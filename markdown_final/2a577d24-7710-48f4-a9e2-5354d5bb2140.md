## Question

Can corticosteroids be used in patients with renal failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether corticosteroids can be used in patients with renal failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts encompassed by "renal failure" and whether the answer differs for AKI, CKD, dialysis, and transplant populations. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics and whether dose adjustments are needed in reduced eGFR. Next, I will examine safety concerns uniquely magnified in renal dysfunction. After that, I should review scenario-specific evidence: transplantation, dialysis patients, glomerular diseases, and critical illness. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations on dosing, tapering, and monitoring, and state clear circumstances for use versus avoidance in renal failure, ensuring I check each assertion against guidelines and trial data as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scope. "Renal failure" spans acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease including dialysis-dependent ESRD, and it also includes kidney transplant recipients who may have reduced GFR and require immunosuppression; management may also differ for primary glomerular diseases versus systemic diseases with renal involvement, so I need to keep these subgroups distinct while I proceed.

> Now, I need to check pharmacokinetics and dose adjustment. Glucocorticoids like prednisone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone are hepatically metabolized, and standard labels emphasize using the lowest effective dose and tapering without specifying renal dose adjustment; several hydrocortisone SPLs even note "no guidance available" across eGFR 0–90 mL/min/1.73 m², which practically aligns with no routine renal adjustment, though I should confirm by not over-interpreting label silence as proof of no effect [^111Y7UpL] [^notfound]. Wait, let me verify I'm not conflating drug classes; at first glance I almost included spironolactone here as a "corticosteroid", but that is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and not a glucocorticoid, with distinct renal considerations, so I should keep MRAs separate from corticosteroids in this discussion. I should also remember that KDIGO advises basing drug dosing on validated eGFR equations and considering renal elimination when relevant, even though for systemic glucocorticoids renal clearance is not the dominant pathway [^117BPkL1] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review key safety signals that are amplified in CKD. Corticosteroids can cause sodium retention with edema, hypertension, and potassium loss, and labels caution use in heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency; they also trigger hyperglycemia and suppress the HPA axis, necessitating gradual tapering and stress-dose coverage when indicated; bone loss is an established risk and especially relevant in CKD-related bone disease, so I need to ensure monitoring plans acknowledge these risks [^111Y7UpL] [^116bEPoD] [^114LMcDS]. Hold on, I should verify adrenal suppression guidance; endocrine society recommendations stress lowest effective dose, structured tapering, and vigilance for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, which is particularly germane to patients with kidney disease who often receive prolonged courses [^112Bs4iG].

> But wait, what about conditions where steroids may precipitate renal-specific complications or be contraindicated. I need to double-check that in systemic sclerosis, corticosteroids are associated with scleroderma renal crisis and guidelines advise minimizing their use, and that in acute-on-chronic liver failure, particularly severe alcohol-related hepatitis with uncontrolled infection, EASL advises avoiding corticosteroids; these cautions intersect with renal failure because AKI is common in these syndromes, so I must not overgeneralize steroid utility in undifferentiated "renal failure" [^116raBRN] [^113KX3qA]. I should also remember that in ALF-related shock states, stress-dose steroids can reduce vasopressor needs without mortality benefit, so expectations should be set accordingly [^114zxVa4].

> I will now examine transplantation, where the calculus differs. Let me first confirm that perioperative and early post-transplant immunosuppression includes corticosteroids, and rejection episodes are treated with high-dose steroid pulses, which are standard of care; however, steroid withdrawal or avoidance strategies, while attractive for cardiometabolic toxicity, consistently show higher acute rejection risk without clear long-term graft survival advantage, so routine elimination is not benign [^113cVdki] [^112AEGou] [^1121eU2L]. Hold on, I should verify longer-term outcomes; a randomized trial of early cessation found no long-term graft-survival benefit and higher early rejection risk, reinforcing that steroids remain necessary for many recipients albeit at the lowest feasible maintenance dose [^111NAwmC]. I need to ensure we also screen for adrenal insufficiency in chronically steroid-treated transplant recipients because cross-sectional data demonstrate a high prevalence of prednisolone-induced AI, warranting structured tapering and testing strategies when doses are reduced [^116j9377] [^113uLZzA].

> For dialysis-dependent ESRD, I should double-check that no renal dose adjustment of systemic glucocorticoids is generally required, but the diagnostic and logistical aspects of adrenal testing are nontrivial; basal cortisol may be comparable to healthy volunteers while ACTH stimulation logistics during hemodialysis can complicate interpretation and scheduling, which argues for planning testing on non-dialysis days and using morning sampling with standardized assays when assessing HPA recovery during taper [^117NUq7S] [^116wNZtd]. Let me consider the practical angle; when physiologic replacement is needed, shorter half-life hydrocortisone facilitates physiologic dosing and diurnal mimicry, but I should verify against label cautions for fluid retention in susceptible patients [^111p38fT] [^111Y7UpL].

> Now, glomerular diseases demand a careful benefit–harm review. In IgA nephropathy, oral methylprednisolone reduced adverse kidney outcomes in the TESTING program but increased adverse events, with risk magnified in lower eGFR strata; this supports selective use with rigorous monitoring rather than blanket application to advanced CKD, and I should confirm that systematic reviews also highlight substantial SAE burdens with steroids in IgAN [^116dxE68] [^115DUQpc]. Let me also think about minimal change disease in adults, where corticosteroids remain first-line and recent randomized data comparing IV methylprednisolone followed by oral therapy to conventional oral therapy inform regimen choices without a renal dose adjustment mandate; nonetheless, toxicity mitigation remains paramount in CKD [^1147fwJP] [^112eRi82].

> Next, I should review critical illness scenarios. For septic shock, low-dose hydrocortisone shortens time on vasopressors but does not confer a consistent mortality benefit, so use should be reserved for refractory shock rather than routine administration; earlier I almost said "mortality benefit", but the weight of evidence and guidance emphasize hemodynamic, not survival, endpoints, so I must correct that and align recommendations accordingly [^113tKS4r] [^notfound]. In COVID-19, high-dose regimens have been associated with worse outcomes in observational analyses, so sticking to evidence-based dosing and avoiding unnecessary escalation is prudent, especially in patients with or at risk for AKI [^113kjc2p].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework without jumping to conclusions. Corticosteroids can be considered in renal failure when there is a clear indication such as peri-transplant immunosuppression, biopsy-proven steroid-responsive glomerulonephritis, or refractory septic shock, provided comorbidities are optimized and monitoring is feasible; conversely, they should be minimized or avoided in contexts with clear harm signals such as systemic sclerosis at risk for renal crisis or ACLF with uncontrolled infection, and in advanced CKD without a compelling steroid-responsive target disease, where adverse effects may outweigh renal benefit [^113cVdki] [^116raBRN] [^113KX3qA] [^114zxVa4].

> I should now translate this into practical dosing and monitoring. Use the lowest effective dose individualized to the indication and patient response, recognizing that routine renal dose adjustments for systemic glucocorticoids are not required, but taper gradually to reduce the risk of adrenal crisis; during taper or prolonged courses, consider morning cortisol or standardized ACTH testing to document HPA recovery, and educate on stress dosing for intercurrent illness [^111Y7UpL] [^117CF1AN] [^113uLZzA]. I need to ensure longitudinal safety surveillance in CKD by tracking blood pressure, weight, edema, glucose, and electrolytes, and by coordinating medication reviews and lab monitoring across transitions of care, which KDIGO emphasizes for complex regimens in CKD [^111jMeFn] [^112dY1B2]. If testing adrenal function in dialysis patients, schedule on non-dialysis days when possible and avoid assay cross-reactivity by pausing prednisolone per local protocols, acknowledging the logistical constraints in this population [^116wNZtd] [^112rM3Qg].

> Stepping back, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the evidence. Corticosteroids can be used in patients with renal failure, including those on dialysis, because their disposition does not mandate renal dose adjustment; however, in CKD the cardiometabolic, infectious, skeletal, and endocrine toxicities are amplified, so decisions should be indication-driven, doses minimized, and monitoring intensified, with explicit avoidance in scenarios where harm is likely to outweigh benefit such as scleroderma renal crisis risk and ACLF with uncontrolled infection [^111Y7UpL] [^114jrtsW] [^116raBRN] [^113KX3qA].

Yes, **steroids can be used in renal failure** when clinically indicated, such as for glomerular diseases [^112eRi82], transplant immunosuppression [^113cVdki], or adrenal insufficiency [^112Bs4iG]. They **do not require dose adjustment** for renal impairment, but **close monitoring** is essential due to increased risks of fluid retention, hypertension, hyperglycemia [^116bEPoD], infection, and adrenal suppression [^112Bs4iG]. Use the lowest effective dose and taper gradually [^113uLZzA]; **avoid or minimize steroids in scleroderma renal crisis** [^116raBRN] and monitor for hyperkalemia [^116PddYK] with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^111mNFQj].

## Indications for steroid use in renal failure

Steroids are indicated in renal failure for specific conditions, including:

- **Glomerular diseases**: Minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus nephritis [^112eRi82], and IgA nephropathy [^114chEK3].

- **Acute interstitial nephritis**: Steroids may improve renal recovery in drug-induced AIN [^1117cJiV].

- **Kidney transplantation**: Steroids are part of standard immunosuppression [^113cVdki] and for acute rejection [^111xiTWE].

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Physiologic replacement is required in secondary adrenal insufficiency from chronic steroid use [^112Bs4iG].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of steroids in renal failure

Steroids are primarily metabolized in the liver [^111Y7UpL] and excreted by the kidneys. Renal impairment can reduce clearance, increase exposure [^11619Br5], and heighten adverse-effect risk. Hypoalbuminemia increases the free steroid fraction and the risk of toxicity [^11619Br5]. Most steroids are not significantly removed by dialysis [^11619Br5], so **dosing is generally unchanged**.

---

## Risks and adverse effects of steroid use in renal failure

Steroids carry significant risks in renal failure, including:

- **Fluid retention and hypertension**: Sodium retention and edema [^111Y7UpL] can worsen hypertension and heart failure [^116bEPoD].

- **Hyperglycemia and diabetes**: Steroids can induce or worsen hyperglycemia, increasing diabetes risk [^111Y7UpL].

- **Infection risk**: Immunosuppression increases susceptibility to infections, including opportunistic pathogens [^116bEPoD].

- **Adrenal suppression**: Chronic use can cause secondary adrenal insufficiency, requiring careful tapering [^112Bs4iG].

- **Bone disease**: Steroids accelerate osteoporosis and fracture risk, especially in CKD [^114LMcDS].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Steroids can cause hypokalemia and hypernatremia, complicating CKD management [^115Nabv5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

KDIGO 2024 recommends **using validated eGFR equations** for drug dosing [^117BPkL1] and for monitoring eGFR, electrolytes, and drug levels in CKD [^111jMeFn]. EAU 2025 **supports corticosteroids perioperatively and early post-transplant** [^113cVdki] and suggests that withdrawal may be considered in standard-risk patients on calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolic acid regimens after the early post-transplant period [^115mrLp3]. BSR 2024 **advises minimizing corticosteroids in systemic sclerosis** due to the increased risk of scleroderma renal crisis [^116raBRN].

---

## Dose adjustments and monitoring

Steroids generally do not require dose adjustment in renal impairment, but **careful monitoring is essential** [^111jMeFn]:

- **Blood pressure and fluid status**: Monitor closely to detect and manage fluid overload and hypertension [^111Y7UpL].

- **Blood glucose**: Regular monitoring to detect steroid-induced hyperglycemia [^116bEPoD].

- **Electrolytes**: Monitor potassium and sodium levels regularly [^111jMeFn].

- **Adrenal function**: Monitor for adrenal insufficiency, especially during tapering or discontinuation [^113uLZzA].

---

## Alternative therapies

To minimize steroid use, **immunosuppressive alternatives** include calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab for glomerular diseases [^112eRi82] and transplantation [^113cVdki]. NSAIDs have limited roles due to nephrotoxicity but may be used cautiously in select situations. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists can be used cautiously in CKD [^116PddYK] with monitoring for hyperkalemia [^111mNFQj].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Steroid use in renal failure is associated with both **beneficial and adverse outcomes**. Benefits include improved renal function in glomerular diseases [^114chEK3], reduced acute rejection in transplantation [^1121eU2L], and better management of adrenal insufficiency [^112Bs4iG], whereas **harms** include increased risks of infection, cardiovascular complications, metabolic disturbances [^111Y7UpL], and bone disease [^114LMcDS].

---

Steroids can be used in renal failure when indicated, but require **careful monitoring and risk mitigation** [^111jMeFn]. Use the lowest effective dose [^111Y7UpL], taper gradually [^112Bs4iG], and monitor for fluid retention, hypertension, hyperglycemia, infection, adrenal suppression, and electrolyte disturbances [^111jMeFn].

Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion.

Literature reports suggest an apparent association between the use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture following a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients.

There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents).

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, particularly with respect to RAAS inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for the treatment of heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or refractory hypertension. It is recognized that this may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in glomerular filtration, particularly in patients with a low GFR.

### Dexamethasone [^111Y7UpL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroids should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with corticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case regarding dose and duration of treatment as well as whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

- **Cardio-renal**: As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

- **Endocrine**: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

- **Gastrointestinal**: Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent. There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of corticosteroids in patients with compromised liver function, so monitoring and appropriate adjustments in therapy are crucial.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (Fig. 2). Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects including co-morbidities, co-medication, age, and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency or by the medical context such as training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

Figure 2.
Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation.

- **Gradual tapering**: Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, the glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of the HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

- **Morning serum cortisol testing**: Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery (R 2.7). If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, while still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7.

### Corticosteroids for treating sepsis [^113tKS4r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Sepsis occurs when an infection is complicated by organ failures, as defined by a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of two or higher. Sepsis may be complicated by impaired corticosteroid metabolism, and giving corticosteroids may benefit patients. The original review was published in 2004 and updated in 2010 and again in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effects of corticosteroids on death at one month in patients with sepsis, and to determine whether the dose and duration of corticosteroids influence patient response to this treatment.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (October 2014), EMBASE (October 2014), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS; October 2014), and reference lists of articles, and we contacted trial authors. The original searches were performed in August 2003 and October 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of corticosteroids versus placebo or supportive treatment in patients with sepsis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All review authors agreed on the eligibility of trials. One review author extracted data, which were checked by the other review authors and, when possible, by the primary author of the paper. We obtained some missing data from trial authors and assessed the methodological quality of trials.

- **Main results**: We identified nine additional studies since the last update, for a total of 33 eligible trials (n = 4268 participants). Twenty-three of these 33 trials were at low risk of selection bias.

### Zortress [^1174mamj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clinical trials experience indicates that adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect rates in clinical practice.

In kidney transplantation studies, data described reflect exposure to Zortress in an open-label, randomized trial of de novo kidney transplant patients on concentration-controlled everolimus at an initial starting dose of 1.5 mg per day [target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL] with reduced exposure cyclosporine (N = 274) compared to mycophenolic acid (N = 273) with standard exposure cyclosporine. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy and corticosteroids. The population was between 18 and 70 years of age, with more than 43% being 50 years or older (mean age was 46 years in the Zortress group and 47 years in the control group). A majority of recipients were male (64% in the Zortress group, 69% in the control group), and a majority of patients were Caucasian (70% in the Zortress group, 69% in the control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups and included hypertension/nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis/glomerular disease, and diabetes mellitus. Significantly more patients discontinued Zortress 1.5 mg per day treatment (83/277, 30%) than discontinued the control regimen (60/277, 22%). Of those patients who prematurely discontinued treatment, most discontinuations were due to adverse reactions: 18% in the…

### Burden of corticosteroid therapy in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN): a systematic literature review [^115DUQpc]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Notwithstanding the comprehensive literature searches underpinning this systematic review, the findings are limited by the availability of published data. Although the NEFIGAN and NefIgArd trials have been completed and published, there remains uncertainty regarding the impact of budesonide targeted-release on safety outcomes. Statistical significance of the comparative data on adverse events (AEs) was not reported in NEFIGAN or NefIgArd, but there were higher rates of new-onset diabetes (2%) and hypertension (> 5%) with budesonide compared to placebo. At the time of writing, there are no published safety data from observational studies on budesonide targeted-release.

Moreover, cumulative exposure to corticosteroids may contribute to the risk of AEs; however, calculation of cumulative exposure would require individual patient-level data, detailing the amount and duration of use as well as previous exposure to corticosteroids before the index therapy. None of the included studies provided this level of detail, limiting the ability to account for cumulative exposure in this systematic review. Furthermore, statistical significance for AE rates was often not reported or not presented across studies, making it challenging to interpret the results and quantify the risk of AEs with corticosteroid use.

Notably, findings from key RCTs, including the STOP IgAN and TESTING trials, reinforce concerns regarding corticosteroid-associated AEs. The STOP IgAN trial reported a numerically higher incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to corticosteroid use (63%) in patients with suboptimal kidney function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²).

### Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^114LMcDS]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a significant problem in patients receiving glucocorticoids after transplantation and for the treatment of parenchymal renal disease and rheumatological disorders. Frequently, patients are not evaluated or treated appropriately for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Bone loss occurs early after the administration of high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. Elderly patients with low bone densities before the initiation of glucocorticoid therapy are at particular risk of developing significant bone loss that could result in fractures.

New information is now available concerning the mechanisms by which glucocorticoid-associated bone disease occurs. New therapies with anti-resorptive agents, such as bisphosphonates, and anabolic agents, such as parathyroid hormone, offer the prospect of effective treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.

**Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m²). In a dedicated renal impairment study, patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) had no clinically significant difference in total PTH compared to subjects with normal renal function upon treatment with Yorvipath [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Glucocorticoid induced adrenal insufficiency is common in steroid treated glomerular diseases - proposed strategy for screening and management [^112rM3Qg]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

A strength of our study is that we ensured that patients were off Prednisolone for 24 hours prior to the assessment of adrenal function. All common corticosteroids, except Dexamethasone, can cross-react with the assay to some degree. The half-life for these agents is approximately 0.5–4.0 hours, so it is important that Prednisolone is paused for at least 24 hours prior to baseline cortisol measurements. We switched patients identified with adrenal insufficiency to twice-daily Hydrocortisone, which has a shorter half-life than Prednisolone and is more favorable on bone mineral density. Patients are also educated on sick day rules and retested at six-month intervals until recovery.

Our study also adds to understanding by evaluating the duration and predictors of recovery. We have shown that patients can take a considerable time to recover, which raises concerns over the safety of the conventional practice of unmonitored tapering. A higher initial post-synacthen cortisol concentration can predict earlier recovery and therefore could inform prognosis discussions with patients. The latest recovery was 23 months after discontinuation of Prednisolone, with not a single patient recovering more than two years following Prednisolone discontinuation (three patients with the latest follow-up at 27, 33, and 36 months, respectively). This finding suggests that there may be a cohort of patients that do not recover and have permanent adrenal insufficiency. A similar study conducted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease found a longer time to recovery, with a mean of 3.1 ± 2.5 years (mean ± SD); however, comparison between this study and our findings is limited.

### Reporting of corticosteroid use in systemic disease trials: Evidence from a systematic review of the potential impact on treatment effect [^116TAr5i]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

To study how corticosteroid therapy is planned and described in reports of systemic disease trials and estimate the impact of the between-arm difference in corticosteroid dose on treatment effect, a systematic review of PubMed and Cochrane databases was performed. This involved all reports of randomized systemic disease trials that used corticosteroids as a cointervention.

Data were extracted regarding trial characteristics and results, planning of corticosteroid use, and dosage. Success rates were adjusted for corticosteroid use in studies with available data and a binary outcome. Since the exact impact of between-arm differences in corticosteroid dose on success rates is unknown, different values for the impact of a difference of 1 unit (1 mg for daily dosage or 250 mg for cumulative dose at the end of the trial) were tested.

A total of 139 trials were identified, including 79 investigating lupus and 30 investigating vasculitis. Planned management of corticosteroid use was specified in 101 reports (72.7%), with a fully described tapering scheme in 33 (23.7%). Corticosteroid consumption for each arm was given in 60 reports (43.2%), with a comparison of daily or cumulative dosage at the end of the trial in 32 (23.0%). An attempt to adjust for corticosteroid use was described in 2 (1.5%) reports. With a value of 2.5% for the impact of a 1-unit difference in corticosteroid dose, adjustment yielded changes in success rate differences exceeding 10% in 11 (46%) of the 24 reports analyzed.

For systemic disease trials, the use of corticosteroids as a cointervention is of concern.

### Steroid withdrawal after renal transplantation: A retrospective cohort study [^1121YNqV]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Kidney transplantation is the most cost-effective treatment option for eligible patients with end-stage renal disease since transplantation is superior in terms of quality and quantity of life while being less costly compared to long-term dialysis treatment. However, choosing the appropriate immunosuppressive treatment strategy is a key decision for sustained allograft function. Despite the development of novel immunosuppressants in recent years, serious side effects, such as increased cardiovascular risk, impaired immune system detection of cancer cells, and antiviral defense, still result from long-term intake of immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, various strategies to reduce immunosuppression are being investigated to alleviate toxicity associated with this treatment.

Maintenance immunosuppression usually consists of three components, one of which is frequently a corticosteroid. Steroids are effective in preventing acute rejection, which is one of the main risk factors for reduced long-term graft survival when not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Although triple immunosuppression allows lower steroid doses, the disadvantageous association of steroids with weight gain, hyperlipidemia, high blood pressure, impaired glucose metabolism, and osteoporosis persists. Consequently, several randomized trials have been performed to investigate the efficacy of steroid withdrawal after kidney transplantation. However, clinical trials can only investigate withdrawal at a specific time point, which likely may not be the optimal choice. While earlier meta-

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113yQJcS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). High credibility.

In specific circumstances for diagnosing Cushing's syndrome, particularly concerning patients with renal failure, the ES 2008 guidelines recommend considering the use of the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test. This is suggested as the diagnostic test of choice rather than urinary free cortisol for patients with severe renal failure who are suspected of having Cushing's syndrome.

### Adrenal function testing in dialysis patients - a review of the literature [^116wNZtd]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) due to long-term glucocorticoid medication in patients on hemodialysis (HD) presents a diagnostic challenge, as many kidney diseases are treated with corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive therapy after renal transplantation often includes prednisolone. This issue is further complicated because both AI and renal replacement treatments may lead to similar nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and orthostatic hypotonia.

Undetected adrenal insufficiency can be life-threatening. Therefore, testing adrenal function in HD patients, particularly after glucocorticoid therapy or in chronically hypotensive patients, is a common procedure. The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test is a standard diagnostic tool for AI. The 250 μg ACTH test is more suitable for diagnosing primary AI, whereas the low-dose (1 μg) ACTH test is more sensitive for secondary AI. Both tests are generally conducted in the morning when the baseline cortisol level is highest. Notably, peak cortisol values after ACTH stimulation are independent of diurnal rhythms.

For patients on HD, who typically spend three half-days per week in the hospital or community-based centers, additional appointments and time-consuming tests can be burdensome. Moreover, finding an accessible, suitable vein for venous puncture is often challenging in these patients. Therefore, conducting AI testing during ongoing HD would ease the procedure. Concerns remain about the metabolism and clearance of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol, in addition to hemoconcentration.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: A clinical practice guideline [^1179cfSc]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, the DC 2025 guidelines recommend initiating a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven efficacy, such as finerenone. This should be done alongside potassium monitoring in adult patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy. These patients are defined by an eGFR of 25–90 mL/min/1.73 m² and an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 3–30 mg/mmol, with or without diabetic retinopathy.

- **Initiation criteria**: For those with an eGFR of 25–60 mL/min/1.73 m², or if the eGFR is greater than 25 mL/min/1.73 m² with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30–500 mg/mmol, the medication is recommended for patients who are on maximally tolerated or prescribed doses of RAAS inhibitors and have a serum potassium level of ≤ 4.8 mmol/L.

This intervention aims to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: A G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^114TZDE4]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

For drugs used in the management of gout flares or flare prophylaxis when starting ULT, such as NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids, and IL-1 inhibitors, the efficacy outcomes of interest are resolution or prevention of gout flares, respectively. For this G-CAN consensus statement, safety outcomes for each drug were individualized. The specific issues identified with medications used for the management of gout flares and prophylaxis in people with CKD are discussed below, and the G-CAN-proposed research priorities are outlined.

- **Colchicine**:
	- **Treatment of gout flares**:
		- **Safe and effective dosing of colchicine in chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: How should the AGREE trial a colchicine dose be modified in different stages of CKD?
		- How should colchicine be used in people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis?
		- Is the risk of drug interactions with colchicine greater in patients with CKD?
		- Should the dose of colchicine be altered when used in combination with atorvastatin in people with CKD?
	- **Gout flare prophylaxis**:
		- Can low-dose colchicine be used in people with ESRD on dialysis?
		- Is there an increased risk of adverse effects with low-dose, longer-term colchicine use in people with CKD?

- **NSAIDs**:
	- **Treatment of gout flares**:
		- Are short-term NSAIDs safe in the context of ESRD?
		- Are longer-term NSAIDs safe in the context of ESRD?
	- **Gout flare prophylaxis**:

### Prednisone [^117CF1AN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The initial dosage of prednisone tablets, USP, may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients, higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If, following a reasonable period of time, there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued, and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy.

It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized based on the disease under treatment and the patient's response. After a favorable response is observed, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached. Constant monitoring is essential regarding drug dosage.

- **Dosage adjustments**: Situations that may necessitate dosage adjustments include changes in clinical status due to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In such cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period consistent with the patient's condition.

### Steroid avoidance or withdrawal for kidney transplant recipients [^1129YBpe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Steroid-sparing strategies have been attempted during the last two decades to avoid morbidity in kidney transplant recipients. Previous systematic reviews of steroid withdrawal after kidney transplantation have shown significant increases in acute rejection and an increase in graft failure rates. Steroid avoidance in kidney transplantation is increasingly attempted, and the possible benefits or harms have never been a subject of a systematic review.

- **Objective**: To assess the safety and efficacy of steroid withdrawal or avoidance in patients receiving a kidney transplant.

- **Search strategy**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, reference lists, and abstracts from international transplantation society scientific meetings.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled studies (RCTs) of steroid avoidance or withdrawal were included, provided that one treatment arm consisted of steroid avoidance or withdrawal. Intention-to-treat rates of acute rejection and graft failure were clearly established after steroid avoidance or use, or withdrawal or continuation. Observational studies were tabulated.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: We included 30 RCTs (5949 participants). Steroid-sparing strategies showed no effect on mortality or graft loss, including death. Patients on any steroid-sparing strategy showed a higher risk of acute rejection.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: Consensus statements from an international task force by the American College of Critical Care Medicine [^1177twrz]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to develop consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients.

Participants included a multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine, convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Additionally, international experts in endocrinology were invited to participate.

The design/methods involved task force members reviewing published literature and providing expert opinion from which the consensus was derived. The consensus statements were developed using a modified Delphi methodology. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, which classifies recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2) and rates the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C). These classifications are based on factors including the study design, the consistency of the results, and the directness of the evidence.

Results indicated that the task force coined the term "critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency" to describe the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis occurring during critical illness. This condition is caused by adrenal insufficiency combined with tissue corticosteroid resistance and is characterized by an exaggerated and protracted proinflammatory response. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency should be suspected in hypotensive patients who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents.

### Efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in kidney transplant patients: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116PddYK]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In a prior meta-analysis, the authors found that MRAs increase the risk of hyperkalemia but did not correlate with a higher risk of clinical complications, highlighting that the benefits of taking MRAs outweighed the risk of this adverse effect.

- **Use in kidney transplant recipients**: In kidney transplant (KT) recipients, MRAs are generally used with caution, as these patients are already at risk of hyperkalemia due to the concomitant use of drugs that can elevate potassium levels, such as calcineurin inhibitors. Our analysis confirmed a significantly higher risk of hyperkalemia in patients treated with steroidal MRAs compared to placebo, reinforcing prior evidence and highlighting this safety concern in the KT population. The GRADE assessment supported this finding with high-certainty evidence.

- **Gynecomastia risk**: Gynecomastia has previously been reported in patients treated with steroidal MRAs. The SPIREN trial was the only study that specifically evaluated this outcome, reporting 19 cases of gynecomastia in the spironolactone group compared to 12 cases in the placebo group.

- **Impact on fibrosis and graft function**: Studies demonstrate that MRAs may reduce fibrosis in KT, potentially preserving graft function for longer. Our analysis showed that there were no significant differences between treatment groups regarding interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) scores independent of their severity. Notably, in the SPIREN trial, the MRA-treated group included older kidney allografts with initial biopsies showing more chronic lesions in the spironolactone group. This may have rendered these allografts less responsive to the beneficial effects of the treatment over time.

### Adrenal insufficiency in kidney transplant patients during low-dose prednisolone therapy: a cross-sectional case-control study [^116j9377]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Maintenance immunosuppressive regimens after renal transplantation (RTx) most often include prednisolone, which may induce secondary adrenal insufficiency due to the risk of acute adrenal crisis. This is a potentially life-threatening side effect of glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. We investigated the prevalence of prednisolone-induced adrenal insufficiency in RTx patients receiving long-term low-dose prednisolone treatment.

- **Methods**: We performed a case-control study of patients on renal replacement therapy differing in terms of GC exposure. The study included 30 RTx patients who were transplanted more than 11 months before enrollment in the study and treated with prednisolone (5 or 7.5 mg/day for ≥ 6 months) and 30 dialysis patients not treated with prednisolone. Patients underwent testing for adrenal insufficiency using a 250-µg Synacthen test performed fasting in the morning following a 48-hour prednisolone pause. Normal adrenal function was defined as P-cortisol ≥ 420 nmol/L 30 minutes after Synacthen injection. This cut-off is routinely used for the Roche Elecsys Cortisol II assay and is validated based on Synacthen test responses in 100 healthy individuals.

- **Results**: Thirteen RTx patients, 43% [95% confidence interval (CI) 27–61], had an insufficient response to the Synacthen test compared with one patient in the control group, 3% [95% CI 0.6–17] (P = 0.0004). Insufficient responses were seen in 9 out of 25 and 4 out of 5 RTx patients treated with 5 mg and 7.5 mg prednisolone/day, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: We found a high prevalence of adrenal insufficiency among RTx patients receiving long-term low-dose prednisolone therapy.

### Steroid withdrawal after renal transplantation: A retrospective cohort study [^111GdkXs]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In agreement with others, we found that steroid withdrawal was associated with an increased risk of acute rejection. In contrast to previous reports, our results revealed an increased rate of graft loss following steroid withdrawal within the first 18 months after transplantation compared to steroid maintenance during this time. Although an increased risk of acute rejection does not necessarily imply an increased rate of graft loss, we argue that the majority of trials were too small, with fewer than 300 participants, and too short, with a follow-up between 1 and 3 years, to determine long-term outcomes. It is not surprising that the rate of graft loss, as shown in our analysis, is higher if steroids are withdrawn within the first 18 months following engraftment as the immunological risk is higher earlier after transplantation. It is reasonable to assume that graft loss requires a larger amount of time to develop compared to acute rejection, which is an earlier outcome and is thus not observed in clinical trials. Our findings challenge recommendations to abstain from steroid withdrawal in kidney transplantation beyond 1 week after engraftment, as well as proposals for safe steroid withdrawal between 3 and 6 months despite the absence of long-term evidence from randomized trials.

In line with previous analyses, we found no significant difference in mortality between steroid withdrawal and maintenance at any time point after transplantation despite the availability of long-term follow-up data in our registry. However, this does not only suggest that steroid withdrawal is…

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116JLrhW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the potential benefits of early initiation, low-dose, and prolonged administration of corticosteroids in critically ill patients, demonstrating a statistical association with reduced mortality. The findings suggest that such a regimen may optimize the balance between therapeutic efficacy and safety, potentially mitigating risks linked to higher-dose or short-term steroid use, such as hyperglycemia. However, the heterogeneity among included studies, variations in patient populations, and differences in adjuvant therapies highlight the need for cautious interpretation. The use of low-dose corticosteroids in select critically ill patients, guided by individualized risk-benefit assessments and monitored for adverse effects, appears to represent a reasonable therapeutic strategy.

### Do high-dose corticosteroids improve outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [^113kjc2p]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a dysregulated hyperimmune response, and steroids have been shown to decrease mortality. However, whether higher dosing of steroids results in better outcomes has been debated. This study was a retrospective observation of COVID-19 admissions between March 1, 2020, and March 10, 2021. Adult patients (≥ 18 years) who received more than 10 mg daily methylprednisolone equivalent dosing (MED) within the first 14 days were included. We excluded patients who were discharged or died within 7 days of admission.

- **Study design**: We compared the standard dose of steroids (40 mg MED). Inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) was used to examine whether higher dose steroids resulted in improved outcomes.

- **Outcomes studied**: The outcomes studied were in-hospital mortality, rate of acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), hospital-associated infections (HAI), and readmissions.

Of the 1379 patients meeting the study criteria, 506 received less than 40 mg of MED (median dose 30 mg MED) and 873 received more than or equal to 40 mg of MED (median dose 78 mg MED). Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was higher in patients who received high-dose corticosteroids (40.7% vs. 18.6%, p < 0.001). On IPWRA, the use of high-dose corticosteroids was associated with higher odds of death (odds ratio [OR] 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45–3.14, p < 0.001) but not with the development of HAI, readmissions, or requirement of IMV. High-dose corticosteroids were associated with lower rates of AKI requiring hemodialysis.

### Patient characteristics and initiation of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with chronic kidney disease in routine clinical practice in the US: a retrospective cohort study [^113KPi5e]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this retrospective, exploratory study is the first to describe the respective patient characteristics and use of steroidal MRAs in routine clinical practice for four distinct cohorts of patients with CKD, DKD, CKD with HF, or DKD with HF.

- **Patient characteristics and use of MRAs in the CKD and MRA population studied**: At least 70% of patients in the CKD population and at least 88% of patients in the MRA population reported hypertension. Steroidal MRA use was at least threefold higher in patients with HF than in those without HF, suggesting that most prescribing of steroidal MRAs was in line with guidelines recommending their use in patients with hypertension or heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class 3–4 and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%). However, given the relatively low proportions of patients in the CKD population that were subsequently prescribed steroidal MRAs (less than 6%), our results suggest that steroidal MRA use is rare in clinical practice and are in line with other reports showing that steroidal MRA use is low even in guideline-eligible patients. Reassuringly, given the guideline recommendations for steroidal MRA use, fewer than 5% of patients in the MRA population lacked a recorded code for either hypertension or HF; this may reflect missing data rather than the absence of the condition.

Of the available steroidal MRAs, patients predominantly received spironolactone, which could be either due to lower costs or its greater effectiveness compared with eplerenone.

### Steroid avoidance or withdrawal for kidney transplant recipients [^1121eU2L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Steroid-sparing strategies have been attempted in recent decades to avoid morbidity from long-term steroid intake among kidney transplant recipients. Previous systematic reviews of steroid withdrawal after kidney transplantation have shown a significant increase in acute rejection. There are various protocols to withdraw steroids after kidney transplantation, and their possible benefits or harms are subject to systematic review. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of steroid withdrawal or avoidance for kidney transplant recipients.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialized Register up to 15 February 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which steroids were avoided or withdrawn at any time point after kidney transplantation were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Assessment of risk of bias and data extraction was performed by two authors independently, and disagreement was resolved by discussion. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model, and dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals.

- **Main results**: We included 48 studies (224 reports) that involved 7,803 randomized participants. Of these, three studies were conducted in children (346 participants). The 2009 review included 30 studies (94 reports, 5,949 participants).

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and reno-protection: What's the evidence & where do they fit? A guide for non-specialists [^116eZaqX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The role of aldosterone has yet to be well appreciated in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Two variables define CKD: an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30mg/g. Both are needed for an accurate diagnosis. The presence of CKD at this level is associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular death and a greater risk of CKD progression to kidney failure and subsequent dialysis. This paper presents an overview of aldosterone's importance in CKD and its contribution to the inflammatory processes involved in CKD development. Data on outcomes, both surrogate and hard, related to outcomes on CKD progression will also be discussed in the context of mineralocorticoid blockade.

Based on recent epidemiological data and data examining markers of diabetic kidney disease progression, it is clear that the use of both renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and aldosterone receptor antagonists has a significant role in altering the natural history of kidney disease progression itself, as well as reducing the risk of cardiovascular events that generally accompany long-standing kidney disease. This paper will discuss these issues and the management of consequent hyperkalaemia in detail when both steroidal and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are used.

### Safety and efficacy of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115ZDHC7]. Lancet (2025). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists can prevent cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure and non-severe chronic kidney disease, but their effects in patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis are uncertain. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in this patient population.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated our previous systematic review by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature for randomised controlled trials published between database inception and March 18, 2025. Trials comparing a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with placebo or standard of care in adults (aged ≥ 18 years) receiving maintenance dialysis were eligible. Studies that did not report an outcome of interest (cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, gynaecomastia or breast pain, or hypotension) were excluded. Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The main outcome was cardiovascular mortality assessed using the empirical Bayes random-effects models, stratified by risk-of-bias. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251008119).

- **Findings**: Nineteen trials of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists including 4675 participants met eligibility criteria. Effect estimates differed among trials with low and high risk of bias.

### Corticosteroid therapy in IgA nephropathy [^114chEK3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The benefits and risks of steroids for the treatment of IgA nephropathy remain uncertain. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for randomized, controlled trials of corticosteroid therapy for IgA nephropathy published between 1966 and March 2011. We identified nine relevant trials that included 536 patients who had urinary protein excretion > 1 g/d and normal renal function. Forty-six (8.6%) of these patients developed a kidney failure event, defined as doubling of the serum creatinine/halving of the GFR or ESRD.

Overall, steroid therapy was associated with a lower risk for kidney failure (relative risk, 0.32 [95% confidence interval, 0.15–0.67]; P = 0.002) and a reduction in proteinuria (weighted mean difference, -0.46 g/d [95% CI, -0.63 to -0.29 g/d]), with no evidence of heterogeneity in these outcomes.

- **Subgroup analysis**: Suggested that the dose modifies the effect of steroids for renal protection (P for heterogeneity = 0.030). Relatively high-dose and short-term therapy (prednisone > 30 mg/d or high-dose pulse intravenous methylprednisolone with duration ≤ 1 year) produced significant renal protection, whereas low-dose, long-term steroid use did not. Steroid therapy was associated with a 55% higher risk for adverse events. The quality of included studies was low, however, limiting the generalizability of the results.

In conclusion, steroids appear to provide renal protection in patients with IgA nephropathy but increase the risk for adverse events. Reliably defining the efficacy and safety of steroids in IgA nephropathy requires a high-quality study.

### Glucocorticoids in the treatment of glomerular diseases: Pitfalls and pearls [^112eRi82]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities through genomic and nongenomic effects. The classic genomic effects are mediated by cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors that can upregulate the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus (transactivation) or repress the translocation of proinflammatory transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus (transrepression). The nongenomic effects are likely mediated by membrane glucocorticoid receptors.

Glucocorticoid receptors are also expressed in podocytes, and experimental data suggest that glucocorticoids may protect against podocyte injury. Glucocorticoids have a low therapeutic index and may cause several time-dependent and dose-dependent side effects. Measures to prevent or attenuate these side effects include single-morning administration of short-acting glucocorticoids, dietetic counseling, increased physical activity, frequent monitoring, and adapting doses to the patient's clinical conditions.

Synthetic glucocorticoids, whether given alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs, remain the cornerstone therapy in multiple glomerular disorders. However, glucocorticoids provide little benefit in C3 glomerulopathy and may be potentially deleterious in patients with maladaptive focal glomerulosclerosis. Their efficacy depends not only on the type and severity of glomerular disease but also on the timeliness of administration, dosage, and duration of treatment. Excessive use of glucocorticoids can lead to severe toxicity, while inadequate dosing can also be problematic.

Drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis represents an emerging cause of acute kidney disease, especially among polymedicated elderly patients. Although corticosteroids are frequently used, controversy exists about the timing of initiation, efficacy, safety, and duration of treatment.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: We performed a retrospective study of 182 patients with biopsy-proven drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis from 13 Spanish centers. Exposure was defined as the length of corticosteroid treatment. The main outcome was the level of serum creatinine at month 6, with respect to baseline values.

- **Results**: The most common offending agents were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (27%). In 30% of patients, the offending drug could not be identified. The median time to suspected drug withdrawal was 11 days (interquartile range, 5–22). All patients presented with acute kidney disease and were treated with corticosteroids. The mean initial dose of prednisone was 0.8 ± 0.2 mg/kg per day. High-dose corticosteroid treatment was maintained for 2 weeks (interquartile range, 1–4). After 6 months, the mean recovered GFR was 34 ± 26 ml/min per 1.73 m², and ten patients required maintenance dialysis. Use of high-dose corticosteroids for 3 weeks or treatment duration > 8 weeks were not associated with better recovery of kidney function. In the multivariable analysis, delayed onset of steroid treatment (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.04) and the presence of interstitial fibrosis of > 50% on the kidney biopsy specimen.

### Safety and tolerability of the novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist BAY 94–8862 in patients with chronic heart failure and mild or moderate chronic kidney disease: A randomized, double-blind trial [^114NBnHQ]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

- **Patients**: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study are provided in detail elsewhere. Briefly, adult males and females without childbearing potential were eligible for inclusion if they had a clinical diagnosis of HFrEF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–III and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%] and were treated with evidence-based therapy for HFrEF; if their serum potassium concentration was ≤ 4.8 mmol/L at the screening visit; and if their eGFR was 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² (part A) or 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (part B) according to the MDRD formula.

- **Study medication**: In both parts of the study, patients received the study drug for 4 weeks, starting within 14 days of the initial screening visit. The randomization list was generated using a validated automated system that assigned treatment groups to randomization numbers. In part A, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive oral BAY 94–8862 at doses of 2.5, 5, or 10 mg q.d. or placebo. In part B, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1 to receive oral BAY 94–8862 at doses of 2.5, 5, or 10 mg q.d., or 5 mg twice daily (b.i.d.), placebo, or open-label oral spironolactone, which was given at an initial dose of 25 mg q.d. and up-titrated to 50 mg q.d. on day 15 ± 1 if serum potassium concentration remained below or equal to 4.8 mmol/L.

- **Investigations**: Patients were assessed at the screening visit, at baseline/day 1, day 4 ± 1, and day 8 ± 1, and then weekly until the end of the study and at a follow-up visit 14 days after the last intake of the study drug. Patients who terminated the study early were assessed as soon as possible.

### Cortifoam [^115Nabv5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

- **Cardio-renal**: As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

- **Endocrine**: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

- **Gastrointestinal**: Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Where surgery is imminent, it is important to consider these risks carefully.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111jMeFn]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to drug dose adjustments, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend monitoring eGFR, electrolytes, and therapeutic medication levels when indicated. This is crucial for patients with CKD receiving medications with narrow therapeutic windows, potential adverse effects, or nephrotoxicity. The guidelines emphasize the importance of these practices both in outpatient settings and in hospital environments.

### Use of corticosteroids in Norwegian patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy progressing to end-stage kidney disease: a retrospective cohort study [^113QTGWg]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids did not delay progression to ESKD in our cohort of high-risk Norwegian patients when comparing the corticosteroid therapy to patients who only received supportive therapy and who also reached ESKD (p = 0.98). This finding is similar to the STOP-IgAN trial. Moreover, in our study, the STOP-IgAN and TESTING trials reported adverse effects and a temporary reduction in proteinuria during corticosteroid therapy, which did not persist for several years after tapering off the corticosteroids.

There were several differences among the three studies. The included patients in the TESTING and STOP-IgAN trials had similar kidney function parameters at the time of enrollment in the randomized trial phase. However, the included patients in both these trials had better kidney functions at the time of initiation of corticosteroid therapy than those in our study. Similar differences have been observed among supportive care groups in the two aforementioned drug trials and our own study. These differences might have affected the study outcomes; however, they were expected, as we only included patients who had progressed to ESKD and thus had a known aggressive IgAN. Additionally, the TESTING trial included younger patients and almost twice as many women as those in our study and the STOP-IgAN trial. Sex differences in the clinical progression of non-diabetic kidney diseases, such as IgAN, have been reported; however, they are controversial.

### High-dose glucocorticoids improve renal failure reversibility in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma [^112zYxDU]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

One-fifth of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients present with renal failure (RF) [1–3]. Glucocorticoids (GCs) may improve RF in MM by:

- **Rapid reduction of paraprotein production**: This helps in lessening inflammation and fibrosis in renal parenchyma and decreases serum calcium levels.

We hypothesized that lower-dose GCs might be less effective in restoring renal function. We retrospectively compared the RF reversibility between newly diagnosed MM patients treated with GCs equivalent to ≥ 160 mg DX over 4 days (high-dose GC group, n = 16) and those treated with < 160 mg (low-dose/no GC group, n = 8). There was no difference in age, baseline calcium, and creatinine levels between the two groups. Renal function was restored in seven patients in the high-dose GC group (44%) and in none of the patients in the low-dose/no GC group (P = 0.026).

The only other factor found to impact RF reversibility was the delay of GC initiation. Four patients in the high-dose GC group and one patient in the low-dose/no GC group developed a severe infection. The use of higher doses of GCs in newly diagnosed MM patients presenting with RF increases the likelihood of renal function restoration.

### Steroids as treatment for glomerulonephritis: Time for a rethink [^116XcdhB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids have been a cornerstone of treatment for inflammatory and autoimmune kidney diseases for almost 70 years, yet it is fair to say we still do not know how 'best' to use them. Significant adverse events are associated with their continued use, which contribute to premature patient mortality. Steroid avoidance or minimization is possible and has been tested in various glomerular diseases as a result of novel agents or innovative regimens using established therapeutics. It is now time to seriously address our use of steroids and educate physicians on better ways of managing inflammatory kidney diseases.

### Treatment of renal sarcoidosis: Is there a guideline? Overview of the different treatment options [^116rAeKy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas. It may affect any organ, including the kidney. A disordered calcium metabolism is most often responsible for the development of renal failure. Granulomatous interstitial nephritis is the most typical histological finding, but it rarely leads to renal insufficiency. Since the development of renal insufficiency in sarcoidosis is uncommon, we lack large (randomized) trials concerning the treatment of this disorder. Most information is gathered from case reports and small series. Our knowledge of pulmonary sarcoidosis is more comprehensive. It is, however, impossible to treat renal manifestations identically because some of the drugs used in pulmonary sarcoidosis are nephrotoxic. Moreover, renal sarcoidosis is a specific entity with its own characteristics and response to therapy.

A guideline for treatment is currently missing. Based on a review of the literature, we present an overview of the different treatment options to promote a more uniform and scrutinized approach to this disease.

- **Treatment options for hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria**: Corticosteroids, (hydroxy)chloroquine, or ketoconazole can be used. Preventive measures play a supportive role.

- **Treatment for granulomatous interstitial nephritis**: Glucocorticoids are the standard of care. For patients with failure of or a contraindication to corticosteroids, or for those who need a high maintenance dose of corticosteroids, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil can be used. TNF-alpha inhibitors are useful in cases of steroid resistance.

### Early corticosteroid cessation vs long-term corticosteroid therapy in kidney transplant recipients: Long-term outcomes of a randomized clinical trial [^111NAwmC]. JAMA Surgery (2021). High credibility.

The complications of corticosteroids make the inclusion of these drugs in immunosuppressive protocols for kidney transplant patients undesirable. However, cessation of corticosteroids is associated with a higher risk of short-term rejection, and the long-term outcomes of patients withdrawn from corticosteroids remain uncertain.

To compare long-term kidney transplant outcomes of patients randomized to continue or withdraw corticosteroids, this prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between November 1999 and December 2002. It included linkage to a mandatory national registry with validated outcome ascertainment until June 8, 2018. The study included 28 kidney transplant centers in the United States, comprising 386 low- to moderate-immune risk adult recipients of a living or deceased donor kidney transplant without delayed graft function or short-term rejection in the first week after transplant. Analyses were intention to treat. The analysis began in September 2018 and ended in June 2019.

Patients were randomized to receive tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil with or without corticosteroids 7 days after transplant. The main outcomes and measures were kidney allograft failure from any cause, including death, and allograft failure censored for patient death defined by the requirement for long-term dialysis or repeat transplant.

Of 385 patients, 191 were assigned to withdraw from corticosteroids (mean [SD] age, 46.5 [12.1] years), and 194 patients were assigned to continued treatment.

### Steroid-free maintenance immunosuppression in kidney transplantation: Is it time to consider it as a standard therapy [^111VodYg]. Kidney International (2009). High credibility.

Steroid-free immunosuppression in kidney transplantation has been gaining popularity over the past decade, as documented by a continuous and steady rise in the number of kidney transplant patients discharged on steroid-free regimens. This increased interest in steroid-free immunosuppression is fueled by the recognition that half of transplant loss is related to patient death due to cardiovascular disease and/or infectious complications, and that the long-term use of steroids contributes to such elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

The availability of newer and more potent immunosuppressive agents has furthered such interest. Many clinical trials over the past two decades have demonstrated the feasibility of steroid-free regimens, at the expense of a slight increase in the rate of acute rejection, which is an important endpoint in any clinical trial of relatively short duration. The largest epidemiological study at the time of writing has reassured the transplant community that the selective use of steroid-free immunosuppression in kidney transplant patients provides no inferior outcome in patient and graft survival at the intermediate term. Steroid-free regimens have the potential to improve the cardiovascular risk profile.

The challenges that remain are to identify the subset of kidney transplant patients who may not benefit from steroid-free immunosuppression and to demonstrate the survival advantage of steroid-free immunosuppression in suitable kidney transplant candidates.

### Adrenal function testing in dialysis patients - a review of the literature [^115dUHaT]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Risk for bias assessment of individual studies and across studies**: For assessing the risk of bias, we used the "Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network" (SIGN) system. The risk of bias was recorded using checklists and divided into "high", "acceptable", and "unacceptable" quality. Due to a small selection, all 16 studies, regardless of quality, were used for further analysis. We also consulted the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

- **Data synthesis and statistical analysis**: A minimum of five trials were required for the quantitative analysis (meta-analysis). Dichotomous data were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); continuous data were expressed as standard mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI. As a test of heterogeneity, the variation in SMD across studies attributable to heterogeneity (I²) was computed. Since there was significant heterogeneity across studies (I² > 75%), data from the fixed-effect model were omitted due to overestimation of effect size. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. For each study, the effect size was plotted by the inverse of its standard error. The symmetry of these "funnel plots" was assessed both visually and formally with Egger's test to see if the effect decreased with increasing sample size.

The statistical analysis was conducted using Stata software v15.1 (Stata Corp. College Station, TX, USA). All significance tests were two-sided, and p-values were calculated.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111pknCB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency can occur with any glucocorticoid formulation, and there is no established safe level of dose exposure. Published studies provide some guidance on the overall degree of risk in patients treated with glucocorticoids. However, establishing the risk on an individual basis is challenging and relies on clinical judgment. We suggest that some groups of non-oral glucocorticoid users carry a higher risk, although evidence is limited.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients with recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency are often non-specific and can overlap with other conditions, including those for which glucocorticoids were prescribed. It is therefore imperative that healthcare professionals maintain a high degree of suspicion for the presence of adrenal insufficiency.

### Intravenous methylprednisolone for nephrotic syndrome with minimal change lesions in adults: a randomized controlled trial [^1147fwJP]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

After the confirmation of eligibility, patients were randomly assigned in a concealed fashion to an oral group or a sequential group according to a random number label. Patients in the sequential group received IV methylprednisolone for 2 weeks, followed by a conventional oral prednisone regimen. Patients in the oral group received conventional oral steroid therapy, consisting of oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 80 mg/day) for 8–12 weeks, depending on the treatment response. If the treatment was effective and the patient had received the treatment for an adequate duration, the dose was reduced every 2 weeks by 10%. At approximately 30 mg, the dose was reduced by half a tablet, or 2.5 mg each time. In the sequential group, patients received IV methylprednisolone at 0.8 mg/kg/day infusions (maximum 64 mg/day) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the treatment was changed to oral prednisone at 1.0 mg/kg/day. Anticoagulation was administered to patients 50 years of age. Diuretics, lipid-lowering drugs, and human albumin were not used as routine medications. Other immunosuppressive drugs were not used in the trial.

Randomization was performed 1:1 using a web-based tool, including stratified block randomization with varying age and gender as stratification factors. This trial was open label, with no masking of patients or study staff to the treatment allocation.

Patients were followed up for 48 weeks after randomization. They were followed up weekly in hospital for the first 4 weeks, then monthly.

### Corticosteroid for IgA nephropathy: Are they really therapeutic [^114XLXmW]. American Journal of Nephrology (2018). High credibility.

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common chronic glomerular disease that, in most patients, slowly progresses to end-stage kidney disease. Therapy with corticosteroids in IgAN remains a global issue that is challenging for clinicians.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and article reference lists were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared corticosteroids with placebo and any other non-immunosuppressive agents in treating IgAN. Twelve RCTs involving 1,057 patients were included.

- **Results**: Overall, we found that steroids had statistically significant effects in preventing the decline in renal function (relative risk 0.42, 95% CI 0.25–0.71, p < 0.01). However, no differences were observed in terms of proteinuria reduction, different steroid dosages (≤ 30 mg/day or > 30 mg/day), duration (≤ 8 or > 8 months), or serum creatinine levels (< 1.10 or ≥ 1.10 mg/dL). Steroids also increased the risk of side effects such as gastrointestinal and endocrine symptoms.

- **Conclusion**: This study provides clear evidence of the beneficial effects of steroid therapy on kidney function and proteinuria. However, it should be used with caution.

### Adrenal insufficiency is common amongst kidney transplant recipients receiving maintenance prednisolone and can be predicted using morning cortisol [^114NWj5T]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

Interval screening with a basal serum cortisol concentration is appropriate for identifying patients maintained on immunosuppressive glucocorticoid therapy who are at risk of adrenal insufficiency (AI). However, if there is a discontinuation or reduction of the glucocorticoid dose below AI replacement dosing (< 3–5 mg prednisolone/day), a short synacthen test (SST) is required to ensure adequate adrenal function. Patients with AI are at risk of an adrenal crisis in the absence of adequate glucocorticoid replacement and should begin physiological replacement with glucocorticoids like hydrocortisone, 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon. In such cases, referral to an endocrinologist is suggested to ensure adequate glucocorticoid replacement is prescribed.

In conclusion, AI is common in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) receiving low-dose prednisolone as immunosuppressive therapy and is largely undiagnosed. Greater awareness of the risk of AI among both KTRs and clinicians caring for this patient group is key to reducing the potential risk of an adrenal crisis. It is advocated that steroid sick day rules education be considered as part of routine clinical care for all KTRs receiving glucocorticoid-based immunosuppression. A single morning serum cortisol concentration is a useful screening tool in this patient cohort and may help identify patients at the highest risk of AI. Finally, a strong encouragement is given for clinicians to perform an assessment in these situations.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112Bs4iG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Despite their efficacy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, chronic use of glucocorticoids can induce manifestations of Cushing syndrome, along with concomitant central and later permanent adrenal insufficiency (suppression of the entire HPA axis). For this reason, clinicians prescribing glucocorticoids for non-endocrine reasons are advised to employ the lowest effective dose and duration of therapy and consider tapering glucocorticoid doses when treatment is no longer necessary for the underlying condition.

Given the widespread use of glucocorticoids, it is imperative that treating physicians of any discipline be well-versed in the clinical consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. It is equally critical to recognize signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and be experienced in methods to taper and/or stop glucocorticoids once their pharmacologic effects are no longer required.

The management of glucocorticoid therapy is considered a general medical skill that should be managed by the prescribing clinician, also taking into consideration the underlying disease as a determinant of tapering speed. Furthermore, the affected number of patients (at least 1% of the general population) is too large, with too few endocrinology providers to perform consultations for each instance of glucocorticoid tapering. When prescribing clinicians decide that glucocorticoid therapy is no longer required, they should educate their patient on methods.
