## Question

What timeline should you use to start hrt in menopause

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when to start menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and how to individualize the timing, including considerations for special populations and risk mitigation strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core timing principle and its evidentiary basis. Then, I should verify how major guidelines operationalize that principle into practical thresholds. Next, I will examine the "window of opportunity" concept and its limitations. After that, I need to consider special populations such as early menopause and surgical menopause. Then, I should review what to do when initiation is delayed beyond the window. Finally, I will synthesize a decision framework and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and uncertainty before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the core timing principle. The most consistent, high-quality guidance indicates that MHT is safest and most beneficial when initiated in healthy women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, reflecting the "timing hypothesis" supported by WHI subgroup analyses and subsequent meta-analyses showing more favorable cardiovascular and mortality signals in younger or recently menopausal initiators, with absolute risks rising with age and time since menopause [^113CmpaW] [^114WrBok] [^116xRGvZ] [^115RMpRN].

> Wait, let me verify how guidelines translate this principle into thresholds. NAMS 2022 explicitly recommends initiation primarily for women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause, noting the benefit–risk balance is most favorable in this group, while cautioning that initiation after 60 or more than 10 years from menopause carries higher absolute risks of CHD, stroke, VTE, and dementia. The Endocrine Society similarly frames initiation for symptomatic women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause. SOGC 2021 aligns with the same < 60 or < 10-year construct and emphasizes individualization and periodic reassessment [^113CmpaW] [^111g5hPA] [^113scWk6] [^1121nsY2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a rigid cutoff. I should confirm the "window of opportunity" nuance. While the balance is most favorable in the early window, emerging expert commentary argues for more inclusive initiation beyond 60 or 10 years in carefully selected, well-counseled women, particularly for compelling indications like persistent vasomotor symptoms or fracture prevention when alternatives are unsuitable; NAMS 2022 acknowledges that some women older than 60 may reasonably initiate or continue therapy with shared decision-making, and the USPSTF highlights research gaps on whether age or timing modifies outcomes, underscoring uncertainty rather than prohibition [^113Vxb4F] [^113CmpaW] [^113hqw5o].

> I need to check special populations next. For premature ovarian insufficiency, premature, or early surgical menopause, guidelines recommend offering systemic estrogen (with progestogen if the uterus is present) and continuing until the average age of natural menopause, typically around 51 years, to preserve bone and treat symptoms. This is a different risk calculus given the long-term estrogen deficiency and higher fracture risk, and higher initial doses may be needed in very young women, with later tapering as they approach the natural menopause age [^112JyAtk] [^116eCmNr] [^1134k2WV] [^117HZMei].

> Let me consider what to do when initiation is delayed. For women older than 60 or more than 10 years past menopause, I should confirm that initiation is not categorically contraindicated but requires careful risk stratification and counseling; absolute risks of CHD, stroke, VTE, and dementia are higher, and new-onset vasomotor symptoms years after menopause warrant evaluation for alternative causes before attributing them to menopause; mitigation strategies include using the lowest effective dose, preferring transdermal routes to reduce VTE risk, and selecting micronized progesterone when a progestogen is needed [^113CmpaW] [^111KmVKh] [^113r69Zv] [^1178U8Q1].

> I should double-check the formulation and route considerations because they meaningfully modify risk. Transdermal estrogen is associated with lower VTE risk than oral and may carry less stroke risk, making it a reasonable choice for women with higher thrombotic risk or those initiating later; when a progestogen is required for endometrial protection, micronized progesterone is preferred over synthetic agents like medroxyprogesterone acetate to minimize breast cancer and metabolic risks; for isolated genitourinary symptoms, low-dose vaginal estrogen is effective and has minimal systemic risk, allowing use at any age as needed [^113r69Zv] [^1178U8Q1] [^1157hBxF].

> Next, I should review the decision framework and ensure it aligns with shared decision-making. Indications should be clear, typically moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, genitourinary syndrome of menopause refractory to local measures, or bone protection in select high-risk women; contraindications must be screened, including estrogen-dependent cancers, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, active thromboembolic disease, and severe liver disease; baseline CVD and breast cancer risk should be assessed and integrated; therapy should start at the lowest effective dose with periodic reassessment, and continuation should be individualized rather than bound by an arbitrary stopping age, with annual reviews to weigh evolving risks and benefits [^112TXcrr] [^114fevBe] [^1169oVcS] [^1157hBxF].

> But wait, what about duration and discontinuation? I should confirm that NAMS advises against routine discontinuation at age 65 and supports individualized duration, noting that vasomotor symptoms often persist for years. When discontinuation is contemplated, a shared decision about tapering versus abrupt cessation is reasonable, recognizing that symptoms may recur and that bone protection is rapidly lost after stopping. For women using therapy for osteoporosis, extended use may be appropriate if benefits outweigh risks and alternatives are unsuitable [^114dh9sV] [^114vNTEq] [^117HZMei].

> Let me reconsider areas of uncertainty so I don't overstate certainty. The USPSTF highlights gaps regarding whether timing or age modifies outcomes across diverse populations, and NAMS notes that while observational and meta-analytic data support benefit with early initiation, significant research gaps remain on dose, formulation, route, and duration. Thus, counseling should transparently communicate absolute risks, acknowledge uncertainty, and incorporate patient preferences and evolving evidence [^113hqw5o] [^1142EVDA].

> In summary, I should confirm the practical bottom line. Initiate MHT for healthy, symptomatic women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause whenever feasible, using shared decision-making to tailor formulation, dose, and route. For women older than 60 or more than 10 years past menopause, initiation is not absolutely contraindicated but requires careful risk–benefit analysis, preference-sensitive discussion, and risk-mitigation strategies. For premature or early menopause, treat until the average age of natural menopause. And reassess annually, adjusting or discontinuing based on evolving risks, symptoms, and patient goals [^113CmpaW] [^111g5hPA] [^112JyAtk] [^1169oVcS].

Start HRT for menopausal symptoms as soon as they appear, ideally **within 10 years of menopause or before age 60** [^111g5hPA] [^113CmpaW], when benefits outweigh risks [^114WrBok]. For early menopause (before 45), **continue HRT until the average menopause age (about 51)** [^113xGSvt] unless contraindicated [^112JyAtk]. After 60 or more than 10 years post-menopause, use the lowest effective dose with shared decision-making and annual reassessment [^111ioqqJ] [^1169oVcS]. Use transdermal estrogen if VTE risk is present [^113r69Zv], and add progestogen if the uterus is intact [^111q3rop].

---

## Optimal timing for HRT initiation

- **Within 10 years of menopause or before age 60**: The benefit-risk ratio is most favorable [^111ioqqJ]; HRT effectively treats vasomotor symptoms, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and prevents osteoporosis [^111ioqqJ] [^116L6LEC].

- **Early menopause (before age 45)**: Continue HRT until the average age of natural menopause (~51 years) unless contraindicated [^113xGSvt] [^112JyAtk].

- **After age 60 or more than 10 years post-menopause**: Initiation requires careful risk assessment and shared decision-making due to higher risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia [^114WrBok] [^111ioqqJ].

---

## Duration of HRT use

- **General recommendation**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals, with annual reassessment [^1169oVcS] [^1157hBxF].

- **Extended use**: May be considered for persistent symptoms or osteoporosis risk, with individualized risk-benefit assessment and periodic reevaluation [^113CmpaW] [^117HZMei].

- **Discontinuation**: No routine stopping age; decisions should be individualized, with gradual tapering to minimize symptom recurrence [^114dh9sV] [^112qfBPr].

---

## Individualized risk assessment

Before initiating HRT, assess:

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Age, blood pressure, lipid profile, smoking, diabetes, and family history [^112PurCg] [^114WrBok].

- **Breast cancer risk**: Personal and family history, genetic predisposition (e.g. BRCA mutations) [^1174zrG3] [^113bk3sm].

- **Thromboembolic risk**: Personal history of VTE, obesity, immobility, and inherited thrombophilias [^113r69Zv] [^114WrBok].

- **Gynecological history**: Uterine status, menstrual history, and presence of contraindications [^111q3rop] [^112dsQ7T].

---

## Formulation and route of administration

- **Transdermal estrogen**: Preferred for women with increased VTE risk, as it lowers thromboembolic risk compared to oral estrogen [^113r69Zv] [^1178U8Q1].

- **Progestogen**: Required for women with an intact uterus to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer; micronized progesterone is preferred due to a favorable risk profile [^111q3rop] [^1178U8Q1].

- **Local estrogen**: Effective for genitourinary syndrome of menopause with minimal systemic absorption and risk [^111ZzYLd] [^111ioqqJ].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess efficacy, side effects, and ongoing risk-benefit balance. Reassess **annually** [^1169oVcS] or as clinically indicated, adjusting therapy as needed [^1121nsY2]. Monitor for adverse effects, including cardiovascular events, breast cancer, and thromboembolism [^114WrBok] [^115vZyd6].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Within 10 years of menopause or < 60 years | Initiate HRT if indicated; favorable benefit-risk ratio [^111g5hPA] [^113CmpaW] |
| Early menopause (< 45 years) | Continue HRT until average menopause age (~51 years) [^113xGSvt] [^112JyAtk] |
| > 10 years post-menopause or > 60 years | - Use lowest effective dose <br/> - Shared decision-making <br/> - Annual reassessment [^1157hBxF] [^112TXcrr] [^114UWJ1K] |
| Increased VTE risk | Prefer transdermal estrogen [^113r69Zv] [^1178U8Q1] |
| Intact uterus | Add progestogen (prefer micronized progesterone) [^111q3rop] [^1178U8Q1] |

---

The optimal time to start HRT is **within 10 years of menopause or before age 60**, with individualized risk assessment and shared decision-making. For early menopause, continue HRT until the average menopause age, and for older women, use the lowest effective dose with regular monitoring.

### The 2017 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111yvUiD]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) updates the 2012 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society guideline update [^114zbvE8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to menopausal hormone therapy, ES 2020 guidelines recommend to consider initiating menopausal hormone therapy, with estrogen-only therapy after hysterectomy, to prevent all types of fractures in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fractures if meeting the following criteria:

- < 60 years of age or < 10 years after menopause

- low risk of DVT

- bisphosphonates and denosumab are not appropriate

- bothersome vasomotor symptoms

- additional climacteric symptoms

- no contraindications

- no prior myocardial infarction or stroke

- no breast cancer

- willing to take menopausal hormone therapy.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, NAMS 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- estrogen therapy carries a class effect risk of VTE

- low-dose vaginal estrogen may carry a very low risk but there has been no report of an increased risk in the vaginal estrogen clinical trials

- insufficient evidence in high-risk patients.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) monitoring and discontinuation — For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT and emphasizing the importance of adhering to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. For young women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), premature or early menopause, without contraindications, we suggest taking MHT until the time of anticipated natural menopause, when the advisability of continuing MHT can be reassessed. For women preparing to discontinue MHT, we suggest a shared decision-making approach to elicit individual preference about adopting a gradual taper vs abrupt discontinuation.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111KmVKh]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — initiation after age 60 years: In the WHI blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), exposure was limited to 5 to 7 years of therapy, and initiating hormone therapy in women aged older than 60 years or more than 10 years beyond menopause onset was associated with greater risk, with initiation at older than 70 years associated with the highest risk. There may be well-counseled women aged older than 60 years who choose to initiate or restart hormone therapy, but for women requesting initiation because of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) appearing many years after menopause onset, further evaluation is needed, as new-onset VMS may be related to underlying medical problems (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, carcinoid, lymphoma, Lyme disease, tuberculosis, HIV) or medication/substance use (eg, antidepressants, hypoglycemic agents, or withdrawal from alcohol or opioids).

Regarding specific circumstances for menopause, more specifically with respect to patients at increased risk of gynecological cancers, BGCS/BMS 2024 guidelines recommend to avoid continuing hormone replacement therapy beyond the usual age of menopause in patients with a cancer susceptibility gene associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (such as BRCA carriers). Consider continuing hormone replacement therapy based on the individual balance of risks and benefits in patients after bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy for primary breast cancer prevention.

### The women's health initiative trials of menopausal hormone therapy: lessons learned [^116xRGvZ]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) assessed oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) taken with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for prevention of chronic disease in postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years.

Methods

Women with an intact uterus (n = 16,608) were randomized to CEE+ MPA therapy or placebo for a median of 5.6 years; women with hysterectomy (n = 10,739) were randomized to CEE-alone therapy or placebo for a median of 7.2 years. Both cohorts have been followed for 18 years.

Results

In the overall study population (mean age, 63 y), neither estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) nor estrogen-only therapy prevented coronary heart disease or led to a favorable balance of chronic-disease benefits and risks. Subgroup analyses, however, suggest that timing of hormone therapy (HT) initiation influences the relation between HT and coronary risk, as well as its overall benefit-risk balance, with more favorable effects in women who are younger (age < 60 year) or recently menopausal (within 10 year) than in women who are older or further past the menopausal transition. In younger women who entered the trial of estrogen-only therapy with oophorectomy, the intervention was associated with a significant 32% reduction in all-cause mortality over long-term follow-up.

Conclusions

WHI findings indicate important differences in HT-related clinical outcomes by age and time since menopause. Systemic HT has an acceptable safety profile for menopause management when initiated among healthy women who are younger (or recently menopausal) and not at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease or breast cancer. Initiation of treatment in older women who are distant from menopause onset, however, should be avoided. Other HT formulations and routes of delivery warrant further study.(WHI clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00000611).

Research needs and gaps — more research is needed on whether age or timing of initiation of hormone therapy with respect to menopause affects health outcomes; on whether the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy vary across population groups, including understanding whether therapy might have a different magnitude or balance of harms or benefits across racial and ethnic groups and how an individual patient data meta-analysis might inform this; and on the comparative benefits and harms of different formulations and treatment durations of menopausal hormone therapy.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend to administer estrogen-progestogen regimens either continuously (estrogen-progestogen taken every day) or following a cyclic regimen, with estrogen taken every day and progestogen taken for 12–14 days every month. Consider administering estrogen alone taken every day in patients with hysterectomy.

Menopausal hormone therapy — key points: The safety profile of hormone therapy is most favorable when initiated in healthy women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, so initiation of hormone therapy by menopausal women aged older than 60 years requires careful consideration of individual benefits and risks. [Level I] Long-term use of hormone therapy, including for women aged older than 60 years, may be considered in healthy women at low risk of CVD and breast cancer with persistent VMS or at elevated risk of fracture for whom other therapies are not appropriate. (Level III) Factors that should be considered include severity of symptoms, effectiveness of alternative nonhormone interventions, and underlying risk for osteoporosis, CHD, cerebrovascular accident, VTE, and breast cancer. (Level III) Hormone therapy does not need to be routinely discontinued in women aged older than 60 or 65 years. (Level III)

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115G8fey]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

NAMS position statement — conclusions on effectiveness and benefit-risk stratification state that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for VMS and GSM and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture, and that risks differ by type, dose, route, timing, and progestogen need; treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation. Absolute attributable risks for hormone therapy in the 50- to 59-year-old age group or within 10 years of menopause onset are low, whereas risks appear greater when initiated at 60 years and older or further than 10 years from menopause onset, particularly for those aged 70 years and older or more than 20 years from menopause onset. For women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset and without contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio appears favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for the prevention of bone loss and reduction of fracture, and based on the WHI RCTs, longer duration may be more favorable for ET than for EPT. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or when aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable than for younger women because of greater absolute risks of CHD, stroke, VTE, and dementia.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114vNTEq]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — discontinuation: Controversy exists regarding how long hormone therapy may safely be used and when it should be discontinued. Based on WHI findings, breast cancer risk becomes detectable after 3 to 5 years in women using estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT), whereas for women without a uterus using estrogen therapy (ET) alone, breast cancer risk did not increase after 7 years, so a longer duration of hormone therapy use may be acceptable. There are few studies to guide the optimal way to stop, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) will recur in approximately 50% of women after discontinuation; data directly comparing abrupt versus tapered discontinuation are lacking, although clinical experts generally advise gradually decreasing hormone therapy doses over time. If hormone therapy is being used for prevention of osteoporosis, protection against bone density loss and fracture prevention is lost rapidly with discontinuation. Although VMS generally improve with time, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) worsens with prolonged estrogen deficiency, observational studies confirm the long-term safety of low-dose vaginal ET as a highly effective treatment for GSM, and, in the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional.

### Managing menopause [^11282Kge]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for menopause, more specifically with respect to patients with early menopause, SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend to add cyclic (at least 12 days/month) or continuous progestogen therapy to estrogen therapy in patients with an intact uterus, and monitor adherence to the progestogen therapy.

Conclusion

CV risk in women increases at the time of menopause, likely related to a combination of aging and the menopausal transition. Proper CVD risk assessment is imperative for improving long term CVD outcomes, guiding risk reduction therapy, and determining safety of MHT if needed. A thorough history of adverse pregnancy outcomes and complications is required in all perimenopausal women. Assessment of family history of CVD in addition to any personal history of autoimmune or rheumatologic disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is essential. All traditional risk factors should be assessed as well as current lipid cholesterol levels, blood glucose levels, and blood pressure. All women should receive education on ideal body weight, a plant-based heart healthy diet, and optimal exercise routines.

MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD or in women with known ASCVD or high risk for CVD events. In select populations of women who may benefit from its vasomotor, genitourinary, and bone health effects, women at low CVD risk may be prescribed MHT safely until age 65. The principles underlying safe use of MHT include using low dose MHT for the shortest possible duration and employing transdermal, SERM, and topical formulations where appropriate, often as an initial strategy. Lastly, it is imperative that both patients and providers are aware of the appropriate indications for MHT and individual risks, especially from a CV standpoint. Several calculators are available to further risk-stratify these patients and enable safe shared-decision making, such as the ASCVD pooled-cohort risk calculator and the NAMS MenoPro app. Quality of life for postmenopausal women is an important consideration, and in addition to early risk assessment and CVD risk reduction, decisions regarding MHT should be made individually and reassessed over time.

Tailoring menopausal hormone therapy — shared decision-making, dosing, and monitoring are specified as follows: "We suggest a shared decision-making approach to decide about the choice of formulation, starting dose, the route of administration of MHT, and how to tailor MHT to each woman's individual situation, risks, and treatment goals". Clinicians prescribe estrogen alone for women without a uterus, use "the lowest effective dose with upward titration based on clinical response", and "usually do not measure estradiol levels to monitor therapy except when symptoms do not improve with escalating doses, particularly after changing the mode of administration from oral to transdermal". For younger women with surgical menopause or those with POI, higher starting doses may be used, for example "transdermal estradiol, 100 μg", then tapered as tolerated, and "the reassessment and tapering of MHT dose seems reasonable" as premature menopause approaches the natural menopause age.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115RMpRN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Mortality with menopausal hormone therapy — overall effect and timing hypothesis: A meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrated no significant effect on all-cause mortality with MHT use, including women < and > 60 years of age, but a Cochrane review reported a 30% relative risk reduction (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52–0.95) in women starting MHT < 10 years since menopause (or < age 60); meta-analyses reported a 30–40% mortality reduction, while the guideline concludes that further data are required for definitive conclusions about mortality in younger women.

### Current recommendations: what is the clinician to do? [^111Jkgg2]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) has complex biologic effects but continues to have an important clinical role in the management of vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. The rational use of menopausal HT requires balancing the potential benefits and risks of treatment. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other randomized clinical trials have helped to clarify the benefits and risks of HT and have provided insights to improve decision making. Several clinical characteristics have utility in identifying women for whom benefits of HT are likely to outweigh the risks. Age and time since menopause are strong predictors of health outcomes and absolute risks associated with HT, and differences by age have been particularly apparent for estrogen alone. In the WHI trial of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) alone, younger women (50–59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index, but not for stroke and venous thrombosis. Age trends were less clear for CEE + medroxyprogesterone acetate, owing to increased risks of breast cancer, stroke, and venous thrombosis in all age groups. Absolute risks of adverse events were lower in younger than in older women in both trials, however. Other predictors of lower vascular risk from HT include favorable lipid status and absence of the metabolic syndrome. Transdermal administration may be associated with lower risks of venous thrombosis and stroke, but additional research is needed. The use of risk stratification and personalized risk assessment offers promise for improved benefit-risk profile and safety of HT. One approach to decision making is presented. Key elements include: assessment of whether the patient has moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, the primary indication for initiating systemic HT (vaginal estrogen may be used to treat genitourinary symptoms in the absence of vasomotor symptoms); understanding the patient's own preference regarding therapy; evaluating the patient for the presence of any contraindications to HT, as well as the time since menopause onset and baseline risks of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer; reviewing carefully the benefits and risks of treatment with the patient, giving more emphasis to absolute than to relative measures of effect; and, if HT is initiated, regularly reviewing the patient's need for continued treatment.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 565: hormone therapy and heart disease [^116HaBj5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy should not be used for the primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease at the present time. Evidence is insufficient to conclude that long-term estrogen therapy or hormone therapy use improves cardiovascular outcomes. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that women in early menopause who are in good cardiovascular health are at low risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and should be considered candidates for the use of estrogen therapy or conjugated equine estrogen plus a progestin for relief of menopausal symptoms. There is some evidence that lends support to the "timing hypothesis", which posits that cardiovascular benefit may be derived when estrogen therapy or hormone therapy is used close to the onset of menopause, but the relationship of duration of therapy to cardiovascular outcomes awaits further study. Clinicians should encourage heart-healthy lifestyles and other strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in menopausal women. Because some women aged 65 years and older may continue to need systemic hormone therapy for the management of vasomotor symptoms, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against routine discontinuation of systemic estrogen at age 65 years. As with younger women, use of hormone therapy and estrogen therapy should be individualized based on each woman's risk-benefit ratio and clinical presentation.

### Hormone-replacement therapy: current thinking [^111ZZbUb]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

For several decades, the role of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has been debated. Early observational data on HRT showed many benefits, including a reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality. More recently, randomized trials, including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), studying mostly women many years after the the onset of menopause, showed no such benefit and, indeed, an increased risk of CHD and breast cancer, which led to an abrupt decrease in the use of HRT. Subsequent reanalyzes of data from the WHI with age stratification, newer randomized and observational data and several meta-analyses now consistently show reductions in CHD and mortality when HRT is initiated soon after menopause. HRT also significantly decreases the incidence of various symptoms of menopause and the risk of osteoporotic fractures, and improves quality of life. In younger healthy women (aged 50–60 years), the risk-benefit balance is positive for using HRT, with risks considered rare. As no validated primary prevention strategies are available for younger women (< 60 years of age), other than lifestyle management, some consideration might be given to HRT as a prevention strategy as treatment can reduce CHD and all-cause mortality. Although HRT should be primarily oestrogen-based, no particular HRT regimen can be advocated.

### Menopause hormone therapy: 30 years of advances and controversies [^114ix3BR]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) recommendations have changed significantly over the last thirty years. Early observational studies suggested that MHT offered broad benefits for women, including relief from menopausal symptoms, improved genitourinary health, prevention of osteoporosis, and reduction in cardiovascular disease. As randomized controlled trials were conducted to validate these findings, new evidence emerged that led to shifts in guidance from medical societies and sharp declines in MHT prescriptions. This review summarizes three decades of studies, key advancements and ongoing controversies. We also discuss recommendations for MHT from cardiology, obstetrics/ gynecology and endocrinology perspectives.

### Current perspectives on benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy [^1123uSfv]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen alone or with added progestin relieves menopausal symptoms and physical changes associated with depleted endogenous estrogen levels. Estrogen replacement has also demonstrated a clear benefit in the prevention of osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy with added progestin maintains spinal bone density, protects against postmenopausal hip fractures, and provides these benefits even when therapy is started after age 60. More recently, additional benefits have emerged. Current estrogen and hormone replacement therapy users have a 34% reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer and a 20% to 60% reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Until recently, the body of evidence indicated that hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only reduced cardiovascular disease risk by 40% to 50% in healthy patients; whether the findings of 3 ongoing trials will change this conclusion is pending availability of the final results. The many benefits of estrogen and hormone replacement therapy must be weighed against a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer diagnosis with use for 5 or more years, but which disappears following cessation of therapy. Overall, estrogen and hormone replacement therapy improves the quality of life and increases life expectancy for most menopausal women.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115TEqN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — treatment of menopausal symptoms states that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric, and that benefits clearly exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference, and they should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. For those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications — because these patients should not use MHT — other options are available; for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### What the women's health initiative has taught us about menopausal hormone therapy [^111pvX15]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complex relationship between menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been informed by detailed analyses in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating MHT in postmenopausal women. Although the WHI demonstrated increased risk of CVD events with MHT in the overall cohort, subsequent secondary analyses demonstrated that these risks were influenced by the woman's age and time since menopause, with lower absolute risks and hazard ratios for younger than older women. As MHT is the most effective treatment for the vasomotor symptoms of menopause, it is important to understand its risks and how to conduct risk stratification for symptomatic women. In addition to reviewing the WHI findings, studies pre- and post-WHI are reviewed to describe the relationship between MHT and CVD risk in menopausal women. The absolute risks of adverse cardiovascular events for MHT initiated in women close to menopause are low, and all-cause mortality effects are neutral or even favorable for younger menopausal women. The WHI has advanced and refined our understanding of the relationship between MHT and CVD risk. Although MHT should not be used for CVD prevention, absolute risks of CVD are low when MHT is started close to menopause in healthy women and hazard ratios tend to be lower for younger than older women. For women in early menopause and without contraindications to treatment, the benefits of MHT are likely to outweigh the risks when used for menopausal symptom management.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^1146ThMd]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menopause hormone therapy — overview and symptom relief benefits emphasize that systemic hormone therapy is an acceptable option for relatively young (up to age 59 or within 10 years of menopause) and healthy women who are bothered by moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, and that individualization is key with consideration of quality-of-life priorities and risk factors including age, time since menopause, and risks of blood clots, heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Systemic hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for most menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy; estrogen therapy as a single agent is sufficient in women who have undergone hysterectomy, whereas progestogen therapy is required to prevent endometrial cancer when estrogen is used systemically in women with a uterus. For symptoms limited to vaginal dryness or discomfort with intercourse, local estrogen therapy is effective and preferred, and low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is recommended in this setting.

Guideline scope and shared decision-making for menopausal symptom therapy: This guideline covers the full spectrum of therapies for relief of the most common and bothersome menopausal symptoms, while the detailed management of early menopause transition, primary ovarian insufficiency, and prevention of osteoporosis and fracture are considered beyond the current scope. Choice of therapy is ideally based on available evidence regarding safety and efficacy and is generally a shared decision including both patient and provider, and the treatment selected should be tailored to the individual patient and will vary according to each woman's symptom severity, age, medical profile, personal preference, and estimated benefit/risk ratio. An accepted philosophy is that a fully informed patient should be empowered to make a decision that best balances individual QOL benefits against potential health risks.

### Update on menopause hormone therapy; current indications and unanswered questions [^114pVtrs]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide clinicians involved in managing menopause with a summary of current evidence surrounding menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

Design

The authors evaluate and synthesize existing pooled evidence relating to MHT's clinical indications, efficacy, and safety and explore the limitations of existing data.

Patients

The review focuses on MHT-related outcomes in women with natural-timed menopause captured within observational studies, RCTs, and pooled data from pivotal meta-analyses and reviews.

Measurements

Available published data are scrutinized. Available evidence and notably lacking data from women not adequately represented in published MHT trials, such as those with socioeconomic adversity, significant comorbidities, and minority ethnic backgrounds, are highlighted and deliberated.

Results

The impact of MHT differs significantly between demographics. Current consensus recommendations for MHT emphasize the importance of tailoring type, route, dose, and duration of therapy to individual needs and risk/benefit ratio through shared decision-making. MHT impact can change over time. Current MHT data support its benefits for treating menopause symptoms and a potential window of opportunity in midlife to benefit skeletal health. Limitations of current evidence highlight menopause health inequalities and underscores the need for further research.

Conclusions

This review recommends tailored use of MHT for well-defined indications, recognizing its value for menopause symptom relief and skeletal benefits for many midlife women. MHT may be used as long as benefits outweigh risks, through shared decision-making. There is insufficient clinical evidence to support the long-term use of MHT in some contemporary cohorts of women accessing MHT in clinical practice.

### Rethinking menopausal hormone therapy: for whom, what, when, and how long? [^116rfD6e]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) was widely used in the past, but with the publication of seminal primary and secondary prevention trials that reported an excess cardiovascular risk with combined estrogen-progestin, HT use declined significantly. However, over the past 20 years, much has been learned about the relationship between the timing of HT use with respect to age and time since menopause, HT route of administration, and cardiovascular disease risk. Four leading medical societies recommend HT for the treatment of menopausal women with bothersome menopausal symptoms. In this context, this review, led by the American College of Cardiology Cardiolovascular Disease in Women Committee, along with leading gynecologists, women's health internists, and endocrinologists, aims to provide guidance on HT use, including the selection of patients and HT formulation with a focus on caring for symptomatic women with cardiovascular disease risk.

We feel that methods to integrate these factors to categorize individual risk as minimal, moderate, and high are useful and can be accomplished qualitatively by clinical judgment or quantitatively by risk assessment tools, and country- and population-specific CVD risk calculators are available to quantify individual risk per local guidelines; however, specific cutoffs for the safe use of MHT have not been formally validated, and practice differs from country to country.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114WrBok]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular disease — key points: For healthy symptomatic women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, the favorable effects of hormone therapy on coronary heart disease (CHD) and all-cause mortality should be considered against potential rare increases in risks of breast cancer, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and stroke (Level I), and hormone therapy is not government approved for primary or secondary cardioprotection (Level I). Personal and familial risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, VTE, and breast cancer should be considered when initiating hormone therapy (Level III). The effects of hormone therapy on CHD may vary depending on when hormone therapy is initiated in relation to a woman's age or time since menopause onset (Level I). Women who initiate hormone therapy aged older than 60 years or more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset are at higher absolute risks of CHD, VTE, and stroke than women initiating hormone therapy in early menopause (Level I).

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: July 2008 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^112H6TEs]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in March 2007 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Design

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the March 2007 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. The document was provided to other interested organizations to seek their endorsement.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Conclusions that vary from the 2007 position statement are highlighted. Addenda include a discussion of risk concepts, a new component not included in the 2007 paper, and a recommended list of areas for future HT research. A suggested reading list of key references is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable close to menopause but decreases with aging and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^116DhHJr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Women are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with men. While traditional risk factors for CVD seem to disproportionately affect women and contribute to this disparity, increased prevalence of CVD at midlife calls into question the contribution of menopause. Given the potential role that declining hormone levels play in this transition, menopause hormone therapies (MHT) have been proposed as a strategy for risk factor reduction. Unfortunately, trials have not consistently shown cardiovascular benefit with use, and several describe significant risks. Notably, the timing of hormone administration seems to play a role in its relative risks and benefits. At present, MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. For women who may benefit from the associated vasomotor, genitourinary, and/or bone health properties of MHT, CVD risks should be taken into account prior to administration. Further research is needed to assess routes, dosing, and formulations of MHT in order to elucidate appropriate timing for administration. Here, we aim to review both traditional and sex-specific risk factors contributing to increased CVD risk in women with a focus on menopause, understand cardiovascular effects of MHT through a review of several landmark clinical trials, summarize guidelines for appropriate MHT use, and discuss a comprehensive strategy for reducing CV risk in women.

### The 2012 hormone therapy position statement of: the North American Menopause Society [^114YryjJ]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This position statement aimed to update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2010 regarding recommendations for hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women. This updated position statement further distinguishes the emerging differences in the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio between estrogen therapy (ET) and combined estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) at various ages and time intervals since menopause onset.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of expert clinicians and researchers in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2010 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement.

Results

Current evidence supports the use of HT for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women when the balance of potential benefits and risks is favorable for the individual woman. This position statement reviews the effects of ET and EPT on many aspects of women's health and recognizes the greater safety profile associated with ET.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture. The more favorable benefit-risk ratio for ET allows more flexibility in extending the duration of use compared with EPT, where the earlier appearance of increased breast cancer risk precludes a recommendation for use beyond 3 to 5 years.

Menopausal transition is associated with profound hormonal changes, which can be symptomatic in 80% of women, and these symptoms, including vasomotor, genitourinary, sleep difficulties, and cognition, can be severe in about 30% of women. Vasomotor symptoms, which are episodes of profuse heat accompanied by sweating and flushing, cause anxiety and sleep disruption and tend to be the most lifestyle-limiting symptom in many women.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the treatment of choice for menopausal symptoms and is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. During peak use in the late 1990s, prescriptions for MHT rose rapidly in the US, fueled by observational studies showing a protective effect on coronary heart diseases and cardiovascular deaths. MHT use, however, declined rapidly in 2002 after the Women's Health Initiative trial showed that the health risks associated with MHT outweighed the benefits. Recent studies highlighting nuances in the risks of MHT with suggestions that the absolute risks of adverse events depend on several factors, including age at initiation and timing in relation to menopause, MHT type, dosage, duration, and route of administration, have led to several national societies putting out guidelines on MHT prescribing.

In 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against the use of MHT for primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women, while the North American Menopause Society recommended tailoring MHT in treating menopausal symptoms to each individual need. The US Preventive Services Task Force also highlighted research gaps, including the need to understand the comparative benefits and harms of different MHT formulations and age at initiation. A gap in the current conversation on MHT use is an understanding of recent trends in, and prevalence of, MHT use. To our knowledge, the most recent study on MHT prevalence using a nationally representative sample was based on self-reported data up to 2010; hence, there are no recent MHT use data captured by prescriptions to understand contemporary patterns in the US.

The goal of this cross-sectional study is to comprehensively describe the most recent trends in, and current prevalence and correlates of, MHT use, taking into consideration MHT formulations, among postmenopausal women in the US. Study findings will provide data that can help guide national discussions and policy on MHT use.

Duration of menopausal hormone therapy — We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. Technical remarks note that current proposed limits on duration are informed by large intervention trials (5 to 7 y) with extended follow-up for 13 years, that risk rates for breast cancer and CVD increase with age and time since menopause with risks appearing less with ET than with EPT, and that ovarian cancer risk may also increase relative to duration of MHT. The guideline concludes that clinicians and patients should reassess MHT continuation yearly and discuss the risks and individual benefits beyond 5 years.

Osteoporosis key points — Hormone therapy prevents bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, with dose-dependent effects on bone density (Level I), and hormone therapy reduces fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal women (Level I). Hormone therapy is FDA approved for prevention of bone loss, but not for treatment of osteoporosis (Level I). In the absence of contraindications, in women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, systemic hormone therapy is an appropriate therapy to protect against bone loss (Level I). Unless contraindicated, women with premature menopause without prior fragility fracture or osteoporosis are best served with hormone therapy or oral contraceptives to prevent bone density loss and reduce fracture risk, rather than other bone-specific treatments, until the average age of menopause, when treatment may be reassessed (Level II). Decisions regarding initiating and discontinuation of hormone therapy should be made primarily on the basis of extraskeletal benefits (ie, reduction of VMS) and risks (Level III).

### Update in hormone therapy use in menopause [^116EhNVU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The original report from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) changed our understanding of the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Since that time, reanalysis of the WHI and additional data from other studies have further refined these concepts. Here we provide an update on recent advances in the field. Menopausal hormone therapy continues to have a clinical role in the management of vasomotor symptoms. However, our understanding of the role of hormones in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer continues to evolve. Further analyses of the effect of age and proximity to menopause at the time of initiation of therapy, duration of treatment, dose, route of administration, and the persistence of risks and benefits after stopping hormone therapy are described. In addition, recent data have emerged suggesting that there may be a link between hormone therapy and cancers of the lung and ovary. Finally, we discuss new advances in hormone therapy that will likely lead to a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, enabling safer effective menopausal symptom relief.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on menopause-2017 update [^1178U8Q1]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Position Statement is designed to update the previous menopause clinical practice guidelines published in 2011 but does not replace them. The current document reviews new clinical trials published since then as well as new information regarding possible risks and benefits of therapies available for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. AACE reinforces the recommendations made in its previous guidelines and provides additional recommendations on the basis of new data. A summary regarding this position statement is listed below: New information available from randomized clinical trials and epidemiologic studies reported after 2011 was critically reviewed. No previous recommendations from the 2011 menopause clinical practice guidelines have been reversed or changed. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, SERMs, and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. New recommendations in this position statement include: 1.

Recommendation

the use of menopausal hormone therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women should be based on consideration of all risk factors for cardiovascular disease, age, and time from menopause. 2.

Recommendation

the use of transdermal as compared with oral estrogen preparations may be considered less likely to produce thrombotic risk and perhaps the risk of stroke and coronary artery disease. 3.

Recommendation

when the use of progesterone is necessary, micronized progesterone is considered the safer alternative. 4.

Recommendation

in symptomatic menopausal women who are at significant risk from the use of hormone replacement therapy, the use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and possibly other nonhormonal agents may offer significant symptom relief. 5.

Recommendation

AACE does not recommend use of bioidentical hormone therapy. 6.

Recommendation

AACE fully supports the recommendations of the Comité de l'Évolution des Pratiques en Oncologie regarding the management of menopause in women with breast cancer. 7.

Recommendation

HRT is not recommended for the prevention of diabetes. 8.

Recommendation

In women with previously diagnosed diabetes, the use of HRT should be individualized, taking in to account age, metabolic, and cardiovascular risk factors.

### Hormone therapy: evolving concepts [^116C75ea]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the medical literature published in 2002 regarding menopausal hormone therapy and its impact on clinical practice.

Methods

A literature search was performed using MEDLINE with the keywords of menopause, sex steroids, and hormone replacement therapy. Randomized clinical trials were reviewed. An evidence-based review is presented.

Results

Menopausal hormone therapy has undergone radical change since the publication of the Women's Health Initiative randomized prospective trial of combined estrogen plus progestin therapy for disease prevention. After a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the E + P versus placebo trial of 16,608 women was stopped because the health risks of taking E + P exceeded the benefits. An increase in breast cancer risk, coupled with an adverse trend in overall risk-benefit ratio, reached the preset stopping boundaries. In addition, there was an increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. The decreased risks seen for osteoporotic fracture and colorectal cancer were outweighed by the above risks. The FDA has required mandatory label changes for all hormone products based on these findings. The Women's Health Initiative found that treatment with estrogen plus progestin for up to 5 years is not beneficial overall. There is early harm for coronary heart disease, continuing harm for stroke and venous thromboembolism, and increasing harm for breast cancer. This risk-benefit profile is not consistent with a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases in postmenopausal women. Menopausal hormone therapy should be reserved for women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.

Conclusions

In the past 20 years, menopause has become a household word, with much better understanding of its consequences. The growing numbers of menopausal women and clinical trials have coincided to draw increasing attention to the perimenopausal and menopausal years. Better studies of older therapies and the expanded number of new choices today, with more in development and evaluation, have complicated provider and patient choices but greatly improved the potential for effective intervention.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to management of vasomotor symptoms, hormonal therapy, AACE 2011 guidelines recommend to consider initiating menopausal hormone therapy during the perimenopause and early menopause for menopausal symptoms. Consider initiating menopausal hormone therapy for severe menopausal symptoms in selected postmenopausal patients, on the basis of an individually determined benefit-versus-risk profile.

### Role of hormone therapy in the management of menopause [^114ExMCw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

There are many options available to address the quality of life and health concerns of menopausal women. The principal indication for hormone therapy (HT) is the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, and benefits generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who elect HT at the time of menopause. Although HT increases the risk of coronary heart disease, recent analyses confirm that this increased risk occurs principally in older women and those a number of years beyond menopause. These findings do not support a role for HT in the prevention of heart disease but provide reassurance regarding the safety of use for hot flushes and night sweats in otherwise healthy women at the menopausal transition. An increased risk of breast cancer with extended use is another reason short-term treatment is advised. Hormone therapy prevents and treats osteoporosis but is rarely used solely for this indication. If only vaginal symptoms are present, low-dose local estrogen therapy is preferred. Contraindications to HT use include breast or endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disorders, and active liver disease. Alternatives to HT should be advised for women with or at increased risk for these disorders. The lowest effective estrogen dose should be provided for the shortest duration necessary because risks increase with increasing age, time since menopause, and duration of use. Women must be informed of the potential benefits and risks of all therapeutic options, and care should be individualized, based on a woman's medical history, needs, and preferences.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^117HZMei]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Systemic hormone therapy — indications, timing, and cautions for bone health: The primary indication for systemic HT is for relief of vasomotor (VMS) and other menopause symptoms in postmenopausal women aged younger than 60 years and within 10 years of menopause, with secondary benefit on bone protection. Extended use of HT is an option for well-counseled women who have a low bone mass for prevention of further bone loss and/or reduction of fracture risk when alternate therapies are not appropriate or when the benefits of extended use exceed the risks. Despite positive effects on bone, initiating HT in women aged older than 60 years or more than 10 years beyond menopause is generally not recommended because of concerns about cardiovascular safety, and ET or EPT should largely be used in the early years after menopause. For women with primary ovarian insufficiency, premature menopause, or early surgical menopause, an estrogen preparation should be considered, unless there are contraindications, to prevent bone loss as well as treat menopause symptoms, at least until the average age of natural menopause; higher doses of HT may be needed in younger women, particularly those aged younger than 40 years.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114dh9sV]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — extended use after age 65 years: There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years, and although the Beers criteria warns against hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years, the recommendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Menopause Society. For otherwise healthy women with persistent vasomotor symptoms (VMS), continuing hormone therapy beyond age 65 years is a reasonable option with appropriate counseling, regular assessment of risks and benefits, and shared decision-making, and hormone therapy also may be considered for prevention of fracture in healthy older women at elevated fracture risk when bothersome VMS persist or when hormone therapy remains the best choice because of lack of efficacy or intolerance of other fracture-prevention therapies; however, long-duration hormone therapy use and use in older women is not appropriate for reduction in the risk of CHD or dementia, and mitigation strategies include switching from oral to transdermal hormone therapy, choice of progestogen, and lowering of dose.

Introduction

Despite recent improvements in sex and gender research in cardiovascular disease (CVD), disparities still exist. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) in particular remains a leading cause of death in women. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include biological, social, environmental, and economic factors. While men and women share many traditional risk factors for CVD, these alone do not explain the sex-specific increased risk of CVD in women. Additional female-specific risk factors, most notably menopause, contribute significantly. Menopause has been associated with an increased CVD risk in women aged ⩾55 years. The transition to menopause has shown to be associated with negative alterations in the lipid profile, increased susceptibility to weight gain and metabolic syndrome, and both epicardial and paracardial fat deposition. – It represents a vulnerable time for women and an opportunity for consideration of menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

In prior decades, MHT was thought to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, large trials demonstrating the risks of MHT have changed clinician and public perception of these strategies. As our understanding of MHT has evolved, so has our knowledge regarding the appropriate timing and patient characteristics for safe administration. Given the efficacy of MHT in reducing the unpleasant vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, which can severely alter quality of life, understanding the safety and potential cardiovascular (CV) risks and benefits of MHT is important in optimizing the health of our female patients.

Abstract

"The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" (NAMS) updates "The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2017 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Advisory Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of hormone therapy differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing therapy. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1157hBxF]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

NAMS position statement — risk mitigation, monitoring, and continuation of hormone therapy in older women emphasizes that mitigation of risk through use of the lowest effective dose and potentially with a nonoral route of administration becomes increasingly important as women age and with longer duration of therapy, and that longer durations or extended use beyond age 65 should include periodic reevaluation of comorbidities with consideration of periodic trials of lowering or discontinuing hormone therapy. In the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional, and it remains an individual decision in select, well-counseled women aged older than 60 or 65 years to continue therapy, with no data to support routine discontinuation in women aged 65 years. For women with GSM, low-dose vaginal ET may be considered for use at any age and for extended duration, if needed.

### The timing hypothesis and hormone replacement therapy: a paradigm shift in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease in women. part 1: comparison of therapeutic efficacy [^116YYKd8]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Low credibility.

The long-held belief that outcome data from intervention trials in men are generalizable to women has created the framework in which the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in women is viewed, but over the past decade, data have accumulated to refute such a supposition of generalizability. These lines of evidence concern the sex-specific efficacy of CHD primary prevention therapies and timing of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) initiation according to age and time since menopause as modifiers of efficacy and risk. Although the standard primary prevention therapies of statins and aspirin reduce CHD in men, neither therapy reduces CHD and, more importantly, mortality in women under primary prevention conditions. Nonetheless, HRT significantly reduces CHD and mortality in primary prevention when it is initiated in women who are younger than 60 or are less than 10 years since menopause. Herein, the efficacy of the commonly used therapies for the primary prevention of CHD in women, statins, aspirin, and postmenopausal HRT is discussed. The comparative risks of these therapies will be discussed in Part 2 of this series.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115SF8aJ]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Duration of use, initiation after age 60 years, and discontinuation — benefits of hormone therapy generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who are aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, but because increasing risk is observed with advancing age and extended duration of use, women are advised to use the appropriate dose for the time needed to manage symptoms. Because many women will experience bothersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS) for many years, long-duration hormone therapy may be needed and an arbitrary age-based stopping rule is not clinically appropriate; frequent VMS persist on average 7.4 years and for many more than 10 years. In a study of Swedish women aged older than 85 years, 16% reported hot flashes at least several times per week, and up to 8% of women continue to have hot flashes for 20 years or longer after menopause.

The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR) is a national, nonprofit organization based in Washington DC that is dedicated to transforming women's health through science, advocacy, and education. For more than 10 years, women and the physicians who treat them have been concerned about the safety of menopausal hormone therapy, largely since the early termination of two large federally funded studies. Considerable confusion remains despite decades of accumulated evidence from observational studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses. In November 2012, SWHR convened 18 of the foremost experts within the field for a roundtable event to discuss the collective evidence related to the risks and benefits of hormone therapy. This report includes a synopsis of those discussions, the clinical statements that were generated and agreed upon, and the research recommendations suggested by the assembled experts.

### Hormone therapy in menopause: concepts, controversies, and approach to treatment [^111VeXUA]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy (HT) is an effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Randomized trials also demonstrate positive effects on bone health, and age-stratified analyses indicate more favorable effects on coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality in younger women (close proximity to menopause) than in women more than a decade past menopause. In the absence of contraindications or other major comorbidities, recently menopausal women with moderate or severe symptoms are appropriate candidates for HT. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials-estrogen and progestin trial and the estrogen-alone trial-clarified the benefits and risks of HT, including how the results differed by age. A key lesson from the WHI trials, which was unfortunately lost in the posttrial cacophony, was that the risk:benefit ratio and safety profile of HT differed markedly by clinical characteristics of the participants, especially age, time since menopause, and comorbidity status. In the present review of the WHI and other recent HT trials, we aim to provide readers with an improved understanding of the importance of the timing of HT initiation, type and route of administration, and of patient-specific considerations that should be weighed when prescribing HT.

### Menopausal hormone therapy: current considerations [^114KkBWo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and vaginal symptoms. Today, symptomatic women younger than 60 years of age or less than 10 years since onset of menopause yield the greatest benefit of MHT with the lowest risks when compared with older women remote from menopause. Careful assessment before initiating therapy includes severity of bothersome symptoms, treatment preferences, medical history, presence of contraindications to MHT, and personal risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Considerations of type of MHT, dosing, and route of administration, and recommendations regarding duration of therapy are discussed.

### Assessing benefits and harms of hormone replacement therapy: clinical applications [^113U5vbf]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

An estimated one third of postmenopausal women in the United States use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat symptoms of menopause and prevent chronic conditions. In the context of this widespread use, evidence has been growing about the potential harms of HRT, particularly regarding long-term use. Physicians and patients are often confused about how to use results of studies in individual cases. This article applies the current state of evidence for the benefits and harms of HRT to management decisions in 4 clinical situations. Patient preferences, as well as evidence, are important for these decisions. Benefits and harms need to be readdressed periodically to apply newly published evidence and to reassess emerging risks, comorbidities, and needs of individuals.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116zFqH3]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in July 2008 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the July 2008 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel' s recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. Also participating in the review process were other interested organizations who then endorsed the document.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Areas that vary from the 2008 position statement are noted. A suggested reading list of key references published since the last statement is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable for women who initiate HT close to menopause but decreases in older women and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.
