---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what TSH result to expect after 6 months of Synthroid (levothyroxine) therapy for primary hypothyroidism, assuming appropriate dose titration and adherence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic goal of levothyroxine replacement in primary hypothyroidism. Then, I should verify the expected time course for TSH normalization and the monitoring cadence. Next, I will review guideline targets for TSH and what constitutes "normal" in this context. After that, I need to consider exceptions that could yield low or undetectable TSH at 6 months, such as over-replacement or central hypothyroidism. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely answer and explicitly exclude the incorrect options with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic goal. In primary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine replacement aims to normalize serum TSH, reflecting restoration of euthyroidism, and this is the standard biochemical endpoint used to titrate dose and monitor adequacy of therapy [^4e552c61] [^07a7b05d].

> Wait, let me verify the time course. I initially thought TSH might still be changing at 6 months, but that would be too slow. The pharmacokinetics of levothyroxine mean steady state is reached in about 6–8 weeks, and dose adjustments are typically reassessed at 6–8 week intervals until TSH normalizes; once stable, periodic monitoring every 6–12 months is recommended, so by 6 months most patients should have completed titration and be at a stable, therapeutic dose if managed per guidelines [^a083e0c8] [^07a7b05d] [^efd413d2].

> I need to check the target TSH range. Guidelines consistently target a serum TSH within the population reference interval, commonly cited as roughly 0.5–4.0 or 0.5–3.5 mIU/L, with individualized targets considered in older adults or those with comorbidities; importantly, long-term observational data show no clinically meaningful differences in outcomes across this "normal" TSH spectrum, supporting flexibility as long as TSH is within the reference range [^07a7b05d] [^04a4a7e0] [^3739e1af].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider scenarios where TSH might be low or undetectable at 6 months. Low or undetectable TSH would suggest over-replacement or iatrogenic subclinical hyperthyroidism, which guidelines advise avoiding, particularly in older adults due to bone and cardiovascular risks; this would prompt dose reduction rather than being the expected endpoint of appropriate therapy [^4e552c61] [^e25d78a3]. But wait, what if the patient has central hypothyroidism? In that case, TSH is unreliable for dosing, and clinicians target free T4 instead, so a low or undetectable TSH could occur despite undertreatment, which is a different clinical context altogether [^318324c9] [^6bf11f69].

> Let me synthesize. Given 6 months of appropriately titrated levothyroxine for primary hypothyroidism, the expected TSH is within the normal reference range, reflecting biochemical euthyroidism; elevated TSH would imply under-replacement or adherence or absorption issues, while low or undetectable TSH would imply over-replacement or a different diagnostic context such as central hypothyroidism or TSH suppression for thyroid cancer, none of which are the intended outcome of routine replacement therapy [^4e552c61] [^07a7b05d] [^a083e0c8].

> I should double-check the options against this reasoning. Elevated TSH at 6 months would indicate persistent hypothyroidism or inadequate therapy, not the expected result; low or undetectable TSH would indicate over-replacement or a different clinical scenario; thus, the best answer is normal TSH, assuming standard primary hypothyroidism treatment and adherence [^07a7b05d] [^4e552c61].

---

The correct answer is **b. Normal TSH**. After 6 months of appropriately titrated Synthroid (levothyroxine) therapy, the clinician should expect the TSH to be normalized within the reference range, typically 0.5–2.5 mIU/L, indicating biochemical euthyroidism [^07a7b05d] [^04a4a7e0]. Persistent elevation would indicate undertreatment or nonadherence, while suppression would suggest overtreatment; both require dose adjustment and follow-up TSH testing in 6–8 weeks [^a083e0c8] [^07a7b05d].

---

## Expected TSH level after 6 months of Synthroid therapy

- **Normalization of TSH**: The primary goal of levothyroxine therapy is to normalize TSH, restoring it to the reference range (typically 0.5–2.5 mIU/L) [^07a7b05d] [^04a4a7e0].

- **Steady-state achievement**: Levothyroxine has a half-life of about 7 days, so steady state is reached in 6–8 weeks; after 6 months, TSH should be stable if dosing is appropriate [^d4d51eca].

- **Monitoring and adjustment**: TSH is checked every 6–8 weeks during titration until stable, then every 6–12 months; dose changes are based on TSH to maintain euthyroidism [^a083e0c8] [^07a7b05d].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal TSH levels

### Elevated TSH (option a)

An elevated TSH after 6 months indicates **undertreatment** — inadequate dosing, poor adherence, or absorption issues (e.g. interactions with calcium, iron, or food) [^a083e0c8] [^4d8061bc]. Management should reassess adherence, absorption, and dose, then adjust and recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks [^a083e0c8] [^07a7b05d].

---

### Low or undetectable TSH (options c and d)

A low or undetectable TSH indicates **overtreatment** — excess levothyroxine causing subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism, with risks of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and anxiety [^e25d78a3]. Management should reduce the dose and recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks [^a083e0c8] [^07a7b05d].

---

## Factors influencing TSH normalization

Several factors can influence **TSH normalization** with levothyroxine therapy:

| **Factor** | **Effect on tsh normalization** |
|-|-|
| Patient adherence | Poor adherence can lead to elevated TSH despite adequate dosing [^80fb55bf] |
| Drug interactions | Calcium, iron, and certain foods can impair absorption, causing elevated TSH [^4d8061bc] |
| Age and comorbidities | Older patients or those with cardiovascular disease may require lower doses and slower titration, delaying normalization [^95d0aac6] |
| Formulation consistency | Switching brands or generics can alter absorption and TSH levels, necessitating re-evaluation [^639f6a74] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ATA guidelines**: Aim for TSH 0.5–2.5 mIU/L in most adults, with individualized targets in older adults or those with comorbidities [^07a7b05d] [^ff11340f].

- **AACE/ATA guidelines**: Monitor TSH 6–8 weeks after initiation or dose changes, then every 6–12 months once stable [^efd413d2] [^40f61ce6].

- **FDA labeling**: Emphasizes periodic TSH monitoring to ensure euthyroidism and avoid overtreatment [^a083e0c8].

---

## Conclusion

After 6 months of Synthroid therapy, the expected TSH is **within the reference range** (about 0.5–2.5 mIU/L), reflecting biochemical euthyroidism [^07a7b05d]. Persistent elevation or suppression warrants evaluation of adherence, absorption, and dosing, with dose adjustment and repeat TSH in 6–8 weeks [^a083e0c8].

2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation.

Biotin supplementation may interfere with immunoassays for TSH, T4, and T3, resulting in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Drug Interactions (7.10)].

Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of SYNTHROID may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dosage. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dosage, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient’s clinical status.

Pediatric Patients

In patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in pediatric patients as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dosage stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

The general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level. TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of SYNTHROID therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the patient is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of SYNTHROID [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

General

The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is confirmed by measuring TSH levels using a sensitive assay (second generation assay sensitivity ≤ 0.1 mIU/L or third generation assay sensitivity ≤ 0.01 mIU/L) and measurement of free-T4.

The adequacy of therapy is determined by periodic assessment of appropriate laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. The choice of laboratory tests depends on various factors including the etiology of the underlying thyroid disease, the presence of concomitant medical conditions, including pregnancy, and the use of concomitant medications (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions). Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVOTHROID®may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or decreased T4potency of the drug product.

Adults

In adult patients with primary (thyroidal) hypothyroidism, serum TSH levels (using a sensitive assay) alone may be used to monitor therapy. The frequency of TSH monitoring during levothyroxine dose titration depends on the clinical situation but it is generally recommended at 6-8 week intervals until normalization. For patients who have recently initiated levothyroxine therapy and whose serum TSH has normalized or in patients who have had their dosage of levothyroxine changed, the serum TSH concentration should be measured after 8-12 weeks. When the optimum replacement dose has been attained, clinical (physical examination) and biochemical monitoring may be performed every 6-12 months, depending on the clinical situation, and whenever there is a change in the patient's status. It is recommended that a physical examination and a serum TSH measurement be performed at least annually in patients receiving LEVOTHROID®(see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Regarding the use of levothyroxine sodium PO (also known as Synthroid) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: generally acceptable for use. The clinical experience to date does not indicate any adverse fetal effect when thyroid hormones such as levothyroxine are administered during pregnancy. Thyroid replacement therapy to hypothyroid women should not be discontinued during pregnancy. Thyroid hormones undergo minimal placental transfer. Measure TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester to gauge the adequacy of thyroid replacement dosage since during pregnancy as thyroid requirements may increase. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Immediately after obstetric delivery, the dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose, monitor thyroid function tests TSH at 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to assess for needed adjustments.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 IU per liter, and this usually requires a LEVO-T dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.

2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Levothyroxine dosing and monitoring—primary hypothyroidism: Except in secondary (central) hypothyroidism, dose titration is guided by serum thyrotropin (TSH), with the “target TSH typically being 0.5 to 3.5 or 4 mIU/L.” “Dose adjustments are usually made 4–6 weeks after initiating therapy,” typically in increments of “12.5–25 μg/d,” and “the serum TSH is then repeated in 4–6 weeks, until the TSH target has been reached.” Ongoing monitoring is advised as “serum TSH should be measured in 4–6 months and then at 12 months to assure stability.” In patients with coronary artery disease, initiation should be conservative: “Patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) should always be started on a low LT4 dose (12.5–25 μg/d), with gradual increases based on symptoms and serum TSH levels.”

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^c2c3fbb6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism affects approximately 5% of the United States population, and synthetic thyroxine in the form of levothyroxine (LT4) is the most prescribed therapy for this common condition. Autoimmune hypothyroidism is generally progressive, with a decrement in endogenous thyroid function occurring over time, such that overt hypothyroidism would occur if the thyroid hormone deficiency is untreated.However, at the current time hypothyroidism may initially be diagnosed when it is mild or subclinical, at a time that the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is minimally elevated below 10 mIU/L and the serum thyroid hormone levels are normal. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are not always specific for this condition, and each of the symptoms generally associated with hypothyroidism may also have non-thyroid causes.As attribution of the cause of symptoms is not a simple matter,, many physicians may err on the side of treating mild TSH elevations with the expectation that symptoms may improve. Thus, treatment with LT4 may be initiated for borderline TSH elevations.The authors also hypothesize that LT4 may even be prescribed for unconfirmed serum TSH elevations, or even without TSH elevation, based on the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

LT4 is being prescribed with increasing frequency, both in the United States, and in other countries. Several studies have shown that the TSH threshold at which LT4 therapy is initiated has fallen over time, such that an increasing number of cases of subclinical hypothyroidism are being treated and the mean or median TSH value at which therapy is initiated has decreased over time.– This trend for increasing treatment and decreasing thresholds has been documented both in the United States, and in Europe. Moreover, a recent study showed that if LT4 therapy was discontinued in patients undergoing treatment, while 39% of patients did in fact become hypothyroid as manifest by an elevated TSH, 61% maintained a normal TSH, perhaps suggesting that their treatment was unnecessary.However, the follow-up period in this study was relatively brief at 6–8 weeks, thus hypothyroidism being manifest later during follow-up cannot be excluded.Although national databases show a trend for an increasing number of LT4 prescriptions being provided over time,, part of this apparent increase may be accounted for by a reduction in the length of prescriptions by prescribers,such that more prescriptions are being generated for the same number of patients each year.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) monitoring during L-thyroxine treatment—Patients being treated for established hypothyroidism should have serum TSH measurements done at 4-8 weeks after initiating treatment or after a change in dose, and once an adequate replacement dose has been determined, periodic TSH measurement should be done after 6 months and then at 12-month intervals, or more frequently if the clinical situation dictates otherwise (Grade B, BEL 2).

Different levothyroxine products and serum TSH—Because use of different levothyroxine products may sometimes be associated with altered serum TSH values, a change in an identifiable formulation of levothyroxine (brand name or generic) should be followed by re-evaluation of serum TSH at steady state. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

2.4	Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVOXYL may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of LEVOXYL therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of LEVOXYL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

### Study protocol ; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^cdf53b2f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is changed according to the serum TSH level as follows; 6–8 weeks after randomisation a blood sample is taken for serum TSH, with three possible actions:
TSH <0.4 mU/L: treatment dose reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – blinding maintained by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose; these patients will have a further check TSH after 6–8 weeks; if TSH remains <0.4 mU/L patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.
TSH ≥0.4 and <4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose; patient to be reviewed at 12 months.
TSH remains elevated (≥4.6 mU/L): additional 25 micrograms levothyroxine, giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of dose of levothyroxine (25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions, at 6–8 week intervals, with a check of serum TSH performed at 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained masked to the results of TSH measurements throughout the course of the study.

The above process (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month) then annually (at 24 and 36 months plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine that is prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the levothyroxine-treated group. We have adopted an adaptive schedule, in which the data centre allocates the same proportion of placebo patients to have dose adjustment (up and down) as are required in the levothyroxine group. This ensures that the burden of assessment, and number of tablets to be taken, is the same in both the levothyroxine and placebo groups. The computer generated allocation also ensures that the clinical investigators remain blind to treatment allocation.

Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism, despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of ERMEZA, may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

The risk of thyroid imbalance can be linked to the switch between levothyroxine-containing products. Assess the adequacy of therapy by assessment of laboratory tests, and clinical evaluation is recommended.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dosage. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient’s clinical status.

Pediatric Patients

In patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in pediatric patients as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dosage stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

The general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level. TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of ERMEZA therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the patient is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of ERMEZA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^04a4a7e0]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent global health problem that can substantially affect patients’ wellbeing.Lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone (replacement therapy) is needed when the diagnosis of persistent thyroid hormone deficiency is confirmed; consequently, levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Western countries,and this is likely to increase further in the foreseeable future.

Long term adverse health outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction and treatment targets to optimise these outcomes, generally monitored by serial measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), have been extensively investigated. In particular, the cardiovascular effect of thyroid dysfunction and the negative ramifications of clinical (overt) thyroid hypofunction, mediated by changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis, are well documented.One of the targets for treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is to reverse such adverse effects. Current guidelines in Europe and the US recommend that replacement therapy should be aimed at resolving symptoms and achieving “normalisation” of TSH.However, no specific optimal target for TSH exists in the context of thyroid hormone replacement. This uncertainty is reflected in the guidelines proposed by the American Thyroid Association Task Force and the statement issued by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, which suggest a wide range for TSH, 0.4-4.0 mIU/L, as an indication for optimal replacement,after emphasising the scarcity of relevant evidence. TSH concentrations in this wide target range may be achieved by different doses of levothyroxine. However, from a physiological standpoint, a continuum of effects may plausibly occur across the spectrum of normal TSH concentrations; the same human heart might behave differently at a pace dictated by a TSH concentration of 0.4 mIU/L compared with one of 4 mIU/L, both of which are considered normal. Evidence indicates that TSH and circulating thyroid hormone concentrations are quite tightly regulated on an individual basis,but determining an individual’s set point is not part of routine clinical practice, and replacement treatment is generally targeted in a wide reference range.

### Delayed TSH recovery after dose adjustment during TSH-suppressive levothyroxine therapy of thyroid cancer [^7a65a712]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Delayed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) recovery during treatment of Graves' disease is caused by long-term excessive thyroid hormone, which results in downregulation of pituitary thyrotrophs. However, it is unknown whether delayed TSH recovery exists after levothyroxine (LT4) dose reduction in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) after long-term TSH suppression.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 97 DTC patients with LT4 dose reduction after long-term TSH suppression. TSH levels at baseline (point 1), 6 months (point 2) and 12-18 months (point 3) after LT4 dose reduction were compared. A delayed TSH recovery group whose TSH levels changed to upper target TSH category (2015 revised ATA guidelines) from point 2 to point 3 was identified, and risk factors were analysed.

Results

The median TSH level at point 3 was significantly higher than that of point 2 (0.17 vs 0.09 mIU/L; P<.001). The delayed TSH recovery group (44.3%) showed increased body weight (60.84 vs 62.73 kg; P=.01), while normal response group did not. Greater reduction (%) in the LT4 dose per weight [HR 1.10, 95% CI (1.00-1.22), P=.04] and higher BMI before thyroid surgery [1.19, 1.03-1.38, P=.01] predicted the occurrence of delayed TSH recovery, while higher dose of LT4 per weight after reduction showed preventive effect [HR 0.01, 95% CI (0.00-0.54); P=.02].

Conclusions

Delayed TSH recovery was common during LT4 dose reduction after long-term TSH suppression for DTC management. Six months may not be enough for TSH recovery and to evaluate thyroid hormone status by serum TSH.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^e2a5f855]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11—patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and >80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

Aim to maintain free T4 levels above the median value of the normal range.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^198c6c6d]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Children in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests)

Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., 100-125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.

For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of 25-50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6-8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5-25 mcg/day, with gradual dose increments at 4-6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5-25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.

In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5-25 mcg/day with increases of 25 mcg/day every 2-4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.

In patients with secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, the levothyroxine sodium dose should be titrated until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over... [^aa9f8dd5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24 month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication:
If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range) a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care.
If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the GP for usual care.
If for clinical reasons (e.g. major illness) a proposed change in study medication or placebo is deemed inappropriate the algorithm is overridden by the local principal coordinator and no change in study medication takes place.

Randomisation

Participants are randomised to either the levothyroxine or placebo treatment arm (ratio 1:1) using the randomly permuted block method, stratified by site, sex and starting dose. The data centre (Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, Scotland) independently provides the randomisation schedule. Mawdsley Brooks & Co. implements the schedule through identical packaging of levothyroxine and matching placebo tablets.

Patient allocation is conducted via the dedicated trial web portal by the study nurses. When a participant is eligible based on entering the eligibility criteria in an electronic case report form (eCRF) supervised by a medically certified Principle Investigator, a central computer will trigger the decision.

### No effect of levothyroxine on hemoglobin in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: pooled results from 2 randomized controlled trials [^374de839]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The current preplanned combined analysis uses data from the TRUST (Thyroid hormone Replacement for Untreated older adults with Subclinical hypothyroidism Trial) trial and the IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial. Both trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trials investigating the potential multimodal effects of levothyroxine treatment for persons with subclinical hypothyroidism aged 65 years and older, and aged 80 years and older, respectively. The identical design, study processes, and infrastructure allowed for a preplanned combined analysis. Consequently, the combined cohorts are presented and analyzed as a single study group throughout the manuscript.

The full study protocols and statistical analysis plans for the TRUST Thyroid trial and the IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial have been published previously. In short, persons aged 65 years and older (TRUST Thyroid trial) or 80 years and older (IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial) with a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as elevated thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone; TSH) levels (≥ 4.6 and ≤ 19.9 mIU/L), measured on at least 2 occasions with an interval between >3 months and 3 years apart, and free thyroxine (fT4) within normal local laboratory ranges, were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to, the use of levothyroxine, antithyroid medication, clinical diagnosis of dementia, recent hospitalization for major illness, and terminal illness. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to levothyroxine or placebo.

The study medication consisted of levothyroxine sodium tablets and matching placebo tablets taken orally daily. The intervention group started with 50 micrograms daily (or 25 micrograms for participants with body weight < 50 kg or a history of coronary heart disease) and the control group with a matching placebo for 6 to 8 weeks. Two optional up- or down-titrations after 6- to 8-week intervals, and one at 12 months of follow-up ensured adequate treatment while avoiding potential overtreatment, mirroring routine clinical practice. An adaptive mock titration schedule was applied for the placebo group. Participants, general practitioners (GPs) and study personnel remained blinded to treatment allocation and thyroid function test results throughout the study. Ethics approval was obtained from the medical ethics committees and competent authorities in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Ireland. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

### Are we restoring thyroid hormone signaling in levothyroxine-treated patients with residual symptoms of hypothyroidism? [^1c891df8]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Levothyroxine (LT4) at doses that maintain the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels within the normal range constitutes the standard of care for the treatment of hypothyroidism. After a few months, this eliminates the signs and symptoms of overt hypothyroidism in the majority of patients, owing to the endogenous activation of thyroxine to triiodothyronine, the biologically active thyroid hormone. Still, a small percentage of the patients (10%-20%) exhibit residual symptoms, despite having normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. These symptoms include cognitive, mood, and metabolic deficits, with a significant impairment in psychological well-being and quality of life.

Objective

To provide a summary of progress in the approach of patients with hypothyroidism that exhibit residual symptoms despite treatment.

Methods

We reviewed the current literature and here we focused on the mechanisms leading to a deficiency of T3 in some LT4-treated patients, the role of residual thyroid tissue and the rationale for combination therapy with LT4 + liothyronine (LT3).

Results

A score of clinical trials comparing therapy with LT4 versus LT4 + LT3 concluded that both are safe and equally effective (neither is superior); however, these trials failed to recruit a sufficiently large number of patients with residual symptoms. New clinical trials that considered LT4-treated symptomatic patients revealed that such patients benefit from and prefer therapy containing LT4 + LT3; desiccated thyroid extract has also been used with similar results. A practical approach to patients with residual symptoms and on initiation of combination therapy with LT4 + LT3 is provided.

Conclusion

A recent joint statement of the American, British, and European Thyroid Associations recommends that a trial with combination therapy be offered to patients with hypothyroidism that do not fully benefit from therapy with LT4.

### Stable TSH can Be rechecked in two years (...) [^393c69bf]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question How much do seemingly stable thyroid tests vary over time. Bottom Line Most patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy with less than 125 mcg of levothyroxine per day can wait two years before monitoring thyroid-stimulating hormone levels if their results are normal. Fewer than one in 10 patients who take less than 125 mcg of levothyroxine per day with a normal TSH level will have an abnormal laboratory value one year later. The likelihood goes up to 26. 7% if the dosage is higher than 125 mcg of levothyroxine per day. Patients with TSH levels closer to the upper or lower limits of normal will also be slightly more likely to have an abnormal value in one year. . Synopsis These authors identified 715 patients in a single primary care practice who were treated for hypothyroidism and had a normal TSH value.

They recorded all subsequent TSH levels in these patients for the following six years. Age, sex, body mass index, and history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis were not associated with the development of a subsequent abnormal TSH level, but the dosage of levothyroxine was associated. Approximately one in four patients taking more than 125 mcg of levothyroxine per day had an abnormal TSH level one year later. Most of the patients taking lower dosages had normal TSH levels one year later.

### Study protocol ; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^17825f2f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The primary and secondary outcomes at 12 months will also be analysed in the following subgroups by adding the subgroup variable and its interaction with treatment group:
Sex (Male/Female)
Baseline TSH ○ <10 / ≥10 ○ <7 / 7–9.99 / ≥10

In addition, continuous interactions with age at randomisation and baseline TSH will be analysed analogously.

Study outcome analyses will be repeated on the per protocol population as exploratory analyses.

Patient safety and adverse event recording

We have taken particular care in devising a titration algorithm to avoid any possibility of prolonged periods of thyroid hormone over replacement in those allocated to levothyroxine. This should substantially reduce the risks of adverse effects such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac failure. In epidemiological studies these problems are observed in association with biochemical hyperthyroidism and not with TSH within the reference range. Similarly for those allocated to placebo we have developed an algorithm that is designed to detect those who develop overt hypothyroidism are require to start open-label levothyroxine. These measures are designed to ensure safety of those who are randomised into the trial.

Within ThyPRO we are assessing the domain of hyperthyroid symptoms as a possible adverse effect (recorded at baseline, 6–8 weeks, 12 months and final visit).

Adverse events (AEs) are recorded, notified, assessed, reported, analysed and managed in accordance with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). Certain potential adverse events are anticipated or likely as a result of the study and study population. The adverse events detailed below are likely to occur in the context of over replacement of levothyroxine. Our dose titration scheme and study processes of careful monitoring of thyroid function tests are designed to ensure we avoid prolonged periods of thyroid hormone excess.

Full details of all AEs of special interest (new atrial fibrillation, heart failure, fractures, new diagnosis of osteoporosis) including the nature of the event, relationship to study drug and outcome are recorded in the electronic case report form. AEs of special interest are monitored and followed up until satisfactory resolution or stabilization.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Euthyrox) [^5a6df355]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty Are Complete

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of EUTHYROX is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of EUTHYROX may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of EUTHYROX dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 (L-thyroxine) level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate EUTHYROX dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with SYNTHROID [see Contraindications (4)] .

5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control

Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing SYNTHROID [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement

Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of levothyroxine over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of SYNTHROID that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate this risk.

7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics

Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to SYNTHROID (Tables 5 to 8).

7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy

Addition of SYNTHROID therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when thyroid therapy is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] .

7.3 Oral Anticoagulants

SYNTHROID increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the SYNTHROID dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments.

7.4 Digitalis Glycosides

SYNTHROID may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may decrease when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides.

7.5 Antidepressant Therapy

Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and SYNTHROID may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. SYNTHROID may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on SYNTHROID may result in increased SYNTHROID requirements.

7.6 Ketamine

Concurrent use of ketamine and SYNTHROID may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients.

7.7 Sympathomimetics

Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and SYNTHROID may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease.

7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors

Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^4e552c61]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism—levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients’ symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^318324c9]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism—biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^34ead0d9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction—population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is “No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence).” Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels <10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or <0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^b2bf2570]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^bac3eadf]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General

The goal of treatment in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is to achieve and maintain normal intellectual and physical growth and development.

The initial dose of levothyroxine varies with age and body weight (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table 3). Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, it is recommended that levothyroxine administration be discontinued for a 30-day trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Serum T4and TSH levels should then be obtained. If the T4is low and the TSH high, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is established, and levothyroxine therapy should be reinstituted. If the T4and TSH levels are normal, euthyroidism may be assumed and, therefore, the hypothyroidism can be considered to have been transient. In this instance, however, the physician should carefully monitor the child and repeat the thyroid function tests if any signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism develop. In this setting, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion of relapse. If the results of the levothyroxine withdrawal test are inconclusive, careful follow-up and subsequent testing will be necessary.

Since some more severely affected children may become clinically hypothyroid when treatment is discontinued for 30 days, an alternate approach is to reduce the replacement dose of levothyroxine by half during the 30-day trial period. If, after 30 days, the serum TSH is elevated above 20mU/L, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is confirmed, and full replacement therapy should be resumed. However, if the serum TSH has not risen to greater than 20mU/L, levothyroxine treatment should be discontinued for another 30-day trial period followed by repeat serum T4and TSH testing.

The presence of concomitant medical conditions should be considered in certain clinical circumstances and, if present, appropriately treated (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^3739e1af]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Implications of findings

Our findings may have important implications for research and clinical practice. The finding that long term outcomes remain similar across a wide range of “normal” TSH concentrations supports flexibility in the levothyroxine dosing schemes to preserve TSH within the normal range. Extrapolating, this is also supportive of the not uncommonly overlooked importance of an individual’s set point in thyroid homoeostasis, as opposed to the laboratory reference.Related to the above, the local, tissue level activation or inactivation of thyroid hormones by deiodination (D2 and D3 deiodinases, which are critical determinants of the cytoplasmic triiodothyronine pool) may provide the individual with the necessary buffering capacity to control the activation of thyroid receptors at the tissue level according to the individual’s needs, provided that this buffering capacity is not overwhelmed by high or low hormone concentrations. From a clinical perspective, this study provides strong support for the current recommendations on the clinical management of hypothyroid patients and validates with hard evidence the latest American Thyroid Association and British Thyroid Association guidelines.

Conclusions

Using repeated measures of TSH concentration over time in a well balanced and highly powered study population, we observed no clinically meaningful difference in the pattern of long term health outcomes, including all cause mortality, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, atrial fibrillation, all fractures, and fragility fractures, in patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism when TSH concentrations lie within normal limits. However, targets for individual patients should be considered in line with their clinical needs.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (maintenance dosing), ETA 2025 guidelines recommend to adjust the dose of levothyroxine in patients with primary hypothyroidism to aim for a serum TSH level within the population reference interval. Once the target TSH is achieved, avoid complicated regimens and minute adjustments of levothyroxine dose for improving QoL or modulating body weight, as they are not useful.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^cc6ebde5]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least 2 months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0-10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

Hospitalized but not critically ill patients starting or increasing levothyroxine—therapeutic goal: The therapeutic goal of levothyroxine replacement in non-critically ill patients is long-term normalization of serum thyrotropin when steady-state thyroid hormone levels are achieved, and levothyroxine should not be titrated to serum free thyroxine levels unless serum thyrotropin cannot be relied upon. Strong recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Combined therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine in two ratios, compared with levothyroxine monotherapy in primary hypothyroidism: a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial [^e2377670]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Controversy remains about the value of combined treatment with levothyroxine (LT4) and liothyronine (LT3), compared with LT4 alone in primary hypothyroidism. We compared combined treatment with LT4 and LT3 in a ratio of 5:1 or 10:1 with LT4 monotherapy. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in 141 patients (18-70 yr old) with primary autoimmune hypothyroidism, recruited via general practitioners. Inclusion criteria included: LT4 treatment for 6 months or more, a stable dose for 6 wk or more, and serum TSH levels between 0.11 and 4.0 microU/ml (mU/liter). Randomization groups were: 1) continuation of LT4 (n = 48); 2) LT4/LT3, ratio 10:1 (n = 46); and 3) LT4/LT3, ratio 5:1 (n = 47). Subjective preference of study medication after 15 wk, compared with usual LT4, was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included scores on questionnaires on mood, fatigue, psychological symptoms, and a substantial set of neurocognitive tests. Study medication was preferred to usual treatment by 29.2, 41.3, and 52.2% in the LT4, 10:1 ratio, and 5:1 ratio groups, respectively (chi2 test for trend, P = 0.024). This linear trend was not substantiated by results on any of the secondary outcome measures: scores on questionnaires and neurocognitive tests consistently ameliorated, but the amelioration was not different among the treatment groups. Median end point serum TSH was 0.64 microU/ml (mU/liter), 0.35 microU/ml (mU/liter), and 0.07 microU/ml (mU/liter), respectively [ANOVA on ln(TSH) for linear trend, P < 0.01]. Mean body weight change was +0.1, -0.5, and -1.7 kg, respectively (ANOVA for trend, P = 0.01). Decrease in weight, but not decrease in serum TSH was correlated with increased satisfaction with study medication. Of the patients who preferred combined LT4/LT3 therapy, 44% had serum TSH less than 0.11 microU/ml (mU/liter). Patients preferred combined LT4/LT3 therapy to usual LT4 therapy, but changes in mood, fatigue, well-being, and neurocognitive functions could not satisfactorily explain why the primary outcome was in favor of LT4/LT3 combination therapy. Decrease in body weight was associated with satisfaction with study medication.

### When to begin treatment in patients with elevated TSH (...) [^7d4099d8]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

to the editor: I read with interest your article, “Treatment of Hypothyroidism. ” 1 I found the article informative, but I do have one disagreement. Dr. Hueston’s discussion of “subclinical hypothyroidism” suggests that patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels between 6 and 10 may not progress to overt hypothyroidism and do not necessarily need to be treated. The author recommends an “individualized” approach and gives several parameters to aid in decision-making. One important factor is missing from this discussion: the lipid panel. Patients with “mild thyroid failure” usually have dyslipidemia, which may be improved with thyroid hormone replacement. Indeed, mild hypothyroidism is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. I had the benefit of serving on two expert panels on this illness.

However, lead investigators have convinced me that all patients with an elevated TSH level should be treated unless a contraindication is present. Improvement in several health parameters are often observed in patients who receive treatment, including improved well-being, improved lipid panel, and modest weight loss. These patients are often overweight and lose weight much easier when their TSH is normal. In summary, I consider patients with an elevated TSH level as having hypothyroidism, and patients with normal free thyroxine level as having mild thyroid failure, which is a real condition. Why should physicians wait to treat these patients until they, if ever, progress to worse disease. Early treatment is beneficial, especially considering the lipid profile that results from an elevated TSH level. Letters to the Editor in reply: I appreciate Dr. Scherger’s comments regarding my article.

1 on hypothyroidism in AFP. The issue of small elevations of thyroid-stimulating hormone with normal thyroxine levels is still controversial. While it is recognized that hypothyroidism is clearly associated with elevations in cholesterol, 2 there are no population-based data showing that persons with subclinical hypothyroidism are more likely to have higher cholesterol levels.

Hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine (LT4)—serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels relative to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization are described as follows: Patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine to achieve normal serum TSH values may have serum triiodothyronine concentrations that are at the lower end of the reference range, or even below the reference range, and the clinical significance of this is unknown. LT4 is an effective, convenient, and cost-effective treatment for hypothyroidism. The evidence base includes at least eight studies examining serum T3 levels in humans being treated with LT4, although only two were prospective. In cross-sectional comparisons, despite similar TSH values, LT4-treated patients had significantly lower T3 concentrations than controls.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism—dose adjustment and monitoring: Dose adjustments are guided by serum TSH determinations 4–8 weeks following initiation of therapy, dosage adjustments, or change in the L‑thyroxine preparation. While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

### Levothyroxine: conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^3ee58e22]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Combined Therapy of T4 and T3

Although the predominant treatment of thyroxine supplementation is LT4 monotherapy, 10% to 15% of patients have persistent or recurrent hypothyroid symptoms (weight gain, fatigue, memory loss, etc.) despite normal TH levels and medical adhesion. This phenomenon is assumed to be attributed to a low level of circulating T3, which plays a superior role to T4 in the feedback of the hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid axis. A previous study showed a 10% to 20% reduction in serum T3 levels in ∼1.8 thousand LT4-treated hypothyroid patients compared with the healthy population. Similar phenomena were also observed in thyroidectomized rats, which reached euthyroidism only after normalization of serum T3 levels.

Based on the theory above, clinicians have returned to combined therapy of T4 plus T3 to eliminate hypothyroid symptoms, with strict indications. Clinicians supported that only hypothyroid patients treated with a stable dose of LT4 for at least 6 months, who had experienced persistent symptoms and had a normal serum TSH level, should receive T4 plus T3 combination therapy. However, those with associated comorbidities (eg, autoimmune diseases and psychological dysfunctions) or unrealistic expectations should not receive combination therapy. The dose ratio of T3 to T4 in combination therapy is a controversial area. Ratios ranging from 1:3 to 1:17 have been reported in several articles. Considering that the physiological ratio of T3:T4 secreted by the thyroid gland is approximately 1:14 and the residual thyroid has secretory function, a ratio between 1:8 and 1:13 may be more appropriate. Animal-derived DTE has also been introduced to treat refractory hypothyroidism due to combinations of T3 and T4 in a 1:4.22 ratio. Animal-derived DTE contains a supraphysiological amount of T3, and cardiac complications should be monitored with caution.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) released from the hypothalamus stimulates secretion of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone, TSH, from the anterior pituitary. TSH, in turn, is the physiologic stimulus for the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones, L-thyroxine (T4) and L-triiodothyronine (T3), by the thyroid gland. Circulating serum T3and T4levels exert a feedback effect on both TRH and TSH secretion. When serum T3and T4levels increase, TRH and TSH secretion decrease. When thyroid hormone levels decrease, TRH and TSH secretion increase.

The mechanisms by which thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions are not completely understood, but it is thought that their principal effects are exerted through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. T3and T4diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins.

Thyroid hormones regulate multiple metabolic processes and play an essential role in normal growth and development, and normal maturation of the central nervous system and bone. The metabolic actions of thyroid hormones include augmentation of cellular respiration and thermogenesis, as well as metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. The protein anabolic effects of thyroid hormones are essential to normal growth and development.

The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4by deiodination in peripheral tissues.

Levothyroxine, at doses individualized according to patient response, is effective as replacement or supplemental therapy in hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis.

Levothyroxine is also effective in the suppression of pituitary TSH secretion in the treatment or prevention of various types of euthyroid goiters, including thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multinodular goiter and, as adjunctive therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE, PRECAUTIONS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

The authors propose that the first assessment following initial therapy should occur within 3 months after resection, with an example that a patient at high risk of recurrence may be treated with a lower dose if the serum Tg is not detectable on a highly sensitive assay (e.g., lower limit of detection 0.1 ng/mL), in the absence of TgAb during levothyroxine (LT4) administration, and if neck ultrasonography does not reveal residual disease after operation; conversely, an elevated Tg level might prompt chest imaging to identify metastases.

In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH >12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Levothyroxine (LT4) bioequivalence—FDA criteria and clinical assessment: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines an LT4 formulation as equivalent if the 90% confidence interval of the difference of the pharmacokinetically derived areas under the curve (AUC) and difference of maximal concentrations (Cmax) of serum T4 fall within 80%–125% of a reference product when a comparable dose is administered to healthy volunteers, and in this analysis the LT4 dose is only tested at a single oral dose of 600 μg. The guideline states this definition is problematic because it does not require assessment of serum TSH and because 600 μg is pharmacologic, and proposes assessing comparable serum T4, T3, and TSH after daily dosing for at least 4–6 weeks in athyroid individuals; simulation studies also support TSH-based protocols for judging bioequivalence rather than pharmacokinetic indices.

American Thyroid Association—congenital hypothyroidism dosing and monitoring use weight-based levothyroxine (LT4) with age-specific needs, definitions of starting doses, treatment targets, and follow-up. Newborn requirements are higher, with “newborns typically requiring 10 μg/kg/d, 1-year-old children 4–6 μg/kg/d, adolescents 2–4 μg/kg/d, with transition to the average adult dose of 1.6 μg/kg/d once endocrine maturation is complete.” In CH, “standard or low-dose therapy is defined by a range of 5–10 μg/kg/d, while high-dose regimens are defined as a range of 10–15 μg/kg/d,” and “Starting doses of 10–15 μg/kg/d have been reported to normalize T4 levels within 2–3 weeks, while doses <8 μg/kg/d result in normalization within 6–8 weeks.” Targets are to “keep the T4 level in the mid to upper half of the reference range and the TSH in the mid to lower half of the reference range, optimally between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L.” For follow-up, “surveillance testing with a TSH and T4 should be performed every 1–2 months during the first year of life,” and “For patients with severe CH, monthly surveillance during the first 6–12 months may be indicated.” For possible transient CH, “For patients with mild CH and no change in the LT4 dose over the first 3 years of life, a trial off LT4 therapy is reasonable,” and permanence is confirmed if on “repeat testing 4–6 weeks after stopping LT4 therapy” the “TSH rises and the T4 decreases.” Formulation and interactions are important: “Within the United States, there are no liquid formulations and there are no compounding processes that produce a stable concentration of LT4 in suspension. Efforts to create suspensions should be avoided,” and “Soy, iron, calcium, and infant colic drops (simethicone) can decrease the absorption of LT4, and concurrent ingestion should be avoided.” In selected cases with persistent TSH elevation despite adequate LT4 levels, “the addition of LT3 may result in normalization of TSH.”

### Use of liothyronine (T3) in hypothyroidism: joint British thyroid association / society for endocrinology consensus statement [^9f82f68e]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Persistent symptoms in patients treated for hypothyroidism are common. Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomised trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focussed on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments. The statement emphasises several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimised aiming for a TSH in the 0.3-2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below reference range (e.g. 0.1-0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term. We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been excluded, a trial of liothyronine/levothyroxine combined therapy may be warranted. The decision to start treatment with liothyronine should be a shared decision between patient and clinician. However, individual clinicians should not feel obliged to start liothyronine or to continue liothyronine medication provided by other health care practitioners or accessed without medical advice, if they judge this not to be in the patient's best interest.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^d4d51eca]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General Principles

The goal of replacement therapy is to achieve and maintain a clinical and biochemical euthyroid state. The goal of suppressive therapy is to inhibit growth and/or function of abnormal thyroid tissue. The dose of LEVOTHROID®that is adequate to achieve these goals depends on a variety of factors including the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions, including pregnancy, concomitant medications, and the specific nature of the condition being treated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Hence, the following recommendations serve only as dosing guidelines. Dosing must be individualized and adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

LEVOTHROID®is administered as a single daily dose, preferably one-half to one hour before breakfast. LEVOTHROID®should be taken at least 4 hours apart from drugs that are known to interfere with its absorption (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Due to the long half-life of levothyroxine, the peak therapeutic effect at a given dose of levothyroxine sodium may not be attained for 4-6 weeks.

Caution should be exercised when administering LEVOTHROID®to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, to the elderly, and to those with concomitant adrenal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS).

Combination therapy for patients unwell on levothyroxine—For patients with primary hypothyroidism who feel unwell on levothyroxine therapy alone (in the absence of an allergy to levothyroxine constituents or an abnormal serum thyrotropin), there is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of a trial of a combination of levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy outside a formal clinical trial or N-of-1 trial, due to uncertainty in long-term risk benefit ratio of the treatment and uncertainty as to the optimal definition of a successful trial to guide clinical decision-making. The guideline rates this as 'Weak recommendation. Moderate quality evidence'. Additional research targeting those with relatively low serum triiodothyronine concentrations, but normal thyrotropin levels during monotherapy is needed to address whether there is a subgroup of patients who might benefit from combination therapy.

### Levothyroxine replacement therapy and overuse: a timely diagnostic approach [^14ab8b44]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Levothyroxine (LT4) is one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide. Once started, approximately 90% of patients continue treatment long term. However, accumulating evidence suggests that many patients, for whom the indication for its administration is not adequately established and the diagnosis is not well documented, are overusing it. This study aimed to evaluate the necessity for and determine potential prognostic factors of long-term LT4 supplementation.

Methods

A prospective clinical cohort follow-up study was carried out. In 291 subjects (84% females) aged 48±16 years on LT4 replacement therapy without a solid diagnosis of hypothyroidism being provided, the treatment was paused. At the beginning and after six to eight weeks of treatment discontinuation, thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine levels were assessed, and thyroid ultrasound was performed. A TSH value of ≥4.5 IU/mL was considered as underlying hypothyroidism.

Results

Among the 291 individuals, 114 became hypothyroid (group A), while 177 subjects remained euthyroid off LT4 (group B; 39.2% vs. 60.8%, p<0.001). The groups were comparable regarding sex, family history, age, body mass index, duration of treatment, basal TSH and free thyroxine values, thyroid volume, and presence of thyroid autoantibodies. However, diffuse inhomogeneous echogenicity on ultrasound examination was significantly higher (p<0.001) in group A.

Conclusions

These findings suggest considerable overuse of thyroxine therapy. The results underline the initial need to establish the diagnosis firmly before treatment initiation and to undertake periodic evaluation of all patients on chronic LT4 treatment as to the necessity for treatment continuation. In all patients on long-term LT4 therapy in whom the diagnosis has not been definitively established, it appears rational to introduce a six- to eight-week period of LT4 replacement therapy discontinuation, preceded and followed by TSH tests, as the first-line approach-a procedure that could be implemented as part of a common strategy among the scientific community to decrease current LT4 overuse.

Thyroid extracts versus levothyroxine in adults with primary hypothyroidism—recommendation: We recommend that levothyroxine be considered as routine care for patients with primary hypothyroidism, in preference to use of thyroid extracts. Although there is preliminary evidence from a short-duration study that some patients may prefer treatment using thyroid extracts, high-quality controlled long-term outcome data are lacking to document superiority of this treatment compared to levothyroxine therapy. Furthermore, there are safety concerns related to the use of thyroid extracts, such as the presence of supraphysiologic serum triiodothyronine levels and a paucity of long-term safety outcome data. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

Introduction

Levothyroxine monotherapy is considered the standard of care for hypothyroidism by professional organizations, whereby the patients achieve the state of euthyroidism through the normalization of TSH, a reliable proxy of euthyroidism. In euthyroid individuals, 80% of T3 (25 µg) is generated from T4 to T3 conversion in kidney and liver cells and 20% (5 µg) is secreted from the thyroid gland. Using levothyroxine (L-T4) alone is expected to be a suitable strategy owing to the peripheral conversion of the pro-hormone T4 into the hormonally active T3 by the deiodinase. Of interest, while this treatment modality is safe, well-tolerated, and extremely effective in normalizing TSH, it may not be sufficient to account for the normal thyroidal secretion of T3 and T4. Approximately 10% lower serum T3 levels in LT4-treated patients compared to euthyroid individuals with similar serum TSH values have been reported previously, leading to the skewed T3:T4 ratio toward an increase of T4, while serum T3 levels are normal to low. The clinical significance of these deviations in thyroid hormones in LT4-treated patients is not clear.

Clinically, a sizable minority of patients adequately treated with LT4 complain of residual symptoms. Higher T4 and lower T3 serum levels reflect a relative imbalance in the thyroid hormone axis homeostasis may be responsible for the persistence of hypothyroid symptoms in some patients. It is unclear to what extent lower serum T3 levels may contribute to the persistent symptoms in hypothyroid patients; however, in an experimental study on thyroidectomized rats with evident tissue hypothyroidism in peripheral cells, tissue euthyroidism occurred only following normalization of serum T3.

The above-mentioned evidence led to the growing interest in combination therapy with LT4 plus liothyronine(LT3); however, multiple randomized controlled clinical trials addressing objective and subjective clinical outcomes did not provide conclusive results. The non-conclusive results, besides heterogeneity in the study population, design, and dosage, may be attributed to the concerns and challenges regarding available oral T3 preparations stemming from the short half-life of T3 with rapid T3 absorption followed by fast metabolization. Despite the lack of definite evidence for the superiority of combination therapy, this strategy remains a common practice in hypothyroid patients who remained dissatisfied with LT4 monotherapy, while the use of LT4 + SR-T3 was suggested.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, the adequacy of replacement therapy should be assessed by measuring both serum TSH (using a sensitive assay) and total- or free-T4.000000000000000e+00During the first three years of life, the serum total- or free-T4should be maintained at all times in the upper half of the normal range. While the aim of therapy is to also normalize the serum TSH level, this is not always possible in a small percentage of patients, particularly in the first few months of therapy. TSH may not normalize due to a resetting of the pituitary-thyroid feedback threshold as a result of in utero hypothyroidism. Failure of the serum T4to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of LEVOTHROID®therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20mU/L within 4 weeks should alert the physician to the possibility that the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Careful inquiry should then be made regarding compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to raising the dose of LEVOTHROID®.

The recommended frequency of monitoring of TSH and total- or free-T4in children is as follows: at 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment; every 1-2 months during the first year of life; every 2-3 months between 1 and 3 years of age; and every 3 to 12 months thereafter until growth is completed. More frequent intervals of monitoring may be necessary if poor compliance is suspected or abnormal values are obtained. It is recommended that TSH and T4levels, and a physical examination, if indicated, be performed 2 weeks after any change in LEVOTHROID®dosage. Routine clinical examination, including assessment of mental and physical growth and development, and bone maturation, should be performed at regular intervals (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Secondary (pituitary) and tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism

Adequacy of therapy should be assessed by measuring serum free-T4levels, which should be maintained in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^1b65e3ea]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Although age specific TSH targets may be considered, especially in the context of high cardiovascular risk,this strategy is based on the findings of studies in euthyroid or subclinically hypothyroid people. However, patients with hypothyroidism need a higher concentration of serum free thyroxine to achieve a normal TSH concentration compared with euthyroid controls.Consequently, a hypothyroid patient receiving thyroid replacement therapy and a euthyroid patient with comparable TSH concentrations are not expected to have comparable circulating free thyroxine concentrations. The same is true of free triiodothyronine concentrations in patients who have had total thyroidectomy.Therefore, any extrapolations on the association between optimal TSH concentrations and cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy based on studies in euthyroid patients should be treated with caution, as serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine concentrations (relevant to cardiovascular physiology) may differ significantly between the two groups.

Moreover, in primary studies in euthyroid or subclinically hypothyroid patients,and in the related meta-analyses and reviews,thyroid function testing was done only at baseline. The potential therefore exists for misclassification bias in all estimates to date as a result of established and anticipated changes in thyroid hormone production over the life course of a patient, as well as instances of transient thyroid dysfunction (such as non-thyroidal illness or following the hyperthyroid phase of a painless thyroiditis). A person classified as euthyroid at baseline might go on to develop hypothyroidism, overt or subclinical, whereas those classified as subclinically hypothyroid might be found to be euthyroid on follow-up thyroid function testing.

Similar limitations affect studies assessing the association between thyroid dysfunction and risk of fracture,and whether variation in TSH concentration within normal limits may significantly affect the skeleton or whether any effect is insignificant in clinical terms (fracture risk remains unaffected) remains unclear. This is further challenged by evidence suggesting that free thyroxine concentrations are the main driver of the above clinical outcomes.

The aim of this study was to explore whether TSH concentration is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, mortality, and fractures in patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. We treated TSH as a time varying covariate to account for variation in TSH concentration over time within individuals.

Pediatric Dosage - Congenital or Acquired Hypothyroidism

The recommended daily dose of EUTHYROX in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 1. Start EUTHYROX at the full daily dose in most pediatric patients. Start at a lower starting dose in newborns (0 to 3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and in children at risk for hyperactivity (see below). Monitor for clinical and laboratory response [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure :

Consider a lower starting dose in newborns at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity:

To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: EUTHYROX dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of EUTHYROX by 12.5 mcg daily to 25 mcg daily and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable EUTHYROX dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce EUTHYROX dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure EUTHYROX dose is appropriate.

New Onset Hypothyroidism: Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. In patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day). In patients with mild hypothyroidism (TSH less than 10 mIU per liter) start EUTHYROX at 1 mcg per kg body weight per day. Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust EUTHYROX dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer

The dose of EUTHYROX should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require a EUTHYROX dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day, depending on the target level for TSH suppression.

### Generic levothyroxine compared with synthroid in young children with congenital hypothyroidism [^2afa8060]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Clinicians who prescribe levothyroxine (LT4) for hypothyroidism often feel strongly about using a brand-name drug instead of a generic.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine whether Synthroid resulted in better control of congenital hypothyroidism than generic LT4.

Design

This was a 5-year retrospective study.

Setting

The study was conducted at 1 tertiary care center.

Patients

Children who were 0-36 months old with congenital hypothyroidism followed up at our center from 2006 to 2011 were treated with either Synthroid exclusively (35 subjects) or generic LT4 exclusively (27 subjects).

Interventions

We recorded the subjects' TSH and free T(4) measurements, how often their LT4 dose was adjusted, and the duration of follow-up.

Main Outcome Measure

TSH variance between the groups was measured. Secondary end points were the frequency of LT4 dose changes and the variance in free T(4).

Results

Using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, there was no difference in TSH SD in the Synthroid group compared with the generic group (median 3.0 vs 2.2, P = .27). Using a linear mixed model, children treated with the generic LT4 had lower TSH estimated SD [1.35 with 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.194, 1.526)] than the Synthroid group [1.66 with 95% CI (1.536, 1.803)]. Similarly, no difference was observed in free T(4) SD between the groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (median 0.29 generic vs 0.36 Synthroid, P = .11), but the generic group had lower free T(4) estimated SD than the Synthroid group using the linear mixed model [0.216 with 95% CI (0.187, 0.249) vs 0.298 with 95% CI (0.273,0.326)]. Frequency of LT4 dosing adjustments was similar between the groups, both in total (median 2.0 for generic vs 3.0 for Synthroid, P = .097) and when adjusted for number of TSH checks (ratio 0.25 generic vs 0.31 Synthroid, P = .45).

Conclusions

In our study of congenital hypothyroidism, generic LT4 treatment resulted in similar or better control of hypothyroidism compared with Synthroid, as assessed by the clinical outcomes of TSH variance and the frequency of LT4 dosing adjustments.

Levothyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations—clinical significance of within‑reference‑range T3 changes: The significance of perturbations in serum triiodothyronine concentrations within the reference range or of mildly low serum triiodothyronine concentrations is unknown. According to the current model, normalizing serum thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH) is generally considered the target of therapy, and serum T3 is typically not measured or monitored, and direct evidence on whether small decrements in plasma T3 have clinically important sequelae is lacking. Some data in humans suggest maintenance of serum T3 concentrations is clinically important; for example, in one study of 15 athyreotic patients taking LT4, a progressive 50% fall in T3 induced by PTU over 8 days led to a doubling of TSH even though T4 was constant.

Hypothyroidism therapy—biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to “normal” generally not an endpoint.

Diagnosis TSH elevation indicates hypothyroidism. Low-end normal TSH is 0. 4 mIU per L. EVALUATING FOR SUSPECTED HYPOTHYROIDISM When signs and symptoms raise the index of suspicion, the clinician should obtain a serum TSH level. If the FT 4 level is normal, further thyroid or pituitary evaluation is unnecessary. If the FT 4 level is low, the clinician should review medications the patient is taking, evaluate the pituitary gland, or consider euthyroid sick syndrome. 18 If the TSH level is high, a serum FT 4 level should be obtained. A low FT 4 level indicates clinical hypothyroidism, specifically autoimmune hypothyroidism if the TPO antibody test result is elevated). Table 1 lists other causes.

Rare other causes include adrenal insufficiency, drugs, post-nonthyroidal illness, or thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. Some patients with a normal TSH level and symptom resolution may become symptomatic again with or without a change in TSH.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^b2c45664]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

All study personnel remain blinded for the duration of the trial through remote analysis of laboratory results of TSH in the data centre, ensuring the trial stays double blinded. GPs will remain blinded to treatment allocation and TSH tests unless otherwise required in the event of an emergency medical situation. An Interactive Voice Response System at the data centre allows for individual emergency allocation information to be released to an unblinded study physician through 24-h telephone access. All participants will learn the treatment allocation within 15 working days of receiving the final visit and completing all the data to aid in any further treatment decisions with the GP.

All laboratory tests for TSH and fT4 are performed at the local GP and clinical laboratories. The results in the treatment phase are uploaded to the independent data centre which in turn advises the study site on dose titration through the dedicated trial web portal. The study team remains unaware of the results of the thyroid function testing. Additionally, all cooperating GPs were asked to refrain from additional thyroid function measurements to ensure adequate blinding.

Pediatric Dosage - Congenital or Acquired Hypothyroidism

The recommended daily dose of LEVOXYL in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 1. Start LEVOXYL at the full daily dose in most pediatric patients. Start at a lower starting dose in newborns (0 to 3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and in children at risk for hyperactivity (see below). Monitor for clinical and laboratory response [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .

Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure :

Consider a lower starting dose in newborns at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity:

To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: LEVOXYL dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of LEVOXYL by 12.5 mcg daily to 25 mcg daily and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable LEVOXYL dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce LEVOXYL dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure LEVOXYL dose is appropriate.

New Onset Hypothyroidism: Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. In patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start LEVOXYL at the full replacement dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day). In patients with mild hypothyroidism (TSH less than 10 mIU per liter) start LEVOXYL at 1 mcg per kg body weight per day. Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust LEVOXYL dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] .

TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer

The dose of LEVOXYL should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require a LEVOXYL dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day, depending on the target level for TSH suppression.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (indications, abnormal TSH), AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend to consider initiating treatment based on individual factors in patients with TSH levels between the upper limit of a given laboratory's reference range and 10 mIU/L, particularly if patients have symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, positive anti-TPO antibodies, or evidence of ASCVD, HF, or associated risk factors for these diseases.

### The impact of levothyroxine on cardiac function in older adults with mild subclinical hypothyroidism: a randomized clinical trial [^9c1db60c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with heart failure, but only small trials assessed whether treatment with levothyroxine has an impact on cardiac function.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial nested within the TRUST trial, Swiss participants ages ≥65 years with subclinical hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] 4.60-19.99 mIU/L; free thyroxine level within reference range) were randomized to levothyroxine (starting dose of 50 µg daily) to achieve TSH normalization or placebo. The primary outcomes were the left ventricular ejection fraction for systolic function and the ratio between mitral peak velocity of early filling to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e' ratio) for diastolic function. Secondary outcomes included e' lateral/septal, left atrial volume index, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure.

Results

A total of 185 participants (mean age 74.1 years, 47% women) underwent echocardiography at the end of the trial. After a median treatment duration of 18.4 months, the mean TSH decreased from 6.35 mIU/L to 3.55 mIU/L with levothyroxine (n = 96), and it remained elevated at 5.29 mIU/L with placebo (n = 89). The adjusted between-group difference was not significant for the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (62.7% vs 62.5%, difference = 0.4%, 95% confidence interval -1.8% to 2.5%, P = 0.72) and the E/e' ratio (10.6 vs 10.1, difference 0.4, 95% confidence interval -0.7 to 1.4, P = 0.47). No differences were found for the secondary diastolic function parameters or for interaction according to sex, baseline TSH, preexisting heart failure, and treatment duration (P value >0.05).

Conclusion

Systolic and diastolic heart function did not differ after treatment with levothyroxine compared with placebo in older adults with mild subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Association of thyrotropin suppression with survival outcomes in patients with intermediate-and high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer [^8342fbc0]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Currently accepted therapy for patients with intermediate- or high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is surgery followed by radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. Radioactive iodine therapy is performed under either endogenous or exogenous stimulation of thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH), aimed at achieving a thyrotropin level exceeding 30 mIU/L.Thyrotropin stimulation leads to overexpression of thyroid differentiation genes such as sodium-iodide symporter, resulting in increased RAI uptake, enhancing the tumoricidal effect. The long-term management of DTC includes levothyroxine therapy aimed not only at appropriate physiologic thyroid hormone replacement in thyroidectomized patients, but also at suppressing thyrotropin release from the pituitary gland by supraphysiologic levothyroxine doses. A recommended thyrotropin suppression goal in patients with locally advanced or metastatic DTC is less than 0.1 mIU/L as some preclinical evidence suggests that thyrotropin is a growth stimulus for DTC cells.
