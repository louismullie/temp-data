## Question

When to repeat hemoglobin after transfusion of red blood cells?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to repeat hemoglobin after red blood cell transfusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, especially whether the patient is actively bleeding or hemodynamically unstable. Then, I should verify the expected hemoglobin increment per unit and how that influences timing. Next, I will review guideline-based recommendations for stable, non-bleeding patients, including the single-unit strategy and when to recheck. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pediatrics, obstetrics, and neurocritical care. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, context-specific recommendation and note exceptions where immediate reassessment is warranted.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because timing hinges on whether there is active bleeding or hemodynamic instability. In actively bleeding patients, waiting for a scheduled hemoglobin check can be unsafe; instead, I should reassess hemoglobin frequently based on clinical trajectory and the rate of blood loss, often every 1–2 hours or sooner if the patient is unstable, and I should not delay resuscitation to wait for a lab result [^881620bb] [^387f2de7].

> Next, I should review the expected hemoglobin rise per unit to anchor timing. In stable adults, one unit of packed RBCs typically increases hemoglobin by about 1 g/dL, with a range of roughly 0.8–1.2 g/dL depending on patient size and starting hemoglobin; this expectation helps me decide when a recheck will be informative, and I should double-check that this applies across common inpatient populations, which it does in postpartum and general medical cohorts [^ad13cd47] [^782b758b].

> For stable, non-bleeding adults, I need to ensure I align with guideline-based practice. Multiple high-quality guidelines converge on a restrictive, single-unit strategy: transfuse one unit, then recheck hemoglobin within about 1–2 hours after completion to confirm the response and decide whether additional units are needed; this approach reduces unnecessary exposure and has been associated with substantial reductions in units transfused without harming outcomes in trials and implementation studies [^f8b14d3f] [^fb977e9b] [^c7dab591].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance for special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, especially in severe anemia, repeat hemoglobin checks at 8, 24, and 48 hours are recommended to capture the nadir and guide retreatment; in postpartum patients, a 4–6 hour check is reasonable to confirm the expected 1 g/dL rise; in neurocritical care, some protocols advise maintaining higher hemoglobin targets and checking after each unit to avoid both under- and over-transfusion; in acute coronary syndromes, thresholds are higher and decisions are more symptom-driven, so earlier reassessment is sensible when ischemia is a concern [^c3dc7233] [^ad13cd47] [^ff531a83] [^8b833548].

> Hold on, I should verify the exceptions where immediate reassessment is warranted even outside scheduled checks. If the patient develops new tachycardia, hypotension, dyspnea, chest pain, or altered mentation, I should recheck hemoglobin promptly because ongoing bleeding or dilutional anemia may be evolving; similarly, after procedural or surgical interventions with expected blood loss, earlier hemoglobin checks are prudent to detect delayed bleeding [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and make sure it is actionable. For stable, non-bleeding adults: transfuse 1 unit, then recheck hemoglobin in 1–2 hours; if the rise is less than expected, reassess for ongoing bleeding, dilution, or lab issues before ordering more units; if the rise is as expected and the patient remains asymptomatic, decide on further transfusion based on the restrictive threshold and clinical context, typically 7 g/dL in most adults, 7.5 g/dL in cardiac surgery, and 8 g/dL in orthopedic surgery or with cardiovascular disease; in active bleeding, reassess hemoglobin frequently based on clinical status rather than fixed intervals [^c7dab591] [^f8b14d3f] [^881620bb].

> But wait, what if the hemoglobin rise is excessive or the patient becomes symptomatic after transfusion? I should double-check for transfusion-associated circulatory overload or a hemolytic reaction, pause further transfusion, and evaluate with exam, vitals, and appropriate labs; this is exactly why the single-unit-with-recheck strategy improves safety and should be the default unless hemorrhage demands otherwise [^171734e7] [^e78692cf].

---

Repeat hemoglobin **1–2 hours after each RBC unit** in stable, non-bleeding patients to confirm the expected 1 g/dL rise and guide further transfusion [^f8b14d3f] [^ad13cd47]. In actively bleeding or hemodynamically unstable patients, **check hemoglobin every 1–2 hours** or as clinically indicated, since rapid changes can occur and delay risks harm [^387f2de7]. For postpartum patients, **recheck at 4–6 hours** to assess response and detect ongoing blood loss [^ad13cd47]. Always interpret results with the clinical context and adjust the frequency based on symptoms, comorbidities, and the rate of bleeding [^7f855552].

---

## General principles for hemoglobin monitoring after transfusion

- **Expected hemoglobin rise**: Each unit of packed RBCs typically raises hemoglobin by about 1 g/dL in adults, though this varies with patient size, baseline hemoglobin, and clinical context [^ad13cd47] [^782b758b].

- **Clinical context**: Timing of hemoglobin checks should be individualized based on the patient's stability, ongoing bleeding, comorbidities, and symptoms [^7f855552].

- **Restrictive strategy**: Use a restrictive transfusion approach, transfusing one unit at a time and reassessing hemoglobin and clinical status before additional units [^f8b14d3f] [^c7dab591].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios and recommended timing

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing for hemoglobin check** |
|-|-|
| Stable, non-bleeding adult patients | 1–2 hours after each transfusion unit [^notfound] |
| Actively bleeding or hemodynamically unstable patients | Every 1–2 hours or as clinically indicated [^notfound] |
| Postpartum patients (non-acute anemia) | 4–6 hours after transfusion [^ad13cd47] |
| Critically ill patients (ICU) | 1–2 hours after each unit, or as clinically indicated [^fb977e9b] |
| Pediatric patients | 8, 24, and 48 hours after transfusion [^c3dc7233] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting current practices

- **Restrictive transfusion strategy**: Multiple RCTs and guidelines support a restrictive strategy (typically 7–8 g/dL) with single-unit transfusions and reassessment, showing no increase in adverse outcomes and reduced transfusion exposure [^c7dab591] [^ed11ded3].

- **Single-unit transfusion**: Transfusing one unit at a time with reassessment reduces unnecessary transfusions and adverse events without compromising outcomes [^f8b14d3f] [^c91d7554].

- **Postpartum anemia**: A 4–6 hour check aligns with observed hemoglobin kinetics and helps detect ongoing blood loss or under-resuscitation [^ad13cd47].

---

## Factors influencing hemoglobin response and timing of checks

Several factors influence the **magnitude and timing** of hemoglobin rise after transfusion:

- **Baseline hemoglobin**: Lower pre-transfusion hemoglobin yields a larger absolute rise per unit [^782b758b].

- **Patient size and volume status**: Larger patients or those with expanded plasma volume may show a smaller hemoglobin increase.

- **Ongoing bleeding**: Continued blood loss can blunt the apparent rise, necessitating more frequent checks [^387f2de7].

- **Transfusion reaction**: Acute reactions can alter expected hemoglobin kinetics, warranting immediate reassessment [^e78692cf].

---

## Clinical judgment and patient-specific considerations

While guidelines provide a framework, **clinical judgment is essential**. Consider more frequent hemoglobin checks in patients with:

- **Active bleeding or hemodynamic instability**: Rapid changes can occur, and delays can be harmful [^387f2de7].

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, renal failure, or respiratory compromise may require closer monitoring [^notfound].

- **Symptoms**: Persistent anemia symptoms despite transfusion may indicate ongoing loss or malabsorption [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Stable, non-bleeding adults**: Check hemoglobin 1–2 hours after each unit [^notfound].

- **Active bleeding or instability**: Check every 1–2 hours or as indicated [^notfound].

- **Postpartum patients**: Recheck at 4–6 hours [^ad13cd47].

- **Pediatric patients**: Check at 8, 24, and 48 hours [^c3dc7233].

- **Always reassess clinically**: Use symptoms, comorbidities, and the clinical context to guide further transfusion decisions [^7f855552].

---

Current practice emphasizes a **restrictive, single-unit transfusion strategy** with timely hemoglobin reassessment to balance efficacy and safety [^f8b14d3f].

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy outcomes in overall critically ill patients — restrictive versus permissive — show pooled effects as follows: ICU mortality had relative risk 1.00 (0.80–1.25) with 0 fewer per 1,000 (46 fewer-57 more); 30-d mortality 0.99 (0.87–1.13) with 1 fewer per 1,000 (14 fewer-14 more); 1-y mortality 0.99 (0.87–1.13) with 4 fewer per 1,000 (54 fewer-54 more); adverse events 0.45 (0.22–0.94) with 8 fewer per 1,000 (11 fewer-1 fewer); secondary infections 1.03 (0.94–1.12) with 3 more per 1,000 (6 fewer-13 more); ICU length of stay 0.12 d higher (0.01 higher-0.23 higher); and hospital length of stay 0.2 d lower (0.51 lower-0.12 higher). In trials evaluating ICU mortality, clinical teams were "encouraged strongly to transfuse one RBC unit at a time and repeat hemoglobin measurements after each unit", and using this approach "the number of RBC units transfused was decreased by 50%".

### Outcomes using lower vs higher hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion [^faa525e9]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is a lower vs higher hemoglobin threshold best for minimizing both red blood cell use and adverse clinical outcomes when used to trigger red blood cell transfusions in anemic patients in critical care and acute care settings?

Bottom Line

Compared with higher hemoglobin thresholds, a hemoglobin threshold of 7 or 8 g/dL is associated with fewer red blood cell units transfused without adverse associations with mortality, cardiac morbidity, functional recovery, or length of hospital stay.

Red blood cell transfusion — practice considerations beyond hemoglobin: Good transfusion practice should rely not only on hemoglobin concentration thresholds but also incorporation of patients' symptoms, signs, comorbid conditions, risk of bleeding, values, and preferences, and given that RCTs demonstrated no effect on mortality, the storage age of transfused RBCs need not be considered in transfusion decisions.

Implementation — For patients reluctant to accept transfusions based on personal values or religious beliefs, "a thorough discussion with the patient or surrogate should occur before deciding to transfuse". When an RBC transfusion is chosen, "the optimal implementation strategy encompasses a restrictive approach and transfusing one RBC unit at a time". This "threshold and single-unit recommendation does not apply to patients actively bleeding at a rate exceeding the ability to transfuse single units or await hemoglobin test results safely", but "can be applied to patients whose acute bleeding has subsided", and "this approach should be suspended and then reapplied after bleeding is controlled (Fig 1)".

Background

The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group.

Main Results

A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 96%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I² = 30%; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high-quality evidence)). High-quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone-marrow disorders.

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30-day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.

AABB 2023 red blood cell transfusion — evidence base and general conclusions: For adults, 45 randomized controlled trials with 20 599 participants compared restrictive hemoglobin-based transfusion thresholds, typically 7 to 8 g/dL, with liberal transfusion thresholds of 9 to 10 g/dL; for pediatric patients, 7 randomized controlled trials with 2730 participants compared a variety of restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds, and for most adult patient populations, results provided moderate certainty evidence that restrictive transfusion thresholds did not adversely affect patient-important outcomes; it is good practice to consider overall clinical context and alternative therapies to transfusion when making transfusion decisions about an individual patient.

Red blood cell transfusion: transfusion thresholds for whom and when?

Allogeneic red cell transfusion is associated with a significant increase in peri‐operative morbidity and mortality 2, 98, 99, 100. In addition, there is a worldwide shortage of blood, with substantial associated costs to the manufacturer and health systems 101. Moreover, red cell transfusion risks infectious, immunological, haemolytic, non‐haemolytic adverse reactions, cardiac and pulmonary complications 2, 98. Despite successful implementation of PBM programmes, red cell transfusion is still widely used as a default treatment for the majority of patients with acute postoperative anaemia 102.

Historically, the standard for red cell transfusion was a liberal transfusion threshold, namely haemoglobin level < 100 g.l −1 (or haematocrit < 30%). This arbitrary transfusion threshold has been gradually lowered towards haemoglobin 70–80 g.l −1, according to data derived from a number of RCTs evaluating the effect on patient outcomes of restrictive vs. more liberal red cell transfusion strategies in a variety of clinical settings. When subjected to pooled analysis in several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (Supporting Information online, Appendix S2) 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, data from these RCTs show that, in terms of morbidity and mortality, a restrictive red cell transfusion strategy is equivalent to or more beneficial than a liberal strategy 101, 109.

In addition, evidence‐based guidelines have translated the results of RCTs and meta‐analyses into clinical practice 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49. One of the most recently published guidelines on red cell transfusion thresholds recommends a restrictive red cell transfusion threshold (haemoglobin < 70 g.l −1) for hospitalised adult patients who are haemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients 49. However, a transfusion threshold of at least 80 g.l −1 is suggested for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, cardiac or oncological surgery, and those with pre‐existing cardiovascular disease 12, 49, 110, 111. Nevertheless, transfusion of red cells for higher haemoglobin levels should be evaluated case by case, considering acute ongoing blood loss, comorbidities and signs of organ ischaemia or symptoms indicative of hypoxia. In any case, published guidelines agree that red cell transfusion is not beneficial when haemoglobin is > 100 g.l −1 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49, 112. Confounding factors on haemoglobin levels have to be considered, as discussed above.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding red blood cell transfusion [^459e95c8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active area of research. Blood is a limited resource, and there are concerns about risks, including transmitted infections. If a liberal transfusion strategy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach should be recognised as the standard of care.

Objectives

The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration to direct transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). Increasingly, investigators are considering other strategies including physiological triggers (i.e. central venous oxygen saturation), alone or in combination with such thresholds, to determine when a transfusion is indicated, so it is important to assess this growing body of evidence in tandem.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Transfusion Evidence Library, Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index, trial registries and PubMed on 14 October 2024. We checked reference lists of published reviews and papers for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children. We excluded studies that focused on preterm neonates. Eligible trials assigned intervention groups based on different transfusion strategies or thresholds, usually defined by a haemoglobin concentration below which a RBC transfusion would be administered. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios across trials using a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group.

Main Results

Adult threshold comparison We included 61 trials (27,639 participants), across a range of clinical contexts: orthopaedic, cardiac or vascular surgery; critical care; neurocritical care; gastrointestinal bleeding; trauma; acute myocardial infarction; haematological malignancies and postpartum haemorrhage. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. The main outcomes were exposure to blood transfusion, 30-day mortality, neurologic function, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebral vascular accident, infection and thromboembolism. Studies were generally at low risk of bias. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 42% when combining all clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.65; high-certainty evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 97%), reflecting diversity in the strength of estimates, not the efficacy of the policy. When combining all clinical contexts, restrictive transfusion strategies did not modify the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 44 studies, 22,575 participants; high-certainty evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed including myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism or infection (moderate to high-certainty evidence). There were two exceptions in clinical populations. In gastrointestinal bleeding, 30-day mortality was lower with a restrictive transfusion strategy (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.95; 4 studies, 1574 participants). In critically ill patients with brain injury, unfavourable neurological outcome at 6 to 12 months was lower with a liberal transfusion strategy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22; 4 studies, 2297 participants) (moderate-certainty evidence). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon, but occurred more frequently with the liberal strategy (Peto odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.62; 18 studies, 11,505 participants). Paediatric threshold comparison We included eight trials (2764 participants), across a limited range of clinical contexts (critical care, cardiac surgery, haematological malignancies and severe malarial anaemia). The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive group in critical care and haematological malignancies trials was between 6.5 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL, and between 7.0 g/dL and 9 g/dL in cardiac surgery trials, depending on the cardiac abnormality and stage of repair. Studies were generally at low risk of bias. There was no clear difference in 30-day mortality between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies, although confidence intervals were wide (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.08; 7 studies, 2571 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was moderate-certainty evidence of no clear difference between threshold strategies for infection; very low-certainty evidence of little to no difference for thrombosis and very low-certainty evidence of little to no difference for the outcomes multiple organ dysfunction and cerebrovascular accident. Physiological triggers Nine trials in adults (3818 participants) and one trial in children (100 participants) were identified. These tested different interventions and measures of physiological parameters in diverse clinical populations. The risk of bias was variable. Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to heterogeneity.

Authors' Conclusions

A restrictive transfusion strategy significantly decreased the proportion of adults and children exposed to RBC transfusion. In most clinical contexts, there was no evidence of harm from a restrictive compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Neurocritically ill patients, however, have better neurological outcomes at 6 to 12 months with a liberal transfusion strategy. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes beyond mortality, and to what degree the optimal strategies for transfusion should be modified in some patient populations, including different types of acute bleeding, cancers and subgroups of patients with myocardial infarction and other neurological injuries. New studies need to recognise the clinical context and the limitations of the adoption of a single threshold of haemoglobin, and to consider evaluating the use of physiological parameters to modify transfusion.

In view of the published literature, anaemia is common in the general population and relevant for patient outcome. In the hospital, acute anaemia is often treated by RBC transfusions, because it has been proven to increase Hb levels in a timely manner. This therapeutic approach, however, usually does not address the underlying disease that triggered anaemia and may carry its own risks that have to be taken into account.

Results

The hemoglobin thresholds prompting RBC transfusion varied across studies, with a restrictive threshold generally defined as a hemoglobin level of 7 to 8 g/dL and a permissive threshold typically ranging from a hemoglobin level of 8.5 to 10 g/dL (Table 1). Hemodynamic instability typically has been defined as hypotension (mean arterial pressure, < 65 mm Hg, or systolic BP, < 100 mm Hg), tissue hypoperfusion caused by acute bleeding, or both.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [^c2d027ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than others because of a lack of testing for viral pathogens. Therefore, reducing the number and volume of transfusions would benefit patients.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials by searching CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), the Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to May 2016), the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to May 2016), and ongoing trial registries (27 May 2016). We also checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials where intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered.

Data Collection and Analysis

We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two people extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as 'restrictive transfusion' and to the higher transfusion threshold as 'liberal transfusion'.

Main Results

A total of 31 trials, involving 12,587 participants, across a range of clinical specialities (e.g. surgery, critical care) met the eligibility criteria. The trial interventions were split fairly equally with regard to the haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group. About half of them used a 7 g/dL threshold, and the other half used a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL to 9 g/dL. The trials were generally at low risk of bias. Some items of methodological quality were unclear, including definitions and blinding for secondary outcomes. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialties (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.65; 12,587 participants, 31 trials; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 97%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16, I² = 37%; N = 10,537; 23 trials; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (high-quality evidence)). Liberal transfusion did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound, or bacteraemia).

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusing at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration of between 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL decreased the proportion of participants exposed to RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialities. There was no evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacts 30-day mortality or morbidity (i.e. mortality at other points, cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. There were insufficient data to inform the safety of transfusion policies in certain clinical subgroups, including acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, neurological injury/traumatic brain injury, acute neurological disorders, stroke, thrombocytopenia, cancer, haematological malignancies, and bone marrow failure. The findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds above 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL.

### Clinical practice guidelines from the AABB: red blood cell transfusion thresholds and storage [^6ceaea25]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More than 100 million units of blood are collected worldwide each year, yet the indication for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and the optimal length of RBC storage prior to transfusion are uncertain.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the target hemoglobin level for RBC transfusion among hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable and the length of time RBCs should be stored prior to transfusion.

Evidence Review

Reference librarians conducted a literature search for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion (1950-May 2016) and RBC storage duration (1948-May 2016) without language restrictions. The results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. For RBC transfusion thresholds, 31 RCTs included 12 587 participants and compared restrictive thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7–8 g/dL) with liberal thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 9–10 g/dL). The summary estimates across trials demonstrated that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds were not associated with higher rates of adverse clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, rebleeding, pneumonia, or thromboembolism. For RBC storage duration, 13 RCTs included 5515 participants randomly allocated to receive fresher blood or standard-issue blood. These RCTs demonstrated that fresher blood did not improve clinical outcomes.

Findings

It is good practice to consider the hemoglobin level, the overall clinical context, patient preferences, and alternative therapies when making transfusion decisions regarding an individual patient. Recommendation 1: a restrictive RBC transfusion threshold in which the transfusion is not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7 g/dL is recommended for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients, rather than when the hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). A restrictive RBC transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL is recommended for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery, and those with preexisting cardiovascular disease (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). The restrictive transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is likely comparable with 8 g/dL, but RCT evidence is not available for all patient categories. These recommendations do not apply to patients with acute coronary syndrome, severe thrombocytopenia (patients treated for hematological or oncological reasons who are at risk of bleeding), and chronic transfusion-dependent anemia (not recommended due to insufficient evidence). Recommendation 2: patients, including neonates, should receive RBC units selected at any point within their licensed dating period (standard issue) rather than limiting patients to transfusion of only fresh (storage length: < 10 days) RBC units (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

Conclusions and Relevance

Research in RBC transfusion medicine has significantly advanced the science in recent years and provides high-quality evidence to inform guidelines. A restrictive transfusion threshold is safe in most clinical settings and the current blood banking practices of using standard-issue blood should be continued.

### Transfusion guidelines: when to transfuse [^65dabbe3]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Transfusion of blood and blood components has been a routine practice for more than half a century. The rationale supporting this practice is that replacement of blood loss should be beneficial for the patient. This assumption has constituted the underpinning of transfusion medicine for many decades. Only over the past 20 years, we have seen a more concerted effort to answer very basic questions regarding the value of transfusion therapy. An assessment of the value of transfusion based on well-designed and appropriately powered randomized, controlled trials is the first step in optimizing transfusion practices. Systematic reviews provide the second step by building the knowledge base necessary to assess the impact of transfusion practice on patient outcomes. The third step is the development of clinical practice guidelines, and this occurs when systematic reviews are interpreted by individuals with expertise in transfusion medicine. Such guidelines are typically supported by professional organizations and/or health authorities. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines can be challenging, especially in an area as heterogeneous as transfusion medicine. However, clinical practice guidelines are necessary for the practice of evidence-based medicine, which optimizes patient care and improves patient outcomes. This review focuses on clinical practice guidelines for transfusion of three blood components: RBCs, platelets and plasma. In addition, we provide the approach used to implement clinical practice guidelines at our own institution.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing mortality in restrictive and liberal haemoglobin thresholds for red cell transfusion: an overview of systematic reviews [^55269acf]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations of systematic reviews and meta-analyses

The quality of RCTs pooled by systematic reviews and meta-analyses are generally appraised through tools designed to assess the risk of bias and the quality of evidence. These tools focus on important elements in the conduct of RCTs such as concealed allocation, blinding, random allocation, selective reporting, statistical inconsistency (or heterogeneity), imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias.

While these domains are important in the general context of reviewing RCTs, we identified key clinical differences in the RCTs comparing transfusion strategies. Some, including variability in the study setting, variability in the patient population, and variability in the timing of the outcome measure, apply to all systematic reviews. Four, however, are unique to this topic: (1) haemoglobin thresholds selected for transfusion, (2) the absolute difference of pre-transfusion haemoglobin concentrations, (3) time to randomisation (resulting in transfusion administered prior to randomisation), and (4) comparable transfusion dosing regimens.

### Red blood cell transfusion: 2023 AABB international guidelines [^1225f45d]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

AABB red blood cell (RBC) transfusion guideline — adult good practice and recommendations: For hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, the international panel recommends a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which the transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Remark: in accordance with the restrictive strategy threshold used in most of the trials for subgroups of patients, clinicians may choose a threshold of 7.5 g/dL for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 8 g/dL for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. For hospitalized adult patients, the panel suggests a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL in those with hematologic and oncologic disorders (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). Good practice considerations state clinicians should consider not only the hemoglobin concentration but also symptoms, signs, other laboratory data, patients' values and preferences, and the overall clinical context, and that clinicians should consider alternatives to transfusion, including medical treatment of anemia and blood conservation strategies; the guideline also notes this practice guideline will not apply to all individual RBC transfusion decisions.

The AABB recommends adhering to a restrictive transfusion strategy in hospitalized, stable patients. The AABB suggests that transfusion decisions be influenced by symptoms as well as hemoglobin concentration.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^c91d7554]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Implementation

For patients reluctant to accept transfusions based on personal values or religious beliefs, a thorough discussion with the patient or surrogate should occur before deciding to transfuse. As soon as an RBC transfusion is decided on, the optimal implementation strategy encompasses a restrictive approach and transfusing one RBC unit at a time. This threshold and single-unit recommendation does not apply to patients actively bleeding at a rate exceeding the ability to transfuse single units or await hemoglobin test results safely. The recommendation can be applied to patients whose acute bleeding has subsided. If acute bleeding occurs during a patient's stay, this approach should be suspended and then reapplied after bleeding is controlled (Fig 1).

The panel suggested conducting audits or observational studies using hospital databases to understand current practices. Proven implementation strategies to overcome barriers to changing transfusion include academic detailing, audit-feedback approaches, standard order sets, computerized order entry decision support, reminders, and alerts. These approaches require resources, leadership, and clinical oversight.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guideline on blood product transfusion in burn care [^e84823ae]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Quality and performance measures — The hemoglobin concentration before and after any RBC transfusion administered outside of the OR is measured. Ideally, where adequate resources are available, dynamic VET is considered prior to administration of FFP, PLTs, cryoprecipitate, or factor VII concentrate during the perioperative period. We recognize that this quality measure may not be suitable for all burn centers or under austere conditions. Strategies to minimize volume and frequency of blood draws for diagnostic tests are used to limit anemia from repetitive phlebotomy. While we did not directly form a PICO question about this strategy to lessen blood loss and hence, RBC transfusion, we believe that an overarching theme in this CPG is the use of strategies to limit blood loss and blood product transfusion. A transfusion protocol with standard indications is identified and followed outside of the OR for transfusing RBC to burn patients who are not hemodynamically unstable from acute bleeding. If the transfusion protocol is not followed, a rationale for the deviation should be documented.

### Implications of packed red bloods cells production and transfer on post transfusion hemoglobin increase [^80759aed]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Blood loss resulting in severe anemia is the most common indication for postoperative allogenic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. In high-income countries, the majority of transfusions is received by elderly patients. Preservatives extend the storage of RBCs, though concerns exist about potential harm from transfusing older RBCs. This study tested the hypothesis that RBC storage duration effects hemoglobin increase in patients older than 70 years who underwent non-cardiac surgery.

Method

Observations on surgical cohorts from two study sites of the LIBERAL-Trial were collected. Transfusion events and hemoglobin between 2018 and 2022 assessments in addition to manufacturing and product specific quality review information were evaluated.

Results

A total of 1626 transfusion events in 505 patients were analyzed. A linear mixed effects model was used to estimate the effect size of different predictors on hemoglobin increment upon red blood cell transfusion. No statistically significant effect of the RBC unit storage duration was found. Confounding variables resulting in higher hemoglobin increase included lower hemoglobin values prior to transfusion, the length of Hb measurement intervals before and after transfusion, as well as the method of RBC cell separation in line with different manufacturer hemoglobin values.

Conclusions

The aspired increase in hemoglobin can be achieved with red blood cell concentrates of any storage duration. In general, elderly patients exhibit a sufficient hemoglobin rise following transfusion. However, if this is associated with improved outcomes cannot be answered.

### The bloody mess of red blood cell transfusion [^2c6a5683]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is one of the most iconic intravenous treatments in medicine. In life-threatening conditions of massive blood loss, state-of-the-art RBC transfusion might be the most prominent option to prevent immediate death. Based on this tradition, a healthcare provider treating an anaemic surgical or critically ill patient may consider RBC transfusion as a life-saving treatment. Increasing evidence, however, indicates that RBC transfusion might also induce harm in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, any transfusion decision presupposes not only a thorough consideration of pros and cons, but also a careful assessment of potential alternatives.

### Red blood cell transfusion for hematologic disorders [^73db48c2]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have determined, in surgical and critically ill patients, relatively safe hemoglobin (Hb) thresholds of 7–8 g/dL to guide restrictive transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs). However, in patients with various hematologic disorders, strong evidence in support of such an approach is sparse and the optimal transfusion practice is yet to be defined. This review focuses on RBC transfusion practice in three hematologic diseases and a treatment strategy, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These entities manifest in a broad spectrum of anemia, acute or chronic, in patients with different comorbidities and degrees of transfusion requirement. Thus the nuances in the indications of RBC transfusion and the goals to achieve in these specific situations may have been underappreciated. The limited data available highlight the importance of titrating RBC transfusion based on the clinical context and patient characteristics. Future RCTs are necessary to firmly establish the Hb thresholds associated with improved outcomes relevant to these specific patient populations, which will facilitate the personalized decision-making in RBC transfusion.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine (SMFM) clinical guideline # 8: the fetus at risk for anemia – diagnosis and management [^906a89c4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Fetal anemia — monitoring and timing of repeat intrauterine transfusion (IUT): After a transfusion in an alloimmunized pregnancy, fetal hemoglobin and hematocrit are expected to decline at approximately 0.4 g/dL per day and 1% per day, respectively; using the MCA-PSV can give an accurate assessment of when to resample, with reported detection of severe anemia at 100% sensitivity and a false-positive rate of 6%. Following an initial transfusion, the recommended threshold for diagnosing fetal anemia that requires a second transfusion is higher (MoM > 1.69). If the posttransfusion hematocrit is known or can be estimated, timing of the next transfusion can be calculated using the expected decline in fetal hematocrit, and after a second transfusion the intertransfusion interval should be individualized based on pathology, fetal condition, and posttransfusion hematocrit rather than MCA-PSV thresholds.

### Debate: transfusing to normal haemoglobin levels will not improve outcome [^658c45db]. Critical Care (2001). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that critically ill patients are able to tolerate lower levels of haemoglobin than was previously believed. It is our goal to show that transfusing to a level of 100 g/l does not improve mortality and other clinically important outcomes in a critical care setting. Although many questions remain, many laboratory and clinical studies, including a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), have established that transfusing to normal haemoglobin concentrations does not improve organ failure and mortality in the critically ill patient. In addition, a restrictive transfusion strategy will reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusions, result in more efficient use of red blood cells (RBCs), save blood overall, and decrease health care costs.

Recent progress has been made in the identification and implementation of best transfusion practices on the basis of evidence-based clinical trials, published clinical practice guidelines, and process improvements for blood use and clinical patient outcomes. However, substantial variability persists in transfusion outcomes for patients in some clinical settings — eg, patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. This variability could be the result of insufficient understanding of published guidelines; different recommendations of medical societies, including the specification of a haemoglobin concentration threshold to use as a transfusion trigger; the value of haemoglobin as a surrogate indicator for transfusion benefit, even though only changes in concentration and not absolute red cell mass of haemoglobin can be identified; and disagreement about the validity of the level 1 evidence for clinical practice guidelines. Nevertheless, institutional experience and national databases suggest that a restrictive blood transfusion approach is being increasingly implemented as best practice.

### Red blood cell transfusion in the intensive care unit [^0708140e]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is common among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Despite multiple randomized clinical trials of hemoglobin (Hb) thresholds for transfusion, little is known about how these thresholds are incorporated into current practice.

Objective

To evaluate and describe ICU RBC transfusion practices worldwide.

Design, Setting, and Participants

International, prospective, cohort study that involved 3643 adult patients from 233 ICUs in 30 countries on 6 continents from March 2019 to October 2022 with data collection in prespecified weeks.

Exposure

ICU stay.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the occurrence of RBC transfusion during ICU stay. Additional outcomes included the indication(s) for RBC transfusion (consisting of clinical reasons and physiological triggers), the stated Hb threshold and actual measured Hb values before and after an RBC transfusion, and the number of units transfused.

Results

Among 3908 potentially eligible patients, 3643 were included across 233 ICUs (median of 11 patients per ICU [IQR, 5–20]) in 30 countries on 6 continents. Among the participants, the mean (SD) age was 61 (16) years, 62% were male (2267/3643), and the median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 3.2 (IQR, 1.5–6.0). A total of 894 patients (25%) received 1 or more RBC transfusions during their ICU stay, with a median total of 2 units per patient (IQR, 1–4). The proportion of patients who received a transfusion ranged from 0% to 100% across centers, from 0% to 80% across countries, and from 19% to 45% across continents. Among the patients who received a transfusion, a total of 1727 RBC transfusions were administered, wherein the most common clinical indications were low Hb value (n = 1412 [81.8%]; mean [SD] lowest Hb before transfusion, 7.4 [1.2] g/dL), active bleeding (n = 479; 27.7%), and hemodynamic instability (n = 406 [23.5%]). Among the events with a stated physiological trigger, the most frequently stated triggers were hypotension (n = 728 [42.2%]), tachycardia (n = 474 [27.4%]), and increased lactate levels (n = 308 [17.8%]). The median lowest Hb level on days with an RBC transfusion ranged from 5.2 g/dL to 13.1 g/dL across centers, from 5.3 g/dL to 9.1 g/dL across countries, and from 7.2 g/dL to 8.7 g/dL across continents. Approximately 84% of ICUs administered transfusions to patients at a median Hb level greater than 7 g/dL.

Conclusions and Relevance

RBC transfusion was common in patients admitted to ICUs worldwide between 2019 and 2022, with high variability across centers in transfusion practices.

Chronic anemia and transfusion thresholds — commentary highlights conservative triggers and individualized assessment. The threshold for transfusion in chronic anemia in the absence of symptoms is approximately 7 g/dL, prior clinical practice used higher Hb goals when Hb concentration targets were greater than 10.0 or 11.0 g/dL, and a careful within-patient assessment of symptoms before and after transfusion may be the best strategy to determine a patient-specific threshold until better evidence is available.

### Restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy for red blood cell transfusion: systematic review of randomised trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^3f74c52d]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Our systematic review was conducted according to the protocol previously published in the PROSPERO register. The methodology and reporting were based on recommendations from the Cochrane Collaborationand the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement, and evaluated according to the GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation) guidelines.

Eligibility criteria

We considered prospective randomised controlled trials to be eligible for inclusion if red blood cell transfusions were administered on the basis of a clear transfusion "trigger" or "threshold", defined as a specific haemoglobin or haematocrit level. Comparator group patients were required to be either transfused at higher haemoglobin or haematocrit levels than the intervention group or transfused in accordance with current transfusion practices. We considered for inclusion trials that included surgical or medical patients and adults or children, but excluded trials conducted on neonates and children with low birth weight.

All randomised controlled trials were eligible irrespective of language, blinding, publication status or date, or sample size. We excluded quasirandomised trials for assessment of benefit but considered them for inclusion for assessment of harm.

Search strategy

We identified relevant randomised controlled trials through an up to date systematic search strategy used in a published Cochrane review; in the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, SilverPlatter Medline (1950 to October 2014), SilverPlatter Embase (1980 to October 2014), and Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to October 2014). To identify any planned, unreported, or ongoing trials we contacted the main authors of included trials and experts in this discipline. We reviewed the references of included trials to identify additional trials. Moreover, we identified ongoing clinical trials and unpublished trials through Current Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and(see supplementary appendix 1 for detailed information on the search strategy).

Trial selection

Authors (LB, MWP, and NH) independently reviewed all titles and abstracts identified through the systematic search. They excluded trials that did not fulfil the eligibility criteria and evaluated the remaining trials in full text. Disagreements were resolved with JW.

### Red blood cell transfusion: 2023 AABB international guidelines [^8a909739]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Red blood cell transfusion is a common medical intervention with benefits and harms.

Objective

To provide recommendations for use of red blood cell transfusion in adults and children.

Evidence Review

Standards for trustworthy guidelines were followed, including using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methods, managing conflicts of interest, and making values and preferences explicit. Evidence from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials was reviewed.

Findings

For adults, 45 randomized controlled trials with 20 599 participants compared restrictive hemoglobin-based transfusion thresholds, typically 7 to 8 g/dL, with liberal transfusion thresholds of 9 to 10 g/dL. For pediatric patients, 7 randomized controlled trials with 2730 participants compared a variety of restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds. For most patient populations, results provided moderate quality evidence that restrictive transfusion thresholds did not adversely affect patient-important outcomes. Recommendation 1: for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, the international panel recommends a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). In accordance with the restrictive strategy threshold used in most trials, clinicians may choose a threshold of 7.5 g/dL for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 8 g/dL for those undergoing orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Recommendation 2: for hospitalized adult patients with hematologic and oncologic disorders, the panel suggests a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (conditional recommendations, low certainty evidence). Recommendation 3: for critically ill children and those at risk of critical illness who are hemodynamically stable and without a hemoglobinopathy, cyanotic cardiac condition, or severe hypoxemia, the international panel recommends a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Recommendation 4: for hemodynamically stable children with congenital heart disease, the international panel suggests a transfusion threshold that is based on the cardiac abnormality and stage of surgical repair: 7 g/dL (biventricular repair), 9 g/dL (single-ventricle palliation), or 7 to 9 g/dL (uncorrected congenital heart disease) (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).

Conclusions and Relevance

It is good practice to consider overall clinical context and alternative therapies to transfusion when making transfusion decisions about an individual patient.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [^4b8ebafb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Most clinical practice guidelines recommend restrictive red cell transfusion practices, with the goal of minimising exposure to allogeneic blood. The purpose of this review is to compare clinical outcomes in patients randomised to restrictive versus liberal transfusion thresholds (triggers).

Objectives

To examine the evidence for the effect of transfusion thresholds on the use of allogeneic and/or autologous red cell transfusion, and the evidence for any effect on clinical outcomes.

Search Methods

We identified trials by searching; The Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched 01 Feb 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 2011, issue 1 (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid) 1948 to January Week 3 2011, EMBASE (Ovid) 1980 to 2011 (Week 04), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (1970 to Feb 2011), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (1990 to Feb 2011). We checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials in which patients were randomised to an intervention group or to a control group. Trials were included where intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Risk ratios of requiring allogeneic blood transfusion, transfused blood volumes and other clinical outcomes were pooled across trials, using a random effects model. Data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias was performed by two people.

Main Results

Nineteen trials involving a total of 6264 patients were identified, and were similar enough that the results could be combined. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 39% (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.72). This equates to an average absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 34% (95% CI 24% to 45%). The volume of RBCs transfused was reduced on average by 1.19 units (95% CI 0.53 to 1.85 units). However, heterogeneity between trials was statistically significant (P < 0.00001; I(2) ≥ 93%) for these outcomes. Restrictive transfusion strategies did not appear to impact the rate of adverse events compared to liberal transfusion strategies (i.e. mortality, cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia and thromboembolism). Restrictive transfusion strategies were associated with a statistically significant reduction in hospital mortality (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62–0.95) but not 30 day mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.03). The use of restrictive transfusion strategies did not reduce functional recovery, hospital or intensive care length of stay. The majority of patients randomised were included in good quality trials, but some items of methodological quality were unclear. There are no trials in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

Authors' Conclusions

The existing evidence supports the use of restrictive transfusion triggers in most patients including those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. As there are no trials, the effects of restrictive transfusion triggers in high risk groups such as acute coronary syndrome need to be tested in further large clinical trials. In countries with inadequate screening of donor blood, the data may constitute a stronger basis for avoiding transfusion with allogeneic red cells.

### Transfusion management of severe anaemia in African children: a consensus algorithm [^c3dc7233]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

In children requiring additional transfusions: what triggered re-transfusion events and when were they given?

In the TRACT trial, of those receiving immediate transfusion, 3188/3196 (99%) received one, and 496/3196 (15.5%) received a second transfusion, 300 (19%) in the 20 ml/kg group and 196 (12%) in the 30 ml/kg group, an absolute difference of 6% (95% CI 4–9%, P < 0.0001) greater in the 20 ml/kg strategy. Overall, re-transfusions were due to falls in Hb to < 40 g/l in 185 (37%) children, and occurred more frequently in the 20 ml/kg group (42% vs. 30% in 30 ml/kg group) (Table II), or it was felt that clinically stable children with SCD or haemoglobinuria with Hb between 40 and 60 g/l needed it corrected to > 60 g/l (n = 206, 42%). The number for which an Hb < 40 g/l prompted the second transfusion supports our recommendation in the algorithm for repeat Hb measurements at 8, 24 and 48 h among children who have been transfused, as well as those being monitored before a possible transfusion. These three additional measurements capture the large proportion of repeat transfusions, as very few received an additional transfusion for new clinical signs of severity after admission (2%) or when Hb was > 60 g/l (Fig 1). With regard to the timing of additional transfusions, they occurred earlier and at a higher rate in those randomised to 20 ml/kg. Approximately 5% of children in this group received a transfusion by 24 h and 9–10% by 48 h, compared to under half this rate at both time points in the 30 ml/kg arm (Fig 4B). Although it was the second most common reason for a second transfusion, SCD status (known or unknown) was not a risk factor for poor outcome, this group was not segregated in the algorithm for repeat transfusion.

Sickle cell disease — acute management of suspected stroke in children emphasizes urgent imaging and transfusion parameters: Children with SCD presenting with focal neurological deficits or first-time seizure should prompt a neurological consult and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and if an acute infarct is present, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV) should be considered; to avoid undertreatment, simple blood transfusion therapy should occur within several hours of presentation and as soon as possible even before MRI if the hemoglobin is < 10 g/dL, but hemoglobin should not be increased to > 11 g/dL, with an expected rise of ≈2.5 to 3.0 g for every 10 cm3/kg transfused and a check within 2 hours to avoid hyperviscosity; if baseline hemoglobin is > 10 g/dL, an initial exchange transfusion should decrease hemoglobin to < 10 g/dL, and after a simple transfusion within a 5-hour window an exchange transfusion is recommended to lower hemoglobin S to ≤ 15%; there is no absolute threshold for withholding exchange after stroke or transient ischemic attack, and if diffusion-weighted MRI is negative, repeating MRI ≈2 to 4 weeks after presentation should be considered.

### Packed red blood cell transfusion causes greater hemoglobin rise at a lower starting hemoglobin in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage [^782b758b]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Each unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) is expected to raise circulating hemoglobin (HGB) by approximately 1 g/dL. There are few data on modifiers of this relationship other than gender and body mass index (BMI).

Methods

We recorded HGB before and after PRBC transfusion in a retrospective cohort of 103 patients and a prospective cohort of 93 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

Results

In the retrospective cohort, 48 of 103 patients were transfused, and in the prospective cohort, 56 of 93 patients were transfused. In both groups, lower pre-transfusion HGB was associated with a larger increase in HGB (P < 0.001) after correction for the number of units of PRBCs given. In the prospective cohort, lower pre-transfusion HGB was associated with a greater rise in HGB (P < 0.001) after correction for number of units of PRBCs given, gender, and BMI in repeated measures analysis. Pre-transfusion HGB explained an additional 12% of variance in the data (P < 0.001). In both cohorts, the magnitude of the effect was similar.

Conclusion

In patients with SAH, transfusion at lower HGB leads to a greater increase in HGB. Transfusion at lower HGB may be relatively more cost-effective, and this should be balanced against any potential benefit from higher HGB in SAH. One rather than 2 units of PRBCs are likely to be sufficient for most HGB targets after SAH, especially in patients with more severe anemia.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing mortality in restrictive and liberal haemoglobin thresholds for red cell transfusion: an overview of systematic reviews [^4caeba42]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Haemoglobin concentration

Almost all reviews reported the pooled difference in planned intervention haemoglobin thresholds for restrictive and liberal groups. This difference ranged from 0 to 30 g/L among restrictive groups, with one study only pooling trials with restrictive thresholds below 70 g/L and three studies pooling trials with restrictive thresholds ranging from 70 to 100 g/L. The difference in thresholds in the liberal groups ranged from 10 to 53 g/L, with four studies pooling trials with liberal thresholds ranging from 90 to 100 g/L and one study pooling trials ranging from 80 to 133 g/L (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Range in restrictive and liberal haemoglobin thresholds pooled by systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Size of the markers represents number of trials

Only one review described the actual difference in mean haemoglobin thresholds between groups. This review reported the result from one trial with a planned difference in haemoglobin thresholds of 20 g/L, with a threshold of below 80 g/L for the restrictive group and below 100 g/L for liberal. The actual mean difference in haemoglobin level before transfusion in this trial was smaller, with a 13 g/L higher mean difference in the liberal group.

Transfusion dosing regimens

There was a lack of clarity around transfusion dosing regimens pooled between trials. Three reviews described the different planned post-transfusion haemoglobin targets or planned units of blood to be transfused, according to the trial protocols. The criteria for and amount transfused differed between trials and within trials.

Timing of randomisation

The timing of randomisation varied between individual trials, with some interventions commencing on admission, some intraoperatively, some after surgery, and others during a portion of a patient's hospital stay; however, this information was reported only in four reviews.

### Red blood cell transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB* [^aee4c10d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Although approximately 85 million units of red blood cells (RBCs) are transfused annually worldwide, transfusion practices vary widely. The AABB (formerly, the American Association of Blood Banks) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations about hemoglobin concentration thresholds and other clinical variables that trigger RBC transfusions in hemodynamically stable adults and children.

Methods

These guidelines are based on a systematic review of randomized clinical trials evaluating transfusion thresholds. We performed a literature search from 1950 to February 2011 with no language restrictions. We examined the proportion of patients who received any RBC transfusion and the number of RBC units transfused to describe the effect of restrictive transfusion strategies on RBC use. To determine the clinical consequences of restrictive transfusion strategies, we examined overall mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiac events, pulmonary edema, stroke, thromboembolism, renal failure, infection, hemorrhage, mental confusion, functional recovery, and length of hospital stay. RECOMMENDATION 1: The AABB recommends adhering to a restrictive transfusion strategy (7 to 8 g/dL) in hospitalized, stable patients (Grade: strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: The AABB suggests adhering to a restrictive strategy in hospitalized patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and considering transfusion for patients with symptoms or a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL or less (Grade: weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: The AABB cannot recommend for or against a liberal or restrictive transfusion threshold for hospitalized, hemodynamically stable patients with the acute coronary syndrome (Grade: uncertain recommendation; very low-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 4: The AABB suggests that transfusion decisions be influenced by symptoms as well as hemoglobin concentration (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

The objectives are as follows: To summarize the evidence in Cochrane reviews of the effectiveness and safety of red cell transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treatment or prevention of complications experienced by people with SCD.

---

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing mortality in restrictive and liberal haemoglobin thresholds for red cell transfusion: an overview of systematic reviews [^f0f36f8e]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This overview of reviews evaluating the effect on mortality of restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies identified 19 systematic reviews and 33 meta-analyses that used data from 53 RCTs. Of the 33 meta-analyses, one was graded as high quality, 15 were moderate, and 17 were low. The 16 meta-analyses of mortality graded as high to moderate quality demonstrate no difference in mortality between these two transfusion strategies.

Australian guidelines state that red cell transfusion should not be dictated solely by haemoglobin concentration; rather, the decision should also be based on a patient's clinical signs and symptoms, the availability of other therapies for the treatment of anaemia, and the presence of risk factors for haemorrhage. Similarly, the AABB Clinical Practice Guidelines highlight it is a good practice to individualise transfusion decisions taking into account the overall clinical context, haemoglobin decline, symptoms, volume status, patient preferences, and alternative therapies. Therefore, important questions for future research include examining whether haemoglobin concentration is a good indicator of tissue oxygen needs and looking at other physiological parameters to assess whether these would be more indicative of tissue oxygenation and perfusion.

Should future systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing transfusion thresholds be updated, we recommend they address the variations between studies in haemoglobin thresholds selected for transfusion, the gap in haemoglobin thresholds between restrictive and liberal groups both planned and actual, the different timing of randomisation, and the lack of comparable transfusion dosing regimens.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^171734e7]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults — background and epidemiology: In the United States, approximately 25% of critically ill patients receive RBC transfusions, totaling approximately 1.8 million units annually. The primary indication is low hemoglobin (80%), whereas less frequently encountered indications include active bleeding (27%) and hemodynamic instability (23%). Since the publication of the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial, > 30 trials have examined RBC transfusion strategies in a variety of clinical settings. Despite this evidence, significant variability exists in clinical practice regarding the indications for RBC transfusions, with most occurring in patients with hemoglobin levels of > 7 g/dL. Although RBC transfusions can be life-saving, they carry significant risks of adverse effects, including transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, and immunomodulating effects that may increase the risk of nosocomial infections. These side-effects may be severe and even life-threatening. The entire process, from distribution to administration of RBCs, incurs substantial costs, which vary globally.

### Don't routinely transfuse patients with sickle cell disease for chronic… [^01ee8405]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with sickle cell disease are especially vulnerable to potential harms from unnecessary red blood cell transfusion. In particular, they experience an increased risk of alloimmunization to minor blood group antigens and a high risk of iron overload from repeated transfusions. Patients with the most severe genotypes of sickle cell disease with baseline hemoglobin values in the 7 to 10 g/dL range can usually tolerate further temporary reductions in Hb without developing symptoms of anemia. Many patients with sickle cell disease receive intravenous fluids to improve hydration when hospitalized for management of pain crisis, which may contribute to a decrease in hemoglobin by 1 to 2 g/dL. Routine administration of red blood cells in this setting should be avoided. Moreover, there is no evidence that transfusion reduces pain due to vaso-occlusive crises.

For a discussion of when transfusion is indicated in sickle cell disease, readers are referred to recent evidence-based guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

### Hemoglobin change after red blood cell transfusion for postpartum anemia: secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled trial [^ad13cd47]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to describe hemoglobin (Hb) change after transfusion in the nonacute postpartum anemic population in order to provide clinicians with appropriate expectations regarding Hb rise posttransfusion.

Study Design

We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing initial transfusion with 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) to 2 units pRBCs for postpartum women requiring nonacute transfusion (n = 66). Inclusion criteria were: age 18 years and older, Hb level either < 7g/dL or > 7g/dL with signs or symptoms of anemia, and > 6hours postpartum without contraindication to transfusion. Hb assessment was performed 4 to 6hours after initial transfusion. Hb change (ΔHb) was calculated as posttransfusion Hb minus randomization Hb. Our primary goal was to describe mean ΔHb per pRBC transfused at the 4- to 6-hour posttransfusion blood count. We also compared ΔHb per pRBC transfused by number of units transfused, body mass index (BMI), and symptoms (dizziness and/or fatigue) at time of posttransfusion assessment.

Results

Participants were mean age 29, mean BMI of 27, and over 70% self-identified as black, 12% identified as white, and 9% as Asian race. Mean Hb prior to transfusion was 6.9 ± 0.6g/dL. Mean ΔHb per pRBC transfused was 0.9 ± 0.4g/dL. There was no difference in ΔHb per pRBC by BMI category (normal weight < 25kg/m 2: 1.1 ± 0.2g/dL; overweight 25–29.9kg/m 2: 0.9 ± 0.5g/dL; obese ≥ 30kg/m 2: 0.9 ± 0.5g/dL; p = 0.12). Finally, there was also no significant difference in ΔHb per pRBC by whether or not symptoms of anemia persisted after initial transfusion (1.0 ± 0.7 vs. 0.9 ± 0.4g/dL, p = 0.39).

Conclusion

Our data supports the classically accepted rise in Hb after pRBC of approximately 1g/dL, regardless of BMI category or anemia symptomatology. The study population includes patients at highest risk of postpartum anemia. The results of our study provide important information for clinicians caring for postpartum patients with nonacute anemia.

Key Points

· Postpartum anemia is a significant public health issue. · Providers use hemoglobin change to assess response to blood transfusion. · The established 1g/dL change in Hb after transfusion is based on historic surgical populations. · Our data suggests the 1g/dL Hb change is applicable to postpartum patients.

However, there appears to be a catch-22 situation reflected by the facts that preoperative anaemia represents an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality, and that RBC transfusion might also contribute to adverse clinical outcomes. This dilemma is further complicated by the difficulty to define the "best" transfusion trigger and strategy. Since one size does obviously not fit all, a personalised approach is merited. Attempts should thus be made to critically reflect on the pros and cons of RBC transfusion in each individual patient. Patient blood management concepts including preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative optimisation strategies involving the intensive care unit are warranted and are likely to provide benefits for the patients and the healthcare system. In this context, it is important to consider that "simply" increasing the haemoglobin content, and in proportion oxygen delivery, may not necessarily contribute to a better outcome but potentially the contrary in the long term. The difficulty lies in identification of the patients who might eventually profit from RBC transfusion and to determine in whom a transfusion might be withheld without inducing harm. More robust clinical data providing long-term outcome data are needed to better understand in which patients RBC transfusion might be life-saving vs life-limiting.

### Transfusion management of severe anaemia in African children: a consensus algorithm [^07ad2453]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Consensus blood transfusion algorithm

Following discussion of all of the above, the meeting participants endorsed the proposed paediatric blood transfusion algorithm based on the evidence provided by the TRACT (Fig 2). The key elements start with triage of a child with suspected severe anaemia, incorporating an assessment of severity (to determine the need for a transfusion), with further management guided initially by an assessment of Hb (or haematocrit if Hb is not possible) and fever status at the time a blood transfusion is ordered from the blood transfusion service, in order to determine whether to request a higher volume of blood (30 ml/kg WB or 15 ml/kg RCC), or standard volume (20 ml/kg WB or 10 ml/kg RCC) if fever is present. Informed by the main time points when first (for children with uncomplicated anaemia) or repeat transfusions occurred, our proposed algorithm also incorporates a minimal number of additional measurements of Hb (or haematocrit) and clinical monitoring.

### Allogeneic red blood cell transfusions: efficacy, risks, alternatives and indications [^004333e8]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Careful assessment of risks and benefits has to precede each decision on allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Currently, a number of key issues in transfusion medicine are highly controversial, most importantly the influence of different transfusion thresholds on clinical outcome. The aim of this article is to review current evidence on blood transfusions, to highlight 'hot topics' with respect to efficacy, outcome and risks, and to provide the reader with transfusion guidelines. In addition, a brief synopsis of transfusion alternatives will be given. Based on up-to-date information of current evidence, together with clinical knowledge and experience, the physician will be able to make transfusion decisions that bear the lowest risk for the patient.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing intraoperative red blood cell transfusion strategies [^6ada223a]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are commonly administered in the perioperative setting. In the United States alone, 11 million units of RBCs are administered annually, of which over one quarter are given to surgical patients. By international estimates, surgical services account for 24%–44% of transfused RBC units among inpatients. Although the need for transfusion is variable, its incidence in the perioperative period can be as high as 50% in procedures associated with a high risk of bleeding. –

Although potentially lifesaving, RBC transfusions are not benign interventions. Risks include transfusion-associated acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, hemolytic reactions, bacterial contamination, viral transmission, alloimmunization, and a risk of mistransfusion due to human error.RBC transfusion may also lead to transfusion-related immunomodulation, which may be associated with worse oncologic outcomes in surgical patients. Finally, blood products are a limited and expensive, costing up to 761 US dollars per RBC unit in surgical patients.

There is evidence in the literature of significant variation in transfusion practice in patients undergoing surgery, both in the intraoperative and postoperative settings. Risk-adjusted variation in RBC transfusion has been identified prominently in cardiac surgeryand in major noncardiac surgery.– Although a certain degree of variation is expected based on casemix, wide variation that cannot be explained by disease severity or patient preference likely reflects unwarranted variation in clinical care. – A critical examination of factors contributing to this variation is warranted.

Recommendations guiding the administration of RBCs during surgery exist in the literature. – Guidance pertaining to intraoperative transfusion management is generally limited and endorses the use of restrictive transfusion thresholds. However, this endorsement generally relies on evidence from clinical trials conducted in the postoperative and nonoperative settings. The generalizability of these recommendations to patients undergoing a surgical procedure under general anesthesia is limited for several reasons. First, despite a majority of anesthesiologists identifying hemoglobin concentration as the most important factor when deciding on an intraoperative transfusion, it may be less relevant to guide RBC transfusion in the setting of active or rapid blood loss, particularly given the significant variation in hemoglobin concentration with volume of administered crystalloid or colloid fluids. Second, hemodynamic variations in surgical patients are not necessarily reflective of anemia from surgical bleeding, and may result from other factors such as pharmacologic anesthetic agents, patient positioning, mechanical ventilation, neuraxial analgesia, surgical manipulation, and abdominal insufflation. A comprehensive synthesis of randomized trials comparing intraoperative transfusion strategies does not exist, and is thus timely and necessary.
