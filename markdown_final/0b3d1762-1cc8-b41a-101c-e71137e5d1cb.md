## Question

What are the indications for surgery in hydrocele in adults? how much fluid in asymptomatic cases warrants surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for surgery in adult hydrocele and whether there is a specific fluid volume threshold in asymptomatic cases that warrants surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether adult hydroceles behave differently from pediatric cases. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about indications for surgery. Next, I will examine whether any studies define a fluid-volume threshold for intervention. After that, I should consider special scenarios like filarial hydrocele and post-varicocelectomy hydrocele. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and note exceptions where earlier surgery might be appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Adult hydroceles are typically acquired, idiopathic, and often non-communicating, which means they rarely resolve spontaneously and are managed differently from pediatric hydroceles, where observation is common because many resolve without surgery.

> Wait, let me verify the core indications for surgery in adults. The clearest indications are symptoms such as discomfort, pain, cosmetic concern, or interference with activities of daily living, and these are consistently cited in reviews and contemporary series as the primary reasons to intervene, with surgery being the definitive treatment when symptoms are present [^117WhXq7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about asymptomatic disease. I should confirm whether any authoritative source sets a fluid-volume threshold for asymptomatic hydroceles. I need to check the provided references carefully, and I do not find any guideline or study that specifies a milliliter cutoff mandating surgery in asymptomatic adults; instead, management is individualized based on patient preference, rate of growth, and rare concerns about testicular compromise from mass effect or diagnostic uncertainty [^1138yjxp].

> Let me consider special scenarios. In lymphatic filariasis, large, chronic hydroceles can cause substantial disability and stigma, and public health analyses support hydrocelectomy as cost-effective morbidity management even when not acutely symptomatic, but again, this is framed around quality-of-life and functional burden rather than a strict volume threshold [^115nCDfM] [^112sjQyj]. In post-varicocelectomy hydroceles, some series suggest that aspirated volumes under about 50 mL may predict spontaneous resolution with aspiration alone, but that is a different clinical context and should not be extrapolated to primary idiopathic adult hydroceles [^115oGuhC].

> I should double-check the role of ultrasound. Imaging helps confirm the diagnosis, exclude hernia or testicular pathology, and document size, but it does not, by itself, dictate surgery in asymptomatic adults; there is no validated volume-based surgical trigger in the literature provided, reinforcing that decisions remain symptom- and patient-preference–driven rather than volume-based [^1175KwpV].

> But wait, what if the hydrocele is very large or growing rapidly? Could that justify surgery even without pain? Large, tense hydroceles may rarely impair testicular perfusion or complicate examination, and in such exceptional cases, surgery can be reasonable after discussing risks, benefits, and alternatives, yet this remains a clinical judgment call rather than a standardized volume rule [^114CB4wZ].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For asymptomatic adults, observation with reassurance and periodic review is appropriate; surgery is not mandated by size alone. If the patient desires intervention for cosmetic reasons, recurrent swelling, or anxiety, or if there is diagnostic uncertainty or concern for underlying pathology, then hydrocelectomy is reasonable after shared decision-making that includes discussing recurrence, infection, hematoma, and chronic pain risks, which occur in a minority of cases [^114CB4wZ].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. There is no established fluid-volume threshold in asymptomatic adult hydroceles that obligates surgery; indications are symptom-driven or based on patient preference, growth dynamics, or rare diagnostic or testicular concerns, and management should be individualized rather than anchored to a milliliter cutoff [^114CB4wZ].

---

Surgery for adult hydrocele is indicated for **symptomatic cases** (discomfort, pain, cosmetic concerns, or interference with daily activities) [^114CB4wZ] or when there is **suspicion of underlying pathology** (e.g. tumor, hernia, or infection) [^114CB4wZ]. There is **no absolute fluid volume threshold** for asymptomatic hydroceles; surgery is not routinely recommended solely based on size. Asymptomatic hydroceles are managed conservatively, with surgery considered only if the patient prefers intervention, the hydrocele is very large or rapidly growing, or there is diagnostic uncertainty. Minimally invasive options like aspiration and sclerotherapy are alternatives for patients who decline surgery or are high risk, but recurrence is higher than with surgery [^117WhXq7] [^115mCdzE].

## Indications for surgical intervention

### Symptomatic hydroceles

Symptomatic hydroceles causing **discomfort, pain, cosmetic concerns, or interference with daily activities** are clear indications for surgical intervention [^notfound]. Common symptoms include:

- **Scrotal heaviness or discomfort**: Especially when standing or walking for prolonged periods.

- **Cosmetic deformity**: Significant scrotal enlargement causing psychological distress or embarrassment.

- **Interference with daily activities**: Difficulty with clothing, exercise, or sexual activity.

---

### Suspicion of underlying pathology

Surgical exploration is indicated when there is suspicion of **underlying pathology**, such as:

- **Testicular tumor**: Non-palpable testis or irregularities on examination or ultrasound [^111Zu1Vh].

- **Inguinal hernia**: Fluctuating size or reducibility suggesting a communicating hydrocele [^111Zu1Vh].

- **Infection**: Persistent swelling with signs of infection or inflammation [^notfound].

---

### Failure of conservative management

Persistent hydroceles that do not resolve spontaneously or with conservative measures (e.g. aspiration, sclerotherapy) may require **surgical intervention** [^notfound].

---

## Fluid volume considerations in asymptomatic cases

There is **no established absolute fluid volume threshold** that mandates surgical intervention in asymptomatic adult hydroceles. Management is individualized based on patient preference, clinical judgment, and the following factors:

- **Patient preference**: Some patients may prefer surgical intervention for cosmetic reasons or to avoid repeated aspirations.

- **Rate of growth**: Rapidly enlarging hydroceles may warrant surgical consideration even if asymptomatic.

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Large hydroceles may obscure examination of the testis, necessitating surgical exploration to exclude underlying pathology [^111Zu1Vh].

---

## Alternative minimally invasive treatments

For patients who decline surgery or are high risk, **aspiration with sclerotherapy** is a minimally invasive alternative [^117WhXq7]. However, recurrence rates are higher than with surgical hydrocelectomy, and repeated procedures may be necessary [^117WhXq7] [^115mCdzE].

## Summary of indications for surgery

| **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic hydrocele | - Discomfort <br/> - Pain <br/> - Cosmetic concerns <br/> - Interference with daily activities |
| Suspicion of underlying pathology | - Testicular tumor <br/> - Inguinal hernia <br/> - Infection |
| Failure of conservative management | Persistent hydrocele despite aspiration or sclerotherapy |
| Patient preference | Cosmetic reasons or avoidance of repeated aspirations |

---

Surgery for adult hydrocele is indicated for **symptomatic cases** or when there is suspicion of underlying pathology. There is **no absolute fluid volume threshold** for asymptomatic cases, and management should be individualized based on patient preference, clinical judgment, and the rate of growth or diagnostic uncertainty. Minimally invasive options like aspiration and sclerotherapy are alternatives for patients who decline surgery or are high risk, but recurrence rates are higher than with surgery [^117WhXq7] [^115mCdzE].

### Use of aspiration as an intervention for filarial hydrocele… [^114L1tJj]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

Plain English summary of protocol Background and study aims Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease caused by microscopic, thread-like worms. It is ranked by the World Health Organization as the second leading cause of disability in the world. A significant proportion of the public health problem represented by LF is due to illness. and disability not only related to lymphedema but also to hydrocele. It is estimated that 40 million people are living with chronic forms of disease, of whom estimated 25 million men are affected by. hydrocele. Disease manifestations such as urogenital disorders are known to be the cause of social stigma, physical deformation, loss of self-confidence, problems with sexual activities, lower chances for employment and loss of work due to frequent attacks of fever, pain and adenolymphangitis.

For advanced stages of hydroceles, the only option is hydrocelectomy. However, due to the lack of capacity in in-country health centres and cost restrictions, this is an uncommon practice in rural areas. A small study showed that ultrasound-guided aspiration resulted in long-term improvement of hydrocele in patients with the stages 2 and 3. However, in that particular study. a control group without intervention was missing. This study aims to compare patients who will receive ultrasound-guided aspiration as intervention to those who will be observed without intervention. The control group will receive ultrasound-guided aspiration at the end of the study in case this method proves to be effective. Showing the effectiveness of hydrocele aspiration in this pilot study will be followed by the next.

step, which will be a confirmatory study with the aim of establishing the procedure as standard treatment for LF-infected patients presenting with early hydrocele stages. Who can participate. Healthy men aged 18–55 years with simple hydrocele determined by ultrasound. Hydrocele ultrasound stages 2–4 will be included, however, participants with stage 4 should not have fluid. volume more than 500 mL as determined by ultrasound. What does the study involve. Participants are randomly allocated to the intervention group or the control group. Ultrasound- guided aspiration of hydrocele fluid at study onset will be conducted for the intervention group, while the control group will receive no intervention. The participants will be followed for 2 days Prospectively registered Protocol Statistical analysis plan Results Individual participant data Record updated in last year.

for adverse events, after which visits will be conducted at 6, 12 and 18 months after the intervention. During the visits, ultrasound will be conducted for both the intervention and control groups. What are the possible risks and benefits of participating. The benefits of participation may include one or more of the following: improvement of. hydrocele size and/or stage, improvement in general health, and free medical treatment for common illnesses during the treatment period and at follow-up time points. Risks to the participants are associated with the possible bruising due to the blood sampling and risk of bleeding or infection due to the aspiration.

This article summarizes and updates a number of issues related to hydrocele including anatomy, embryology, classification, etiology, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and management. Hydrocele is an abnormal collection of serous fluid between the parietal and visceral layers arising from the mesothelial lining of the tunica vaginalis that surrounds the testis and spermatic cord directly. Hydroceles result from an imbalance of secretion and reabsorption of fluid from the tunica vaginalis. Hydroceles can be divided into two types as primary and secondary. The diagnosis should be based on medical history, clinical manifestations, and imaging studies. Understanding the causes and types of hydroceles is useful for accurately diagnosing and treatment strategy. Hydroceles can be managed by conservative treatment, fluid aspiration, or hydrocelectomy.

### Management of hydrocele in adolescent patients [^111Zu1Vh]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Hydrocele is defined as an abnormal collection of serous fluid in the potential space between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis. In the majority of affected adolescents, hydrocele is acquired and is idiopathic in origin. The pathogenesis of idiopathic hydrocele is thought to be an imbalance in the normal process of fluid production and reabsorption. The diagnosis is usually clinical. Taking a thorough history is essential to rule out any fluctuation in size, which is an indication of a patent processus vaginalis. Scrotal ultrasonography is mandatory in nonpalpable testicles to rule out a subtending testicular solid mass requiring inguinal exploration. Otherwise, open hydrocelectomy via a scrotal incision is the standard treatment of idiopathic hydroceles. The second most common cause of hydrocele in adolescents is varicocelectomy. The risk of hydrocele formation is higher with non-artery-sparing procedures or those performed without microsurgical aid, and in surgery requiring cord dissection. If hydrocele occurs after varicocelectomy, initial management should include observation with or without hydrocele aspiration. Large persistent hydroceles are best served by open hydrocelectomy.

### Surgery for hydrocele in children-an avoidable excess? [^111RiZDs]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is little consensus over the optimal timing of ligation of a patent processus vaginalis (PPV) in boys with hydrocele. We hypothesized that a proportion of procedures may be unnecessary because they are performed at an age before which the PPV may be expected to close spontaneously. Such excess may expose the child to unnecessary surgery and have significant cost implications.

Methods

A systematic literature review relating to timing of PPV ligation and a population-based study to define number of PPV ligations performed annually in England and age at surgery were conducted.

Results

Most hydroceles resolve before 2 years of age, but their natural history beyond this age is poorly documented. Current guidelines recommend PPV ligation at 2 years of age. An average of 2878 operations for hydrocele is performed per year in children in England. Commonest age at repair is 2 years. There are no randomized controlled trials comparing PPV ligation with an observational nonoperative approach.

Conclusions

The natural history of hydrocele is poorly documented beyond the age of 2 years. There is no good evidence to support current practice. Delaying surgery may reduce the number of procedures necessary without increasing morbidity. A prospective study to investigate this is warranted.

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele: a systematic review [^111TvMqN]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is an uncommon condition characterized by a fluid-filled mass with inguinoscrotal and abdominal components. Controversy exists regarding the best management. We conducted a systematic review of the literature with special interest in presentation, management and outcomes.

Methods

A search was conducted of the MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science and Scopus databases. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in each study.

Results

We found 18 case series that met selection criteria, describing 116 patients with 146 hydroceles. Unilateral ASH was found in 59% of cases with almost even distribution between left and right-sided hydroceles. Ipsilateral undescended testicle, testicular dysmorphism, and contralateral pathology (inguinal hernia) often accompanied ASH. Management was always surgical. The most common approaches were inguinal (67.2%), combined laparoscopic + inguinal (11.2%), and scrotal (10.3%). Complications were poorly reported, but were generally minor. There were a decreased number of complications with the scrotal approach because of avoidance of a difficult inguinal dissection.

Conclusions

ASH is a rare entity treated most commonly via an inguinal approach. However, consideration should be given to combining with an extraperitoneal or laparoscopic approach given coexisting pathology, or to the scrotal approach for reducing morbidity.

Effectiveness of Hydrocele Surgery

Hydrocelectomy is a surgical procedure that drains excess intrascrotal fluid (ie, hydrocele) and inverts or removes the tunica vaginalis (the tissue that produces this fluid) to prevent hydrocele from recurring.

For men living with a hydrocele, the surgery ensures they are able to return to their daily activities, continue to contribute to the prosperity of their family and community, and resume a normal life. We performed an economic evaluation of a hydrocelectomy to give an indication of its cost-effectiveness and how sensitive the estimates are to a range of different assumptions and parameters (outlined in Supplementary Table S6).

The number of DALYs averted from a hydrocelectomy was derived from the assumed average age at surgery, the average life expectancy in LF endemic areas, and the relevant LF DALY weight (Supplementary Table S6). Based on data provided by Kiddoo et al, a typical hydrocelectomy was assumed to have a success rate of 87% (with the remaining 13% either failing to reverse the condition or resulting in the patient having severe adverse outcomes). We assumed that a successful hydrocelectomy alleviates 90% of the morbidity associated with living with hydrocele (Supplementary Table S6). A 1-month lag between the time of surgery and any post-surgical health benefit was assumed and varied in the sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Table S6).

Costs of Hydrocele Surgery

A hydrocelectomy is not very expensive, with reported costs ranging from $80 to $360. However, no comprehensive costing studies have been published. Due to this lack of data, we considered a wide range of costs and investigated the conditions under which hydrocelectomy would be classed as cost-effective in a low income country. It should also be noted that patients can incur additional costs for a hydrocelectomy. Based on the research of Ahorlu et al, we assumed that a hydrocelectomy would cost an average patient $37 in transportation and lost wages (outlined in Supplementary Table S7).

### Aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocoelectomy for treating hydrocoeles [^117WhXq7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrocoeles are common cystic scrotal abnormalities, described as a fluid-filled collection between the visceral and parietal layers of the tunica vaginalis of the scrotum. There are two approaches for treatment of hydrocoeles: surgical open hydrocoelectomy and aspiration followed by sclerotherapy.

Objectives

We compared the benefits and harms of aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocoelectomy for the management of hydrocoeles.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 2 August 2014 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocoelectomy for the management of hydrocoeles.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies. Random effects meta-analyses were performed using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We found four small studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies enrolled 275 patients with 282 hydroceles. Participants were randomised to aspiration and sclerotherapy (155 patients with 159 hydroceles) and surgery (120 patients with 123 hydroceles). All studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias and selective reporting bias. Blinding was not possible for participants and investigators based on the type of interventions. Blinding for statisticians was not reported in any of included studies. There were no significant difference in clinical cure between the two groups (3 studies, 215 participants: RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.10), however there was significant heterogeneity (I² = 95%). On further investigation one study contributed all of the heterogeneity. This could be due to the agent used or perhaps due to the fact that this is a much older study than the other two studies included in this analysis. When this study was removed from the analysis the heterogeneity was 0% and the result was significant (in favour of surgery) (2 studies, 136 participants: RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85). There was a significant increase in recurrence in those who received sclerotherapy compared with surgery (3 studies, 196 participants: RR 9.37, 95% CI 1.83 to 48.4). One study reported a non-significant decrease in fever in the sclerotherapy group (60 participants: RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.08). There was an increased number of infections in the surgery group however this increase was not statistically significant (4 studies, 275 participants): RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.05; I² = 0%). Three studies reported the frequency of pain in the surgery group was higher than aspiration and sclerotherapy group but because of different measurement tools applied in these studies, we could not pool the results. Radiological cure was not reported in any of the included studies. There was no significant difference in haematoma formation between the two groups (3 studies, 189 participants: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.90; I² = 0%). Only one study reported patient satisfaction at three and six months; there was no significant difference between the two groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Postoperative complications as well as cost and time to work resumption were less in the aspiration and sclerotherapy group; however the recurrence rate was higher. The cure rate in short-term follow-up was similar between the groups, however there is significant uncertainty in this result due to the high heterogeneity. There is a great need for further methodologically rigorous RCTs that assess the effectiveness of different type of sclerosant agents, sclerosing solution concentration and injection volume for the treatment of hydrocoeles. It is important that the RCTs have sufficiently large sample size and long follow-up period. Studies should evaluate clinical outcomes such as pain, recurrence, satisfaction, complications and cure using validated instruments. The protocols for all studies should be registered in clinical trial registries and the reports of these studies should conform with international guidelines of trial reporting such as CONSORT. Cost-effectiveness studies should also be undertaken.

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele: a rare cause of a cystic abdominal mass in children [^112G9V8m]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele is a rare cause of cystic lower abdominal masses in children. A timely diagnosis is important because early surgical treatment is curative. Graded compression during the ultrasound evaluation might better demonstrate the communication between the abdominal and scrotal components of the fluid collection, thereby avoiding the use of ionizing radiation and/or the sedation required with alternative imaging modalities.

### Adolescent varicocele: efficacy of indication-to-treat protocol and proposal of a grading system for postoperative hydroceles [^114HaTjj]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Varicocele is a common urologic anomaly in adolescent males; however, evidence-based treatment guidelines do not exist. Hydroceles are known to be a common complication after surgical therapy, with a wide variation in the reported incidence between 1 and 40%.

Aim

This study aimed to introduce a standardized indication-to-treat protocol and prove its efficacy by analyzing the outcome of patients. Secondly, it aimed to better define postoperative hydroceles because the wide variation of reported incidence is attributed to a lack of definition.

Methods

Our standardized treatment protocol included an initial assessment with clinical grading of varicoceles, ultrasound evaluation of testicular volume, and calculation of the atrophy index. Indications for surgical treatment were testicular volume asymmetry > 20%, discomfort and pain, or bilateral varicocele. The Palomo procedure (laparoscopically since 2005) was the standard procedure. Postoperative hydroceles were graded according to clinical findings and symptoms: Grade I, sonographic chance finding without clinical correlate; Grade II, palpable but clinically insignificant; Grade III, symptomatic. All patients treated according to the defined protocol were prospectively monitored between January 2001 and December 2015.

Results

A total of 129 patients with left varicocele were referred to our institution; 70 fulfilled the indication criteria for surgical treatment. Twenty-eight of these patients were treated for volume asymmetry, 26 of these showed catch-up growth. Forty-two patients were treated for discomfort and pain; the symptoms subsided in all of them. Postoperative hydroceles were detected in 36 patients (51%). In 29 patients this was a sonographic chance finding (Grade I). Three patients showed a palpable but clinically insignificant postoperative hydrocele (Grade II) and four patients (5.7%) showed symptomatic hydrocele (Grade III) where treatment was recommended.

Discussion

The treatment protocol allowed judicious indication for surgery and postoperative outcomes similar to previous reports. The high rate of catch-up growth in operated cases represents a proxy for successful treatment in cases where more precise parameters, like semen quality or paternity rate, were not yet detectable. The introduced grading system for postoperative hydroceles provs to be a valid and appropriate instrument, and promises to be a standardized method for comparing outcomes in future studies.

Conclusion

The indication-to-treat protocol proved to be easily applicable, highly efficient, and have outcomes comparable to international literature. The necessity for a standardized grading of postoperative hydroceles was underscored in the data.

### Surgical treatment of perineal lymphatic malformations: a single-center retrospective study of 24 years [^111HLd5c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Table
Patient demographics (n = 192)

Fig 2
Morphological presentation of lymphatic malformations (LMs) at different perineal sites. (A and B) Penile LMs. (C) Scrotal LMs. (D and E) Penoscrotal LMs. (F) Vulvar LMs.

Clinical manifestations encompassed local swelling (19 [100%]), disfigurement (13 [68.4%]), cutaneous masses (10 [52.6%]), and lymphostatic elephantiasis (7 [36.8%]), characterized by chronic lymphatic fluid accumulation, subcutaneous fibrosis, and dermal thickening with verrucous or papillomatous changes. Additional symptoms included pain (4 [21.1%]), skin discoloration (3 [15.8%]), erectile dysfunction (3 [15.8%]), impaired ambulation (3 [15.8%]), skin ulceration (2 [10.5%]), penile developmental abnormalities (2 [10.5%]), hydrocele (2 [10.5%]), and voiding dysfunction (1 [5.3%]). Five patients had a history of prior interventions, including sclerotherapy (n = 3), laser therapy (n = 1), and cryotherapy (n = 1). Across the cohort of 19 patients, none underwent surgery at 0 to 1 year of age, 6 patients at 1 to 6 years, 1 patient at 6 to 12 years, 6 patients at 12 to 18 years, and 6 as adults (> 18 years).

Surgical outcomes and follow-up

The median follow-up period was 12 years (range, 1–24 years). Surgical outcomes are summarized in Supplementary Table I (online only). All 19 patients demonstrated postoperative improvements in both function and appearance. At the 1-year follow-up, tissue morphology and texture in the affected areas had improved significantly, with satisfactory external genital appearance. All patients achieved independent living, normal urination, and normal sexual function, including functional recovery in the three patients with preoperative erectile dysfunction. All skin grafts and flaps healed successfully without local necrosis. The grafts effectively covered surgical defects, and grafted areas showed minimal contraction. In the long term, some grafted areas exhibited decreased elasticity and a woody texture, but no scar contractures leading to functional impairments, such as restricted erection, were observed.

### Percutaneous aspiration for hydroceles after varicocelectomy [^115oGuhC]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the role and efficacy of aspiration alone in the treatment of hydroceles occurring after varicocelectomy. Hydroceles represent one of the most common complications related to varicocelectomy at any age.

Methods

From September 1990 to 2008 at our department, a total of 453 varicocelectomies were performed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were created. The patients with postoperative hydrocele formation were followed up every 3 months. Aspiration was suggested and then performed after 2 consecutive follow-up visits showing an enlarged hydrocele. In compliance with the protocol implemented at our institution, the clinicians performed ≥ 3 aspirations before suggesting surgical treatment.

Results

A total of 256 patients were considered for the present study. All patients underwent laparoscopic varicocelectomy, and 31 (11%) developed postoperative hydrocele. Of the 31 patients, 9 (29%) underwent surgical hydrocelectomy after 3 aspirations, 7 (22.5%) had spontaneous resolution of the hydrocele, and 15 (48.5%) were treated with aspiration only. The success rate of aspiration seemed to be related only to the aspirated fluid volume, with < 50 mL/aspiration guaranteeing spontaneous resolution in 60% of patients (P < .05).

Conclusions

The results of our study have shown that the management of postoperative hydrocele formation should be conservative for almost 18–24 months, with a minimum of 3 aspirations, if necessary. If confirmed by additional studies, the volume of fluid aspirated from hydroceles could be used as an early indicator of the need for surgery.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111fbUBk]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study reported pediatric hydrocele disease with the prevalence of 1 and 3.4 per 1000 cases for infants and children, respectively. Findings can be useful in health policies of societies and accurate statistics lead to the improvement of health standards. The prevalence of pediatric hydrocele can lead to the prevention of acute disease conditions and rapid diagnosis with early treatment.

### Aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocelectomy for treating hydroceles: a systematic review and meta-analyses [^115mCdzE]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to compare the hydrocelectomy versus aspiration and sclerotherapy for treating primary hydrocele.

Methods

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aspiration and sclerotherapy with any type of sclerosants versus hydrocelectomy for primary hydrocele. Studies were identified via a systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Citation tracking of related articles was performed. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two authors. The primary and secondary outcome measures were compared and analyzed using the Review Manager 5.3.5 software.

Results

Five small RCTs were included in the present study. These 5 RCTs included 335 patients with 342 hydroceles, randomized to aspiration and sclerotherapy (185 patients; 189 hydroceles) and surgery (150 patients; 153 hydroceles). There was no significant difference in clinical cure between sclerotherapy and hydrocelectomy (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.10). Meta-analysis revealed a significant increase in recurrence in the sclerotherapy group compared with the surgical group (RR 9.43, 95% CI 1.82 to 48.77). There were no significant differences between the two groups in assessing fever, infection, and hematoma.

Conclusion

Aspiration and sclerotherapy is an efficient technique with a higher recurrent rate; therefore, we recommend aspiration and sclerotherapy for patients at high risk for surgery or avoiding surgery. In addition, included RCTs had low methodological quality, low sample size, and invalidated instruments for outcome assessment. Therefore, there is a great need for further methodologically rigorous RCTs with the registered protocol.

### The treatment of abdominoscrotal hydrocele: is there a role for nonoperative management? [^117DSgQe]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is an uncommon entity. Until now, the recommended treatment has been surgical. There is only one successful case of nonoperative management reported in literature. We report the largest series of children with ASH, and provide evidence in support of an initial nonoperative approach.

Methods

This study is a retrospective chart review of patients treated from 1994 to 2015 with ASH at a single institution.

Results

Thirty patients were identified with ASH, with 29 included in the analysis. Nine patients (30%) had operative management with an 80% complication rate. Twenty out of 29 patients (70%) were initially managed expectantly. Sixteen (80%) had resolution of their abdominal component, twelve (60%) of which went on to have full resolution of ASH. Four patients (20%) in this group required operative management of ASH.

Conclusions

ASH should be included in the differential diagnosis of pediatric scrotal swelling. The "Springing Back Ball Sign" should be used as a screening tool. If it is positive, a dynamic ultrasound should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. We recommend observation as the first step in the management of uncomplicated ASH. It can result in avoidance of operation or at least lower the complication risk significantly if operation is required.

### Infant communicating hydroceles – do they need immediate repair or might some clinically resolve? [^117Ud1c7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Infant hydroceles that are communicating by history (fluctuation in size) or examination (reducible fluid) are often repaired soon after presentation. We have followed a series of infant boys with such hydroceles and reviewed their early natural history.

Materials and Methods

Since 1998, we have followed 174 infant boys presenting with an apparent communicating hydrocele without immediate surgical repair. All boys were initially seen before 18 months of age and most (168) by 12 months. Most had been full term at delivery, although 32 had been premature (< 37 weeks' gestational age) and 11 extremely so (< 32 weeks). Most boys (120) had bilateral hydroceles at presentation.

Results

Of the 110 boys followed to disposition, 69 (62.7%) had complete resolution without surgery by a mean age of 11.7 months. Forty-one patients (37.3%) underwent surgery for correction at a mean age of 14 months because of persistence in size or development of a hernia. Six developed a hernia during observation, none of whom had any episode of incarceration. Only 2 patients with apparent resolution subsequently had recurrence with a hernia. Age at presentation and gestational age at birth showed no effect on resolution. The hydroceles of 64 boys had improved in size after a mean follow-up of 13.9 months when last seen.

Conclusions

Many infant hydroceles that are communicating by history or examination do resolve clinically without surgery and deserve observation. Progression to hernia was rare in our experience and did not result in incarceration. Consequently, little risk is taken by initial observation.

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management [^111VmaKa]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113EWQcy]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

According to this study, it is suggested that neonates with congenital hydrocele should be monitored for spontaneous resolution for at least 18 months before surgical intervention, as no hydrocele-associated complications were observed during follow-up period. In contrast, the study conducted by Imaizumi et al. entitled "The prevalence at birth of congenital malformations at a maternity hospital in Osaka City, 1948–1990" provided a broader epidemiological perspective on congenital malformations, including hydroceles. In this study, no special focus on hydrocele outcomes or management strategies was considered. While this study documented various congenital conditions over several decades, it lacked detailed findings on hydroceles and prevalence rates or resolution outcomes like those reported by Osifo and Osaigbovo.

Totally, while Osifo and Osaigbovo's research offered specific insights into the prevalence and management of hydrocele in a Nigerian context, Imaizumi et al. contributed to a general understanding of congenital malformations without delving deeply into hydrocele specifics. The studies by Lingaji et al. Chu et al. and Nisale provided valuable insights into the prevalence and management of hydrocele and hernia among children, highlighting different aspects of these conditions. Lingaji and Sambhus Dilip reported a prevalence rate of 2.5% for hydroceles among the surveyed school children. Their findings indicated that hydrocele is often associated with inguinal hernias, emphasizing the need for comprehensive screening in pediatric populations.

In contrast, the study by Chu et al. focused on the management of inguinal hernias rather than hydroceles specifically. This research analyzed data from 3,006 cases and found that individualized treatment strategies significantly reduced recurrence rates in adolescents. While this study not directly address hydrocele, it underscored the importance of tailored surgical approaches in managing related conditions, given that hydroceles can occur alongside hernias. Nisale's study reported a prevalence of 1.7% for hydroceles in their cohort study. This study highlighted the significance of early detection and intervention for both hernias and hydroceles to prevent complications and improve outcomes in pediatric patients.

Overall, while Lingaji and Sambhus Dilip emphasized the prevalence of hydrocele in a specific population, Chu et al. provided insights into surgical management strategies for hernias which may also relate to cases involving hydrocele, and Nisale and Warad contributed additional prevalence data supporting the need for vigilant screening in school-aged children.

### Aspiration and sclerotherapy: a minimally invasive treatment for hydroceles and spermatoceles [^1122SVMX]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe our contemporary experience with aspiration and sclerotherapy (AS) as a non-surgical alternative for patients with symptomatic hydrocele and spermatocele who prefer non-surgical treatment.

Materials and Methods

Patients were identified by billing diagnosis code for hydrocele or spermatocele from 2015 to 2019. Patients underwent AS with doxycycline (200–400 mg). Physical examination, ultrasound and aspirate microscopy were used to differentiate hydrocele from spermatocele. Baseline and follow-up data were recorded.

Results

In total, 65 patients underwent AS, 54/65 (83%) for hydrocele and 11/65 (17%) for spermatocele with mean aspirate volumes 307 mL (SD 238 mL) and 138 mL (SD 112 mL), respectively. Follow-up data was available for 38/54 (70%) hydroceles and 8/11 (73%) spermatoceles with median follow-up 28 (IQR 23–41) and 22 (IQR 18.5–30.5) months respectively. Relief of patient reported bother associated with scrotal size occurred in 29/38 (77%) hydroceles and 8/9 (89%) spermatoceles. 2/54 (4%) hydrocele patients developed hematoma managed with in-office aspiration. Immediate post-procedural pain occurred in 2/56 (4%) hydroceles and 2/10 (20%) spermatocele. Post-procedural pain requiring more than 5 tablets of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5mg/325mg occurred in 2/57 (3%) hydroceles and 2/10 (20%) spermatoceles. Surgical repair was ultimately pursued in 3/38 (8%) and 1/9 (11%) patients with persistent hydrocele and spermatocele respectively.

Conclusion

AS is a safe and effective treatment alternative for hydrocele and spermatocele for patients wishing to avoid surgery.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114gKuXU]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A pediatric hydrocele is a pathologic sac filled with serous fluid beneath the scrotal layer which can develop into both sides of the scrotum, called bilateral hydrocele. Although this type of pathology affects males of all ages, it is also commonly seen in children. Besides, the PH can develop spontaneously in adulthood.

There are two types of hydrocele regarding the pathogenesis process; communicating and non-communicating. In the communicating type, the hydrocele is directly in contact with abdominal fluids through the non-closed canal of spermatic cord; besides, the scrotum appears larger or swollen over time. Although the abdominoscrotal passage is blocked naturally in the non-communicating type of hydrocele in infants, some excess abdominal fluid remains in the scrotum surrounding testes. These types of hydroceles could be present at birth or develop for no apparent reason in the future. Non-communicating hydrocele usually remains in the same size or grows slowly over the time. Obstetric testicular edema is usually present at birth and diagnosed in 5% of cases. Premature newborns (≥ 3 weeks) represent a higher risk of hydrocele.

Risk factors of PH in children include scrotal damage, inflammation, and infection (such as sexually transmitted infection). The main symptom of PH is swelling on one or both sides of scrotum. Generally, the hydrocele is not often lethal along with no side-effects on fertility. However, the PH in children reflects an underlying serious disease such as acute infection or the presence of tumors in testis and inguinal canal, the associated treatment completely depends on the type and severity of disease. Although medicinal check-ups are necessary, no special treatments are advised in many cases (spontaneous disease disappearance).

In PH cases with severe swelling or an underlying disease (such as a hernia), surgical treatment may be required. Also, in cases with persistent hydroceles, further medical examinations are strictly needed. Since the PH can induce reproductive-associated pathologies, comprehensive health-based planning seems necessary to accelerate early diagnosis and reduce un-detected hydrocele. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis study was designed to determine the global prevalence of PH in infants and children.

### A new approach in the management of the hydrocele with a silicone catheter [^1141yF8i]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

To describe a new alternative technique to overcome several disadvantages of previous techniques to repair idiopathic hydrocele. Idiopathic hydrocele, which causes scrotal enlargement and discomfort for patients, is an abnormal fluid collection between the parietal and visceral layers of tunica vaginalis of the testis. Surgical and sclerotherapy treatments have previously been used to treat this problem.

Technical Considerations

Forty-five patients with hydrocele (aged 19 to 67 years) underwent an alternative procedure using a silicone catheter 15 to 20 cm in length in which holes had been made to enable flow of the hydrocele fluid from the parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis to the surrounding scrotal tissue. After an incision of approximately 5 mm on the scrotal wall with a scalpel knife, a cannula was pushed through the hydrocele sac with a gentle rotation until reaching the upper scrotal wall. A silicone catheter with holes was passed through the cannula to the point of the incision by way of the cannula. At the end, both tips of the catheter were sutured. During the procedure, the hydrocele fluid was emptied using an angiocatheter before the cannula was removed.

Conclusions

The results of this study indicate that this procedure does not require dissection, incision, or manipulation of the scrotal contents during treatment. It also resulted in a low rate of recurrence during the 1 to 3 years of follow-up. Additionally, the procedure has minimal complications and requires a short time, only about 15 minutes.

### Implementation and outcomes of a pilot collaborative surgical hydrocele training in Côte D'ivoire [^111CZMXm]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has several important limitations. The study was small and retrospective, and the surgical details and postoperative data for some patients are incomplete. Because the survey was not implemented preoperatively, each individual's self-assessment of difficulties with activities of daily living and work, quality of social interactions, etc. was subject to recall bias. Despite these limitations, our study suggests that building surgical capacity can lead to well-tolerated surgery and improvements in quality of life across various important domains.

### Hydroceles-not just for men [^114TFQVL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hydroceles develop in females through the canal of Nuck. This canal is formed when the processes vaginalis fails to obliterate during development. The canal of Nuck can lead to the formation of not only hydroceles, but hernias as well. Although physicians typically think of hydroceles occurring in males, on rare occasions, they do occur in females because of this defect. They are often mistaken for incarcerated hernias, making ultrasound an excellent tool to distinguish between them and guide further treatment.

Case Report

We report a rare case of a 46-year-old female with the chief complaint of a painful groin mass. A diagnosis of a hydrocele was made by point of care ultrasonography in the emergency department after being misdiagnosed by computed tomography scan on two previous occasions. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is a valuable tool for emergency physicians and can lead to quick diagnoses and appropriate management of the patient. Using ultrasound in conjunction with other imaging modalities can improve diagnostic accuracy. POCUS is portable and a powerful tool for immediate answers, and continues to prove its utility for clinical decision making.

### Investment success in public health: an analysis of the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis [^112sjQyj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Before widespread control, approximately 120 million people worldwide were infected with lymphatic filariasis (LF), with 40 million suffering from overt clinical disease. Though infection is often asymptomatic, clinical disease occurs in around one-third of infected individuals and can manifest as hydrocele, lymphedema, and acute adenolymphangitis episodes. Clinical disease can be debilitating and reduces economic productivity as well as limiting educational and employment opportunities. Those suffering from physical disfigurement often experience stigmatization and discrimination.

In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF), with the goal of eliminating the disease as a public health problem by 2020. The program has the following 2 parallel goals: to use community-wide preventive chemotherapy to interrupt transmission and to provide access to a basic package of care to every affected person in endemic areas in order to manage morbidity and prevent disability. These goals are supported with the WHO's 2020 neglected tropical disease (NTD) Road Map.

The GPELF has been incredibly successful, delivering more than 5.6 billion preventive chemotherapy treatments between 2000 and 2014 (Supplementary Table S1). However, in order to achieve the WHO's 2020 Road Map target, the 21 countries with incomplete geographical coverage (as well as the 11 countries that have yet to start drug distribution) will need to scale up preventive chemotherapy fully. Furthermore, only 24 (33%) endemic countries have established morbidity management and disability prevention programs.

It has been estimated that $154 million ($105–$208 million) per year will be required during 2015–2020 to continue the GPELF. In light of this, it is important to understand the program's current value. Here, we address the program's value by evaluating the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of the preventive chemotherapy that was provided under the GPELF between 2000 and 2014. In addition, we perform the first analysis to investigate the potential cost-effectiveness of hydrocele surgery.

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele in infancy: a review and presentation of the scrotal approach for correction [^113tmxeV]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

A simple transcrotal approach to the surgical treatment of abdominoscrotal hydrocele is presented.

Materials and Methods

Via a scrotal incision the hydrocele sac is drained and the wall is everted and plicated in the manner described by Lord.

Results

The hydrocele is eliminated with a decreased risk of damage to the spermatic cord and epididymis. There has been no recurrence.

Conclusions

The scrotal approach to abdominoscrotal hydrocele is a simple, safe and effective method of managing this relatively uncommon problem.

### European Association of Urology / European Society for Paediatric Urology guidelines on paediatric urology: summary of the 2024 updates [^115gbBrn]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

We present an overview of the 2024 updates for the European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society for Paediatric Urology (ESPU) guidelines on paediatric urology to offer evidence-based standards for perioperative management, minimally invasive surgery (MIS), hydrocele, congenital lower urinary tract obstruction (CLUTO), trauma/emergencies, and fertility preservation.

Methods

A broad literature search was performed for each condition. Recommendations were developed and rated as strong or weak on the basis of the quality of the evidence, the benefit/harm ratio, and potential patient preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Recommendations for perioperative management include points related to fasting, premedication, antibiotic prophylaxis, pain control, and thromboprophylaxis in patients requiring general anaesthesia. MIS use is increasing in paediatric urology, with no major differences observed among different MIS approaches. For hydrocele, observation is the initial approach recommended. For persistent cases, treatment varies according to the type of hydrocele. CLUTO cases should be managed in tertiary centres with multidisciplinary expertise in prenatal and postnatal management. Neonatal valve ablation remains the mainstay of treatment, but associated bladder dysfunction requires continuous treatment. Among urological traumas and emergencies, renal trauma is still an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Conservative management has become the standard approach in haemodynamically stable children. Ischaemic priapism is a medical emergency and requires stepwise management. Initial management of nonischaemic priapism is conservative. Fertility preservation in prepubertal children and adolescents has become an increasingly relevant issue owing to the ever-increasing number of cancer survivors receiving gonadotoxic therapies. A major limitation is the scarcity of relevant literature.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

This summary of the 2024 EAU/ESPU guidelines provides updated guidance for evidence-based management of some paediatric urological conditions.

Patient Summary

We provide a summary of the updated European Association of Urology/European Society for Paediatric Urology guidelines on paediatric urology. There are recommendations on steps to take before and immediately after surgery, management of hydrocele, congenital lower urinary tract obstruction, and urological trauma/emergencies, as well as preservation of fertility. Recommendations are based on a comprehensive review of recent studies.

### The long-term efficacy of hydrocele treatment with aspiration and sclerotherapy with polidocanol compared to placebo: a prospective, double-blind, randomized study [^112qukCq]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluate whether aspiration and sclerosing of hydrocele testis is an effective treatment.

Materials and Methods

Men with symptomatic hydrocele testis were included in this prospective, double-blind, randomized study with polidocanol and placebo. Patients were randomized to active treatment or placebo at the first treatment. Depending on hydrocele testis size (less than 100, 100 to 200 and greater than 200 ml), the patients were treated with 1, 3 or 4 mL polidocanol after aspiration. Patients with recurrence at the 5-week followup received active treatment.

Results

A total of 77 patients were included in the study. In group 1 (active treatment) there were 36 patients with a median age of 63 years (range 34 to 92). In group 2, comprised of 41 patients, the median age was 59 years (range 26 to 82). Median followup was 72 months. A significant difference between the groups was observed after the first and second treatments. Recurrence after the first treatment was seen in 16 (44%) patients from group 1 and in 32 (78%) from group 2 (p < 0.05). Recurrence after re-treatment with the active drug in both groups was seen in 4 (25%) patients in group 1 and in 14 (44%) in the former placebo group (p < 0.05). The overall success rate of treatment in the active group was 89%. There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of volume of fluid aspirated, symptoms or complications.

Conclusions

This long-term efficacy randomized study with placebo showed that polidocanol is effective for the treatment of hydrocele testis with a low recurrence rate.

### Incidental findings on brain and spine imaging in children [^116MFNT1]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Arachnoid cysts — treatment indications and complications are outlined as follows: cysts "should be treated in most cases if they are causing clear and specific neurologic symptoms", and "even small cysts may require treatment if they block normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways and cause symptomatic hydrocephalus", with suprasellar cysts "especially likely to cause symptoms and require treatment". However, "evidence of mass effect on imaging is not, by itself, a sufficient indication for surgical treatment", and because most have a benign natural history, "surgical treatment should be avoided except in the unusual instance in which a cyst is clearly responsible for specific symptoms". Subdural hygromas related to arachnoid cysts "are rare" and "do not always require surgical treatment", and because surgery itself "can cause iatrogenic hygromas", "prophylaxis against future hygroma risk should not be regarded as an adequate indication for surgical treatment". Similarly, hemorrhage into a cyst after trauma is "a very rare event", so "prophylaxis against future hemorrhage risk should not be used to justify surgical treatment in an asymptomatic child", and such hemorrhages are "associated with generally good outcomes, even when surgical evacuation of the hemorrhage is deemed necessary".

### Hernias and hydroceles [^111UjwSx]. Pediatrics in Review (2013). Low credibility.

Inguinoscrotal abnormalities in children are best understood by understanding the embryology of testicular descent and the failure of the processus vaginalis to properly obliterate. The inguinal hernia, communicating hydrocele, hydrocele of the spermatic cord, and scrotal hydrocele should be differentiated based on a history and physical examination in most cases, with selective use of ultrasonography. The urgency to surgically correct these entities depends on the nature of the hernia or hydrocele and the likelihood of incarceration or spontaneous resolution. Open standard herniorrhaphy remains the most common surgical approach, and concurrent transinguinal laparoscopy allows quick and accurate inspection of the contralateral internal inguinal ring and the need for bilateral repair of an inguinal hernia.

### Early surgery versus watchful waiting strategy for infantile abdominoscrotal hydrocele [^112Xdfke]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Infantile abdominoscrotal hydrocele is generally managed with early surgery. However, whether these patients actually benefit from an initial watchful waiting strategy is yet to be determined.

Methods

This single-center, comparative observational analysis included 36 consecutive patients (9 bilateral cases) diagnosed between January 1998 and December 2019. Initial 16 patients (21 lesions) underwent surgical repair shortly after diagnosis (Group A) at a mean (SD) age of 8 (4) months. Remaining 20 patients (24 lesions) underwent initial nonoperative management (Group B). Overall follow-up was 82.74 (63.84) months.

Results

Six lesions of Group B spontaneously regressed at a mean age of 23.8 (7.8) months. Remaining 18 hydroceles underwent surgical management at a mean age of 18.7 (12.6) months. Early postoperative morbidity was high (43%) in both groups (Clavien-Dindo grade I-II). During follow-up, there were 1 recurrent hydrocele and 1 testicular atrophy, both events occurring in Group A patients. Group B patients required a higher need for concomitant ipsilateral orchidopexy (61% versus 14%; p = 0.001), and developed a higher rate of ipsilateral inguinal hernia (39% versus 5%; p = 0.01), occurring within 8.3 (3.53) months of surgery. On multivariable analysis, nonoperative management was associated with unplanned second surgery (odds ratio 5.5, 95% CI 1.25–24.17, p = 0.02), regardless of the type of hydrocelectomy performed.

Conclusions

Nonoperative management provides effective spontaneous resolution in about 25% of infantile abdominoscrotal hydrocele. Clinicians must balance the potential benefits of such strategy against the impact of pressure induced detrimental effects on the success of future surgery when dealing with longstanding lesions.

### Treatment of varicocele in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis from the European Association of Urology / European Society for Paediatric Urology guidelines panel [^114T1uDj]. European Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

The benefits and harms of intervention (surgical or radiological) versus observation in children and adolescents with varicocele are controversial.

Objective

To systematically evaluate the evidence regarding the short- and long-term outcomes of varicocele treatment in children and adolescents.

Evidence Acquisition

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. A priori protocol was registered to PROSPERO (CRD42018084871), and a literature search was performed for all relevant publications published from January 1980 until June 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomized comparative studies (NRSs), and single-arm case series including a minimum of 50 participants were eligible for inclusion.

Evidence Synthesis

Of 1550 articles identified, 98 articles including 16 130 patients (7–21 yr old) were eligible for inclusion (12 RCTs, 47 NRSs, and 39 case series). Varicocele treatment improved testicular volume (mean difference 1.52ml, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73–2.31) and increased total sperm concentration (mean difference 25.54, 95% CI 12.84–38.25) when compared with observation. Open surgery and laparoscopy may have similar treatment success. A significant decrease in hydrocele formation was observed in lymphatic sparing versus non-lymphatic sparing surgery (p = 0.02). Our findings are limited by the heterogeneity of the published data, and a lack of long-term outcomes demonstrating sperm parameters and paternity rates.

Conclusions

Moderate evidence exists on the benefits of varicocele treatment in children and adolescents in terms of testicular volume and sperm concentration. Current evidence does not demonstrate superiority of any of the surgical/interventional techniques regarding treatment success. Long-term outcomes including paternity and fertility still remain unknown.

Patient Summary

In this paper, we review benefits and harms of varicocele treatment in children and adolescents. We found moderate evidence that varicocele treatment results in improvement of testicular volume and sperm concentration. Lymphatic sparing surgery decreases hydrocele formation. Paternity and fertility outcomes are not clear.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic (TAPP) and endoscopic (TEP) treatment of inguinal hernia [International Endohernia Society (IEHS)] [^111MfJoS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary retention

Statements

Recommendations

Urinary retention is less common after inguinal herniorrhaphies performed under local anesthesia compared with general or regional [9, 10]. Urinary retention is not unusual after a LIH, because the most common associated factor, the use of general anesthesia, is almost always used [11, 12]. The incidence varies widely from as low as 0.2% in a single-author study from France to as high as 22.2% of patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in a study from the Mayo clinic in Rochester, Minnesota [13, 14]. More commonly, it is reported to occur in the 2–7% range [15–19]. Although reports in the literature conflict somewhat, in general older age, prostatic symptoms, postoperative use of narcotics, and the administration of postoperative intravenous fluid > 500 cc have been found to be predictive [14]. Type of procedure (TEP vs. TAPP), surgical time, anesthesia time, intraoperative fluid restriction, or the development of other complications do not appear to be significant risk factors. Intermittent catheterization or temporary placement of an indwelling urinary catheter is usually adequate therapy.

Urinary infection

Statements

Recommendations

Miscellaneous cord and testicular problems

Statements

Scrotal hematomas can be prevented after LIH if complete hemostasis is assured before completing the procedure. Conservative treatment (ice, scrotal support, pain management, and observation) is sufficient for most, but large hematomas may require surgical drainage. Patients with bleeding disorders are especially prone to this complication [23]. Hydroceles can develop but the cause is not known. Whereas urological literature suggests that this is due to the practice of leaving the distal sac in situ, most experienced hernia surgeons do not accept this theory. The treatment is the same as for any other hydrocele. It is important to differentiate a hydrocele from a seroma because the later is almost always self-limiting and will resolve without treatment [24].

### Ten year experience of laparoscopic repair of pediatric hydrocele and the long-term follow-up results [^114gacDZ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic repair for pediatric hydroceles and its long-term follow-up results.

Methods

We performed this procedure to 284 patients from 2002 to 2011 using our specially designed curved awl. The patent internal ring was enclosed and fixed under laparoscopy and fluid within the patent processus vaginalis was emptied by percutaneous needle aspiration.

Results

The median operation time was 16minutes. Fifty-seven contralateral open internal rings were diagnosed during laparoscopic exploration and closed at the same time. During our 10-year follow-up only four kids had recurrence of moderate amount of fluid accumulation 1-3months after the surgery and 3 of them spontaneously resolved during the outpatient follow-ups. Only one of them was treated by percutaneous needle aspiration successfully. No abdominal viscera injury happened.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic hydrocele repair proved to be applicable and effective with satisfactory long-term results according to our experience.

Pediatric hydrocele (PH) is a curable pathology which can lead to early treatment and complete removal of complications following on-time diagnosis by an experienced delivery team. Untreated hydrocele can eventually lead to infertility. Currently, there are no single global statistics available regarding the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele; thus, it seems that presentation of a valid report in this regard causes the awareness of medical staff and health policymakers. This study was designed to present the global prevalence of PH in two groups of infants and children. The results of this meta-analysis study (statistical population of 349,558 cases) showed that the global prevalence of this disease in infants and children is 1 per 1000 and 3.4 per 1000, respectively. The findings showed that by the age (from infancy to childhood), the rate of pediatric hydrocele increases. This finding represented late or no diagnosis of PH pathology during labor or a few days post-labor. It is also suggested that multiple environmental factors can lead to the occurrence of PH in the post-infant period.

Provision of health solutions for early diagnosis of PH pathology seems a critical approach. Hydrocele in infants is a benign condition commonly disappears with no treatment. However, in persistent cases beyond infancy, careful screening is essential to determine the need for surgical intervention. The exact report of hydrocele's prevalence and ongoing management strategies emphasizes the importance of pediatric surveillance in early childhood health care. The studies conducted by Osifo and Osaigbovo and Imaizumi et al. provided important insights regarding the prevalence and special characteristics of hydrocele in infants, albeit from different geographical and clinical contexts. Osifo and Osaigbovo in a study entitled "Congenital hydrocele: prevalence and outcome among male children who underwent neonatal circumcision in Benin City, Nigeria" found that among 2,715 male neonates circumcised, 4.7% were diagnosed with hydrocele. This study highlighted that 83.4% of the diagnosed cases resolved spontaneously by the age of 18 months, with peak resolution occurring between 4–6 months.

### Scrotal masses [^114CB4wZ]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Scrotal and testicular masses can be broadly categorized into painful conditions, which include testicular torsion, torsion of the testicular appendage, and epididymitis, and painless conditions, which include hydrocele, varicocele, and testicular cancer. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency requiring prompt surgical intervention to save the testicle, ideally within six hours of presentation when the salvage rate is about 90%. The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion score can be used to help physicians identify patients at high risk of torsion and those at lower risk who would benefit from imaging first. Torsion of the testicular appendage presents with gradual onset of superior unilateral pain, is diagnosed using ultrasonography, and is treated supportively with analgesics. Epididymitis is usually caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or enteric bacteria and is treated with antibiotics, analgesics, and scrotal support. Hydroceles are generally asymptomatic and are managed supportively. Varicoceles are also generally asymptomatic but may be associated with reduced fertility. It is uncertain if surgical or radiologic treatment of varicoceles in subfertile men improves the rate of live births. Testicular cancer often presents as a unilateral, painless mass discovered incidentally. Ultrasonography is used to evaluate any suspicious masses, and surgical treatment is recommended for suspected cancerous masses.

### Clinical treatment of lymphatic filariasis | Filarial worms… [^112CzHuc]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Diethylcarbamazine citrate is the drug of choice for lymphatic filariasis.
- Providers should refer patients with lymphedema to a therapist.
- Patients with hydrocele may need surgery. Treatment options Antiparasitic treatment The main goal of treating a person with lymphatic filariasis is to kill the adult worm. Diethylcarbamazine citrate, which is both microfilaricidal and active against the adult worm, is the drug of choice for lymphatic filariasis. The late phase of chronic disease is not affected by antiparasitic treatment. Ivermectin is effective against the microfilariae of. W. bancrofti but has no effect on the adult parasite. Because lymphatic filariasis is rare in the United States, DEC is no longer approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Physicians can obtain the medication from CDC, after confirmed positive lab results.

Treatment of lymphatic filariasis in adults and children older than 18 months involves either a 1-day or 12-day treatment course of DEC. One day treatment is generally as effective as the 12-day regimen. For tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, a longer DEC treatment course of 14–21 days is generally recommended. DEC is generally well tolerated. Side effects are limited and depend on the number of microfilariae in the blood. The most common side effects are dizziness, nausea, fever, headache, or pain in muscles or joints. DEC is contraindicated in patients who may also have onchocerciasis. Prior to DEC treatment for lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis should be excluded in all patients with a consistent exposure history due to the possibility of severe exacerbations of skin and eye involvement.

In addition, DEC should be used with extreme caution in patients with circulating Loa loa microfilarial levels > 8, 000/mm³ due to the potential for life-threatening side effects, including encephalopathy and renal failure. Neither steroids pre-treatment nor slow dose escalation prevents these complications. Consultation with a tropical medicine specialist is recommended in these scenarios. The drug ivermectin kills only the microfilariae, but not the adult worm; the adult worm is responsible for the pathology of lymphedema and hydrocele. Some studies have shown adult worm killing with treatment with doxycycline. Care for lymphedema and elephantiasis Lymphedema and elephantiasis are not indications for DEC treatment. Most people with lymphedema are not actively infected with the filarial parasite, and lab tests are generally negative in these patients.

To prevent lymphedema from worsening, physicians should consider referring patients to a certified lymphedema therapist so they can be informed about basic principles of care, such as hygiene, exercise, elevation, treatment of wounds and infections, and use of appropriate footwear. Complex decongestive physiotherapy can be effective for treating lymphedema. The National Lymphedema Network website lists certified lymphedema therapists and lymphedema organizations in the United States. There is limited evidence to suggest that a 4–6-week course of doxycycline may stabilize or reverse the progression of disease in persons with lymphedema. Treatment of hydrocele The treatment for hydrocele is surgery. Patients with hydrocele may have evidence of active infection, but typically do not improve clinically following treatment with DEC. The treatment for hydrocele is surgery.

### New minimally access hydrocelectomy [^1157jGi7]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To ascertain the acceptability of minimally access hydrocelectomy through a 2-cm incision and the outcome in terms of morbidity reduction and recurrence rate. Although controversy exists regarding the treatment of hydrocele, hydrocelectomy remains the treatment of choice for hydroceles. However, the standard surgical procedures for hydrocele can cause postoperative discomfort and complications.

Methods

A total of 42 adult patients, aged 18–56 years, underwent hydrocelectomy as an outpatient procedure using a 2-cm scrotal skin incision and excision of only a small disk of the parietal tunica vaginalis.

Results

The operative time was 12–18 minutes (mean 15). The outcome measures included patient satisfaction and postoperative complications.

Conclusions

This procedure requires minor dissection and minimal manipulation during treatment. It also resulted in no recurrence and minimal complications and required a short operative time.

### Hemorrhagic abdominoscrotal hydrocele. A challenging entity [^1168C3jG]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is a rare condition in childhood. It presents an intraabdominal portion with homogeneous content that is usually excised through a groin approach. A pale child with a recurrent scrotal hydrocele and a huge solid-cystic retroperitoneal mass is reported. Because the diagnostic workup has not ruled out malignancy, a laparotomy was performed; however, ultimate diagnosis was hemorrhagic ASH. The clinical features and surgical management of ASH are addressed. This entity should be considered in front of tense or recurrent hydroceles or coexistent abdominal mass even though with heterogeneous content.

### Natural history and conservative treatment outcomes for hydroceles: a retrospective review of one center's experience [^114aFfHt]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To elucidate epidemiological data and hydrocele progression, we reviewed pediatric patients diagnosed with hydroceles in our institution retrospectively.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed data from 355 pediatric patients with hydroceles. Questionnaires regarding age at diagnosis, time of delivery, presence of hydroceles in the father and brothers, age at recovery, age at surgery, cause of hydrocele (if present), type of hydrocele, associated pathologies, treatments, and posthydrocelectomy complications were completed by reviewing patients' medical records and interviewing their families.

Results

Patients with congenital hydroceles were more frequently born prematurely (32.5%) than were patients with noncongenital hydroceles (15.9%; P = 0.001). Fathers of 10 patients (3.7%) and brothers of 21 patients (7.7%) also had hydroceles. Hydroceles were associated with inguinal hernias on the same side (12.2%), cryptorchidism (7.5%), varicoceles (6.0%), and testis torsion (0.5%). Among patients aged > 1 year (n = 185), 27 did not undergo operations and healed spontaneously at an average of 5.30 ± 3.36 months. For children aged > 1 year who did not undergo surgery, the rate of spontaneous recovery within 6 months was 77.8% and that within 1 year was 96.3%.

Conclusion

Until strong evidence of hydrocele-induced testicular damage in children arises, we recommend following up congenital hydroceles until at least 1 year and preferably 2 years of age. We recommend following up noncongenital hydroceles for at least 6 months and preferably 1 year if there is no associated pathology indicating the need for earlier surgery such as an inguinal hernia, cryptorchidism, tense hydrocele, testis torsion, or testis mass.

### A novel pull-through technique for the surgical management of idiopathic hydrocele [^1115e58b]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Standard surgical procedures for hydrocele may cause postoperative discomfort, temporary limitation of normal activities and complications, such as hematoma, infection, persistent swelling, chronic pain and decreased fertility. We describe a new technique in an effort to decrease these complications.

Materials and Methods

Between April 2004 and December 2006, 21 patients underwent hydrocelectomy, which was bilateral in 1. Through a 15 mm transverse scrotal incision the tunica vaginalis parietalis was identified and grasped. Under gentle traction the sac was dissected bluntly and delivered out of the incision. The fully mobilized tunica was excised by electrocautery at its base, followed by wound closure. Patients were discharged home within 24 hours after surgery and were followed at 6-month intervals for a minimum of 18 months.

Results

Mean operative time was 27.3 minutes. Postoperatively hematoma or wound infection was not evident in any case. Mild scrotal edema usually subsided within a few days after the procedure. Two patients with persistent edema and hardening of the scrotum required additional bed rest and anti-inflammatory agents. Patients were able to resume normal daily activity an average of 6 days after surgery (range 3 to 21). Cure was achieved in 21 of the 22 hydrocele cases (95%).

Conclusions

Our pull-through technique enables the surgeon to remove large hydrocele sacs through a small incision and with minimal dissection under direct vision of the testicular structures, resulting in early recovery and minimal complications. This procedure may be a viable option for the surgical management of idiopathic hydrocele.

### Tension hydrocele: an unusual cause of acute scrotal pain [^1175KwpV]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The etiology of acute scrotal pain can vary from a benign process such as mild trauma, appendicular torsion, or epididymo-orchitis to an emergent process such as an incarcerated inguinal hernia, testicular torsion, or rupture. Furthermore, testicular insult often results in a reactive hydrocele that can both cloud the diagnosis and impair the physical examination. Traditionally, the acute scrotum was managed with immediate exploration, but emergency physicians and urologists have increasingly used Doppler ultrasonography to assess vascular flow, aide in the diagnosis, and ultimately guide triage of those patients who require urgent intervention. We describe the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented with 2 days of increasing testicular pain and swelling, confirmed to have a large hydrocele with compromised testicular perfusion, and was managed by emergent operative drainage and repair of a "tension hydrocele" with immediate return of testicular perfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tension hydrocele causing intratesticular vascular compromise in a pediatric patient.

### Abstracts of ESPR 2013, the European society of paediatric radiology 50th annual meeting and 36th postgraduate course. June 3–7 2013. budapest, Hungary [^1179yWsL]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose-Objective. An abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is a rare lesion and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesion in the abdomen in a child.

Material and methods. A first abdominal US examination in a 6 weeks old boy, performed because of urinary tract infection, revealed no pathological changes. The next US, after 3 months, showed a cystic lesion (53 × 27 × 20mm) on the right side, above the bladder, filled with anechoic fluid. One month later in US the size of the lesion increased and CT demonstrated a communication between a cystic mass in the abdomen and a right scrotal hydrocele — an ASH.

Results. ASH is a congenital condition. It consists of hydrocele that extends from the scrotum through the internal inguinal ring into the abdominal cavity. Our patient had no other symptoms and was observed by US examination. Following the next 4 months the size of the ASH decreased remarkably.

Discussion and conclusions. US is the most valuable tool for confirming diagnosis of ASH. CT should be used only when US fails to establish the nature of the mass. One should remember about this rare entity in differential diagnosis of cystic abdominal mass. Spontaneous resolution of ASH is rare but one can wait with surgical treatment in an asymptomatic patient.

### Epididymo-orchitis presenting as bilateral hydrocele in a young adult [^111cC1DJ]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

We present a case of young patient who presented with a progressive scrotal swelling and low-grade fever. An ultrasound of the scrotum revealed multiple small well-defined hypoechoic lesions in both testes with bulky epididymis and bilateral hydrocele. The final diagnosis was confirmed on cytology. The typical imaging findings may help to reach the diagnosis and to plan the further management in such cases.

### Characteristics of adult abdominal cystic lymphangioma: a single-center Chinese cohort of 12 cases [^1126YhLf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The size of the ACL in this study varied from 5 × 4 cm to 23 × 17 cm, which was consistent with the range of 3–20 cm reported in the literature, except for the largest one in our cohort. The growth rate could be estimated in three patients from detailed records before admission to our center. An average growth of 1.6 cm annually was observed. In reviewing the medical records of the 12 adult patients with ACL, we identified no tendency for the cyst volume to decrease without intervention.

In the absence of prospective controlled studies, the indication for surgery in adult ACL patients was not standardized. Other reports recommend a watch-and-wait approach as a general rule for asymptomatic patients. In our center, surgery was recommended for symptomatic patients. However, because ACL may also result in acute abdomen such as internal bleeding or volvulus, and spontaneous regression of the cyst is essentially impossible, therapeutic choices for asymptomatic patients are relatively flexible. When infection or malignancy is suspected, surgery should be performed. Moreover, surgery should also be considered when patients have intense anxiety and a strong preference for surgery, irrespective of the presence or absence of symptoms.

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele in an infant boy [^1143SrBS]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is the rarest type of hydrocele. This condition is characterised by a large abdominal and scrotal component connected by an isthmus within the inguinal canal. The incidence among the paediatric population is reported to be less than 3%, although it might be underdiagnosed. Several theories have been proposed in the literature but the aetiology of ASH remains unknown. Diagnosis can be made clinically and confirmed by ultrasound. Spontaneous resolution is rare and long-standing ASH may lead to complications, thus early surgical intervention is recommended. Different techniques have been described, but dissection remains challenging due to the tunica vaginalis adherence to the testis and the distal cord. We present a male infant with ASH who underwent inguinal repair. The procedure was facilitated by needle decompression of the mass. Identification and preservation of the vessels and vas deferens was done successfully without compromising the testis.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112VEZKF]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

In order to collect eligible and extractable data representing the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele in infants and children, a systematic searching was applied in 6 databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar using main keywords of " Prevalence ", " hydrocele ", " Infant ", and " Children ". Also, no time restrictions were applied for paper searching (by September 1, 2024). Citation Management Software of EndNote was used for reference arrangement. The references of collected papers were also screened manually to cover the maximum collection of eligible studies. Finally, the searching process was updated on September 16, 2024. Keywords were extracted using the MeSH concept. The search strategy (in each database) was determined using Advanced Searching Mode using (AND) and (OR) operators to reach the maximum combination. For example, the searching strategy in the PubMed database was determined as follows; (((((((Prevalence[Title/Abstract]) AND (hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) OR (Testicular Hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) OR (Scrotal Hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) OR (Vaginal Hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) AND (Infant[Title/Abstract])) OR (Infants[Title/Abstract])) AND (Children[Title/Abstract]))))))).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were all studies reporting the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele in infants and children, with available full-text, sufficient extractable data, and papers designed in English Language. Besides, all case reports, case series, intervention studies, reviews, and papers with insufficient or unextractable data were excluded.

Study selection

The PRISMA guidelines were totally followed for selection of eligible studies. This protocol was conducted through exclusion of duplicate studies and the selection of eligible investigations based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. During paper searching, the citations were imported into the Citation Management Software (EndNote). Duplicate papers were selected and merged. During the primary screening, the Title and Abstract of the papers were assessed and irrelevant investigations were excluded. In the secondary screening process, full texts of studies were provided and re-evaluated. Eligible papers with extractable data were considered in this regard. In order to prevent the probable bias, all stages were carried out by two independent researchers. Any potential disagreements regarding the paper's selection were re-evaluated by the corresponding author.

### A giant heterogeneous abdominoscrotal mass: haemorrhagic hydrocele [^117QYeg7]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

A hydrocele is a collection of fluid in the space surrounding the testicle between the layers of the tunica vaginalis. Occasionally the scrotal hydrocele may extend through the inguinal canal, deep inguinal ring, and into the abdomen as an abdominoscrotal hydrocele. Traditionally, abdominoscrotal hydrocele have been evaluated and diagnosed with US. However if a relationship between the abdominal mass and the hydrocele is not clearly defined by sonography, the traditional modality for imaging the abdomen and the scrotum such as CT or MRI, should be considered because it can be difficult to clearly delineate the anatomy and the full extent of the abnormality. We present a rare case of a giant hemorrhagic abdominoscrotal hydrocele in a 24 year old man that required an elective operative laparotomy for complete excision of the abdominolscrotal mass.

### Novel surgical approach to giant abdominoscrotal hydrocele-video [^111FuGyr]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Repair of abdominoscrotal hydrocele is surgically demanding and may be associated with complications. Herein we describe a surgical technique with laparoscopic assisted approach. A 6-month boy with right hydrocele and left absent testis was surgically treated with scrotal approach using one laparoscopic port. In the presence of abdominoscrotal hydrocele and contralateral absent testis, we opted to correct the hydrocele while minimally mobilizing the solitary testis cord and blood vessels. The patient had minimal drainage-postoperatively, he developed fever and was treated with antibiotics. Abdominoscrotal hydrocele in infancy may simply and successfully be treated via scrotal approach with the assistance of one-port laparoscopy (Video).

Sclerotherapy was performed in six patients in five case reports. 339, 347, 349, 351, 352 The sclerosing agent was OK‐432 in five of the six patients and was Beta‐isodona® (Mundipharma GmbH, Cambridge, UK) solution in one. 349 OK‐432 was locally injected into the lesion in four, 347, 351, 352 administrated i.p. in one 352 and administrated through the drain in two. 347, 352 Concerning sclerotherapy, the number of reported cases that were reviewed was limited, and further accumulation of cases is considered necessary to establish its usefulness.
Abdominal drainage, abdominal puncture and surgical treatment

Abdominal drainage and abdominal puncture are performed when organ compression symptoms (compartment syndrome and respiratory insufficiency) due to abdominal distention are present or possible, or when the drain is inserted postoperatively. However, drainage itself cannot improve chylous ascites, and treatments, such as infusion, blood preparations and blood transfusion, are necessary to supplement the ascites lost due to drainage. 327, 330, 331, 332, 333, 337, 338, 339, 340, 343, 345, 346, 347, 349, 351, 352

Surgical treatment is reported to be frequently performed after conservative or drug treatments. According to the single‐center case series by Zeidan et al. 343 surgical treatment was performed in patients who responded poorly to conservative treatments for over a mean of 25.3 days. In other reports, surgical treatment was performed after conservative treatments for 1–3 months 328, 329 and in patients with congenital chylous ascites 1–4 months after birth. 330, 334, 350 Because it is often impossible to identify the leakage site of chylous ascites, 330 there have been attempts to identify the leakage site by p.o. administration of a lipophilic dye (Sudan black, Sudan III) before operation. 328, 329, 336, 343 When the leakage site can be identified, ligation, suturing, clipping and cauterization have been performed. 328, 334, 336, 343, 350 In addition to reports of the usefulness of techniques to stop leakage, such as applying or sprinkling fibrin glue at the leakage site of chylous ascites or over the surrounding retroperitoneum, 329, 331, 343, 350 and applying a patch of oxidized cellulose/resorbable local hemostatic agent, 331, 343 there have also been reports of peritoneovenous shunting 349, 353 and peritoneoamniotic shunting for fetal cases. 338

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qSfhP]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Qualitative assessment of included papers

To validate the quality of included articles, the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist was used. All aspects of the included papers were assessed including Title, Abstract, Introduction, Statement of the problem, Study objectives, Methods, type of study, statistical population, sampling method, data collection tools, Results, and Discussion. Finally, middle to high-quality papers were included for data extraction. For paper scoring, the values of 1 and 0 were assigned to each approved and rejected item, respectively. The total score was 0–32 on the STROBE checklist. Papers ≥ 16 were considered moderate to high-quality studies (included for data extraction); besides, the articles < 16 were low-quality investigations (excluded).

Data extraction

In this regard, two researchers extracted data using a previously prepared checklist including the "Name of the first author", "Year of paper publication", "Country", "Type of study", "Sample size", "Age group", "Statistics of cases", "Hydrocele prevalence", and "Study tools".

Statistical analysis

Whole statistical analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (v.2). I² test was used to check the heterogeneity and publication bias was assessed using the Egger test. The Funnel plot and Begg and Mazumdar correlation test was used for publication bias. Based on the results of the heterogeneity study, factors such as Sample size and Year of paper publication were detected as effective factors in the heterogeneity index; thus, meta-regression analysis was used to examine in this regard.

Anthrax in adults — procedures and surgical interventions: Pleural fluid drainage has been positively associated with survival, and these data support the need for early and aggressive drainage of any clinically or radiographically apparent pleural effusions; chest tube drainage is recommended over thoracentesis because many effusions will require prolonged drainage. Thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracic surgery might be required to remove gelatinous or loculated collections, and ascites should also be drained and monitored for reaccumulation; continuous drainage might be required. Surgery might be contraindicated or indicated, depending on the type of anthrax; for cutaneous disease, surgery is contraindicated for acute disease, with the exception of tracheotomy for airway obstruction and surgical intervention for large or circumferential extremity lesions causing compartment syndrome. Surgery may be indicated for gastrointestinal anthrax to identify and address potentially fatal complications, such as bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation, and for injection anthrax, surgery is used to obtain diagnostic specimens and to remove the necrotic nidus of infection; surgery for injection anthrax should be more limited than that for necrotizing fasciitis, and resection should be performed only to healthy tissue. Compression of soft tissues can be released by incision, excision, or fasciotomy and might be required for treatment of compartment syndrome, and diathermy dissection is advised to optimize hemostasis.

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele: excision of sac may not be necessary [^113prSmU]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abdominoscrotal hydroceles (ASH) are uncommon occurrences in boys and usually treated similarly to a hernia with the assumption that there is an associated patent processus vaginalis. Treatment in this manner may be challenging due to sac size, extension and adherence to the spermatic cord. Due to the rarity of ASH, the literature is mostly limited to small, single-institution case studies.

Objective

Our goal was to evaluate two techniques in large number. We hypothesized a simplified scrotal technique with eversion, Jaboulay procedure, would demonstrate less complications and equivalent efficacy to standard excision.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed medical records at three tertiary children's hospitals to identify boys who underwent surgical repair of ASH between 1998 and 2018. Group 1 had excision and/or ligation of the hydrocele sac. Group 2 had a scrotal incision with limited excision and then eversion of the hydrocele sac (Jaboulay procedure). Variables that were analyzed included preoperative imaging, surgical technique, surgical findings, length of follow up, complications and recurrence of swelling.

Results

We identified 61 boys, who had 77 abdominoscrotal hydroceles. Group 1 included 38 patients with 48 hydroceles. Group 2 included 23 patients with 29 hydroceles. Complications were more common in Group 1 patients (18% vs 0%) but complication rate and operative time were not statistically associated with surgery type or age. No patient in either group had recurrence of hydrocele.

Discussion

Although this is a large study for this rare condition, the analysis is limited by number and its retrospective nature.

Conclusion

For the rare and difficult to treat abdominoscrotal hydrocele, we were unable to prove with statistical significance that a simplified technique of eversion via the scrotum is safer. However, this large series did demonstrate that the simplified procedure provides equal efficacy as excision.

### Structural alterations of the corpus callosum in children with infantile hydrocephalus [^115sXh5D]. Journal of Child Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Infantile hydrocephalus is characterized by an atypical accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to progressive enlargement of the ventricular system and necessitating surgical intervention within the first 2 years of life. One treatment for this condition is the surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt system that redirects excess fluid to the peritoneum, effectively alleviating pressure on the brain. This intervention has shown significant efficacy in reducing ventricular size and ameliorating associated symptoms. Early hydrocephalus (with an onset before the age of 2), comes with a particular shape of ventricles, which is not seen in patients with a later onset, where the posterior horn is particularly affected and enlarged. Therefore, the posterior cortex, encompassing regions such as the parietal and occipital lobes, bears the brunt of damage. The direction of ventricular dilatation subjects the posterior cortex to sustained compression, inflammation, cortical thinning, and increased cerebrospinal fluid volumes. Research in both human and animal models indicate a correlation between hydrocephalus and corpus callosum thinning, primarily attributed to lateral ventricular dilatation exerting upward compression on periventricular and subcortical white matter. – The corpus callosum, a principal interhemispheric commissure, connects neocortical areas and represents the largest white matter fiber bundle in the human brain. Its role is to provide interhemispheric communication of motor, sensory, and higher-order problem-solving information. Damages to the corpus callosum, including dorsal grooving from impingement on the falx cerebri, and myelin degradation, correlate with motor and cognitive deficits. –

### Aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocelectomy for treatment of hydroceles [^114kNvm7]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare aspiration and sclerotherapy using sodium tetradecylsulfate (STDS) with open hydrocelectomy in the treatment of hydroceles with regard to safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic hydroceles were prospectively enrolled in an aspiration and sclerotherapy protocol between October 1998 and June 2000. Patients in this group underwent percutaneous aspiration followed by sclerotherapy with an STDS-based solution. This group was compared with a group of patients chosen consecutively who underwent hydrocelectomy between December 1996 and August 1999. Primary outcome measures included patient satisfaction and procedural success. Secondary outcome measures included complications and comparative costs.

Results

A total of 27 patients with 28 hydroceles were enrolled in the aspiration and sclerotherapy protocol and compared with 24 patients with 25 hydroceles in the hydrocelectomy group. Mean follow-up for the aspiration and sclerotherapy group and hydrocelectomy group was 8.9 and 16.4 months, respectively. Patient satisfaction was 75% for aspiration and sclerotherapy and 88% for hydrocelectomy. The overall success rate for aspiration and sclerotherapy was 76% compared with 84% for hydrocelectomy. The complication rate was only 8% in the aspiration and sclerotherapy group, but 40% in the hydrocelectomy group. Comparative costs per procedure demonstrated that hydrocelectomy was almost ninefold more expensive than aspiration and sclerotherapy.

Conclusions

In the treatment of hydroceles, aspiration and sclerotherapy with STDS represents a minimally invasive approach that is simple, inexpensive, and safe but less effective than hydrocelectomy. Aspiration and sclerotherapy is a viable first-line therapeutic option in the management of hydroceles.

### Microsurgical spermatocelectomy: technique and outcomes of a novel surgical approach [^114tHwaJ]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

A microsurgical approach to spermatocelectomy theoretically minimizes the risk of injury to the epididymis and testicular blood supply. We present the technique of microsurgical spermatocelectomy and report our perioperative and recurrence outcomes.

Materials and Methods

In a 15-year period 23 men with a total of 36 epididymal cystic masses underwent microsurgical resection with confirmation of spermatocele diagnosis by intraoperative identification of sperm in the cyst fluid. We reviewed pathology reports for resected epididymal tissue in the spermatocele specimen. Postoperative outcome measures included complications, sperm count changes, improvement in pain and fertility, and cyst recurrence.

Results

Mean spermatocele size was 5.0 cm (range 1 to 15). Common indications for surgery included pain in 35% of cases, infertility in 30% and the 2 conditions in 13%. A total of 13 patients (57%) underwent simultaneous procedures for concomitant varicocele and/or hydrocele with a mean overall surgical time of 152 minutes. A single scrotal hematoma managed conservatively was the only postoperative complication. There was no case of infection. Avoidance of inadvertent epididymal resection was shown by absent epididymal tissue in each of the 36 spermatocele pathology specimens. Also, no patient with preoperative and postoperative semen analyses available experienced a decreased sperm count, confirming the avoidance of iatrogenic epididymal tubule obstruction. At a mean followup of 17.3 months no man had cyst recurrence or testicular atrophy and all with preoperative pain reported improvement. One patient with preoperative infertility achieved pregnancy 12 months after surgery.

Conclusions

Microsurgical spermatocelectomy is safe and effective with a minimal risk of epididymal injury, testicular atrophy and recurrence.

### Label: ROPIVACAINE HYDROCHLORIDE injection, solution… [^114P2BrS]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ropivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is an amide local anesthetic indicated in adults for the production of local or regional anesthesia for surgery and for acute pain management. Surgical Anesthesia: epidural block for surgery including cesarean section; major nerve block; local infiltration Acute Pain Management: epidural continuous infusion or intermittent bolus, e.g., postoperative or labor; local infiltration. 16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 17. 1 Information for Patients and Caregivers
- *
- Sections or subsections omitted from the full prescribing information are not listed. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ropivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is indicated for the production of local or regional anesthesia for surgery and for acute pain management.

Surgical Anesthesia: epidural block for surgery including cesarean section; major nerve block; local infiltration Acute Pain Management: epidural continuous infusion or intermittent bolus, e.g., postoperative or labor; local infiltration 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.
2. 1 Important Administration Instructions There have been adverse event reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures. Ropivacaine hydrochloride injection is not approved for this use. The dose of any local anesthetic administered varies with the anesthetic procedure, the area to be anesthetized, the vascularity of the tissues, the number of neuronal segments to be blocked, the depth of anesthesia and degree of muscle relaxation required, the duration of anesthesia desired, individual tolerance, and the physical condition of the patient.

Patients in poor general condition due to aging or other compromising factors such as partial or complete heart conduction block, advanced liver disease or severe renal dysfunction require special attention although regional anesthesia is frequently indicated in these patients. To reduce the risk of potentially serious adverse reactions, attempts should be made to optimize the patient's condition before major blocks are performed, and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly. Administration Cesarean Section 5 7. 5 20 to 30 15 to 20 100 to 150 113 to 150 15 to 25 10 to 20 2 to 4 3 to 5 Thoracic Epidural. 2 5 1 to 100 1 to 40 2 to 200 5 to 200 1 to 5 1 to 5 2 to 6 2 to 6 The doses in the table are those considered to be necessary to produce a successful block and should be regarded as guidelines for use in adults. Individual variations in onset and duration occur. The figures reflect the expected average dose range needed.

For other local anesthetic techniques standard current textbooks should be consulted. For treatment of postoperative pain, the following technique can be recommended: If regional anesthesia was not used intraoperatively, then an initial epidural block with 5 to 7 mL ropivacaine hydrochloride injection is induced via an epidural catheter. Analgesia is maintained with an infusion of ropivacaine hydrochloride injection, 2 mg per mL. Clinical studies have demonstrated that infusion rates of 6 to 14 mL per hour provide adequate analgesia with nonprogressive motor block. With this technique a significant reduction in the need for opioids was demonstrated. Clinical experience supports the use of ropivacaine hydrochloride epidural infusions for up to 72 hours. Delay in proper management of dose-related toxicity, underventilation from any cause, and/or altered sensitivity may lead to the development of acidosis, cardiac arrest and, possibly, death.

### Meta-analysis to determine optimal timing for repair of inguinal hernia in pre-term infants [^111K258s]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Data Extraction

Following the primary and secondary screenings, RCTs and cohort studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Two independent reviewers were involved in the study selection process, and any disagreements or uncertainties regarding inclusion or exclusion were resolved through discussion. Data on baseline characteristics and individual outcome measures were extracted from the results sections of the studies using a pre‐piloted excel spreadsheet. The extracted baseline characteristics included patient population, gestational age at birth, sex, birth weight, postnatal days at diagnosis, post‐conceptional age at surgery, and weight at surgery. The extracted outcomes encompassed the rate of hernia incarceration, spontaneous resolution, respiratory complications, postoperative reintubation, pneumothorax, apnea or hypoxemia, bradycardia, surgical complications, hydrocele, recurrence rate, bowel injury, testicular atrophy, and iatrogenic ascending testis.

2.5 Study Quality and Risk of Bias

The quality and risk of bias for the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies were assessed using the "RoB 2: A Revised Cochrane Risk‐of‐Bias Tool" for RCTs and the "Risk of Bias in Non‐Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS‐I)"tool for cohort studies. Three independent reviewers evaluated the risk of bias in each study, after which the results were pooled and visualized using the Robvis tool to generate a traffic light plot (Supporting Information S1: Figures S1 and S2). Because of the inclusion of fewer than 10 studies for each outcome, publication bias was not assessed through a funnel plot analysis.

2.6 Data Analysis

As argued by Choo et al. the incidence of incarceration can only be accurately determined through prospective or randomized studies. For observational studies, we used the same mathematical approach as used by Choo et al. to calculate the adjusted incarceration number for each group. All statistical analyses were conducted using RevMan 5.4 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for each outcome using the Mantel–Haenszel method, with significance defined as a p ‐value of less than 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A random‐effects model was employed for all analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic, where I² > 50% indicated substantial heterogeneity. A leave‐one‐out sensitivity analysis was performed to identify any outlier studies. Following Cochrane guidelines, publication bias was not assessed using funnel plots or statistical tests, as fewer than 10 studies were included for each outcome.

### Implementation and outcomes of a pilot collaborative surgical hydrocele training in Côte D'ivoire [^116SEpuR]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Twenty-six men were evaluated for surgery as part of the training. Nine were excluded, four because of comorbid conditions, four because of misdiagnosis of hydrocele, and one who refused consent for surgery. All 17 individuals who underwent surgical repair of their hydrocele were available for an interview and were included in this analysis (Table 1). Median participant age was 50 years (range, 38–76 years). Ten of the men were married, three were widowers, and four were single. Eleven of the men had no formal education, and 15 worked in agriculture. Preoperative hydrocele stage and grade were recorded for 15 of 17 patients (Figure 2). All but one of the hydroceles were grade 2 or larger (larger than a tennis ball), and seven extended below the mid-thigh (grade 3 or higher). Seven of the men had bilateral hydroceles, and five had a hydrocele and concomitant hernia.

Surgical technique, postoperative complications, and hydrocele recurrence.

Information regarding surgical technique used was available for 13 patients, all of whom underwent excision/resection of the hydrocele (Table 2). Herniorrhaphy was performed simultaneously in four patients. All participants were followed up as inpatients for at least 2 days postoperatively. No early postoperative complications were identified. Two patients returned to the hospital postoperatively; one patient had poor wound healing and the other poorly controlled postoperative pain. However, neither required readmission. No other complications were identified. There were no recurrences of hydrocele noted at the time of the postoperative interviews.

### Aspiration and sclerotherapy: a nonsurgical treatment option for hydroceles [^116zgvUg]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We demonstrated that hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy with doxycycline is an effective and safe nonsurgical treatment option for hydrocele correction.

Materials and Methods

The medical records of patients who underwent hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy were analyzed in a retrospective cohort study for success rates as well as improvement in scrotal size and discomfort after a single hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy treatment. Patients who reported decreased scrotal size, improved physical symptoms and satisfaction with the procedure were considered as having success with hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy.

Results

A total of 29 patients (mean age 52.8 years) presenting with 32 nonseptated hydroceles underwent hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy with doxycycline between 2005 and 2012. Of the hydroceles 27 (84%) were successfully treated with a single aspiration and sclerotherapy procedure. Overall mean followup was 20.8 months. Three patients reported moderate pain which resolved in 2 to 3 days. Of those patients in whom hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy failed, 1 had hydrocele successfully resolved with a second aspiration and sclerotherapy treatment, 3 did not have success with a second procedure and underwent hydrocelectomy, and 1 wanted immediate surgical correction.

Conclusions

Hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy was successful in correcting 84% of simple nonseptated hydroceles with a single treatment. This result is an increase from previously reported success rates involving a single hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy procedure with tetracycline (75%). The success rate of a single hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy procedure is similar to the reported success rates involving hydrocelectomy while avoiding the hospital expense and many other complications. We conclude that the hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy procedure is a reasonable, nonsurgical and underused treatment option for nonseptated simple hydroceles.

### A fifteen-year retrospective analysis of varicocele embolization: evaluating success, recurrence rates and embolic agents [^116C1UAA]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our technical success rate of 96% is comparable with published meta-analysis data, which have demonstrated 86.1% to 100% success rates. Our study's high clinical success rate of 93.75% on telephone and ultrasound follow up reinforces the efficacy of this intervention, confirming its role as an excellent treatment option for patients presenting with symptomatic varicocele.

Our cohort's initial reported recurrence rate according to telephone follow up was 25%. However, using telephone consultation and repeat ultrasounds, the actual recurrence rate was much lower at 6.25%. This observation is impressive, considering our mean follow-up was 8.03 yearswith a minimum follow-up of 18 months. Our study's mean time to recurrence was 34months. A Cochrane review in 2021 reported recurrence rates of 13%. Interestingly, both Persad et al. and Jing et al. reported no difference in recurrence between those treated surgically and those treated with embolization.

The complication rate in this cohort was lower than similar previous reported studies (1.78%), supporting the established safety profile of embolization compared to surgical alternatives. Halpern et al. reported a 3–3.7% incidence of epididymitis with percutaneous embolization, a 10% risk of haematoma and an up to 12% risk of post-embolic hydrocele. In our study, none of the patients experienced severe complications such as testicular loss, a known risk of surgical intervention. Studies have shown that patients receiving IR treatment have a significantly lower risk of adverse events than those undergoing surgical treatment (RR 0.63). Our study strengthens the evidence that percutaneous embolization offers a safer alternative to varicocelectomy.

Economic studies have demonstrated that surgical embolectomy and percutaneous embolization costs are comparable. However, the potential advantage for those undergoing percutaneous embolization compared to surgical treatment lies in the shorter recovery time to full activity. Patients treated with percutaneous embolization often return to work after 48 h, whereas those treated surgically are advised to avoid strenuous activity for at least three weeks. Dewire et al. noted that 24% of surgical patients required an overnight hospital stay, while all patients treated percutaneously were discharged on the same day.

### Diagnostic and management approaches to pediatric and adolescent varicocele: a survey of pediatric urologists [^112wWb81]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess current diagnosis and management of adolescent varicoceles by pediatric urologists.

Methods

Online questionnaires assessing diagnosis and management approaches to pediatric and adolescent varicocele were distributed electronically to a national listing of pediatric urologists.

Results

Of 242 pediatric urologists surveyed, 131 (54%) responded to the survey. Only 3% of respondents operate on varicoceles at diagnosis, whereas 14% observe, and 83% base treatment on further indications. Varicocelectomy is most commonly performed for decreased ipsilateral testicular size (96%), testicular pain (79%), and altered semen analysis parameters (39%), with the mean age for varicocelectomy being 12.5 ± 3.1 years. Most physicians use ultrasonography (US) or Doppler US to aid in the diagnosis of varicoceles, and half of physicians would not repair incidental findings of varicocele on US. In an otherwise asymptomatic patient with a varicocele, 28% of physicians would consider varicocelectomy depending on varicocele grade. The most common surgical approaches to varicocelectomy were laparascopic (38%), subinguinal microsurgical (28%), inguinal (14%), and retroperitoneal (13%), and most physicians used loupes for these procedures. The most common complication experienced after adolescent varicocelectomy was hydrocele followed by hematoma, testicular atrophy, chronic pain, paresthesia, and varicocele recurrence or persistence. Only 58% of physicians had follow-up data on their varicocele patients, and 89% did not know whether patients developed infertility. Of patients who developed infertility, 39% had undergone varicocele repair.

Conclusion

Significant variation in diagnostic approaches, decision to treat, and operative approaches exists among pediatric urologists, and combined with a dearth of objective data, limits development of management guidelines.

### Initial experience with percutaneous selective embolization: a truly minimally invasive treatment of the adolescent varicocele with no risk of hydrocele development [^114giJXr]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Postoperative hydrocele development is a frustrating complication of varicocele surgical repair. To avoid this complication, we began to offer percutaneous embolization as a treatment option. We present our initial experience with this technique.

Methods

A retrospective review of all patients who underwent percutaneous embolization and sclerotherapy of a varicocele at our institution was performed.

Results

There were 27 patients with a mean age of 16 years (range 13–19 years). Indications included pain (48%), varicocele size (30%) and persistent testicular asymmetry (22%). Four patients had experienced failure of a previous surgical repair. Follow-up data were available for 21 patients (mean 9 months). The varicocele resolved in 19 patients (91%) with no evidence of hydrocele formation in any of the boys. There was resolution of pain in all patients for whom this was the indication for the procedure. In the two failures, access to the lower spermatic vein was not possible owing to the number and tortuosity of the vessels.

Conclusions

Percutaneous embolization and sclerotherapy represent a truly minimally invasive treatment with low morbidity, minimal pain and rapid recovery. In our early experience, since lymphatic channels are completely avoided, there appears to be no risk of hydrocele formation.

### Economic costs and benefits of community-based lymphedema-management programs for lymphatic filariasis in India [^1148xDD4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Lymphatic filariasis (LF) afflicts an estimated 120 million people in 72 countries of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas and is one of the diseases targeted for elimination by the World Health Assembly (World Health Assembly Resolution 50.29, 1997). – India is the country with the largest number of infected persons, accounting for 42% of the global endemic population. The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF), a public–private partnership to assist in advocacy, resource mobilization, and program implementation, embodies 2 "pillars": stopping new infections using mass drug administration (MDA) and managing morbidity and preventing disability for persons already infected. As of 2017, only five endemic countries had not yet started MDA.

An estimated 40 million people live with the disabling effects of LF, including about 15 million persons with chronic filarial lymphedema, primarily of the legs, but also of the arms, breasts, and scrotum, and 25 million men with hydrocele. Asymptomatic LF-infected persons are at life-long risk of developing lymphedema or hydrocele. Ultrasonographic and histological evidence shows lymphatic vessel damage in infected children long before the age at which lymphedema typically becomes evident, generally around the age of 20 years. Programs of morbidity management and disability prevention (MMDP) among infected persons, the second pillar of the GPELF, had been initiated in only 38 of the 72 endemic countries by 2017.

In a 2016 study in Khurda district, Odisha (formerly Orissa), India, we demonstrated that the societal economic benefits of MMDP for filarial lymphedema were 130 times the costs of such interventions. The present article uses a methodology similar to that used in the Odisha study to estimate the costs and benefits of MMDP for all of India.

### The CURE protocol: evaluation and external validation of a new public health strategy for treating paediatric hydrocephalus in low-resource settings [^111wMVGc]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Study design

Using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology criteria, a prospective cohort design was used to compare outcomes of surgical management for paediatric hydrocephalus between the two sub-Saharan African centres during a defined time period with minimum of 6 months of follow-up.

Initial patient assessment

Our management protocol involves a systematic approach to initial patient evaluation as follows. Patients are evaluated clinically and with cranial CT or ultrasound, since MRI is not available. Symptomatic hydrocephalus in children is defined as ventriculomegaly in conjunction with at least one of the following: abnormally increasing head circumference crossing percentile lines, sunsetting of eyes, abnormal irritability/vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, poor feeding, bulging fontanel with child upright and quiet, distended scalp veins or symptomatic type 2 Chiari malformation following closure of myelomeningocele (eg, stridor, swallowing difficulties, etc). Isolated ventriculomegaly and macrocephaly alone are insufficient criteria for intervention; such patients are subsequently followed to look for progressive ventriculomegaly, abnormal rate of head growth, or the development of symptoms.

The diagnosis of postinfectious hydrocephalus is determined, according to previously published criteria, when there is no evidence of hydrocephalus at birth, and either a history of febrile illness preceding development of macrocephaly or endoscopic or imaging evidence of prior ventriculitis (or both). All other causes of hydrocephalus are categorised as either non-postinfectious or related to myelomeningocele.

Prior to surgery, patients undergo a ventricular tap for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assessment to ensure sterility and sufficient clarity of the CSF. Bloody, murky or infected CSF prompts placement of a ventricular reservoir for serial tapping until the CSF has cleared. After initial assessment, all children < 2 years of age requiring intervention are treated according to the CURE Protocol (figure 1A). Older children presenting for treatment are managed similarly except that CPC is not employed in conjunction with ETV.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116zrxiN]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric hydrocele is a congenital pathology commonly diagnosed in newborns. Also, untreated pediatric hydrocele can induce adverse permanent consequences in adulthood. This study aimed to investigate the global prevalence of pediatric hydrocele in infants and children, as a necessary factor for health policymakers.

Methods

Databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar search engine were systematically searched for studies reporting the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele in infants and children. The main keywords of " Prevalence ", " Outbreak hydrocele ", " Infant ", and " Child " were used in this regard. Screenings were applied to achieve eligible papers and a quality control process was conducted to select middle to high-quality papers. Finally, the random effect model was used to perform meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was checked by the I² index. Data analysis was applied with CMA (v.2) software.

Results

Following the assessment of 5 eligible studies with a sample size of 70,961 infants (1–2 weeks), the global prevalence of hydrocele in infants was found 0.001% (95%CI:0.00007–0.018, 1 per 1000 live births). In the review of 3 studies with a sample size of 278,597 children (7–12 years), the global prevalence of hydrocele in children was reported 0.0034% (95%CI:0.00004–0.21), 3.4 per 1000 children).

Conclusion

According to the analyzed studies, a relatively high prevalence of hydrocele in infants was reported, globally. Besides, there were undiagnosed or recurrent pediatric hydrocele cases in children which need more precise medical screening. Thus, it is necessary to implement health policies to reduce the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele and associated adverse consequences.

### Sonographic appearance of canal of nuck hydrocele [^115kXuJM]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

We present a case of a relatively uncommon entity in a 17-year-old girl who presented to the emergency department with right inguinal pain and discomfort. On sonography, she was thought to have a hydrocele of a patent processus vaginalis, although differentials could not be excluded. The hydrocele was subsequently confirmed at surgery. Because this is an uncommonly reported condition, a high index of suspicion must be maintained in the appropriate clinical setting. We present various sonographic appearances and techniques that have been proposed in the literature.

### Complications of scrotal surgery for benign conditions [^114oKrZ6]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Frequent complications have been reported after scrotal surgery. We reviewed our experience to determine the complication rates, risk factors, and how our experience might differ from other series.

Methods

We reviewed all scrotal surgery for benign conditions at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System from 1998 to 2004. The abstracted data included indications, comorbidities, perioperative antimicrobial use, operative procedures, use of drains, and complications.

Results

Ninety-five patients underwent 110 procedures, including hydrocelectomy (55%), spermatocelectomy (15%), epididymectomy (4%), and bilateral or combination procedures (27%). Preoperative antimicrobial administration was documented before 80 (73%) of the 110 procedures. The follow-up ranged from 0 to 85 months (mean 36). Complications occurred after 22 (20%) of the 110 procedures and included recurrences (6%), hematomas (5%), and infections (3.6%), with 95% of complications occurring after hydrocelectomy (odds ratio 9.1, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 71.6). The potential patient and surgical risk factors considered were immunocompromised status, undergoing a bilateral procedure, a high American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index, and the use of drains.

Conclusions

Our overall complication rate was 20%, with most occurring after hydrocele surgery (chi-square, P = 0.01). The 3.6% wound infection rate was substantially lower than that in recent series in which preoperative antimicrobial agents were not prescribed. In the absence of a prospective clinical trial, these findings suggest that scrotal procedures might merit consideration of routine antimicrobial prophylaxis.

### Comparative study of sclerotherapy with phenol and surgical treatment for hydrocele [^115cTsqX]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

We compared the efficiency, side effects and effects on spermatogenesis of sclerotherapy with phenol and surgical treatment for hydrocele.

Materials and Methods

A total of 67 patients (80 hydroceles) were randomly divided into 2 groups of 40 hydroceles each. One group underwent phenol sclerotherapy and the other underwent hydrocelectomy. Spermiograms were done before, 6 and 12 months after treatment in patients able to ejaculate.

Results

In the sclerotherapy group 47.5%, 30%, 12.5%, 5% and 2.5% of the hydroceles were cured with 1 to 5 injections, respectively, but 2.5% were not cured even with 6 injections. There were no complaints of localized pain or infection in these cases. All patients returned to normal activity on the same day. In the hydrocelectomy group 97.5% and 2.5% of hydroceles were cured with 1 and 2 operations, respectively. There was pain postoperatively in 73.5% of the patients and localized infection in 5%, while 62.5% required an average of 4.5 days of rest and were absent from work for 10 days. There was no significant statistical alteration in spermatozoid concentration in the preoperative, and 6 and 12-month postoperative counts in the groups (p = 0.385).

Conclusions

Sclerotherapy for hydrocele with phenol is as efficacious as hydrocelectomy, while causing less morbidity and similar effects on spermatogenesis.

### Diagnosis and management of hymenal variants: ACOG committee opinion, number 780 [^114TtEg8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Imperforate hymen — neonatal and pubertal presentations and initial management are described as follows: the imperforate hymen may present in the neonatal period as a hydrocolpos or mucocolpos with a bulging, translucent, or yellow mass at the introitus, and surgical intervention is necessary only in symptomatic prepubertal patients with intervention usually deferred until pubertal estrogenization has occurred because the imperforate hymen may open spontaneously at puberty. At puberty, typical findings include a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by hematocolpos that distends further with the Valsalva maneuver; pain may be pelvic or abdominal, cyclic or acute, and other findings may include an abdominal mass, urinary retention, dysuria, constipation, and dyschezia.

### Surgical management of syringomyelia-Chiari complex [^1159AMof]. European Spine Journal (2000). Low credibility.

Great variety exists in the indications and techniques recommended for the surgical treatment of syringomyelia-Chiari complex. More recently, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has increased the frequency of diagnosis of this pathology and offered a unique opportunity to visualize cavities inside the spinal cord as well as their relationship to the cranio-cervical junction. This report presents 18 consecutive adult symptomatic syringomyelia patients with Chiari malformation who underwent foramen magnum decompression and syringosubarachnoid shunting. The principal indication for the surgery was significant progressive neurological deterioration. All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative MRI scans and were studied clinically and radiologically to assess the changes in the syrinx and their neurological picture after surgical intervention. All patients have been followed up for at least 36 months. No operative mortality was encountered; 88.9% of the patients showed improvement of neurological deficits together with radiological improvement and 11.1% of them revealed collapse of the syrinx cavity but no change in neurological status. None of the patients showed further deterioration of neurological function. The experience obtained from this study demonstrates that foramen magnum decompression to free the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) pathways combined with a syringosubarachnoid shunt performed at the same operation succeeds in effectively decompressing the syrinx cavity, and follow-up MR images reveal that this collapse is maintained. In view of these facts, we strongly recommend this technique, which seems to be the most rational surgical procedure in the treatment of syringomyelia-Chiari complex.

### The society for fetal urology consensus statement on the evaluation and management of antenatal hydronephrosis [^1124ngQF]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2010). Low credibility.

The evaluation and management of fetuses/children with antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH) poses a significant dilemma for the practitioner. Which patients require evaluation, intervention or observation? Though the literature is quite extensive, it is plagued with bias and conflicting data, creating much confusion as to the optimal care of patients with ANH. In this article, we summarized the literature and proposed recommendations for the evaluation and management of ANH.

### Annual updates of the European Association of Urology-European society for pediatric urology (EAU-ESPU) paediatric urology guidelines: are large-language models (LLM) better than the usual structured methodology? [^114qUdDD]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The European Association for Urology - European Society for Pediatric Urology (EAU-ESPU) guidelines comprise a comprehensive publication of evidence based clinical guidelines for the field of Pediatric urology. The goal is to produce recommendations to optimize patient care and provide an assessment of benefits and harms and possible alternative treatment options. Artificial intelligence (AI) has immensely evolved and is often used in urology. With the emergence of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and CoPilot, a new dimension in AI was reached and more widespread use of AI became possible. ChatGPT and CoPilot are both large language models (LLMs).

Objectives

The aim of the current study was to test the ability of LLMs to provide a trustworthy update of two of the chapters of the EAU-ESPU Pediatric Urology Guideline.

Study Design

Three LLM's (Chat-GPT 3.5, Chat-GPT 4.0 and CoPilot) were asked to perform a systematic update of the hydrocele and varicocele chapters. For both chapters two standard conversations were written; one humane dialogue and one conversation in which we included minor prompt engineering, i.e. few-shot prompting. All conversations were performed five times by an independent researcher and outcomes were scored for accuracy, consistency and reliability, using several predefined criteria by two reviewers.

Results

A total of sixty conversations were analyzed. All three LLMs were unable to update the guidelines with the recent relevant literature because of the lack of access to the correct scientific databases. Furthermore, a high variability was seen in the responses provided by the LLMs, although the input text was similar every time. The use of basic prompting in the structured conversations compared to the humane responses improved the consistency of the responses. The reproducibility, consistency, and reliability of the updates provided by the LLMs were assessed to be inadequate, despite the use of basic prompting.

Discussion

Development of AI and specific plug-ins for LLMs are developing at a very fast pace. A specific follow-up project would be to create specific plug-ins and advanced prompt engineering in cooperation with AI experts for existing LLMs to update the guidelines with access to the relevant databases and correct instructions to follow the handbook of the guidelines.

Conclusion

At the moment LLMs cannot replace the panel members of the EAU Guidelines panel in their work to update the clinical guidelines. They have demonstrated inadequate consistency, reliability, accuracy, and are not able to incorporate new literature.

### Pressure, fluid and anatomical characteristics of abdominoscrotal hydroceles in infants [^112crjpV]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele is a poorly understood entity and multiple theories attempt to explain its occurrence. To our knowledge the factors contributing to the formation of abdominoscrotal hydrocele are unknown, as are its cellular, biochemical and hydrostatic properties. We prospectively evaluated abdominoscrotal hydrocele at surgery to define its cause and its effects on the testicle.

Materials and Methods

Six patients (9 abdominoscrotal hydroceles) were prospectively evaluated at surgery. Hydrocele volume was recorded as well as simultaneous hydrocele and bladder pressure. Fluid at surgery was sent for biochemical and cellular analysis. Testicular and epididymal abnormalities were noted and testicular length was measured. All abdominoscrotal hydroceles were exteriorized and excised. Processus vaginalis patency was documented at repair.

Results

Mean patient age was 7.17 months (range 5 to 12). The mean volume recorded was 212.78 mL (range 80 to 320). Mean corrected hydrocele pressure was 15.44 cm H₂O (range 7 to 28). Mean testicular length was 3.6 cm (range 2.2 to 5.5). All patients had epididymal anomalies and 2 of the 3 unilateral abdominoscrotal hydroceles had abnormal contralateral scrotal findings. In no case was a peritoneal communication identified. Fluid analysis revealed a high protein concentration (mean 4.94 gm/dl), low triglyceride concentration (mean 20.29 mg/dl) and lactate dehydrogenase levels comparable to those in normal serum (mean 99.14 U/l). Cytological analysis revealed a sterile, low cellularity fluid with a macrophage predominance (mean 84.71%).

Conclusions

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele occurs as a result of increased intraluminal pressure confined in a proximal closed processus vaginalis. Increased hydrocele pressure allows expansion into the retroperitoneal space through the internal inguinal ring. This increased pressure is associated with testicular elongation and epididymal abnormalities. The exudative fluid is of a noninfectious etiology and it suggests an altered filtration process. To our knowledge the effects on future fertility are unknown.

### Sonographic evaluation of inguinal lesions [^116X9qwM]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in the inguinal region are varied. The most common abnormality in the inguinal region is the hernia: direct or indirect inguinal hernia and femoral hernia. There are many hernia-mimicking lesions, such as spermatic cord hydrocele, undescended testis, hematoma, inflammation, abscess, benign or malignant tumors, metastatic or benign lymph node enlargement, round ligament varicosities or mesothelial cyst, and herniated ovary. Ultrasonography is currently the primary imaging modality used in assessing inguinal lesions and helpful for the differential diagnosis of a broad spectrum of these diseases. Familiarity with clinical setting and certain ultrasonography details will facilitate prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### Sterile cerebrospinal fluid ascites, hydrothorax and hydrocele as a complication of ventriculoperitoneal shunting in an elderly patient [^112bTaSW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

An 89-year-old man with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries and ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement for normal pressure hydrocephalus presented for intractable abdominal bloating and scrotal swelling, for which imaging revealed massive ascites, bilateral hydrocele and small bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiac, hepatic and renal workup were insignificant. Culture and cytology of ascitic fluid were negative for infection or malignancy. Aetiology of the ascites as secondary to Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the VP shunt was confirmed via ligation of the shunt. Sterile CSF ascites, hydrothorax and hydrocele are rare complications of VP shunt for hydrocephalus and are mostly presented in paediatric patients. We report the first known case of concurrent CSF ascites, hydrothorax and hydrocele in an elderly patient. We examine the difficulty of shunt replacement as a diagnostic and treatment modality in this age group and propose the use of reversible shunt ligation as a diagnostic modality.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of detailed diagnostic obstetric ultrasound examinations between 12 Weeks 0 Days and 13 Weeks 6 Days [^114o6jNh]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

AIUM detailed diagnostic obstetric ultrasound between 12 Weeks 0 Days and 13 Weeks 6 Days — neck and nuchal translucency — lists axial, sagittal, and coronal scanning planes for evaluation for cystic hygroma, dilated jugular lymphatic sacs, other abnormal fluid collections, or masses, described as a subjective evaluation; a measurement of the nuchal translucency is required if it appears enlarged or is part of a screening protocol for aneuploidy risk assessment, and a quality assessment program is recommended to ensure that false-positive and false-negative results are kept to a minimum.
