## Question

When should serum potassium be checked after initiating an ACE inhibitor and HCTZ?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when serum potassium should be checked after initiating an ACE inhibitor plus hydrochlorothiazide combination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the opposing potassium effects of ACE inhibition and thiazide diuresis. Then, I should confirm baseline testing requirements and thresholds before starting. Next, I will determine the earliest follow-up interval after initiation, followed by what to do after each dose titration. After that, I need to set an ongoing monitoring cadence and identify who needs intensified monitoring. Finally, I will define action thresholds for abnormal results and synthesize a clear, schedule-based recommendation anchored in guidelines and product labeling.

> Let me consider the pharmacology first. ACE inhibitors reduce aldosterone and can raise potassium, so hyperkalemia is a recognized risk; conversely, HCTZ promotes urinary potassium loss and can cause hypokalemia, meaning the combination exerts opposing forces and the net effect is patient- and dose-dependent, which is precisely why monitoring is essential; the fixed-dose lisinopril/HCTZ label explicitly advises periodic electrolyte checks to detect imbalance, including both hyper- and hypokalemia, so I should not assume cancellation of effects in any individual patient [^112ffxNr] [^114MQkPf] [^117JMbdM].

> I should confirm baseline assessment before initiation. Hold on, let me verify the pre-treatment requirements: major guidance recommends measuring serum potassium and kidney function prior to starting RAAS blockade, and to use caution if baseline potassium exceeds 5.0 mmol/L; while some recommendations are framed for MRAs, the same potassium thresholds are operationalized in RAAS-start pathways and reiterated in UK and diabetes-kidney guidance, so obtaining pre-start potassium and eGFR/creatinine is mandatory and delaying therapy or modifying the plan is prudent when K+ is > 5.0 mmol/L or kidney function is unstable [^114WwTAf] [^116YL37t] [^1137mjsn] [^116oGqQJ].

> Next, I should review the earliest recheck timing after initiation. Wait, let me verify the exact window — some health-system quality metrics talk about "within 30 days", but that is a broad administrative interval and may be too late for safety in higher-risk patients; KDIGO guidance as cited recommends checking within one week after starting or increasing a dose, whereas UKKA and NICE-based pathways converge on 1–2 weeks and the ADA 2025 Standards specify 7–14 days after starting or changing RAAS inhibitors or diuretics, so a pragmatic and guideline-concordant interval is 7–14 days, with consideration of checking closer to 7 days in higher-risk patients [^111kgMrM] [^117D6kdv] [^112ffxNr].

> I will now examine what to do after dose titrations. Let me first confirm that the same recheck interval applies after any dose change of either the ACE inhibitor or HCTZ; UKKA explicitly advises electrolyte monitoring 1–2 weeks after every dose titration, and NICE-aligned guidance mirrors this, with the ADA also calling for 7–14 day checks after dose changes, so I should replicate the initial monitoring cadence after each up-titration or when switching strengths in a fixed-dose combination [^111kgMrM] [^116oGqQJ] [^112ffxNr].

> Now I need to set the ongoing monitoring schedule once the patient stabilizes. Hold on, I should verify frequency by risk: for CKD, heart failure, or diabetes, UKKA 2023 recommends 2–4 times per year, which equates to every 3–6 months, and ADA guidance supports routine monitoring thereafter; ESC 2024 also flags the need to monitor potassium in patients on potassium-sparing medications, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics, particularly with CKD or increased dietary potassium; importantly, real-world data show under-monitoring after ACEi/ARB initiation, reinforcing the need to adhere to these intervals in practice [^116NkTYS] [^112ffxNr] [^112s1v2E] [^114MxsNz].

> I should double-check which patients need more frequent or earlier checks. High-risk features include eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², higher baseline potassium (practically ≥ 4.5 mmol/L), diabetes, heart failure, older age, volume depletion, and concurrent agents that raise potassium or impair renal perfusion such as potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, trimethoprim, or even beta-blockers; ARB and valsartan labeling also cautions about hyperkalemia with such combinations and advises monitoring, so in these scenarios I need to shorten the recheck interval toward one week and consider additional early checks if clinical status changes [^notfound] [^114MxsNz] [^111r5wu5] [^115zG4Xf] [^113gnFBK] [^116zznuQ].

> Let me verify the combination-specific labeling nuances. The lisinopril/HCTZ (Zestoretic) label calls for periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect imbalance, highlighting both hyperkalemia risk from ACE inhibition and hypokalemia from thiazide diuresis; the HCTZ label emphasizes individualized dosing and warns that doses above 50 mg are often associated with marked reductions in serum potassium, and both labels stress earlier testing if symptoms of electrolyte disturbance emerge, so I should monitor sooner with any suggestive symptoms or intercurrent illness [^117JMbdM] [^114MQkPf].

> I need to ensure clear action thresholds. If potassium exceeds 5.0 mmol/L, I should exercise caution and review contributing medications and kidney function; if potassium reaches 6.0 mmol/L or more, NICE-aligned guidance advises stopping or reducing the RAAS inhibitor and addressing co-medications, with potassium binders considered for persistent hyperkalemia in CKD to preserve RAAS therapy; on the other side, if potassium falls below 3.5 mmol/L, I should consider potassium repletion and reassess the HCTZ dose, with targets of at least 4.0 mmol/L in patients with heart disease where feasible; let me reconsider lab-to-lab variability — some labs cite an upper normal of 5.3 mEq/L, but using standard 3.5–5.0 reference points and the above thresholds is consistent with guideline-based pathways [^116oGqQJ] [^111pXPM7] [^1133u8w9].

> But wait, what if I initially assumed "within 30 days" was sufficient for the first check? The heart failure multimorbidity and population studies used a 30-day testing window as an evaluation metric, yet they did not demonstrate improved short-term outcomes with such timing; this reinforces that guideline-preferred checks at 7–14 days are safer for detecting early potassium shifts after starting or changing RAAS or diuretic therapy, especially in high-risk patients [^1119z5yG] [^114xzkea] [^112ffxNr].

> Putting this together, serum potassium should be measured before starting the ACE inhibitor/HCTZ combination, then rechecked at 7–14 days after initiation, rechecked again 7–14 days after any dose change of either component, then monitored every 3–6 months in stabilized higher-risk patients with CKD, heart failure, or diabetes and at routine clinical visits for lower-risk patients, with earlier and/or more frequent checks when eGFR is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², baseline potassium is ≥ 4.5 mmol/L, interacting medications are present, intercurrent illness occurs, or symptoms of dyskalemia appear; this cadence balances the opposing potassium effects of the combination and aligns with UKKA, NICE-derived pathways, ADA Standards, KDIGO recommendations, and product labeling [^111kgMrM] [^116oGqQJ] [^112ffxNr] [^116NkTYS] [^113jWG18] [^117JMbdM] [^114MQkPf].

---

Check serum potassium and renal function within 1–2 weeks [^111kgMrM] after starting ACE inhibitors and HCTZ, then recheck at 4 weeks [^113jWG18] and after any dose change or the addition of interacting drugs [^116zznuQ]. For high-risk patients [^111kgMrM] (CKD, diabetes, heart failure [^114MxsNz], elderly, or baseline K+ > 4.5 mmol/L), monitor more frequently initially, then continue periodic checks every 3–6 months [^116NkTYS]. Immediate testing is **required** if symptoms or ECG changes [^117JMbdM] suggest electrolyte disturbances.

## Recommended potassium monitoring schedule

| **Time point** | **Monitoring action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Baseline (prior to initiation) | - Serum potassium [^112ffxNr] <br/> - Renal function (eGFR, creatinine) | Establish baseline and identify pre-existing abnormalities [^111kgMrM] |
| 1–2 weeks after initiation [^111kgMrM] | - Serum potassium [^112ffxNr] <br/> - Renal function | Detect early hyperkalemia or hypokalemia [^117D6kdv] |
| 4 weeks after initiation | - Serum potassium <br/> - Renal function | Confirm stability or detect delayed abnormalities [^111kgMrM] [^113jWG18] |
| After dose changes [^111kgMrM] or addition of interacting medications | - Serum potassium <br/> - Renal function within 1–2 weeks [^112ffxNr] | Identify changes from altered therapy [^111r5wu5] |
| Routine monitoring thereafter [^113YChVW] | - Serum potassium <br/> - Renal function every 3–6 months | Ongoing surveillance for late abnormalities [^111kgMrM] |

## Patient-specific factors influencing monitoring frequency

Certain patient characteristics increase the risk of potassium abnormalities and therefore **require closer monitoring**:

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Reduced potassium excretion increases hyperkalemia risk [^113YChVW].
- **Diabetes mellitus**: Higher hyperkalemia risk with ACE inhibitors [^114iM1Rc] [^113YChVW].
- **Heart failure**: Increased hyperkalemia risk with ACE inhibitors [^114MxsNz] [^113YChVW].
- **Elderly patients**: Greater risk of electrolyte disturbances [^115zG4Xf].
- **Baseline potassium > 4.5 mmol/L**: Higher hyperkalemia risk [^114iM1Rc].

For these patients, consider **more frequent monitoring** — e.g. weekly initially, then monthly until stable.

---

## Clinical implications of potassium abnormalities

Potassium abnormalities have significant clinical consequences: **hyperkalemia** [^113YChVW] poses a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and life-threatening events, while **hypokalemia** increases the risk of arrhythmias, muscle cramps, and weakness [^111pXPM7]. **Prompt detection and management are essential** to prevent complications [^115KejBM].

---

## Management strategies for potassium abnormalities

Manage **hyperkalemia (K+ ≥ 5.5 mmol/L)** [^113YXfBL] by reducing or discontinuing the ACE inhibitor, considering potassium binders, and reassessing potassium within 1 week, while **hypokalemia (K+ < 3.5 mmol/L)** [^1133u8w9] warrants consideration of potassium supplementation [^115VmnK9] or HCTZ dose adjustment [^117JMbdM].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Baseline testing**: Serum potassium and renal function before starting therapy.
- **Initial monitoring**: 1–2 weeks after initiation [^112ffxNr].
- **Follow-up monitoring**: 4 weeks after initiation [^113jWG18].
- **After dose changes**: Within 1–2 weeks [^117D6kdv].
- **Routine monitoring**: Every 3–6 months thereafter [^116NkTYS].
- **High-risk patients**: More frequent monitoring [^112s1v2E].

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^113jWG18]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-I) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing blood pressure and proteinuria, slowing the progression of kidney disease, and improving outcomes in patients with heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and post-myocardial infarction. However, these medications have also been associated with adverse events, including hyperkalemia. Although adverse events can occur at any level of kidney function, the risk is thought to be greatest in those with chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure. Thus, concern for adverse effects may lead to underutilization in the subgroups of patients who are expected to derive the greatest benefit.

Clinical detection of hyperkalemia requires laboratory evaluation, and close laboratory monitoring is recommended during ACE-inhibitor or ARB use. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on chronic kidney disease evaluation and management recommends assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and potassium within one week after initiating or increasing the dose of an ACE-I or ARB, regardless of baseline potassium level. The 2004 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) suggests a more detailed algorithm: monitor laboratory values within the first four weeks after initiation or dose change for high-risk patients (defined as having systolic blood pressure over 4.5 mmol/L, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²) and within 4 to 12 weeks for all others.

### Impact of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibition on serum potassium levels among peritoneal dialysis patients [^114spaLn]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The chronic use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers has been associated with hyperkalemia in patients with reduced renal function, even after the initiation of hemodialysis. Whether such medications may cause a similar effect in peritoneal dialysis patients is not well established. The aim of our study was to analyze the impact of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors on the serum levels of potassium in a national cohort of peritoneal dialysis patients.

- **Method**: A prospective, observational, nationwide cohort study was conducted. We identified all incident patients on peritoneal dialysis who had angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) prescribed for at least 3 months and a similar period without these medications. Patients were divided into four groups: Groups I and III correspond to patients using, respectively, an ACEi or ARB and then having the drug suspended. Groups II and IV started peritoneal dialysis without the use of any renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitor and then, respectively, had an ACEi or ARB introduced. Changes in potassium serum levels were compared using two statistical approaches: (1) the non-parametric Wilcoxon test for repeated measures and (2) a crossover analysis.

- **Results**: Mean potassium serum levels at the first phase of the study for Groups I, II, III, and IV were, respectively, 4.46 ± 0.79, 4.33 ± 0.78, 4.41 ± 0.63, and 4.44 ± 0.56. Changes in mean potassium serum levels for Groups I, II, III, and IV were -0.10 ± 0.60, 0.02 ± 0.5.

Comparison of hyperkalemia incidence in the year after β-blocker initiation

In a propensity-matched analysis, 20,186 new users of β-blockers had less potassium monitoring in the year after initiation compared with 20,186 new ACE-I/ARB users (64% versus 74%). The occurrence of hyperkalemia was similar in new ACE-I/ARB and β-blocker users, except in patients with low eGFR. For example, new users of β-blocker therapy had a 4.4% and 1.4% occurrence of potassium > 5 and > 5.5 mmol/L overall, similar to that observed among new ACE-I/ARB users. However, among patients with an eGFR of less than a specific threshold, the incidence of hyperkalemia was notably different.

- **Potassium levels**: New users experienced elevations in (A) potassium > 5 mmol/L and (B) potassium > 5.5 mmol/L during the first year on therapy.

ACEi indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate.

### Prexxartan [^113gnFBK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

- **Agents increasing serum potassium**: Concomitant use of valsartan with other agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that may increase potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. In heart failure patients, this can also lead to increases in serum creatinine. If co-medication is considered necessary, it is essential to monitor serum potassium.

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have compromised renal function, the coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as valsartan, may result in the deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving valsartan and NSAID therapy. Additionally, the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

- **Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)**: Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not experience these adverse effects.

### Moexipril hydrochloride [^116zznuQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics**: Moexipril hydrochloride can increase serum potassium because it decreases aldosterone secretion. The use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) or potassium supplements concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored.

- **Oral anticoagulants**: Interaction studies with warfarin failed to identify any clinically important effect on the serum concentrations of the anticoagulant or on its anticoagulant effect.

- **Lithium**: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.

- **Gold**: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including moexipril hydrochloride.

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including moexipril hydrochloride, requires caution due to potential interactions.

### Hydrochlorothiazide [^113Sjv7x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

In cases of hydrochlorothiazide overdosage, the most frequently observed signs and symptoms are caused by electrolyte depletion, including hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and hyponatremia, as well as dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has been administered concurrently, hypokalemia may exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias.

For treatment of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should be utilized. Inducing emesis or performing gastric lavage may be necessary. It is crucial to correct dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hepatic coma, and hypotension using established medical procedures. Oxygen or artificial respiration should be administered if there is respiratory impairment. Notably, the extent to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis is not established.

The oral LD50 of hydrochlorothiazide is greater than 10 gm/kg in both mice and rats.

### Do thiazides worsen metabolic syndrome and renal disease? The pivotal roles for hyperuricemia and hypokalemia [^114ZiVb2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

The aims of this article are to review the controversies related to the use of thiazide diuretics as first-line treatment of hypertension and to discuss the causal roles for hyperuricemia and hypokalemia on the adverse consequences of thiazide usage.

Thiazides significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in hypertensive subjects. There remains, however, debate about thiazide usage as first-line treatment of hypertension. This negative impact may be partially attributed to their ability to exacerbate features of metabolic syndrome or increase the risk for developing diabetes. Several clinical trials suggest that thiazide-induced hyperuricemia and hypokalemia may account for some of these negative effects. Thiazide treatment is also associated with a decline of renal function despite lowering blood pressure. In this review, we discuss the clinical and experimental evidence supporting a potential role of hyperuricemia and hypokalemia in the development of renal injury and worsening of the metabolic syndrome.

Hyperuricemia and hypokalemia may have pivotal roles in the exacerbation of the metabolic syndrome in response to thiazides. We propose that controlling serum uric acid and serum potassium could improve thiazide efficacy and also reduce its risk for inducing metabolic syndrome or diabetes.

### Potassium homeostasis in health and disease: A scientific workshop cosponsored by the National Kidney Foundation and the American Society of Hypertension [^116bwBmz]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

While much emphasis, along with some controversy, centers on recommendations for sodium intake, there has been considerably less interest in dietary potassium intake recommendations, both in the general population and patients with medical conditions, particularly acute and chronic kidney disease. Physiology literature and cohort studies have noted that the relative balance of sodium and potassium intake is an important determinant of many sodium-related outcomes.

A noteworthy characteristic of potassium in clinical medicine is the extreme concern shared by many practitioners when confronted by a patient with hyperkalemia. Fear of this often asymptomatic finding limits enthusiasm for recommending potassium intake and often restricts the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney diseases. New agents for managing hyperkalemia may alter the long-term management of heart failure, hypertension, proteinuria, and further function loss in chronic kidney diseases.

In this jointly sponsored effort between the American Society of Hypertension and the National Kidney Foundation, three panels of researchers and practitioners from various disciplines discussed and summarized the understanding of the role of potassium in health and disease. The focus was on cardiovascular, nutritional, and kidney considerations associated with both hypo- and hyperkalemia.

### Inspra [^1157fHU9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: HFrEF Post-MI: Initiate treatment with 25 mg once daily. Titrate to a maximum of 50 mg once daily within 4 weeks, as tolerated. Dose adjustments may be required based on potassium levels. Hypertension: Administer 50 mg once daily, alone or combined with other antihypertensive agents. For inadequate response, increase to 50 mg twice daily. Higher dosages are not recommended. Measure serum potassium before starting Inspra and periodically thereafter.

- **Heart failure post-myocardial infarction**: Begin treatment at 25 mg once daily and adjust to the recommended dose of 50 mg once daily, preferably within 4 weeks, as tolerated. Adjust the dose based on the serum potassium level following initiation of Inspra.

- **Hypertension**: The recommended starting dose of Inspra is 50 mg administered once daily, with the full therapeutic effect apparent within 4 weeks. If the blood pressure response is inadequate at 50 mg once daily, increase the dosage to 50 mg twice daily. Higher dosages are not recommended due to lack of additional blood pressure effect and increased risk of hyperkalemia.

- **Recommended monitoring**: Measure serum potassium before initiating Inspra therapy, within the first week, and at one month after the start of treatment or dose adjustment. Continue to assess serum potassium periodically thereafter.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^112sz5un]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Our findings of low rates of potassium monitoring among new ACE‐I and ARB users are at odds with various scientific societies' recommendations but nonetheless consistent with observations in American cohorts. A recent study by Chang and colleagues, evaluating the prevalence of hyperkalemia and monitoring patterns in patients on antihypertensive medications, reported that 20% of the population did not have serum potassium checked within a 3‐year period, including 6% of patients on an ACE‐I and 5% of patients on an ARB. Raebel and colleagues evaluated a prevalent population of patients using ACE‐I or ARB therapy and found similar rates of monitoring over 1 year. Our study adds to the existing literature by reporting testing in new ACE‐I or ARB users, a population in which KDOQI, KDIGO, and American Heart Association guidelines provide specific recommendations for testing.

Hyperkalemia is a noteworthy adverse event, with even modest elevations in potassium relating to mortality. Moreover, concern regarding the risk of hyperkalemia may preclude optimal prescribing practices. A Turkish study investigating barriers to the use of ACE‐I and ARB therapy in chronic kidney disease patients reported that hyperkalemia was the most common reason for the discontinuation of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockers; other studies have attributed underutilization to similar reasons. Although clinical trials of ACE‐I or ARB therapy have reported low rates of hyperkalemia in both treatment and control arms, populations tend to be highly selected and monitored.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^1137mjsn]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hyperkalemia, particularly with respect to indications for screening before initiating RAAS inhibitors, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with a baseline serum potassium level greater than 5.0 mmol/L or an eGFR less than 30 mL/min.

### Hydrochlorothiazide [^114MQkPf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response, using the smallest dosage necessary to achieve the required response.

- **Adults: For edema**: The usual adult dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily, administered as a single or divided dose. Many patients with edema respond to intermittent therapy, such as administration on alternate days or 3 to 5 days each week. With an intermittent schedule, excessive response and resulting undesirable electrolyte imbalance are less likely.

- **For control of hypertension**: The usual initial dose in adults is 25 mg daily given as a single dose. The dose may be increased to 50 mg daily, administered as a single dose or two divided doses. Doses above 50 mg are often associated with marked reductions in serum potassium (see also PRECAUTIONS).

Patients usually do not require doses in excess of 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily when used in conjunction with other antihypertensive agents.

- **Infants and children**: For diuresis and for control of hypertension, the usual pediatric dosage ranges from 0.5 mg to 1 mg per pound (1 to 2 mg/kg) per day in single or two divided doses. It should not exceed 37.5 mg per day in infants up to 2 years of age or 100 mg per day in children aged 2 to 12 years. In infants less than 6 months of age, doses up to 1.5 mg per pound (3 mg/kg) per day in two divided doses may be required (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use).

### Diovan [^115zG4Xf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Agents increasing serum potassium**: Concomitant use of valsartan with other agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that may increase potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. In heart failure patients, this may also lead to increases in serum creatinine. If co-medication is considered necessary, monitoring of serum potassium is advisable.

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving valsartan and NSAID therapy.

	- The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

- **Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)**: Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^114MxsNz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In this large, population-based study of new users of ACE-I or ARB therapy, we demonstrate that adherence to guideline-recommended electrolyte monitoring was poor. Less than one third of patients had a potassium measurement within 30 days of starting an ACE-I or ARB, and only 76% had one in the year following medication initiation. On the other hand, the 1-year occurrence of hyperkalemia was generally quite low in those with potassium measurements, the majority of whom had preserved eGFR, with only 1.7% developing potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L. People without potassium measurements tended to be of low predicted risk. These results suggest that more targeted protocols for monitoring potassium levels after ACE-I/ARB initiation may be cost-effective and safe.

There was a large increase in hyperkalemia risk among persons with low eGFR, a risk that was also present to a lesser extent in matched new users of β-blocker therapy. This may suggest a need for heightened potassium monitoring in patients with reduced eGFR, even those taking medications thought to have only small effects on potassium, such as β-blockers. Other strong risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia on ACE-I or ARB therapy included higher baseline potassium levels, the concomitant use of K-sparing diuretics, and the presence of diabetes mellitus or heart failure. The combination of these factors into a susceptibility score may allay provider concerns regarding the risk of hyperkalemia in low-risk patients, encouraging greater prescription in patients with indications for ACE-I or ARB therapy.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: Probably not O"K" [^111mX8fu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

**Summary of monitoring**: The current guidelines recommend monitoring potassium and renal function after starting treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (i) and mineralocorticoid antagonists. It is crucial to consider the implications on potassium levels, as these medications can impact hyperkalemia management. Key terms include ACE-I (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), ARB (angiotensin II receptor blocker), and GFR (glomerular filtration rate).

### Potassium homeostasis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors [^1155wSxQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key strategy in treating hypertension and cardiovascular and renal diseases. However, RAAS inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors, increase the risk of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L). This review evaluates the effects of RAAS inhibitors on serum potassium levels.

Using PubMed, we searched for clinical trials published up to December 2008 that assessed the effects on serum potassium levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors, alone and in combination, in patients with hypertension, heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD). A total of 39 studies were identified.

In patients with hypertension without risk factors for hyperkalemia, the incidence of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitor monotherapy is low (≤ 2%), whereas rates are higher with dual RAAS inhibition (approximately 5%). The incidence of hyperkalemia is also increased in patients with HF or CKD (5% to 10%). However, increases in serum potassium levels are small (approximately 0.1 to 0.3 mmol/L), and rates of study discontinuation due to hyperkalemia are low, even in high-risk patient groups (1% to 5%).

Patients with HF or CKD are at greater risk of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitors than those without these conditions. However, the absolute changes in serum potassium are generally small and unlikely to be clinically significant. Moreover…

### Diabetes and drug-associated hyperkalemia: Effect of potassium monitoring [^114e5XRp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are associated with hyperkalemia, but there is little evidence demonstrating that patients who receive potassium monitoring have a lower rate of hyperkalemia.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the association between potassium monitoring and serious hyperkalemia-associated adverse outcomes among patients with diabetes newly initiating RAAS inhibitor therapy.

- **Design**: Retrospective observational study.

- **Participants**: Patients with diabetes without end-stage renal disease initiating RAAS inhibitor therapy between 2001 and 2006 at three integrated health care systems.

- **Measurements**: Potassium monitoring and first hyperkalemia-associated adverse event during the initial year of therapy. Hyperkalemia-associated adverse events included hospitalizations, emergency department visits, or deaths within 24 hours of hyperkalemia diagnosis and/or diagnostic potassium ≥ 6 mmol/l. Incidence rates were calculated in person-years (p-y). We used inverse probability propensity score weighting to adjust for differences between patients with and without monitoring; Poisson regression was used to obtain adjusted relative risks.

- **Results**: A total of 19,391 of 27,355 patients (71%) received potassium monitoring. Serious hyperkalemia-associated events occurred at an incidence rate of 10.2 per 1,000 p-y. Compared to patients without monitoring, the adjusted relative risk of hyperkalemia-associated adverse events among all patients with monitoring was 0.50 (0.37, 0.66); in the subset of patients who also had chronic kidney disease (n = 2,176), adjusted relative risk…

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^114WwTAf]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperkalemia, particularly concerning patients on RAAS inhibitor therapy, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining urea and electrolytes testing before initiating ACE inhibitors or ARBs. These drugs should be used with caution if the serum potassium level is greater than 5.0 mmol.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^115PLjUM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis was conducted with baseline characteristics displayed as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range, depending on the distribution. Patient characteristics were stratified by the availability of potassium measurements in the year following the initiation of ACE-I or ARB. The proportion of patients experiencing elevated potassium levels during the year was further stratified by eGFR categories (≥ 90, 60–89, 45–59, 30–44, and < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) and the number of checks in the year following medication initiation.

A susceptibility score for the development of potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L in the year following medication initiation was developed among the 68,880 new users of ACE-I or ARB therapy who had baseline potassium levels < 5 mmol/L. Inputs for the susceptibility score were selected based on factors with significant coefficients in logistic regression, including sex, baseline potassium level, eGFR, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and the use of K-sparing diuretics. These factors were used to predict the risk of hyperkalemia in the year after ACE-I or ARB initiation. Discrimination and calibration were tested by calculating the area under the curve (C-index) and plotting deciles of predicted risk.

### Management of hypertension and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade in adults with diabetic kidney disease: Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and the Renal Association UK guideline update 2021 [^116oGqQJ]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

In the UK, NICE guidance suggests measuring serum potassium and eGFR before starting RAAS blockade and repeating the measurements 1–2 weeks after starting RAAS blockade and after each dose increase. NICE further advises not to offer these agents if the person's pre-treatment serum potassium is greater than 5 mmol/L. Additionally, NICE guidance suggests that these agents should be stopped if the serum potassium concentration increases to 6 mmol/L or more and other drugs known to promote hyperkalaemia have been discontinued. However, recent NICE technology appraisals recommend the use of potassium binders, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, in outpatient care for people with persistent hyperkalaemia (≥ 6 mmol/L) and CKD stages 3b to 5 (non-dialysis), who are not taking an optimum dose of RAAS inhibitor because of hyperkalaemia.

Given the basic pathophysiological mechanism of RAAS blockade, these agents cause a reduction in eGFR and urinary albumin excretion through efferent and afferent glomerular arteriolar dilatation, resulting in a fall in intra-glomerular blood pressure. A reversible reduction of eGFR of up to 30% can be expected. Greater reductions may indicate underlying renal artery stenosis.

NICE guidance states that if there is a decrease in eGFR of greater than 25% or an increase in serum creatinine of greater than 30% with RAAS blockade, renal function tests need to be repeated within 1–2 weeks. If the eGFR drops by 25% or more, or there is a change in serum creatinine by 30% or more, NICE guidance suggests conducting further investigations.

### Should an abnormal serum potassium concentration be considered a correctable cause of cardiac arrest [^113XZa8H]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

According to the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Practice Guidelines, electrolyte abnormalities, including abnormal serum potassium concentrations, are considered a correctable cause of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular defibrillator therapy in this situation is a class III indication, thought to be ineffective and perhaps harmful, although there are minimal data to support this recommendation. The steady-state serum potassium concentration frequently changes during cardiac arrest. Additionally, the vast majority of cardiac arrest patients have structural heart disease and are commonly treated with a variety of medications that can alter the serum potassium concentration.

In the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) trial, patients with a correctable cause of electrolyte imbalance were excluded from study participation but were followed in the AVID registry. Similar outcomes were observed among patients in the AVID registry and the main trial. Spironolactone therapy in patients with congestive heart failure decreases all-cause mortality and sudden and nonsudden cardiac death. In a preliminary study of 169 patients with an episode of a sustained ventricular arrhythmia treated with an implantable defibrillator, freedom from appropriate defibrillator therapy was 18% after five years. The probability of appropriate defibrillator therapy was independent of the initial serum potassium concentration. For these reasons, our clinical practice is to use an implantable defibrillator to treat an initial episode.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114yMY2E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

In the general non-black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add-on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If the goal BP is not reached within one month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug, and if the goal BP cannot be reached with two drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom the goal BP cannot be attained.

- **Basis of recommendations**: In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories. For the non-black population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first-line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP-lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of more than 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of six different thiazide diuretics. Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose-dependent effect.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Potassium-sparing diuretics**: Use with potassium-sparing diuretics can produce severe hyperkalemia; avoid concomitant use.
	- **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors**: Use with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors results in potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Potassium supplements should be given to patients receiving ACE inhibitors only with close monitoring.
	- **Angiotensin receptor blockers**: Use with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) results in potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Potassium supplements should be given to patients receiving ARBs only with close monitoring.

### Revisiting RAAS blockade in CKD with newer potassium-binding drugs [^111e9CNv]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Among patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), guideline recommendations mandate the use of agents blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as first-line antihypertensive therapy based on randomized trials demonstrating that RAAS inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive drug classes in slowing nephropathy progression to end-stage renal disease. However, the opportunities for adequate RAAS blockade in CKD are often limited, and an important impediment is the risk of hyperkalemia, especially when RAAS inhibitors are used in maximal doses or are combined.

Accordingly, a large proportion of patients with proteinuric CKD may not have the anticipated renoprotective benefits since RAAS blockers are often discontinued due to incident hyperkalemia or are administered at suboptimal doses for fear of the development of hyperkalemia. Two newer potassium binders, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS-9), have been shown to effectively and safely reduce serum potassium levels and maintain long-term normokalemia in CKD patients receiving background therapy with RAAS inhibitors. Whether these novel potassium-lowering therapies can overcome the barrier of hyperkalemia and enhance the tolerability of RAAS inhibitor use in proteinuric CKD awaits randomized trials.

### Developing prediction models for electrolyte abnormalities in patients indicated for antihypertensive therapy: Evidence-based treatment and monitoring recommendations [^111rxKLc]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

In this study, the modeling approach took into account the competing risk of death from causes not related to the outcomes of interest. This consideration is particularly important when using the model in older patients with multiple health conditions or risk factors, as failure to account for competing risks can lead to overestimating an individual's benefit from antihypertensive treatment.

The prevalence of hyperkalemia and hyponatremia varies significantly depending on the definition of the event and the healthcare setting. We defined the outcomes of interest as a combination of diagnostic codes and blood test results within two years of the index date, using the diagnostic criteria set out in NICE guidelines. The potassium threshold for hyperkalemia was more than 5.5 mmol/l, and the sodium threshold for hyponatremia was less than 135 mEq/l. However, laboratories analyzing these samples adopt different reference standards, such as normal potassium levels between 3.5–5 and 3.5–5.3 mmol/l, reflecting changes in guidelines over the years. Using these reference ranges would have been advantageous, as they were used by clinicians to interpret the test results, but this would have also resulted in a much less consistent definition.

We encountered a large amount of missing data for some predictor variables, especially ethnicity and eGFR, but this was addressed through the use of multiple imputation. In addition, this study included predefined variables based on the literature and expert opinion. However, it is possible that some important predictors were not included, which could impact the model's overall predictive accuracy.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically concerning the choice of antihypertensives, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering serum potassium monitoring in patients taking potassium-sparing medications. This includes some diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or spironolactone, especially if dietary potassium is being increased.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111poCTc]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Thiazide diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics (e.g. chlorthalidone and indapamide) were the primary drugs tested in landmark randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that demonstrated the high degree of efficacy of blood pressure (BP) lowering in preventing major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, there are no RCTs comparing the efficacy of different thiazides, alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics, to prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Indirect comparisons by meta-analyses and evidence from observational studies returned conflicting results.

Comparisons of the BP-lowering effect of the several thiazides, alone and associated with potassium-sparing agents, have been rarely investigated in head-to-head clinical trials. The effect of amiloride and triamterene on BP remained uncertain and was not identified in a systematic review of six double-blind RCTs with a total of 496 participants. In two isolated trials, however, amiloride increased the BP-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. Amiloride may be effective in resistant hypertension, particularly at higher doses. Potassium supplementation has a BP-lowering effect, and the replacement of a proportion of sodium chloride with potassium chloride in meals reduced BP. A pioneering nutritional RCT showed that replacing 25% of the sodium chloride content with potassium chloride was associated with reducing the incidence of major cardiovascular events and death. The antihypertensive efficacy of spironolactone and eplerenone have been well documented.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) Project [^114LBRqk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The prediction of hyperkalemia following the initiation of ACE‐I or ARB therapy was assessed by evaluating the susceptibility score. This score predicts the probability of developing potassium levels greater than 5.5 mmol/L in the year following ACE‐I or ARB initiation, and it was found to vary by patient profile. Among new users of ACE‐I or ARB therapy in the SCREAM cohort, 91.8% had a predicted risk of exceeding 20%. Conversely, the risk among those who did not have potassium checks within the first year was notably different, with 95.6% having a predicted risk greater than 20%.

- **Patient profiles**:
	- The risk varied significantly depending on the patients' eGFR levels and baseline potassium levels. Patients with relatively preserved eGFR or those with baseline potassium levels below 5.5 mmol/L were at a lower risk. In contrast, those with lower eGFR or higher baseline potassium levels had an elevated risk post-medication initiation.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^114iM1Rc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

A susceptibility score for the development of potassium levels greater than 5.5 mmol/L was analyzed using factors such as sex, baseline potassium, eGFR, the presence of diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and the concomitant use of K-sparing diuretics. This approach demonstrated excellent discrimination, with a C-index of 0.854 (95% CI: 0.840–0.869) in the SCREAM cohort, accompanied by good calibration within this group. Validation of these findings was performed in the US-based Geisinger Health System, a population characterized by older age, a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and diuretic use, and elevated baseline potassium levels. The discrimination and calibration remained excellent, yielding a C-index of 0.818 (95% CI: 0.794–0.841). Notably, a slightly higher proportion of Geisinger patients had their potassium levels checked in the year following ACE-I or ARB initiation (79%), and the incidence of potassium levels exceeding 5 and 5.5 mmol/L was also slightly increased at 11.6% and 2.8%, respectively.

### Real-world associations between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy, hyperkalemia, and outcomes: A clinical and scientific call to action [^111r5wu5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

First, appropriate monitoring of patients at the initiation and shortly after the commencement of therapy with RAASi is critical. Careful monitoring and cautious dose adjustment are absolutely essential to successfully maintain high-risk patients on maximal RAASi therapy.

Before starting or changing the RAASi dose, it is necessary to completely review prescribed medications (e.g. trimethoprim or β-blockers, both shown to increase serum potassium) and over-the-counter medications (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents), in addition to assessing intravascular volume status. Having an accurate assessment of the patient's ideal weight is helpful in this regard. Patients significantly lower than their target body weight may already be sodium avid and not provide the distal sodium delivery needed to support potassium excretion. Patients who are significantly greater than their target body weight may have cardiac decompensation, which will reduce renal blood flow, activate the RAAS, and reduce distal sodium delivery.

It is important to avoid starting or increasing the RAASi dose until patients are optimized with regard to intravascular volume, have stable kidney function, and when other medications that increase serum potassium have been stopped or reduced as much as possible. Clearly, starting RAASi in the setting of hyperkalemia is not advisable. Repeat laboratory testing 10 to 14 days after delaying or after starting or changing the RAASi dose is important and should include close monitoring once a stable RAASi dose is achieved. The intervals for monitoring should be carefully planned to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should it be [^115f546D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the thiazide-like and thiazide-type diuretics are clinically relevant to consider. Hydrochlorothiazide has a shorter duration of action (24 hours) compared to chlorthalidone (48–72 hours), and it is less potent per milligram than chlorthalidone and indapamide. Additionally, hydrochlorothiazide has inferior 24-hour and nighttime blood pressure control compared with chlorthalidone.

When considering tolerability, chlorthalidone likely carries an increased risk of hypokalemia. Indapamide may offer the best tolerability, as hypokalemia appears to occur less frequently than with hydrochlorothiazide. Indapamide has neutral effects on serum glucose and lipids, whereas hydrochlorothiazide does not.

It is important to consider that the antihypertensive and metabolic adverse effects of the thiazide diuretics may not be the same across all racial and ethnic groups. A post hoc analysis of the PEAR (Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses) and PEAR-2 clinical trials, which randomized patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension but without diabetes or prior cardiovascular disease to hydrochlorothiazide (PEAR-1) and chlorthalidone (PEAR-2) or a beta blocker, found that chlorthalidone was more potent than hydrochlorothiazide in both Black and White patients. However, Black patients had robust blood pressure decreases with both hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone, resulting in a smaller differential between the two agents.

### Adverse events after initiating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy in individuals with heart failure and multimorbidity [^1119z5yG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend routine kidney function and serum potassium testing within 30 days of initiating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. However, evidence is lacking on whether routine follow-up testing reduces therapy-related adverse events in adults with heart failure and if multimorbidity influences the association between laboratory testing and these adverse events.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among adults with heart failure from four U.S. integrated health care delivery systems. Multimorbidity was defined using counts of chronic conditions. Patients with outpatient serum creatinine and potassium tests in the 30 days after starting ACEI or ARB therapy were matched 1:1 to patients without follow-up tests. We evaluated the association of follow-up testing with 30-day all-cause mortality and hospitalization with acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia using Cox regression.

- **Results**: We identified 3,629 matched adults with heart failure initiating ACEI or ARB therapy between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012. Follow-up testing was not significantly associated with 30-day all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14; 1.39) and hospitalization with hyperkalemia (aHR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.33; 1.61). However, follow-up testing was significantly associated with hospitalization with acute kidney injury (aHR 1.40, 95% CI, 1.01; 1.94). Interaction between multimorbidity burden and follow-up testing was not statistically significant.

### Enalaprilat [^117TnhXv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include an assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

- **Hyperkalemia**: Elevated serum potassium (greater than 5.7 mEq/L) was observed in approximately one percent of hypertensive patients in clinical trials receiving enalapril. In most cases, these were isolated values that resolved despite continued therapy. Hyperkalemia was a cause of discontinuation of therapy in 0.28 percent of hypertensive patients. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing agents or potassium supplements, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with enalaprilat injection (see Drug Interactions).

- **Cough**: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

- **Surgery/Anesthesia**: In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, enalapril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

### Real-world associations between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy, hyperkalemia, and outcomes: A clinical and scientific call to action [^116CkBtM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

We propose that if normokalemia with serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L can be achieved with diet and drug modifications, treatment with optimal and maximal RAASi dosing should be continued. Compelling modeling data from Evans and colleagues demonstrate that the treatment of hyperkalemia, which allows for continued RAASi use, leads to longer life expectancy, delayed progression to end-stage renal disease, quality-adjusted life year gains, and cost savings in CKD populations.

The available data do not yet provide conclusive evidence of the potential impact on maintaining normokalemia with potassium binders to allow for RAASi use. We need further clinical studies of patients with CHF and advanced CKD taking chronic RAASi in order to evaluate the safety and tolerability with long-term use of potassium binders for the maintenance of normokalemia.

### Hyperkalemia and maintenance of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy after initiating SGLT-2 or DPP-4 inhibitors [^116uDr3N]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

Additional strengths of our study include the use of a target trial emulation, which mitigates time-related biases such as immortal and survivor bias, and the setting of a universal tax-funded health system, which minimizes selection bias from disparate access to health care. We ascertained treatment duration with precision by capturing the totality of pharmacy dispensations in our country, which is a more accurate surrogate of drug intake than a doctor's prescription (i.e. intention).

Limitations of our study include the lack of information on confounders such as dietary potassium intake, BMI, bicarbonate levels, or the use of potassium-containing supplements. However, our modeling of positive and negative control outcomes and our comparison of rates of potassium testing between treatment strategies suggest our findings to be potentially robust to uncontrolled confounding and detection bias. A final limitation is the lack of information on race, thus limiting the generalizability of our findings to other world regions with larger ethnic diversity.

To conclude, in this cohort study of patients with T2D managed in routine care, SGLT-2i initiation was associated with a lower risk of hyperkalemia compared to DPP-4i. However, this was not accompanied by higher persistence on RASi therapy.

### Zestoretic [^117JMbdM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide: Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

- **Monitoring thiazide therapy**: All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance, namely hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of the cause, include:
	- **General symptoms**: Dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures
	- **Muscular symptoms**: Muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue
	- **Cardiovascular symptoms**: Hypotension, tachycardia
	- **Urinary symptoms**: Oliguria
	- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, vomiting

- **Risks of hypokalemia**: Hypokalemia may develop especially with brisk diuresis, in the presence of severe cirrhosis, or after prolonged therapy. Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis, such as increased ventricular irritability. Because lisinopril reduces the production of aldosterone, concomitant therapy with lisinopril attenuates the diuretic-induced potassium loss (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Agents Increasing Serum Potassium).

- **Restore normal serum potassium levels**: This is recommended for patients who develop hypokalemia while on the kaliuretic diuretic.
- **Prevent development of hypokalemia**: This is crucial for patients who are at particular risk if hypokalemia develops, such as digitalized patients or those with significant cardiac arrhythmias.

Use of potassium-conserving agents is often unnecessary in patients receiving diuretics for uncomplicated essential hypertension when such patients have a normal diet. Amiloride HCl has little additive diuretic or antihypertensive effect when added to a thiazide diuretic.

Amiloride HCl should rarely be used alone. It has weak diuretic and antihypertensive effects compared with thiazides. Used as single agents, potassium-sparing diuretics, including amiloride HCl, result in an increased risk of hyperkalemia (approximately 10% with amiloride). Amiloride HCl should be used alone only when persistent hypokalemia has been documented, and only with careful titration of the dose and close monitoring of serum electrolytes.

### Effects of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker on potassium in CAPD patients [^116hMuC6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have shown numerous benefits to the cardiovascular system. However, using both drugs is associated with hyperkalemia, especially in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. To the authors' knowledge, there has been no prospective systematic study of the safety and potassium homeostasis of both drugs in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients.

- **Methods**: Twenty-nine stable, normokalemic CAPD patients without potassium-interference drugs were selected randomly to receive, for 4-week periods, 8 mg candesartan or 10 mg enalapril daily. After completion of the initial drug, both treatment groups were crossed.

- **Results**: Twenty-one patients completed the study. Baseline blood pressure, serum potassium level, plasma aldosterone, adequacy of dialysis, and residual renal function were not different between both groups. For the total group, serum potassium changes were not significantly different between baseline and at 4 weeks after treatment in both groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L [mmol/L]) was 13% and not different between groups. Nine of 11 events of hyperkalemia were associated with Kt/V urea less than 2, and 8 of 11 had low or low-average peritoneal equilibrium tests.

- **Conclusion**: In ESRD patients on CAPD, the standard dose of ACE inhibitor, enalapril, or ARB, candesartan, has little effect on serum potassium, despite drops in plasma aldosterone observed. Both drugs should be considered in CAPD patients with hypertension or cardi…

### Kidney function and potassium monitoring after initiation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade therapy and outcomes in 2 North American populations [^114xzkea]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend routine kidney function and serum potassium testing within 30 days of initiating ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy; however, evidence is lacking about whether follow-up testing reduces therapy-related adverse outcomes.

- **Methods and results**: We conducted two population-based retrospective cohort studies in Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Ontario, Canada. Patients with outpatient serum creatinine and potassium tests in the 30 days after starting ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy were matched 1:1 to patients without follow-up tests. We evaluated the association of follow-up testing with 30-day all-cause mortality and hospitalization with acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia using Cox regression. We also developed and externally validated a risk score to identify patients at risk of having abnormally high serum creatinine and potassium values in follow-up. We identified 75,251 matched pairs initiating ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2017, in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Follow-up testing was not significantly associated with 30-day all-cause mortality in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.54–1.06]) and was associated with higher mortality in 84,905 matched pairs in Ontario (hazard ratio, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.07–1.62]). In Kaiser Permanente Northern California, follow-up testing was significantly associated with higher rates of hospitalization.

### Serum potassium in the PARADIGM-HF trial [^112ncCfK]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Compared with enalapril, sacubitril–valsartan had little effect on potassium levels in PARADIGM‐HF overall. However, in participants treated with an MRA, sacubitril–valsartan significantly reduced potassium levels when compared to enalapril, maintaining levels within the normal range, similar to those in patients not treated with MRAs. One possible, but speculative, explanation for the lower potassium levels in the sacubitril–valsartan group is that sacubitril–valsartan improved renal function compared to enalapril. This may have led to greater distal delivery of loop diuretic and increased potassium excretion. A previous report demonstrated that sacubitril–valsartan reduced the risk for hyperkalemia in patients treated with an MRA. The present study expands upon those findings by comparing the effects of sacubitril–valsartan with those of enalapril across the full spectrum of potassium concentrations. Furthermore, the benefit of sacubitril–valsartan over enalapril was consistent across the range of baseline potassium levels among patients randomized in PARADIGM‐HF.

- **Limitations**: This was a post hoc analysis of the PARADIGM‐HF trial. The patients were highly selected, tolerating recommended doses of enalapril and sacubitril–valsartan during a run‐in period. Although this reduces the generalizability of the findings, the trial design also addresses limitations of earlier studies. Regular monitoring of potassium and protocol-guided mitigation may have led to the correction of potassium abnormalities more frequently or more quickly than in routine practice.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^1176vexx]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperkalemia, particularly in patients on RAAS inhibitor therapy, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend considering an increase in the frequency of monitoring for patients with a serum potassium level of 5.5–5.9 mmol/L.

### Trandolapril [^116jarrq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Trandolapril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (such as spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be used with caution and with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium levels.

- **Antidiabetic agents**: Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and antidiabetic medicines (insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents) may cause an increased blood glucose-lowering effect with a greater risk of hypoglycemia.

- **Lithium**: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors such as trandolapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients.

### Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide [^112L4eyx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Contraindications**: Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules should not be administered to patients receiving other potassium-sparing agents such as spironolactone, amiloride, or other formulations containing triamterene. Concomitant potassium-containing salt substitutes should also not be used.

Potassium supplementation should only be considered in cases of severe hypokalemia when using triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules. Such combined therapy can rapidly increase serum potassium levels, necessitating careful monitoring.

Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules are contraindicated in patients with anuria, acute and chronic renal insufficiency, or significant renal impairment.

Hypersensitivity to either drug in the preparation or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs is also a contraindication.

Use of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules is not recommended for patients with pre-existing elevated serum potassium.

### Hydrochlorothiazide [^1127mcwY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide capsules, USP, are indicated for managing hypertension, either as the sole therapeutic agent or in combination with other antihypertensives. Unlike potassium-sparing combination diuretic products, hydrochlorothiazide may be used in patients where the development of hyperkalemia cannot be risked, including those taking ACE inhibitors.

Usage in pregnancy: The routine use of diuretics in an otherwise healthy woman is inappropriate and exposes both the mother and fetus to unnecessary hazard. Diuretics do not prevent the development of toxemia of pregnancy, and there is no satisfactory evidence that they are useful in treating developed toxemia.

Edema during pregnancy may arise from pathological causes or the physiological and mechanical consequences of pregnancy. Diuretics are indicated in pregnancy when edema is due to pathological causes, just as in the absence of pregnancy. Dependent edema in pregnancy, resulting from restricted venous return by the expanded uterus, is properly treated through elevation of the lower extremities and the use of support hose; using diuretics to lower intravascular volume in this case is illogical and unnecessary.

There is hypervolemia during normal pregnancy, which is harmful to neither the fetus nor the mother in the absence of cardiovascular disease, but is associated with edema, including generalized edema in most pregnant women. If this edema produces discomfort, increased recumbency will often provide relief.

### Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide [^1123DA34]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Laboratory tests:

- **Serum potassium**: The normal adult range of serum potassium is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L, with 4.5 mEq often being used as a reference point. If hypokalemia should develop, corrective measures, such as potassium supplementation or increased dietary intake of potassium-rich foods, should be taken. Institute such measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels. Potassium levels persistently above 6 mEq/L require careful observation and treatment. Serum potassium levels do not necessarily indicate true body potassium concentration. A rise in plasma pH may cause a decrease in plasma potassium concentration and an increase in intracellular potassium concentration. Discontinue corrective measures for hypokalemia immediately if laboratory determinations reveal an abnormal elevation of serum potassium. Discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules and substitute a thiazide diuretic alone until potassium levels return to normal.

- **Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen**: Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules may produce elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, creatinine levels, or both. This effect is apparently secondary to a reversible reduction of glomerular filtration rate or a depletion of intravascular fluid volume (prerenal azotemia) rather than renal toxicity. Levels usually return to normal when triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules are discontinued. If azotemia increases, discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules. Periodic BUN or serum creatinine determinations should be made, especially in elderly patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^1137Uw8k]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperkalemia, specifically concerning patients on RAAS inhibitor therapy, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with a baseline serum potassium level greater than 5.0 mmol/L or an eGFR less than 30 mL/min.

### Arbli [^1149fizo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Agents increasing serum potassium**: Co-administration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

- **Lithium**: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including losartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including losartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

- **Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)**: Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.

### Potassium chloride [^111RuL44]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia. These patients, particularly those on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range due to the potential for developing hyperkalemia. The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently, and renal function should be assessed periodically.

### Real-world associations between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy, hyperkalemia, and outcomes: A clinical and scientific call to action [^115KejBM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Importantly, hyperkalemia and hypokalemia have been shown to independently contribute to mortality in several observational studies. Collins and colleagues published data in 2017 from over 900,000 patients demonstrating that all-cause mortality continuously increased with potassium values above or below the 4.0 to 5.0 mEq/L range. Additionally, in a large meta-analysis of population-based evaluations of dietary sodium and potassium intake, reduced potassium intake is significantly associated with patient mortality. With all of these concerns, how do we rectify the competing risks and benefits of RAAS inhibition therapy and hyperkalemia in CHF and CKD patients?

### Potassium chloride [^115VmnK9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Drug interactions are critical to consider when prescribing potassium chloride.

- **Potassium-sparing diuretics**: Use with potassium-sparing diuretics can produce severe hyperkalemia; hence, avoid concomitant use.

- **Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors**: Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), spironolactone, eplerenone, or aliskiren, can lead to potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. It is crucial to closely monitor potassium levels in patients receiving concomitant RAAS therapy.

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: NSAIDs may cause potassium retention by reducing renal synthesis of prostaglandin E and impairing the renin-angiotensin system. Close monitoring of potassium is essential in patients on concomitant NSAIDs.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^11775u4N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Valsartan:

- **Agents increasing serum potassium**: Concomitant use of valsartan with other agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that may increase potassium levels (e.g. heparin), may lead to increases in serum potassium and in heart failure patients, increases in serum creatinine. If co-medication is considered necessary, monitoring of serum potassium is advisable.

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving valsartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

- **Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)**: Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS.

### Potassium management with finerenone: Practical aspects [^116aq76K]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Although hyperkalemia was increased in both trials, the incidence of hyperkalemia-related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalemia-related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone versus 0.6% with placebo. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations greater than 5.5 mmol/L were detected, until potassium concentrations fell to less than 5.0 mmol/L. With a robust potassium management strategy guided by regular monitoring of serum potassium, there were no hyperkalemia-related deaths in more than 13,000 patients over a median follow-up of 3 years.

### Serum potassium in the PARADIGM-HF trial [^111Xpr2x]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Potassium is essential for normal cellular function, and alterations in its regulation can lead to gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and cardiac abnormalities, some of which can be life-threatening. The treatments used in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) commonly cause potassium disturbances. Hypokalaemia is induced by loop and thiazide diuretics, while hyperkalaemia results from the use of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. Although the clinical significance, and even the definition, of hyperkalaemia is a matter of debate, higher potassium concentrations often lead to the withholding or withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors, which are life-saving therapies in patients with HFrEF. However, hypokalaemia may be of as much concern as hyperkalaemia in HFrEF because in other groups of individuals (e.g. the general population and patients with myocardial infarction, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease), the relationship between potassium concentration and clinical outcomes is U-shaped, and both low and high potassium levels are associated with worse outcomes.

The effects of sacubitril–valsartan on potassium have not been described in detail and may differ from those of enalapril, as sacubitril–valsartan reduces aldosterone, a key regulator of potassium. The sacubitril–valsartan combination probably lowers aldosterone because natriuretic peptides are powerful inhibitors of aldosterone secretion, and neprilysin inhibition (sacubitril) increases natriuretic peptide levels.

### Serum potassium in the PARADIGM-HF trial [^111Sp68S]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

The design, methods, and principal results of the PARADIGM-HF trial have been previously reported. In brief, the trial was a randomized, double-blind, prospective comparison of the effect of sacubitril (97 mg) and valsartan (103 mg) administered twice daily (LCZ696, 200 mg twice daily) and that of enalapril (10 mg twice daily) in 8,399 patients with chronic heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II–IV] and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 40%. Prior to randomization, all participants underwent single-blind, sequential run-in periods to ensure the tolerability of both study drugs at target doses.

Eligible patients were those treated with an appropriate regimen of background heart failure medications at stable doses for at least four weeks, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (at a dose equivalent to enalapril 10 mg/day or greater) and a beta-blocker (unless not tolerated). The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was left to the discretion of the investigators but was encouraged if tolerated.

Key exclusion criteria included symptomatic hypotension, a systolic blood pressure (SBP) drop of 25% (amended to 35%) between screening and randomization, and a serum potassium level greater than 5.2 mmol/L at screening or greater than 5.4 mmol/L at randomization. Serum potassium was measured at every study visit.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^113yhrUv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Results

- **Baseline characteristics**: There were 69,426 patients who initiated ACE-I or ARB therapy from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2010. The majority of dispensations were for ACE-I therapy (82%; N = 56,943). Approximately half of the population were women (N = 35,270, 50.8%), and the average age was 55 years. The average predispensation potassium level was 4.1 mmol/L, and 9% (N = 6,341) of the population had an eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m². Of those participants with an available assessment of albuminuria (23%; N = 15,898), 20% had values between 30 and 299 mg/g, and 5% had values ≥ 300 mg/g.

- **Frequency of potassium monitoring**: Only one third (34%; N = 23,927) of new ACE-I or ARB users had potassium checked within 1 month of initiation, and 76% (N = 52,996) had potassium checked within the year after ACE-I or ARB initiation. Overall, those with potassium measurements in the year following ACE-I or ARB initiation were older, with more heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. They also had lower eGFR (87 mL/min per 1.73 m² versus 94 mL/min per 1.73 m², P < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² (10.6% versus 4.3%, P < 0.001). Of note, the average baseline potassium level was the same among patients with and without potassium monitoring (4.1 mmol/L in both groups).
