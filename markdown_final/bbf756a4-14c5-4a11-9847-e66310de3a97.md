## Question

Orthostatic hypotension dizziness syncope hostory of MS cardiologiy workup

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope in a patient with multiple sclerosis, with attention to the cardiology workup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core initial evaluation elements that separate cardiac from non-cardiac causes. Then, I should confirm the diagnostic criteria and testing approach for orthostatic hypotension, including nuances like supine hypertension and beat-to-beat monitoring for initial orthostatic hypotension. Next, I will distinguish neurogenic from non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and decide when to use autonomic testing. After that, I should risk-stratify for cardiac etiologies and decide on advanced testing. Then, I will consider orthostatic intolerance variants such as delayed OH and POTS. Finally, I will lay out mechanism-based management with MS-specific modifications and a follow-up plan, making sure to check for potential errors and correct them as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the essentials of the initial assessment because missing a cardiac cause would be consequential; history, a focused exam with orthostatic vitals, and a 12-lead ECG are mandatory in all patients with syncope or presyncope, and these steps already classify many patients without further testing, so I need to ensure I document triggers, posture, prodrome, medication exposures, hydration, and family history while checking supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate as well as performing a neurologic and cardiac exam with immediate ECG interpretation [^114yzfK9] [^115JuM62].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension before I anchor; I initially recalled that OH requires a fall of at least 30 mmHg systolic or 15 mmHg diastolic within 3 minutes of standing, but hold on, that 30/15 threshold applies when there is baseline supine hypertension, whereas the standard definition is a sustained fall of at least 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic within 3 minutes of standing or a decrease in systolic BP to less than 90 mmHg, ideally with reproduction of spontaneous symptoms, so I should measure after at least 5 minutes supine and at 1 and 3 minutes of active standing, documenting heart rate responses and using continuous beat-to-beat monitoring when short-lived changes like initial orthostatic hypotension are suspected [^112DCV2o] [^113q4c52] [^111jn2Ym] [^111uYiUy].

> I need to check the best testing sequence; active standing with intermittent measurements is the preferred initial test, but if the active stand is non-diagnostic and suspicion remains high, or if motor impairment from MS limits standing, head-up tilt testing is appropriate and can both reproduce symptoms and characterize patterns typical of reflex syncope, orthostatic hypotension, POTS, or psychogenic pseudosyncope, and continuous beat-to-beat BP/HR monitoring during tilt improves detection of transient phenomena like initial OH or delayed BP recovery, which I should not miss [^111uYiUy] [^111JYUVe].

> Next, I will examine whether this is neurogenic versus non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, because management hinges on that distinction; in neurogenic OH I should look for an inadequate heart rate rise with standing, often less than 10 bpm, coexisting autonomic symptoms such as urinary or bowel dysfunction, and supine hypertension, and if uncertain, I should proceed to autonomic function testing including heart rate variability, Valsalva BP/HR responses, and possibly supine and upright plasma catecholamines in specialized centers, given that MS can disrupt central autonomic pathways and produce neurogenic OH patterns [^114eAFTJ] [^113pcNNH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also rule out non-neurogenic contributors such as hypovolemia, anemia, and medication effects, and I must remember that orthostatic vital signs alone neither diagnose nor exclude orthostatic syncope in isolation, so I need to review and reduce hypotensive agents where feasible, especially alpha-1 antagonists and antipsychotics with alpha-1 blockade, which can worsen orthostatic drops in BP, and I should document any such exposures clearly in my plan [^112wpHns] [^116YoUNR] [^113Kqj5R] [^112Vtr17].

> I should double-check cardiac risk stratification next; if there are high-risk features such as structural heart disease, abnormal ECG, exertional syncope, or a family history of sudden cardiac death, I need to pivot toward echocardiography, ambulatory ECG monitoring with a Holter, patch, or loop recorder, exercise testing if exertional symptoms predominate, and electrophysiology study when conduction disease is suspected, while using validated ED rules and guideline-directed risk assessment to decide on urgency of cardiology involvement [^113q4c52] [^1146a5i6].

> Let me consider variants of orthostatic intolerance that might be relevant in MS and older adults; initial orthostatic hypotension causes a drop within the first 15 seconds of standing and requires beat-to-beat monitoring to capture, delayed orthostatic hypotension or delayed BP recovery can present after 3 minutes and may need prolonged standing or tilt, and POTS is defined by an HR rise of more than 30 bpm or to greater than 120 bpm within 10 minutes of standing without a BP drop, patterns that I should delineate because they change counseling and therapy selection [^111uYiUy] [^116C7kKC] [^114nQSqq].

> Now, I will initiate mechanism-based nonpharmacological management as first-line while I refine the mechanism; education on trigger avoidance and physical counter-pressure maneuvers, liberalizing fluids to about 2 to 2.5 liters per day and salt intake to roughly 8 to 10 grams daily when not contraindicated, acute ingestion of about 500 mL of water for transient relief, head-up sleeping to mitigate nocturnal diuresis and supine hypertension, slow transitions from supine to standing, and abdominal binders or graded compression garments are all evidence-supported and should be prioritized before adding medications, with explicit monitoring for supine hypertension as I intensify these measures [^113oZczM] [^115KVuKd] [^116GQAsP] [^117UP6Bb] [^115t83Pn] [^116vWgWS].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost mis-sequenced pharmacotherapy; my first thought was to start droxidopa broadly, but I should correct that because fludrocortisone and midodrine are typically first-line for persistent symptomatic OH, with droxidopa specifically indicated for neurogenic OH, and for refractory phenotypes I can add targeted options such as octreotide for postprandial OH or pyridostigmine in selected neurogenic cases, while considering atomoxetine as an adjunct in peripheral autonomic failure, and throughout I need to monitor for and manage supine hypertension and hypokalemia with these agents to avoid iatrogenic harm [^115UjaoT] [^113sJq7p] [^112JWj2w] [^113nF6sS] [^111a8mjN] [^115KfJp8] [^113pcNNH].

> I should confirm MS-specific feasibility and risks; motor impairment may limit counter-pressure maneuvers, spasticity can reduce tolerance of compression garments, and neurogenic bladder may complicate aggressive hydration targets, so individualized adaptations are needed, and because autonomic failure underlies neurogenic OH in some MS patients, coordinated neurology and cardiology co-management with referral for specialized autonomic testing is prudent, including planning for supine hypertension mitigation strategies such as head-up sleeping and, if necessary, short-acting antihypertensives at bedtime under close supervision [^117Xfdak] [^115f5hXG].

> Let me verify the follow-up cadence; short-interval reassessment within 1 to 2 weeks after initiating or adjusting therapy to repeat orthostatic vitals and review symptoms is appropriate, with ongoing monitoring for adverse effects like supine hypertension or fluid retention, and I should integrate fall prevention and prodrome recognition education while recognizing that patients with OH and syncope have increased long-term fracture risk, which justifies proactive fracture risk mitigation and safety planning [^113q4c52] [^111p8b7o].

> To summarize the algorithm in words so I ensure nothing is missed: start with history, exam, orthostatic vitals, and ECG; confirm orthostatic hypotension with standardized active standing and consider tilt if needed; distinguish neurogenic from non-neurogenic causes with attention to heart rate responses and autonomic testing; risk-stratify for cardiac etiologies and pursue targeted cardiology testing when indicated; classify the hemodynamic phenotype and consider variants like IOH, delayed OH, and POTS; implement nonpharmacological measures for all and add pharmacotherapy tailored to neurogenic status and phenotype; incorporate MS-specific modifications and supine hypertension management; and reassess iteratively, always remembering that therapy is most effective when directed at the dominant hypotensive versus bradycardic mechanism rather than the disease label alone [^113q4c52].

For MS patients with orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, or syncope, the cardiology workup should start with a **focused history and physical examination** and **orthostatic vital signs** (supine and standing BP/HR) to confirm OH and exclude cardiac causes [^114yzfK9] [^111JYUVe]. Obtain a **12-lead ECG** for arrhythmias or conduction disease, and use echocardiography if structural heart disease is suspected [^111JYUVe]. If initial studies are inconclusive, perform **tilt-table testing** to differentiate neurogenic OH from other causes [^113q4c52]. Ambulatory ECG monitoring or implantable loop recorders are indicated for intermittent symptoms or suspected arrhythmias. Management is **multidisciplinary**, combining **nonpharmacologic** measures (increased fluids/salt, compression garments, head-up tilt sleeping) and **pharmacologic therapy** (midodrine, fludrocortisone, droxidopa) as needed [^113sJq7p] [^113nF6sS].

---

## Initial clinical evaluation

### Detailed history and physical examination

The history should characterize dizziness or syncope — covering triggers, prodrome, duration, recovery, and frequency — and include a **medication review** (antihypertensives, diuretics, antidepressants, antipsychotics) for agents that may worsen orthostatic hypotension [^114yzfK9] [^112ZH7wi]. The physical examination focuses on the cardiovascular system and should include **orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate measurements** (supine after 5 minutes, then at 1 and 3 minutes standing) [^111JYUVe].

---

### Orthostatic blood pressure measurement

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or during head-up tilt [^112DCV2o]. In multiple sclerosis, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is suggested by an **inadequate heart rate increase of less than 15 bpm** despite a significant blood pressure drop.

---

## Essential cardiological tests

### Electrocardiogram (ECG)

Obtain a **12-lead ECG** to detect arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, or ischemia that may cause syncope [^111JYUVe]. This test is a standard component of the initial evaluation.

---

### Echocardiography

Order **transthoracic echocardiography** when structural heart disease is suspected — such as valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, or heart failure [^111JYUVe]. Imaging helps identify structural contributors to syncope.

---

### Ambulatory ECG monitoring

Use **Holter or event monitors** to evaluate intermittent symptoms or suspected arrhythmias not captured on a standard ECG. Consider implantable loop recorders for infrequent, severe episodes when an arrhythmia is suspected.

---

### Tilt-table testing

Perform **tilt-table testing** when the initial evaluation is inconclusive, to differentiate neurogenic orthostatic hypotension from reflex syncope or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^113q4c52]. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is characterized by a significant blood pressure drop with minimal heart rate increase during tilt [^112ZH7wi].

---

## Additional autonomic function tests

Consider **Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, and sudomotor testing** to assess the severity of autonomic dysfunction [^115f5hXG]. These tests help characterize the extent of autonomic impairment.

---

## Management strategies

### Nonpharmacological interventions

- **Fluids/salt**: Increase fluid (2–2.5 L/day) and salt intake (> 8 g/day) [^113oZczM].

- **Compression**: Use compression stockings or abdominal binders.

- **Head-up tilt**: Elevate head of bed > 10° to reduce nocturnal diuresis and morning OH [^117UP6Bb].

- **Counter-pressure**: Teach physical maneuvers (leg crossing, squatting) [^116vWgWS].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Midodrine**: Alpha-agonist to increase vascular tone; first-line for neurogenic OH [^112JWj2w].

- **Fludrocortisone**: Mineralocorticoid to expand plasma volume; first-line or adjunct.

- **Droxidopa**: Norepinephrine precursor for refractory neurogenic OH [^113nF6sS].

- **Pyridostigmine**: Cholinesterase inhibitor for refractory cases [^115KfJp8].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

Coordinate care among **cardiology, neurology, and autonomic specialists** for comprehensive evaluation and management [^112ZH7wi]. Provide patient education and schedule regular follow-up to monitor response and adjust therapy [^112ZH7wi].

A structured **cardiology workup** — history, orthostatic vitals, ECG, echocardiography, ambulatory monitoring, and tilt testing — is essential for confirming OH, excluding cardiac causes, and guiding therapy in MS patients with dizziness or syncope. Management should be multidisciplinary, combining nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies tailored to neurogenic OH.

The first-ever syncope incidence in patients with unexplained syncope exhibits a bimodal lifetime pattern, with peaks at ages 15 and 70 years. The majority of older patients experience their first syncope at an older age, where orthostatic hypotension and carotid sinus syndrome are more common. In older patients with early-onset syncope, prodromes, vasovagal, and complex syncope occur more frequently. A detailed syncope history remains essential in evaluating elderly patients for syncope and significantly impacts the final diagnosis.

### Mechanism of syncope: Role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular autonomic function assessment [^114EJkZ6]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Different types of transient loss of consciousness events are defined based on their pathophysiological features. The qualifying criterion for syncope is cerebral hypoperfusion, which differentiates it from non-syncopal forms such as epileptic seizures or psychogenic pseudosyncope. In patients diagnosed with syncope, once a cardiac cause (such as primary intrinsic cardiac arrhythmias or structural flow obstruction) is ruled out, autonomic neural mechanisms are involved in the genesis of non-cardiac forms. Autonomic (non-cardiac) syncope encompasses both reflex (neurally mediated) syncope and syncope due to orthostatic hypotension as described in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines.

Identifying the hemodynamic mechanism of autonomic syncope is the essential prerequisite for a personalized treatment approach aiming at effectively preventing recurrences. The possible hemodynamic mechanisms underlying autonomic syncope include primary hypotension and asystole/bradycardia of extrinsic cause, corresponding to two different hemodynamic phenotypes, i.e. the hypotensive and bradycardic phenotypes. The choice of therapy — aiming at counteracting hypotension or bradycardia — depends on the detected syncope phenotype identified during the diagnostic work-up.

Autonomic syncope is a common event in the general population and a frequent reason for seeking medical attention, consequently impacting high healthcare costs. Moreover, in a significant proportion of patients, syncope might be disabling due to recurrent episodes and/or severe injuries.

### Orthostatic hypotension: Epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment [^115EHL5J]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common cardiovascular disorder, with or without signs of underlying neurodegenerative disease. OH is diagnosed on the basis of an orthostatic challenge and implies a persistent systolic/diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20/10 mm Hg upon standing. Its prevalence is age dependent, ranging from 5% in patients 70 years of age. OH may complicate treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary heart disease; cause disabling symptoms, faints, and traumatic injuries; and substantially reduce quality of life. Despite being largely asymptomatic or presenting with minimal symptoms, the presence of OH independently increases mortality and the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

In this review, we outline the etiology and prevalence of OH in the general population, summarize its relationship with morbidity and mortality, propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm, and delineate challenges and future perspectives.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113pcNNH]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is a prevalent disorder. Clinicians from a variety of specialties need to be well informed about the diagnosis and management of nOH, as it carries a significant burden of morbidity and has also been associated with increased mortality. Clinicians should, therefore, familiarize themselves with this condition and evolving management options, which offer substantial symptomatic improvement. This communication will focus primarily on nOH, recognizing that orthostatic symptoms are often multifactorial; for instance, patients with nOH may have their symptoms worsened by medications, hypovolemia, intrinsic cardiovascular disease, and other factors.

The literature on nOH is fraught with inconsistencies in the definition and methods of diagnosis and suffers from a lack of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards 'best practice'. As nOH is a subset of orthostatic hypotension (OH), it should be noted that patients with nOH and OH may experience the same symptoms but for different reasons. The following consensus definition of OH was devised by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology, and endorsed by the European Federation of Autonomic Societies and the World Federation of Neurology: OH is "… a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg, or both, within 3 min of standing or head-up tilt to at least 60° on a tilt table". In addition to meeting the definition for OH, patients with nOH have impairment of the autonomic nervous system.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^113XSwHB]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension (OH) is a common yet underdiagnosed disorder. It may contribute to disability and even death and can be the initial sign leading to incapacitating symptoms in primary and secondary autonomic disorders. These symptoms range from visual disturbances and dizziness to loss of consciousness (syncope) after postural changes.

Evidence-based guidelines for the diagnostic workup and therapeutic management (both non-pharmacological and pharmacological) are provided based on the EFNS guidance regulations. The final literature research was performed in March 2005. For the diagnosis of OH, a structured history taking and measurement of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in supine and upright positions are necessary. OH is defined as a fall in systolic BP below 20 mmHg and diastolic BP below 10 mmHg of baseline within 3 minutes in the upright position. Passive head-up tilt testing is recommended if the active standing test is negative, especially if the history is suggestive of OH or in patients with motor impairment.

The management initially consists of education, advice, and training on various factors that influence blood pressure. Increased water and salt ingestion effectively improves OH. Physical measures include leg crossing, squatting, elastic abdominal binders, stockings, and careful exercise. Fludrocortisone is a valuable starter drug. Second-line drugs include sympathomimetics, such as midodrine, ephedrine, or dihydroxyphenylserine. Additionally, supine hypertension has to be considered.

### Evaluation of syncope [^112mjCmW]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Though relatively common, syncope is a complex presenting symptom defined by a transient loss of consciousness, usually accompanied by falling, and with spontaneous recovery. Syncope must be carefully differentiated from other conditions that may cause a loss of consciousness or falling.

- **Classification of syncope**: Syncope can be classified into four categories: reflex-mediated, cardiac, orthostatic, and cerebrovascular. A cardiac cause of syncope is associated with significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality than other causes.

- **Evaluation process**: The evaluation of syncope begins with a careful history, physical examination, and electrocardiography. Additional testing should be based on the initial clinical evaluation. Older patients and those with underlying organic heart disease or abnormal electrocardiograms generally will need additional cardiac evaluation, which may include prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, echocardiography, and exercise stress testing.

- **Tests for exclusion of structural heart disease**: When structural heart disease is excluded, tests for neurogenic reflex-mediated syncope, such as head-up tilt-table testing and carotid sinus massage, should be performed.

- **Cerebrovascular causes**: The use of tests such as head computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, carotid and transcranial ultrasonography, and electroencephalography to detect cerebrovascular causes of syncope should be reserved for those few patients with syncope whose history suggests a neurologic event or who have focal neurologic signs or symptoms.

### Do orthostatic vital signs have utility in the evaluation of syncope [^112wpHns]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis is long and includes benign conditions as well as acute life threats, such as dysrhythmias or pulmonary embolism.

- **Objective**: The specific goals of this review are twofold: 1) to define the diagnostic utility of orthostatic vital signs (OVS) as a test for orthostatic syncope, and 2) to determine whether OVS help diagnose or exclude life-threatening causes of syncope in ED patients.

- **Methods**: Three prospective cohort studies plus 2017 national guidelines for syncope management were identified, reviewed, and critically appraised.

- **Results**: This literature review found that orthostatic hypotension is common among ED patients with syncope and is often diagnosed as the cause of syncope.

- **Conclusions**: OVS measurements do not, in isolation, reliably diagnose or exclude orthostatic syncope, nor do they appear to have value in ruling out life-threatening causes of syncope.

### Latuda [^113Kqj5R]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Latuda may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, possibly due to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated adverse reactions can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. Generally, these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment and during dose escalation. Patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions or complications from hypotension include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medication, history of cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), history of cerebrovascular disease, as well as patients who are antipsychotic-naïve. In such patients, consider using a lower starting dose and slower titration, and monitor orthostatic vital signs.

Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital sign measurement, was defined by the following vital sign changes: a ≥ 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and a ≥ 10 bpm increase in pulse from sitting to standing or supine to standing position.

- **Schizophrenia**: In adults, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope reported as adverse events from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies was as follows: orthostatic hypotension occurred in 0.3% (5/1508) of LATUDA cases compared to 0.1% (1/708) in placebo cases, and syncope occurred in 0.1% (2/1508) of LATUDA cases compared to 0% (0/708) in placebo cases.

In short-term schizophrenia clinical studies, orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.8% with LATUDA 40 mg and 2.1% with LATUDA 80 mg.

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^117KhkhR]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

During the follow-up period (mean time 17.8 ± 6.5 years), a total of 8,201 subjects (27%) suffered at least one fracture. Individuals with incident fractures were older, more likely to be women, and had lower BMI and a higher prevalence of prevalent fractures and family history of fractures. Baseline characteristics of participants were initially presented in the study.

The mean time between baseline and the first admission for syncope and orthostatic hypotension was 12.6 ± 4.2 years, while the mean age at the time of the first hospitalisation was 74.6 ± 7.4 years. In total, 493 and 406 individuals were hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension, respectively. In these two groups, 49.9% and 50.2% were female, respectively. The mean age at baseline of individuals with unexplained syncope was 61.5 ± 7.1 years, while for those with orthostatic hypotension, it was 62.6 ± 6.6 years.

Individuals previously hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension had a higher incidence of fractures (log-rank test: p < 0.001). The survival curves for both groups diverged from the control group significantly.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for syncope, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension-induced syncope, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when there is a symptomatic fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline value by ≥ 20 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by ≥ 10 mmHg, or a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg. This diagnosis should be considered in the presence of symptoms even if not all features from history are suggestive of orthostatic hypotension.

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^111p8b7o]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Impaired orthostatic blood pressure response and syncope confer a high risk of falls and trauma. The relationship between a history of unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension (OH) with subsequent fractures, however, has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between previous hospital admissions due to unexplained syncope and OH and incident fractures in a middle-aged population.

- **Methods**: We analysed a large population-based prospective cohort of 30,399 middle-aged individuals (age: 57.5 ± 7.6; women: 60.2%). We included individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope or OH as the main diagnosis. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis was applied to assess the impact of unexplained syncope and OH hospitalisations on subsequent incident fractures.

- **Results**: During a follow-up period of 17.8 ± 6.5 years, 8201 (27%) subjects suffered incident fractures. The mean time from baseline and first admission for syncope (n = 493) or OH (n = 406) was 12.6 ± 4.2 years, and the mean age of the first hospitalisation was 74.6 ± 7.4 years. Individuals with incident fractures were older, more likely to be women, and had lower BMI, higher prevalence of prevalent fractures, and family history of fractures. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression showed an increased risk of incident fractures following hospitalisations due to unexplained syncope (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.02–1.40; p = 0.025) and OH (HR 1.42; 95% CI 1.21–1.66; p < 0.001) compared with unaffected individuals.

Individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension are at an increased risk of suffering from incident fractures compared to those unaffected.

### Implanted system for orthostatic hypotension in multiple-system atrophy [^112VBSpk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a cardinal feature of multiple-system atrophy. The upright posture provokes syncopal episodes that prevent patients from standing and walking for more than brief periods. We implanted a system to restore regulation of blood pressure and enable a patient with multiple-system atrophy to stand and walk after having lost these abilities because of orthostatic hypotension. This system involved epidural electrical stimulation delivered over the thoracic spinal cord with accelerometers that detected changes in body position.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^112ZH7wi]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Exclude other causes of OH/nOH. If blood pressure and heart rate changes indicate OH/nOH, a complete history and physical examination, as well as electrocardiogram and laboratory testing, should focus on ruling out non-neurogenic causes of OH, including cardiogenic, vascular, or iatrogenic etiologies. Cardiac disorders (e.g. pacemakers, dysrhythmias, ablation, etc) can preclude heart rate augmentation; therefore, a cardiac history, an electrocardiogram, and medication review should consistently be performed. Due to variability among patients, including age, disease status, and medication usage, the lack of heart rate increase on standing may not always be an accurate indicator of nOH in patients with OH; therefore, clinical scenarios and specific presentations need to be considered.

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^117RMMnV]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In this large prospective, population-based observational study, the risk of incident fractures following hospitalizations due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension was increased by 20% and 42%, respectively. The effect size of unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension on the risk of fractures in our cohort is similar to that of several established risk factors for fractures, such as smoking and family history of fractures.

- **Strengths and weaknesses of the study**: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective observational study investigating the association between incident fractures following hospitalizations due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension. The strength of this study is the use of a large population-based cohort with over 30,000 middle-aged individuals enrolled and minimal loss to follow-up. Moreover, data on hospitalizations due to syncope and orthostatic hypotension were retrieved from a national register with complete coverage of public healthcare in Sweden, making our findings reliable and robust. Previous studies have focused on examining the association between unexplained falls in individuals with syncope and orthostatic hypotension. Our findings provide additional knowledge related to the importance of fracture prevention in the population. The mortality in the MDC cohort has been explored in several previous studies. For example, a recent study showed that the cumulative survival after 10 years is around 90%. A previous study from our research group concluded that syncope and orthostatic hypotension increased the risk.

### Selecting appropriate diagnostic tools for evaluating the patient with syncope/collapse [^113iy3LK]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The investigation of syncope is challenging, and physicians have an ever-increasing array of diagnostic tools at their disposal. There are two essential goals that drive investigation: risk stratification and identification of etiology. In this review, we outline our approach while providing a synopsis of the available supportive evidence. The key to syncope is in the story as told by the patient and a bystander, as this drives both risk assessment and diagnostic testing.

All patients should initially be evaluated with a systematic history and physical examination as well as an ECG. The initial evaluation provides an estimation of risk and directs whether inpatient or outpatient evaluation is appropriate. In a substantial proportion of patients, the etiology will be evident after initial evaluation, and no further investigation is required. In the remaining patients, targeted use of additional investigations in the form of cardiac imaging, provocative testing, and/or ambulatory ECG monitoring should be performed. A thoughtful and systematic approach to the investigation of syncope optimizes the diagnostic yield but also ensures efficient usage of limited health care resources.

### New insights in diagnostics and therapies in syncope: A novel approach to non-cardiac syncope [^111eKhmZ]. Heart (2021). High credibility.

This article aims to provide advice on how to identify and manage patients with syncope who are at risk of severe outcomes, such as trauma, potentially life-threatening episodes, or frequent recurrences that reduce quality of life. The first step in syncope diagnostic assessment is to identify patients with cardiac syncope. Once cardiac syncope is established, these patients must receive the appropriate mechanism-specific treatment.

If cardiac syncope is unlikely, reflex (neurally mediated) syncope and orthostatic hypotension are the most frequent causes of transient loss of consciousness. For these presentations, the efficacy of therapy is largely determined by the mechanism of syncope rather than its etiology or clinical features. The identified mechanism of syncope should be carefully assessed and assigned either to a hypotensive or bradycardic phenotype, which will determine the choice of therapy — counteracting hypotension or counteracting bradycardia.

The results of recent trials indicate that "mechanism-specific therapy" is highly effective in preventing recurrences. Established mechanism-specific treatment strategies include withdrawal of hypotensive drugs, applying fludrocortisone and midodrine for the hypotensive phenotype, and cardiac pacing in the bradycardic phenotype.

### Orthostatic blood pressure recovery patterns in suspected syncope in the emergency department [^111bb6qd]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

It is only recently that delayed BP recovery has been recognized as a cause of unexplained falls and (pre)syncope, and it has been associated with similar short-term and long-term risks as classic orthostatic hypotension. In the present syncope guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology and by ACC/AHA/HRS, delayed BP recovery, as a variant of orthostatic hypotension, is not mentioned. In our population, 43% of the patients with delayed BP recovery were classified as unexplained syncope. Compared with those with classic orthostatic hypotension, patients with delayed BP recovery were older, had a higher prevalence of hypertension, and had a higher admission rate. Delayed BP recovery can be seen as a physical sign of subclinical impaired physiology. Therefore, we suggest that (older) patients presenting to the ED with a history of orthostatic (pre)syncope shortly after standing up, but with a negative oscillometric orthostatic BP measurement, be referred to a syncope unit to detect the underlying cause.

Initial orthostatic hypotension was present in eight (7%) patients in our study. This is a common (3%–10%) but unrecognized cause of syncope usually seen in younger patients. The clinical diagnosis is based on a typical history of (pre)syncope directly on standing and no classic orthostatic hypotension during oscillometric orthostatic BP measurement. The diagnosis becomes 100% certain with detection of initial orthostatic hypotension during continuous non-invasive BP measurement and recognizable symptoms. Recognition by the physician is important because management is simple and effective.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^115B3bRU]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man was evaluated for a 2-year history of syncope, collapse, and fluctuating blood pressure. His medical history included Hodgkin lymphoma, lupus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, autonomic neuropathy, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, and orthostatic hypotension. He was being treated with gabapentin (300 mg, twice daily), saxagliptin (5 mg, once daily), pravastatin (40 mg, once daily), levothyroxine sodium (100 mg, once daily), omeprazole (20 mg, once daily), prednisone (10 mg, every other day), midodrine (10 mg, three times daily), and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg, twice daily).

At the time of his initial evaluation, the patient reported that his syncope had progressively worsened over the past 3 months. Although his episodes of syncope were previously preceded by dizziness and nausea, they had begun to occur without warning. He also reported a 5-year history of orthostatic hypotension, with a supine blood pressure of approximately 100/66 mm Hg and a standing blood pressure as low as 50/40 mm Hg. His low standing blood pressure and episodes of syncope persisted despite daily treatment with fludrocortisone and midodrine.

Initial cardiac evaluation revealed a systolic murmur but was otherwise unremarkable. Other than orthostatic hypotension, a clinical manifestation of possible cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, no other signs of autonomic dysfunction were noted during examination. Additionally, the patient showed no signs of hypovolemia (i.e. extremities were not cold, moist mucous membranes, no increase in urine specific gravity) or amyloidosis (i.e. lack of tongue swelling).

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition and an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, further complicating this diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^115LepUL]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

The Malmö Diet and Cancer (MDC) study is a large prospective population-based study launched in the 1990s. A total of 30,446 participants were included with a 41% participation rate; their average age was 57.5 ± 7.6 years, and 60.2% were women. Participants attended the baseline examination between 1991 and 1996, and details of the MDC study have been described elsewhere.

In this study, individuals with fractures prior to hospitalisation for syncope or orthostatic hypotension (n = 39) and those with missing follow-up time data (n = 8) were excluded, leaving 30,399 individuals included in the final analysis. Of these, 8,201 subjects had incident fractures after the baseline examination. One of the primary outcomes was the occurrence of incident fractures after hospital admissions for unexplained syncope or orthostatic hypotension, compared with individuals without a history of such hospitalisations.

### Orthostatic hypotension [^116MVUBT]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a physical finding defined by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology as a systolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing. This condition, which may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, is commonly encountered in family medicine. In healthy individuals, muscle contraction increases venous return of blood to the heart through one-way valves that prevent blood from pooling in dependent parts of the body.

The autonomic nervous system responds to changes in position by constricting veins and arteries and increasing heart rate and cardiac contractility. When these mechanisms are faulty or if the patient is hypovolemic, orthostatic hypotension may occur. In individuals with this condition, gravitational opposition to venous return causes a decrease in blood pressure and poses a threat of cerebral ischemia.

Several potential causes of orthostatic hypotension include:

- **Medications, non-neurogenic causes, and neurogenic causes**: Medications; non-neurogenic causes such as impaired venous return, hypovolemia, and cardiac insufficiency; and neurogenic causes such as multisystem atrophy and diabetic neuropathy.

Treatment generally aims at addressing the underlying cause, and a variety of pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic interventions may relieve symptoms.

### Orthostatic hypotension: Management of a complex, but common, medical problem [^115w65E6]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH), a common, often overlooked disorder with many causes, is associated with debilitating symptoms, falls, syncope, cognitive impairment, and risk of death. Chronic OH, a cardinal sign of autonomic dysfunction, increases with advancing age and is commonly associated with neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and kidney failure. Management typically involves a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach to arrive at an appropriate underlying diagnosis that is causing OH, treating accompanying conditions, and providing individually tailored pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113VYy4o]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To address this issue, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation jointly held an initial consensus panel meeting to formulate essential recommendations into a working guideline for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of nOH and associated supine hypertension. Results of the discussions held during the meeting, along with continued deliberations among the panel participants, are presented here along with recommendations in each of the topic areas. Whereas most patients with disorders typically associated with nOH are seen by cardiologists or neurologists, particularly movement disorder specialists, the first point of contact and potential for identification of nOH is with primary care clinicians. Hence, the following consensus commentary is meant to provide guidance for all clinicians who might encounter and/or ultimately manage nOH.

### Clinical laboratory testing: What is the role of tilt-table testing, active standing test, carotid massage, electrophysiological testing and ATP test in the syncope evaluation [^115M81P7]. Progress in cardiovascular diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The first step in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected syncope begins with an "initial evaluation" consisting of careful history taking, physical examination including orthostatic blood pressure measurement, and electrocardiogram. However, even in expert centers, the diagnostic yield of this "initial evaluation" is only approximately 50%. In cases where a satisfactory diagnosis is unknown or uncertain after the initial assessment, additional clinical testing is needed. This article reviews the role of some of the more commonly used additional diagnostic tests:

- **Tilt-table testing**: Involves observing the patient's cardiovascular response to changes in posture.
- **Active standing test**: A method to evaluate orthostatic changes and potential syncope triggers.
- **Carotid sinus massage**: Performed to assess the carotid sinus sensitivity.
- **Electrophysiological testing**: Used to explore cardiac electrical function.
- **Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) test**: Assists in identifying rhythm disturbances.

- **Additional notes**: The role of angiography, exercise testing, and imaging is noted briefly. Clinical laboratory investigations, such as ambulatory ECG monitoring, are examined in other papers in this issue.

In brief, clinical laboratory tests, when carefully interpreted, may be useful in evaluating the basis of suspected syncope. These tests should be selected carefully and performed based on the pre-test probability inferred from the initial examination, with the less invasive tests used first.

### Water drinking in the management of orthostatic intolerance due to orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syncope and the postural tachycardia syndrome [^115t83Pn]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). High credibility.

Water drinking has recently been shown to raise blood pressure in normal subjects and in patients with autonomic failure who have orthostatic hypotension. However, ingestion of approximately 500 mL in normal young subjects has no pressor effect, but in older subjects, there is an increase in blood pressure. An even greater rise in blood pressure occurs in cases with autonomic failure. The possible mechanisms responsible for the pressor response to water include neural and humoral factors; fluid redistribution also needs to be considered. This review will concentrate on the water pressor response in normal subjects and different groups of patients with autonomic diseases who have orthostatic intolerance, on the mechanisms that could be involved, and on whether this pressor response may be used in the management of orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syncope, and the postural tachycardia syndrome.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^115dLWq1]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can seriously impair patients' quality of life and is associated with increased morbidity, especially in the elderly. In several neurological diseases associated with autonomic failure, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) is a major contributor to disease burden and reduced quality of life. A structured approach is important in the management of patients with NOH. Non-pharmacological interventions should be the first line of therapy. If the symptoms persist and the patients are severely affected, pharmacological interventions are required.

### The neuromuscular evaluation of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^111svGfG]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a diagnosis with a wide spectrum of symptoms and a variety of clinicopathological associations, including hereditary, autoimmune, and infectious origins. There is little consensus regarding the appropriate diagnostic approach to the condition. The aim of this work was to provide guidance on the initial diagnosis and when and how to expand diagnostic testing.

We define the "typical" POTS patient as younger, female, and with a normal examination apart from joint hyperextensibility. Red flags for "atypical" POTS would be older age at onset, male, prominent syncope, review of systems suggestive of specific alternative diagnoses, examination abnormalities other than joint hyperextensibility, or disease refractory to nonpharmacological and other first-line treatments. Although a limited evaluation is appropriate in POTS with typical features, we recommend an expanded and individualized workup in atypical cases, including additional cardiac testing, autonomic testing, neuropathy workup, and/or autoimmune workup (including consideration of Guillain-Barré syndrome), depending on clinical presentation.

We emphasize the importance of shared decision-making in this condition, for which treatment remains primarily symptomatic regardless of etiology.

### Mechanism of syncope: Role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular autonomic function assessment [^116Lt8wc]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

In the study population, there was a high prevalence of the hypotensive phenotype. This can be explained by the high proportion of patients with persistent hypotension (constitutional hypotension) and patients with drug-related persistent hypotension diagnosed by ABPM, which accounted for a quarter of patients. Such patients were usually excluded from other studies in the literature. However, our findings are more representative of the general population of patients referred to a syncope unit because they were affected by severe forms of autonomic syncope and are consistent with the general knowledge of the prevailing hypotensive mechanism of autonomic syncope.

- **Limitations**: Some limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. First, the diagnosis of autonomic syncope — and the rule-out of established/suspected cardiac syncope — was made after the initial evaluation. This means that the diagnosis is most often presumptive, as typically occurs in this field. We cannot completely exclude that some patients, who were mistakenly assigned to the autonomic group, could have a cardiac form. Second, the order of execution of ABPM and SCAFA was decided by each participating center, and the temporal range of their execution was not reported. The initial and classical forms of orthostatic hypotension were not formally assessed in this study during SCAFA. In particular, SCAFA is unable to investigate initial orthostatic hypotension, which is only associated with active standing. As beat-to-beat BP monitoring may not be available during the initial evaluation in some centers, we cannot definitively diagnose certain types of syncope.

### An increased endothelial-independent vasodilation is the hallmark of the neurally mediated syncope [^1114VePo]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The neurally mediated syncope (NMS) is sustained by complex cardiac and vascular reflexes, acting on and amplified by central autonomic loops, resulting in bradycardia and hypotension.

Our aim was to assess whether the pathophysiology of NMS is also related to an abnormal peripheral vasoreactivity. We evaluated by ultrasound the flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and the nitrate-mediated dilation (NMD) in 17 patients with NMS, induced by drug-free tilt test in 6 subjects and by nitrate-potentiated tilt test in the other 11 cases. The syncope was classified as vasodepressive (VD) in 8 cases, cardioinhibitory (CI) in 7, and mixed in 2.

- **Results**: The FMD was not different from controls (10.2 ± 4.5 vs. 11.4 ± 3.9, P = ns), with normal recovery times. The NMD was greater in fainting subjects than in controls (26.7 ± 7.3 vs. 19.0 ± 3.6, P < 0.05), with higher values in VD than in CI syncope (31.1 ± 7.0 vs. 23.1 ± 5.0, P = ns). Compared to controls, subjects with NMS showed normal recovery times after FMD but longer recovery times after nitrate administration (13.0 ± 5.6 vs. 6.3 ± 0.7 minutes, P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: The evaluation of endothelial function supports evidence that NMS is characterized by a marked and sustained endothelial-independent vasodilation in the presence of a normal FMD. Vascular hyperreactivity in response to nitrate administration is particularly overt in vasodepressive syncope and can explain the high rate of responses to nitrate administration during the tilt test.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^111jn2Ym]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

After screening to identify a patient as being at risk for orthostatic hypotension (OH), an accurate assessment of the underlying cause(s) is required to determine the appropriate treatment recommendation. A stepwise approach is recommended for the diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), specifically starting with measurement of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, followed by more detailed autonomic testing in select cases.

- **Blood pressure testing**: The hallmark test for OH is the measurement of change in blood pressure from supine, after at least 5 minutes of rest, to standing or head-up tilt (HUT). Guidelines define OH as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing. However, in patients with supine hypertension (a supine systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg), a 30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure or 15-point fall in diastolic blood pressure may be a more appropriate criterion for patients with nOH, as the magnitude of blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure.

- **A practical stepwise approach to orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate testing**: The recommended gold standard measurement of OH includes having patients rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and then stand for 3 minutes, with blood pressure measurements taken just prior to standing and at both 1 and 3 minutes after standing.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1132ZTDm]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Determining the underlying mechanism of syncope is critical for choosing an appropriate treatment and management protocol. A proposed diagnostic algorithm should include a detailed patient history and physical examination, including supine and standing blood pressure (BP) measurements and an electrocardiogram (ECG). If determination of the mechanism of syncope is inconclusive after initial examinations, then autonomic function testing is warranted.

The underlying causes of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) can be varied. Multiple factors should be considered in the management of nOH, especially in the presence of comorbid conditions. A case report identified amyloidosis as a potential cause in a patient with autonomic nervous system impairment and orthostatic hypotension (OH), along with systemic organ involvement, including gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction. In two other case reports, patients with Parkinson's disease and cardiac conditions presented with dizziness, lightheadedness, and fatigue, and were subsequently diagnosed with nOH. In one of these cases, the patient was initially suspected to have bradycardia due to overlapping symptoms with nOH and was referred for a pacemaker before considering diagnostic testing for nOH. Thus, it is imperative for clinicians to screen for nOH when patients present with non-specific symptoms.

### Syncope [^114CCpXx]. Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common clinical presentation. Although it is most commonly benign, it may herald a pathology with a poor prognosis. The work-up of syncope includes a careful history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, risk stratification, and appropriately directed testing. The key factor in the investigation of syncope is the presence (or absence) of structural heart disease or an abnormal electrocardiogram.

The most useful investigation in unexplained syncope with a normal heart is the tilt table test for evaluating predisposition to neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope. In the setting of structural heart disease or an abnormal electrocardiogram, electrophysiologic studies play a more important role. The utility of noninvasive cardiac monitoring for symptom-rhythm correlation may be limited by infrequent symptoms. However, the availability of external and implantable loop recorders allows prolonged periods of monitoring to increase diagnostic yield.

The management of patients with syncope may be complex. Early referral to a cardiac electrophysiologist is warranted in patients who are at high risk.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: A hidden danger [^1149XgjG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common heterogeneous and multifactorial disorder, traditionally classified as neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or non-neurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical, and delayed OH, as well as postural tachycardia syndrome. Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks either alone or in combination with other mechanisms, and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms.

Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but it is not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and non-neurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods, and more effective therapeutic modalities.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for orthostatic hypotension, specifically concerning physical and nutritional measures, the EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend increased water intake (2–2.5 L/day) and salt ingestion (> 8 g or 150 mmol/day) to effectively improve orthostatic hypotension.

### Twenty-eight years of research permit reinterpretation of tilt-testing: Hypotensive susceptibility rather than diagnosis [^113Bs5qW]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

There is growing skepticism over the utility of tilt-testing for syncope diagnosis, which has been shown unable to distinguish vasovagal from other syncope types, especially cardiac syncope, despite its acceptable sensitivity and specificity in true positive and negative subjects. The new interpretation is that the test reveals a susceptibility to reflex hypotension, which may exist in coincidence with any cause of syncope. This implies an important change in patient management, including selecting effective therapy, particularly in guiding pacemaker therapy in patients affected by reflex syncope.

### Vraylar [^112Vtr17]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension and syncope**: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Generally, the risk is greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was infrequent in trials of Vraylar and was not more frequent on Vraylar than placebo. Syncope was not observed. Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension (e.g. elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, and concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications), those with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), and patients with cerebrovascular disease. Vraylar has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease. Such patients were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials.

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including Vraylar, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

- **Seizures**: Like other antipsychotic drugs, Vraylar may cause seizures. This risk is greatest in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the threshold for seizures.

### Medical therapy and physical maneuvers in the treatment of the vasovagal syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^117KF1s6]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with vasovagal syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can both present with pre-syncope and syncope resulting from systemic hypotension. While not directly responsible for increased mortality, both of these conditions can have a tremendous deleterious impact on the daily lives of patients. This negative impact can take the form of both physical symptoms and injury, and also a psychological impact from living in fear of the next syncopal episode.

Despite these similarities, these are different disorders with fixed damage to the autonomic nerves in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, as opposed to a transient reflex hypotension in "neurally mediated" vasovagal syncope. The treatment approaches for both disorders are parallel. The first step is to educate the patient about the pathophysiology and prognosis of their disorder. Next, offending medications should be withdrawn when possible.

Non-pharmacological therapies and maneuvers can be used, both to prevent the symptoms and to prevent syncope at the onset of presyncope. This is all that is required in many patients with vasovagal syncope. If needed, pharmacological options are also available for both vasovagal syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, many of which are focused on blood volume expansion, increasing cardiac venous return, or pressor agents to increase vascular tone. There is a paucity of high-quality clinical trial data to support the use of these pharmacological agents. We aim to review the literature on these different therapy choices and to give recommendations on tailored approaches.

### Cardiovascular risk after hospitalisation for unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^117T1rME]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

- **Long-term cumulative incidence**: The cardiovascular (CV) mortality rates were analyzed according to incident syncope-related and orthostatic hypotension (OH)-related hospital admissions (n = 29,129). Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess CV mortality, showing that patients admitted for syncope (blue) and OH (red) had significantly lower survival rates compared to those who were never hospitalized for these conditions (green), confirmed by a log-rank test (p < 0.001). A black vertical line at 12 years marks the mean time between baseline and first-ever OH/syncope hospital admission. Post this point, survival curves for OH/syncope-related hospital admission and non-hospitalized patients begin and continue to diverge.

- **Risk estimation**: The risk of CV death and all-cause death associated with a history of OH-related or unexplained syncope-related hospitalization was evaluated during follow-up in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study cohort, which comprised 29,129 individuals without prevalent CV disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension [^114nQSqq]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure on standing that increases the risk of adverse outcomes even when asymptomatic. Improvements in haemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension.

Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies and often coincides with supine hypertension.

The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualized, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure-lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (e.g. counterpressure maneuvers), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

### Secuado [^114tPNyw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and other hemodynamic effects**: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Generally, the risk is greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. In the placebo-controlled trial, orthostatic hypotension was reported in 1.5% (3/204) of patients treated with Secuado 3.8 mg/24 hours and 0% (0/204) of patients treated with Secuado 7.6 mg/24 hours, compared to < 1% (1/206) of patients treated with placebo. There were no reports of syncope for both doses of Secuado in the placebo-controlled trial. During adult pre-marketing clinical trials with sublingual asenapine, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, syncope was reported in 0.6% (11/1953) of patients treated with sublingual asenapine.

Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension, such as elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, or those receiving concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications. This monitoring is also essential for patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g. history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities) and patients with cerebrovascular disease. Secuado should be used cautiously when treating patients who receive treatment with other drugs that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, or respiratory or central nervous system depression [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered for all such patients, and a dose reduction may be needed.

### Orthostatic hypotension: JACC state-of-the-art review [^116axeU7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent and disabling feature of autonomic failure due to both peripheral and central neurodegenerative diseases. Community-based epidemiological studies have demonstrated a high morbidity and mortality associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. It is due to impairment of baroreflex-mediated vasoconstriction of the skeletal muscle and splanchnic circulation and is caused by damage or dysfunction at central and/or peripheral sites in the baroreflex efferent pathway.

Nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions may be implemented to ameliorate the symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and improve quality of life. Many patients will be adequately treated by education, counseling, removal of hypotensive medications, and other nonpharmacological interventions, whereas more severely afflicted patients require pharmacological interventions. The first stage of pharmacological treatment involves repletion of central blood volume. If unsuccessful, this should be followed by treatment with sympathomimetic agents.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, specifically concerning orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining intermittent BP and HR measurements using a sphygmomanometer. These measurements should be taken while the patient is supine and during active standing for 3 minutes as part of the initial evaluation of syncope.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope can have a variety of etiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries. It is defined as a sudden, transient, complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery. Standing for 2 to 3 minutes is usually sufficient to observe the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope. However, in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 minutes of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management.

A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is characterized by a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.

- **Potential causes of syncope**: Neurogenic OH (nOH; that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction) can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (e.g. hypovolemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, and falls. Neurogenic OH is frequently comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

### Flomax [^116YoUNR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group.

Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria:

- **Decrease in systolic blood pressure**: A decrease of ≥ 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests.
- **Decrease in diastolic blood pressure**: A decrease of ≥ 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test.
- **Increase in pulse rate**: An increase of ≥ 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate ≥ 100 bpm during the orthostatic test.
- **Presence of clinical symptoms**: The presence of faintness, lightheadedness, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension upon standing during the orthostatic test.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^117AT4jJ]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a distinctive and treatable sign of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. It is caused by the failure of noradrenergic neurotransmission and is associated with a range of primary or secondary autonomic disorders, including pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease with autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, as well as diabetic and nondiabetic autonomic neuropathies. This condition is commonly accompanied by autonomic dysregulation involving other organ systems, such as the bowel and the bladder.

In the present review, we provide an overview of the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, focusing on neurodegenerative disorders.

### Orthostatic blood pressure recovery patterns in suspected syncope in the emergency department [^117NDwZD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

One hundred and sixteen patients consented to participate. Measurements were suitable for analysis in 111 patients (median age 63 ± 30 years, 51% male). Five measurements were excluded due to poor quality signal (artefacts) or signal interruptions. Sixty-six (59%) patients were referred because of syncope, and 45 (41%) patients because of presyncope. Fifty-seven percent of the 111 patients had a normal BP recovery, 7% had initial orthostatic hypotension, 13% had delayed BP recovery, 19% had classic orthostatic hypotension, and 4% had reflex-mediated hypotension. Haemodynamic profiles of the different patterns are presented in Figure 2.

- **Patient characteristics based on the orthostatic BP recovery patterns**: Seven out of 45 (16%) patients classified by the attending physician as having vasovagal syncope had classic orthostatic hypotension with continuous BP measurement. In patients classified as having orthostatic hypotension by the attending physician, 11/18 (61%) had a positive test for classic orthostatic hypotension. In patients with a delayed BP recovery, 6/14 (43%) were cl…

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, specifically concerning orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when there is an asymptomatic fall in SBP from a baseline value of ≥ 20 mmHg or DBP ≥ 10 mmHg, or a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg. This should be considered in the presence of symptoms (from history) that are less consistent with orthostatic hypotension.

### Cardiovascular risk after hospitalisation for unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^112sh5qT]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

All study participants were followed up through December 31, 2011, by linking a unique 10-digit personal identification number with the Swedish National Hospital Discharge Register (SNHDR), Swedish National Cause of Death Register (SNCDR), and Stroke Register of Malmö (STROMA). Event-free subjects (n = 284; 0.9%) who emigrated from Sweden before December 31, 2011, were assigned the date of emigration as their last follow-up date.

We examined two primary outcomes:

- **First-time hospital admission for unexplained syncope or OH**: Data were based on primary or main secondary discharge diagnoses according to the ICD-9/10 system (syncope: ICD-9 = 780.2, and ICD-10 = R550.9; OH: ICD-9 = 458 and ICD-10 = I951), as retrieved from SNHDR. We excluded cases with concomitant cardiovascular (CV) diagnoses identified as the primary cause of admission, such as acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction or unstable angina), stroke or transient ischaemic attack, cardiac arrhythmia, acute decompensated heart failure, and valvular heart disease.

- **First-ever CV event**: Defined as coronary event, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and aortic valve stenosis.

We also analysed two secondary outcomes:

- **CV death and all-cause mortality**: In the case that the hospital admission was recorded for both unexplained syncope and OH, we classified the event as OH related, as an in-hospital OH diagnosis warrants a positive orthostatic test.

### Evaluation of syncope [^1146a5i6]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Syncope is a transient and abrupt loss of consciousness with complete return to preexisting neurologic function. It is classified as neurally mediated (i.e. carotid sinus hypersensitivity, situational, or vasovagal), cardiac, orthostatic, or neurogenic. Older adults are more likely to have orthostatic, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, or cardiac syncope, whereas younger adults are more likely to have vasovagal syncope. Common nonsyncopal syndromes with similar presentations include seizures, metabolic and psychogenic disorders, and acute intoxication.

Patients presenting with syncope (other than neurally mediated and orthostatic syncope) are at increased risk of death from any cause. Useful clinical rules to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for immediate hospitalization include the San Francisco Syncope Rule and the Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department rule. Guidelines suggest an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of syncope that begins with the history and physical examination.

All patients presenting with syncope require electrocardiography, orthostatic vital signs, and QT interval monitoring. Patients with cardiovascular disease, abnormal electrocardiography, or family history of sudden death, and those presenting with unexplained syncope should be hospitalized for further diagnostic evaluation. Patients with neurally mediated or orthostatic syncope usually require no additional testing. In cases of unexplained syncope, further testing such as echocardiography, graded exercise testing, electrocardiographic monitoring, and electrophysiological studies may be necessary.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^115f5hXG]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

If standard orthostatic blood pressure testing does not reveal orthostatic hypotension (OH) in an at-risk individual with unexplained postural symptoms, falls, or syncope, then any of the following are appropriate as next steps:

1. Conduct extended at-home blood pressure monitoring with results recorded by the patient or caregiver.
2. Implement 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring where the patient can annotate times when supine or standing to determine a typical range of blood pressures during the day and, with patient annotation of position, help to understand fluctuations.
3. Use autonomic function tests.

Some individuals may develop delayed OH later than three minutes of standing, which can be identified with prolonged standing blood pressures or prolonged tilt table testing (head-up tilt, HUT).

- **Specialty testing**: The specialized tests described below are considered by the panel to be beyond the scope of many primary care clinicians and usually require referral to a center specializing in autonomic disorders. Specialized tests for a definitive diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) include autonomic reflex testing, including heart rate variability to paced breathing, heart rate and blood pressure response to a Valsalva maneuver, and continuous blood pressure response to a prolonged HUT. Other tests used to help diagnose nOH may include plasma fractionated catecholamine levels and/or sudomotor function testing.

These specialized tests may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of nOH by demonstrating baroreflex dysfunction based on HUT testing with beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement.
