## Question

What's a good starting statin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about selecting a starting statin and initial management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline risk stratification and who actually qualifies for statin therapy. Then, I should verify how to calculate ASCVD risk and where thresholds fit. Next, I will select the appropriate statin intensity by risk category and reconcile guideline differences. After that, I need to choose a specific statin and dose, confirm baseline labs and monitoring, and outline titration and add-on therapy. Finally, I should address special populations, adherence, and summarize a practical algorithm with shared decision-making built in.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk assessment because everything hinges on it. I need to check age, sex, race/ethnicity, blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, smoking status, diabetes, and antihypertensive or statin use to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations, and I should remember that the USPSTF focuses on adults 40–75 years with risk factors, whereas ACC/AHA extends to broader groups including severe hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, so I must align the tool with the guideline I am following [^116aU1uF] [^111QWr6D].

> Wait, let me verify the risk thresholds before jumping to intensity. For primary prevention in adults 40–75 years, USPSTF recommends initiating a statin when 10-year risk is 10% or higher and selectively offering when risk is 7.5% to less than 10%, with insufficient evidence above 75 years, while ACC/AHA 2019 uses intermediate risk 7.5% to less than 20% and high risk 20% or higher to guide intensity, and both endorse using risk enhancers and, in selected cases, coronary artery calcium to refine decisions, so I should double-check whether enhancers or CAC would shift the patient into a different category [^116aU1uF] [^111QWr6D] [^111U9Dm6].

> Hold on, I should verify secondary prevention and special high-risk states because they override routine risk scoring. Clinical ASCVD, LDL-C 190 mg/dL or higher, and diabetes mellitus in adults 40–75 years are statin benefit groups where therapy is indicated, and in these cases intensity is typically high unless contraindicated, so I need to ensure I do not under-treat these patients while still screening for contraindications and drug interactions [^111QWr6D] [^116g1c8J].

> Next, I will select statin intensity by risk category, but let me reconsider the nuance here. High-intensity statins are first-line for clinical ASCVD, LDL-C 190 mg/dL or higher, and diabetes with multiple risk factors, targeting at least a 50% LDL-C reduction, whereas moderate-intensity is appropriate for primary prevention at intermediate risk targeting 30–49% reduction; for borderline risk, I should engage in shared decision-making and consider risk enhancers or CAC before initiating therapy, and I need to ensure the patient understands the smaller absolute benefit in lower-risk strata [^111QWr6D] [^111rj6qV] [^116aU1uF].

> I will now examine which specific statin and dose to start, and I should confirm cost and potency. Generic atorvastatin or rosuvastatin are reasonable first choices given efficacy and cost; typical starting doses are atorvastatin 10–20 mg daily or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg daily for moderate intensity, and atorvastatin 40–80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg daily for high intensity, with the caveat that I should start at the lower end in older adults, those with renal impairment, or anyone at higher risk of adverse effects, and I need to check for drug interactions like CYP3A4 inhibitors before choosing atorvastatin [^114j5adR] [^111rj6qV] [^114RoPh6].

> Wait, I should double-check baseline safety steps before prescribing. I need to obtain baseline ALT, AST, and CK, review hepatic disease, pregnancy status, and potential drug–drug interactions, counsel on expected benefits, common side effects, and adherence, and then initiate therapy; I should also confirm that pregnancy is a contraindication and plan contraception counseling when relevant [^114RoPh6] [^113vyE4G].

> Next, I should review monitoring and titration because response varies widely. I need to recheck a fasting lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change and then every 3–12 months to assess adherence and percentage LDL-C reduction; if the percentage reduction is below the target for the chosen intensity, I should confirm adherence, then uptitrate or switch to a different statin, recognizing that doubling the dose typically yields about an extra 6% LDL-C reduction, and if goals remain unmet on maximally tolerated statin, I should consider adding ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor in appropriate high-risk patients [^111rj6qV] [^114UAUU2] [^114RoPh6].

> But wait, what if the patient reports muscle symptoms. I should confirm true statin-associated muscle symptoms, check CK if symptoms are significant, and if CK is less than 5 times the upper limit of normal, consider continuation or a brief interruption with rechallenge; if CK is greater than 5 times the upper limit or symptoms recur, I should switch to a different statin, often at a lower dose or intermittent schedule, and if multiple statins fail, proceed to nonstatin therapy such as ezetimibe, with PCSK9 inhibitors or bempedoic acid as next steps depending on risk and access [^111WJhXw] [^113YEmSK] [^115sTb9b].

> I need to ensure I address special populations carefully. In adults older than 75 years, I should individualize based on comorbidity, frailty, life expectancy, and patient preference, continuing therapy if already tolerated; in chronic kidney disease, atorvastatin is preferred and dose adjustments are generally not required; in liver disease, I should avoid statins with significant hepatic metabolism; and in women of childbearing potential, I must confirm effective contraception before starting a statin due to teratogenic risk [^111Y7GK5] [^114RoPh6].

> Let me consider pediatric and young adult scenarios so I do not miss rare but important indications. For children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, statins may be initiated from about age 8–10 depending on severity and guideline, whereas for primary prevention in adults younger than 40 years, evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized, often reserving therapy for those with severe hypercholesterolemia or very high lifetime risk after specialist input [^113vyE4G] [^11775BjY].

> I should confirm adherence and persistence strategies because discontinuation erodes benefit. I will use the 4–12 week lipid check to reinforce adherence, simplify the regimen when possible, use pill organizers or digital reminders, and address cost barriers by preferring generics; I also need to screen for and manage drug interactions that can worsen tolerability, and if adherence is poor, I should revisit the risk–benefit discussion and consider lower-intensity or intermittent dosing rather than abandonment of therapy [^111rj6qV] [^114j5adR] [^115qCCmS].

> Hold on, I should verify that my plan aligns with both treat-to-target and intensity-based approaches. While ACC/AHA emphasizes percentage LDL-C reduction by intensity, a treat-to-target strategy can be noninferior in coronary patients and may help tailor dosing; practically, I will target at least a 30% reduction for moderate intensity and at least 50% for high intensity, and in very high-risk ASCVD I will aim for LDL-C less than 70 mg/dL if achievable, escalating to ezetimibe and then PCSK9 inhibition if thresholds are not met on maximally tolerated statin [^111QzQMo] [^115sTb9b] [^115toYX3].

> Let me synthesize a concise algorithm and make sure nothing is missing. First, assess risk and classify primary versus secondary prevention and special high-risk states; second, choose intensity aligned with risk and patient factors; third, pick a generic atorvastatin or rosuvastatin dose matched to intensity; fourth, obtain baseline labs and counsel; fifth, recheck lipids at 4–12 weeks and titrate every 4–12 weeks until the percentage reduction goal is achieved; sixth, if goals are not met, add ezetimibe and then PCSK9 therapy in appropriate patients; seventh, manage intolerance with switching, dose reduction, or intermittent dosing; eighth, monitor long-term every 3–12 months and reinforce adherence at each visit [^111QWr6D] [^111rj6qV] [^115sTb9b].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making is explicit. Before initiating therapy in borderline or intermediate risk, I should discuss absolute risk reduction, potential benefits and harms, the role of risk enhancers, and the option of CAC testing, documenting the conversation and the patient's preference; this approach improves alignment with guideline intent and patient-centered care while avoiding both over- and under-treatment [^111sWz51] [^113UHS9u] [^116aU1uF].

For most adults aged 40–75 years at intermediate ASCVD risk (7.5–20% 10-year risk) [^111QWr6D], **start with a moderate-intensity statin** (e.g. atorvastatin 10–20 mg or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg daily) [^114t4u26] [^111rj6qV] and titrate to a ≥ 30% LDL-C reduction [^111QWr6D] [^111rj6qV]. For high-risk patients (≥ 20% 10-year risk or clinical ASCVD) [^111QWr6D], **start with a high-intensity statin** (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg daily) to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction [^111rj6qV] [^115toYX3]. Use generic statins when available [^114j5adR], monitor lipids 4–12 weeks after initiation [^111rj6qV], and adjust therapy based on response and tolerance [^114UAUU2].

---

## General principles for statin initiation

- **Risk assessment**: Use the ASCVD Risk Estimator to calculate 10-year risk and guide intensity [^111QWr6D] [^1138QxsW].

- **Intensity selection**: Match statin intensity to risk category and LDL-C goals [^111QWr6D] [^111rj6qV].

- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss benefits, risks, and patient preferences before starting therapy [^111sWz51] [^112Huago].

- **Monitoring**: Check fasting lipids 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change, then every 3–12 months [^111rj6qV] [^114UAUU2].

## Recommended starting statins by risk category

| **Risk category** | **Recommended statin intensity** | **Examples of statins and doses** |
|-|-|-|
| Low risk (< 5% 10-year ASCVD risk) | Lifestyle modifications first; statins not routinely recommended | N/A |
| Borderline risk (5–7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) | Consider moderate-intensity statin if risk enhancers present | Atorvastatin 10–20 mg or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg daily |
| Intermediate risk (7.5–20% 10-year ASCVD risk) | Moderate-intensity statin | Atorvastatin 10–20 mg or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg daily |
| High risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk or clinical ASCVD) | High-intensity statin | Atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg daily |

---

## Specific patient populations

### Diabetes mellitus

In diabetes mellitus, **moderate-intensity statin** is recommended for adults aged 40–75 years [^111QWr6D]; use **high-intensity statin** if multiple ASCVD risk factors are present [^111QWr6D].

---

### Severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL)

For severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL), **high-intensity statin** is recommended without risk assessment [^111QWr6D].

---

### Older adults (≥ 75 years)

For adults aged ≥ 75 years, **individualize therapy** based on comorbidities, frailty, and patient preferences [^111Y7GK5] [^113vETxB].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Lipid panel**: Recheck 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change, then every 3–12 months [^111rj6qV] [^114UAUU2].

- **Liver enzymes**: Monitor ALT/AST if clinically indicated [^114RoPh6].

- **Muscle symptoms**: Assess for myalgias; check CK if symptoms suggest myopathy [^114RoPh6] [^111WJhXw].

---

## Managing statin intolerance

- **Dose adjustment**: Lower dose or switch to another statin [^112VTK5P] [^111WJhXw].

- **Alternative dosing**: Use intermittent dosing (e.g. every other day) with long-acting statins [^112VTK5P] [^111WJhXw].

- **Non-statin therapy**: Add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C goals are not met [^115toYX3] [^116vK1gv].

---

## Cost considerations

Prefer **generic statins** when available to reduce cost and improve access [^114j5adR].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Intermediate risk**: Start moderate-intensity statin (atorvastatin 10–20 mg or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg daily) [^111QWr6D] [^114t4u26].

- **High risk**: Start high-intensity statin (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg daily) [^111QWr6D] [^115sTb9b].

- **Monitoring**: Recheck lipids 4–12 weeks after initiation, then every 3–12 months [^111rj6qV] [^114UAUU2].

- **Intolerance**: Adjust dose, switch statin, or add non-statin therapy as needed [^112VTK5P] [^117LmuJC].

---

Starting with a **moderate-intensity statin** is appropriate for most intermediate-risk adults, while **high-intensity statins** are reserved for high-risk patients or those with severe hypercholesterolemia. Therapy should be individualized, monitored, and adjusted to achieve LDL-C goals and minimize adverse effects.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease [^1127upoK]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Statins rank among the most commonly prescribed drug classes. Recent revisions of clinical guidelines for CVD risk reduction have significantly expanded the population of patients deemed eligible for statin therapy. As the high levels of statin prescribing in the UK are similar to those in the United States and many other countries, the findings should translate well, particularly to other similar western populations. There was a substantial duration of follow-up for outcomes. A wide range of potential confounders were also evaluated and adjusted for in the analyses.

Based on evidence from clinical trial settings, the response of patients to statins varies widely, with reductions in LDL-C values following the administration of statins ranging from 5–70%. In our study using a large general population reflecting routine practice, over half of the patients had a sub-optimal LDL-C response.

Currently, there is no management strategy in clinical practice which takes into account patient variations in LDL-C response, and no guidelines for predictive screening before commencement of statin therapy. Validated clinical decision tools which can predict cholesterol response to statins, or to non-statin drugs, with interventions to help clinicians to tailor and optimise statin treatments for individual patients are needed.

### A point-by-point response to recent arguments against the use of statins in primary prevention: this statement is endorsed by the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^112yqeQY]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, a debate over the merits of statin therapy in primary prevention was published in the Wall Street Journal. The statin opponent claimed that statins should only be used in secondary prevention and never in any primary-prevention patients at risk for cardiovascular events. In this evidence-based rebuttal to those claims, we review the evidence supporting the efficacy of statin therapy in primary prevention. Cardiovascular risk is a continuum in which those at an elevated risk of events stand to benefit from early initiation of therapy. Statins should not be reserved until after a patient suffers the catastrophic consequences of atherosclerosis. Contrary to the assertions of the statin opponent, this principle has been demonstrated through reductions in heart attacks, strokes, and mortality in numerous randomized controlled primary-prevention statin trials. Furthermore, data show that once a patient tolerates the initial treatment period, the few side effects that subsequently emerge are largely reversible. Accordingly, every major guidelines committee endorses statin use in secondary prevention and selectively in primary prevention for those with risk factors. The foundation for prevention remains increased physical activity, better dietary habits, and smoking cessation. However, prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and death from cardiovascular disease does not have to be all or none-all statin or all lifestyle. In selected at-risk individuals, the combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes is more effective than either alone. Future investigation in prevention should focus on improving our ability to identify these at-risk individuals.

### Refining statin prescribing in lower-risk individuals: informing risk / benefit decisions [^1122Jvkr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, as well as those from the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense and the Joint British Societies all recommended treating more people with statins than previous guidelines. In each guideline, the decision-making process began with an assessment of overall cardiovascular risk. Each group proposed updated treatment thresholds, and all of them lowered the threshold compared with earlier guidelines. Since release of these new guidelines in 2013 and 2014, additional evidence has emerged to suggest a rationale for extending statin consideration to an even larger proportion of asymptomatic adults-even those with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk below 7.5%. This review discusses new findings since 2013 and proposes strategies emanating from the current guidelines to help clinicians and patients make more informed decisions about long-term statin use, especially pertinent to lower-risk patients.

### Statins in acute coronary syndromes: do the guideline recommendations match the evidence? [^1171vKTk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

On the basis of the evidence obtained from observational studies, randomized controlled trials and their meta-analyses, current guidelines recommend initiating high-dose statin therapy pre-discharge regardless of the baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Careful review of the evidence indicates that early initiation of high-dose statin therapy reduces recurrent ischemia and may reduce revascularization, but does not confer benefit in terms of hard clinical outcomes such as death or myocardial infarction in any of the randomized controlled trials, and may be associated with increased liver and muscle-related adverse outcomes leading to increased withdrawal and suboptimal long-term adherence. A mortality benefit is apparent in pooled analyses of randomized controlled trials only at long-term (24-month) but not short-term (4-month) follow-up. The critical role of the timing of initiation of therapy (early vs. late) on the benefit-risk profile of statin treatment has not been systematically assessed. It is unclear whether the clinical benefits are attributable to lipid-lowering or lipid-lowering-independent effects. Finally, an optimal LDL threshold for initiating treatment or target LDL level for treatment in ACS remains yet to be defined. On the basis of these observations, and despite a compelling pathophysiologic rationale, the justification for current Class I, Level of Evidence: A recommendation for statin therapy in patients with ACS remains open to question.

Research needs and gaps — Priority evidence gaps include determining the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins for primary prevention in adults 76 years or older; establishing the efficacy and safety of long-term statin use in adults younger than 40 years and the effects of earlier vs delayed initiation in persons with an estimated high long-term (longer than 10 years, lifetime) risk of CVD; conducting trials that directly compare titration to target lipid levels vs fixed-dose therapy and higher- vs lower-intensity statins powered for clinical outcomes; definitively determining whether statin therapy is associated with increased risk of diabetes in primary prevention populations; and clarifying the role of patient preferences across the spectrum of CVD risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^113bsXMv]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Thresholds for consideration of drug therapy — risk-based initiation: Because of available inexpensive, generic statins with favorable safety and demonstrated efficacy, the NLA Expert Panel consensus view is that risk thresholds for initiating drug treatment should be lowered as compared with the NCEP ATP III but raised as compared with ACC/AHA 2013 recommendations; based on the ACC/AHA 2013 guidelines, most men > 60 years of age and most women > 70 years of age would be eligible for statin therapy, and recommendations involve a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. Some clinicians may prefer to prescribe drug therapy to patients with lower levels of risk or atherogenic cholesterol, and such an approach may be considered based on clinical judgment and patient preferences in light of primary prevention randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing risk reduction at projected 10-year ASCVD event rates as low as approximately 5% to 7.5%.

### Statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: pros [^1123QQkc]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

The initiation of statins for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains a debated subject, despite decades worth of clinical trial data demonstrating efficacy, effectiveness, and safety. Statin therapy, in addition to blood pressure-lowering drugs and efforts to reduce cigarette smoking, was a key component of the preventive cardiology renaissance that achieved a dramatic reduction in ASCVD-related mortality from the 1950s to 2010. However, deaths attributable to ASCVD have increased by approximately 13% in recent years, which are in part driven by incomplete treatment of risk factor burden starting in youth. Statins are a cornerstone of preventive cardiology practice, not only due to their lipid-lowering properties, but also in part due to their ability to exert pleiotropic effects that promote atherosclerotic plaque stability which reduces the likelihood of atherothrombotic clinical events. While the benefit of statin therapy undoubtedly depends on the presence and degree of atherosclerotic plaque burden, a broader statin allocation strategy on a population-based level should be considered especially in younger communities that are disproportionately affected by ASCVD risk factors. Thus, the era of precision medicine must be balanced with a pragmatic, cost-effective approach that maximizes ASCVD prevention across the life course. Herein, we examine the pros of statin pharmacotherapy in primary prevention while examining over three decades worth of basic science, translational, and clinical research in the setting of clinical practice guidelines.

### Percent reduction in LDL cholesterol following high-intensity statin therapy: potential implications for guidelines and for the prescription of emerging lipid-lowering agents [^115gAEZJ]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Current statin guidelines in Europe and Canada advocate achieving a fixed LDL target or the attainment of a ≥ 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), while current US guidelines advocate the use of statin therapies that reduce LDLC by < 50% (moderate intensity) or ≥ 50% (high intensity). Data are limited, however, linking the achievement of these % reduction thresholds to subsequent cardiovascular outcomes particularly for contemporary high-intensity regimens.

Methods and Results

In a randomized trial of 17 082 initially healthy men and women with median baseline LDLC of 108 mg/dL (interquartile range 94–119), we (i) used waterfall plots to assess the variability in LDLC response to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily and (ii) evaluated the impact of reaching ≥ 50% reductions in LDLC on risk of developing the first cardiovascular events. Among rosuvastatin allocated participants, 3640 individuals (46.3%) experienced an LDLC reduction ≥ 50%; 3365 individuals (42.8%) experienced an LDLC reduction > 0 but < 50%; and 851 individuals (10.8%) experienced no reduction or an increase in LDLC compared with baseline. These % LDLC reductions directly related to the risks of first cardiovascular events; at trial completion, incidence rates for the primary endpoint were 11.2, 9.2, 6.7, and 4.8 per 1000 person-years for those in the placebo, no LDLC reduction, LDLC reduction < 50%, and LDLC reduction ≥ 50% groups, respectively. Compared with placebo, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for sequentially greater on-treatment per cent reductions in LDLC were 0.91 (95%CI 0.54–1.53), 0.61 (95%CI 0.44–0.83), and 0.43 (95%CI 0.30–0.60) (P < 0.00001). Similar relationships between % reduction and clinical outcomes were observed in analyses focusing on non-HDLC or apolipoprotein B.

Conclusions

As documented for low- and moderate-intensity regimens, variability in % LDLC reduction following high-intensity statin therapy is wide yet the magnitude of this % reduction directly relates to efficacy. These data support guideline approaches that incorporate % reduction targets for statin therapy as well as absolute targets, and might provide a structure for the allocation of emerging adjunctive lipid-lowering therapies such as PCSK9 inhibitors should these agents prove broadly effective for cardiovascular event reduction.

### PES lipid SIG diabetes and lipids algorithm [^115TTmH9]. PES (2024). High credibility.

PES Lipid SIG LDL-C algorithm — initial therapy, goals, reassessment, and escalation — directs that when LDL-C meets the threshold to treat: for High risk, Start CHILD-2 LDL diet* and increase physical activity (goal > 5h/week) AND Start statin simultaneously (as per Fig 1, page 2) with Goal LDL-C < 100 mg/dL; for Moderate risk, Start CHILD-2 LDL diet* and increase physical activity (goal > 5h/week) x 3 mo with Goal LDL-C < 130 mg/dL; and for At risk, Start CHILD-2 LDL diet* and increase physical activity (goal > 5h/week) x 6 mo with Goal LDL-C < 130 mg/dl. After treatment, Repeat LDL-C, meets goal? If yes, Continue current therapy, monitor/reassess periodically; if no, High risk: Titrate statin to goal as above; Moderate risk: Consider statin and titrate to goal as above, intensify lifestyle; At risk: Consider statin and titrate to goal as above, intensify lifestyle.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1154wzMH]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

### Guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia: how can clinicians effectively implement them? [^113tgunW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Guidelines support lowering cholesterol to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk across the entire lifespan with intensive lifestyle intervention, as well as statin and non-statin pharmacotherapy for those at highest risk. Modest improvements in the initiation, use, and adherence to statin therapy in patients with ASCVD have occurred over the past decades. However, studies continue to document a less than desired implementation of guidelines highlighting a substantial and persistent treatment gap. The success of implementation depends on the consideration of a variety of barriers that exist throughout the healthcare delivery system. Further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate these barriers in order to develop appropriate and sustainable interventions to improve guideline implementation.

### Predictors of first-year statin medication discontinuation: a cohort study [^117HdFhU]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite well-documented benefits of statins, discontinuation of statin medication is common among primary and secondary prevention patients.

Several predictors of discontinuation are readily assessable and can provide information with which to identify those with an increased risk of nonadherence.

In clinical practice, many patients for whom statins are prescribed discontinue the use of the drug within a year, which is likely to reduce any benefit of medication and increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Increased efforts to motivate treatment adherence in risk groups could reduce discontinuation and cardiovascular events.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — implementation — advises to consider the patient's age and, for adults aged 40 to 75 years, determine whether the patient has a cardiovascular risk factor, estimate CVD risk, and in patients with a cardiovascular risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater, initiate a moderate-intensity statin after discussing the rationale and provided the patient agrees; in patients with a cardiovascular risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%, clinicians should selectively offer a statin, taking patient values and preferences into account; for adults 76 years or older, the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against starting a statin.

### The efficiency of cardiovascular risk assessment: do the right patients get statin treatment? [^114ATqhc]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate targeting of statin prescribing for primary prevention to those with high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

Design

Two cohort studies including the general population and initiators of statins aged 35–74 years.

Setting

UK primary care records in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.

Patients

3.8 million general population patients and 300 914 statin users.

Intervention

Statin prescribing.

Main Outcome Measures

Statin prescribing by CVD risk; observed 5-year CVD risks; variability between practices.

Results

Statin prescribing increased substantially over time to patients with high 10-year CVD risk (≥ 20%): 7.0% of these received a statin prior to 2007, and 30.4% in 2007 onwards. Prescribing to patients with low risk (< 15%) also increased (from 1.9% to 5.0%). Only about half the patients initiating statin treatment were high risk according to CVD risk score. The 5-year CVD risks, as observed during statin treatment, reduced over calendar time (from 17.0% to 7.1%). There was a large variation between general practices in the percentage of high-risk patients prescribed a statin in 2007 onwards, ranging from 8.2% to 61.5%. For low-risk patients, these varied from 2.1% to 29.1%.

Conclusions

There appeared to be substantive overuse in low CVD risk and underuse in high CVD risk (600 000 and 850 000 patients, respectively, in the UK since 2007). There is wide variation between practices in statin prescribing to patients at high CVD risk. There is a clear need for randomised trials for the best strategy to target statin treatment and manage CVD risk for primary prevention.

### Combination therapy with statins: who benefits? [^116KNohX]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Many lipid-lowering drugs improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. However, when therapies have been studied in addition to statins, it has been challenging to show an additional clinical benefit in terms of CV event reduction, although overall safety seems acceptable. This debate has been complicated by recent guidelines that emphasize treatment with high-potency statin monotherapy. Combination therapy allows more patients to successfully reach their ideal lipid targets. Further testing of novel therapies may introduce an era of potent low-density lipoprotein decrease without dependence on statins, but until then, they remain the mainstay of therapy.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

### Statin use and cardiovascular risk in young adults in the United States [^11775BjY]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease pathogenesis begins in early adulthood, yet guidance on statin use for primary prevention in young adults is limited.

Methods

This is a retrospective multicenter cohort study of adults aged 20–39 years receiving primary care within 87 U.S. health systems (2022–2023). The study included patients with at least 1 low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) measurement. The primary outcome was the measured the proportion of patients prescribed a statin within 1 month of LDL-C testing. The characteristics of those who were and were not prescribed statins were compared using standardized mean differences. Finally, the PREVENT 10- and 30-year ASCVD risk scores for the "average" patient (using the cohort mean values of risk score variables), a "lower-risk" patient, and a "higher-risk" patient were compared (using pooled values 1 SD below and above the mean, respectively). Analyses were conducted in 2024–2025.

Results

Statins were initiated in 3,309 of 775,162 patients. Those who received statins were more likely to be older, male, and have higher mean LDL-C, systolic blood pressure, HgA1c, and BMI (standardized mean differences > 0.10). PREVENT 10-year risk scores were similar or higher among those prescribed statins compared to those not prescribed statins for the average (0.75% vs 0.76%), lower-risk (0.19% vs 0.35%), and higher-risk (8.87% vs 4.55%) groups.

Conclusions

In a multicenter cohort, 0.43% of young adults were prescribed a statin within 1 month of initial LDL-C measurement. The average patient would not have qualified for statin therapy based on their PREVENT risk percentile. Future studies should evaluate the cost effectiveness of statins for primary prevention in patients aged 20 to 39 years.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115RDxGq]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — statin primary prevention recommendations state that the USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater; the USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for adults aged 40 to 75 years with 1 or more CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7.5% to less than 10%, noting that the likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater; and for adults 76 years or older the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) not at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — treatment targets and next steps: The writing committee considered a desirable response to therapy as having achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL). Meta-analysis in this patient population has shown a 22% proportional risk reduction for major vascular events for each 38-mg/dL (1-mmol/L) reduction in LDL-C, and this is true even if baseline LDL is < 77 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). After achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline, further reductions in LDL-C should be discussed with the patient if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL. If patients who are not at very high risk have a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and continue to monitor adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications and ongoing LDL-C response to therapy. If a patient has a less-than-anticipated response (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL or non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if LDL-C lowering remains inadequate, the patient and clinician should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication to the current regimen, and if no additional medication is chosen, it is reasonable to continue current therapy with ongoing monitoring. Although there is a gap in RCT evidence in this group, the writing committee supports consideration of adding ezetimibe 10 mg daily as the initial nonstatin agent, given the benefits on ASCVD outcomes and demonstrated safety of ezetimibe in patients with ACS treated with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin monotherapy.

Introduction

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline suggests several significant changes to the former treatment paradigm for lipid therapy. 1 One of the most controversial aspects of the guideline is the movement away from a low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) target attainment approach to a statin initiation strategy that selects statin intensity based on clinical trial evidence of reduction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by use of statins in specific populations. The ACC/AHA guideline recommendations result from an analysis of pooled evidence from randomized clinical trials. The guideline recommends evaluating a patient's future risk for ASCVD events; for those individuals in whom the benefit of statin treatment was likely to be greater than the risk of adverse events, statin therapy was recommended. 1 With this approach, individuals should be placed on the evidence‐based, preferred intensity of statin, with adjustments made, if necessary, to accommodate any tolerability issues for that individual. Monitoring LDL‐C levels would then be performed to assess appropriate response to a specific intensity of statin therapy and adherence to therapy. In following this evidence‐based approach, the recommendation for many of these patients is a high‐intensity statin (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Statin benefit groups identified in the 2013/cholesterol management guideline./indicates American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association;, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease;‐C, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Several studies have been conducted since the guideline was introduced in an attempt to identify the potential impact of the guideline. In studies evaluating statin prescribing in which the presence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease was determined by coronary imaging, a greater proportion of patients were eligible for a statin based on the ACC/AHA guideline compared with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guideline. 2, 3 Chia et al compared the Pooled Cohort Risk Score with actual practice data from 1998 to 2007 and found that statin use would need to increase under the new guideline. 4, 5 Preguideline data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence registry (2008–2012) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2005 to 2010 were assessed to estimate the impact of the guideline on statin practice patterns. This analysis found that compliance with the new guideline should result in a meaningful increase in statin use, especially in the group of patients with 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. 6, 7

USPSTF assessment of magnitude of net benefit — The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit; with an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit and the decision to initiate therapy should depend on individual patient preference; and in adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms.

Statin intolerance — NLA definition and management: Statin intolerance was defined by the panel as adverse symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities attributed by the patient (or provider) to the statin and in most cases perceived by the patient to interfere unacceptably with activities of daily living, leading to a decision to stop or reduce statin therapy; myalgia, defined as muscle aches, soreness, stiffness or tenderness, is the most frequently reported side effect of statin use with reports generally ranging from 1–5% in controlled clinical trials to 11–29% in observational studies. The NLA Statin Safety Panel stated that patients should be told that whether to continue taking the statin is their decision, but it is best guided by advice from their health care provider, and patients should be advised that before stopping a statin due to possible side effects, they should first speak to their health care provider. Even if statin intolerance is confirmed, in most cases the clinician and patient should attempt to maintain statin treatment in some form to reduce the patient's CVD event risk; options for continuing statin therapy include a lower daily dosage of the same statin, less than daily dosages of the same statin (optimally with a long-acting statin, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin), or use of an alternative statin, and patients who are initially intolerant to 1 statin can often tolerate a different statin. The highest tolerated dose of statin should be targeted, and other non-statin lipid-lowering drugs are options for patients with statin intolerance with consideration of their potential for side effects.

### Treat-to-target or high-intensity statin in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized clinical trial [^111QzQMo]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In patients with coronary artery disease, some guidelines recommend initial statin treatment with high-intensity statins to achieve at least a 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). An alternative approach is to begin with moderate-intensity statins and titrate to a specific LDL-C goal. These alternatives have not been compared head-to-head in a clinical trial involving patients with known coronary artery disease.

Objective

To assess whether a treat-to-target strategy is noninferior to a strategy of high-intensity statins for long-term clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, multicenter, noninferiority trial in patients with a coronary disease diagnosis treated at 12 centers in South Korea (enrollment: September 9, 2016, through November 27, 2019; final follow-up: October 26, 2022).

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the LDL-C target strategy, with an LDL-C level between 50 and 70 mg/dL as the target, or high-intensity statin treatment, which consisted of rosuvastatin, 20 mg, or atorvastatin, 40 mg.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point was a 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization with a noninferiority margin of 3.0 percentage points.

Results

Among 4400 patients, 4341 patients (98.7%) completed the trial (mean [SD] age, 65.1 [9.9] years; 1228 females [27.9%]). In the treat-to-target group (n = 2200), which had 6449 person-years of follow-up, moderate-intensity and high-intensity dosing were used in 43% and 54%, respectively. The mean (SD) LDL-C level for 3 years was 69.1 (17.8) mg/dL in the treat-to-target group and 68.4 (20.1) mg/dL in the high-intensity statin group (n = 2200) (P = 0.21, compared with the treat-to-target group). The primary end point occurred in 177 patients (8.1%) in the treat-to-target group and 190 patients (8.7%) in the high-intensity statin group (absolute difference, -0.6 percentage points [upper boundary of the 1-sided 97.5% CI, 1.1 percentage points]; P < .001 for noninferiority).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with coronary artery disease, a treat-to-target LDL-C strategy of 50 to 70 mg/dL as the goal was noninferior to a high-intensity statin therapy for the 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization. These findings provide additional evidence supporting the suitability of a treat-to-target strategy that may allow a tailored approach with consideration for individual variability in drug response to statin therapy.

### Prescriber uptake and use of novel lipid-lowering therapies [^113YEmSK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cholesterol lowering is the cornerstone of prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), because it reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, many patients with ASCVD fail to achieve lipid targets. Among patients with ASCVD in the United States, 55.5% had low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) > 70 mg/dL, including 71.8% of those on a high‐intensity statin. More recent consensus statements and guidelines recommend even lower LDL‐C levels (< 55 mg/dL) in those with ASCVD. Even with widespread use of high‐intensity statins and ezetimibe, many with ASCVD will need additional add‐on therapy to achieve an LDL‐C < 55 mg/dL. Multiple novel lipid‐lowering therapy (LLT) options, including PCSK9i (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and bempedoic acid (BA) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in patients unable to reach lipid goals on statin therapy or who are intolerant to statins.

### Statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113puV6h]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

Bottom Line

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### Management of dyslipidemia for cardiovascular disease risk reduction: synopsis of the 2020 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^117PSxEw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD dyslipidemia guideline — duration and continuity of statin therapy: Any recommendation on the optimal duration of statin use beyond that of clinical trials (i.e., about six years) is unknown. After trials, the proportion taking statins was nearly identical (within 4%) between previous statin and control populations, and long-term follow-up studies simply demonstrate the continuing advantage of the initial study period for the treatment group. One review identified a cohort suggesting a significant reduction in myocardial infarction with two years of continuous statin use versus non-continuous use. The evidence of the risks of non-continuous statin treatment suggests the decision to start therapy should be considered lifelong, and the NNT is large overall and increases for patients at lower risk.

Adults with clinical ASCVD and baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL on statin therapy should be managed by response thresholds and stepwise intensification: If patients have ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and monitor adherence and ongoing LDL-C response; if response is less than anticipated on maximally tolerated statin therapy, with < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted and such patients should be considered for referral to a lipid specialist and RD/RDN, especially if they have documented HeFH or HoFH; if after these interventions the patient still has < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), the addition of a nonstatin medication to the current regimen should be considered, and the addition of either ezetimibe or a PCSK9 mAb as the initial nonstatin agent should be considered; ezetimibe 10 mg daily may be considered as the initial nonstatin agent for these patients when additional LDL-C lowering is desired, with selection favored when < 25% additional lowering is required and acknowledging interindividual variability with some patients experiencing > 25% reduction in LDL-C.

Because of a variety of factors, changes to guidelines may not be efficiently adapted and implemented. 8 With significant changes such as with the cholesterol guideline, the uptake may be delayed as well as vary greatly in extent between regions, patient populations, and physician types. From a public health perspective, the impact of a change in guideline should be evaluated. To date, 2 studies have been published that assess the impact of the guideline on statin prescribing patterns in patients with an ASCVD diagnosis. Both of these studies were limited to a single health system, and neither assessed changes in statin treatment patterns for primary prevention of ASCVD. 9, 10 The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the new guideline on statin‐initiating treatment patterns with regard to statin intensity for primary and secondary ASCVD prevention in the 2 years following its release. This will provide useful insight to help inform healthcare decision makers with regard to the use of moderate‐ and high‐intensity statin therapies in the near and longer terms as this guideline becomes more thoroughly integrated into clinical practice.

### The ACC / AHA 2013 guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: the good the bad and the uncertain: a comparison with ESC / EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias 2011 [^11179jnJ]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most important public health problem of our time in both Europe and the rest of the world, accounting for the greatest expenditure in most healthcare budgets. Achieving consistency of clinical care, incorporating new evidence and their synthesis into practical recommendations for clinicians is the task of various guideline committees throughout the world. Any change in a set of guidelines therefore can have far reaching consequences, particularly if they appear to be at variance with the existing guidelines. The present article discusses the recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines 2013 on the control of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults. When compared with the ESC/EAS guidelines on lipid modification in 2011, the ACC/AHA guidelines of 2013 differ markedly. Specifically, (i) the scope is limited to randomized trials only, which excludes a significant body of data and promotes essentially a statin centric approach only; (ii) the abolition of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in favour of specific statin regimens that produce a 30–50% reduction in LDL-C we believe will confuse many physicians and miss the opportunity for medication adherence and patient engagement in self-management; (iii) the absence of target LDL-C levels in very high-risk patients with high absolute risk or residual risk factors will discourage clinicians to consider the addition of lipid modification treatments and individualize patient care; (iv) a reduction in the threshold for treatment in primary prevention will result in a greater number of patients being prescribed statin therapy, which is potentially good in young patients with high life time risk, but will result in a very large number of older patients offered therapy; and (v) the mixed pool risk calculator used to asses CVD risk in the guidelines for primary prevention has not been fully evaluated. This article discusses the potential implications of adopting the ACC/AHA guidelines on patient care in Europe and beyond and concludes with the opinion that the ESC/EAS guidelines from 2011 seem to be the most wide ranging, pragmatic and appropriate choice for European countries.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

AHA/ACC 2018 cholesterol guideline — monitoring in response to LDL-C–lowering therapy states that adherence to lifestyle changes and effects of LDL-C–lowering medication should be assessed by fasting lipids and safety indicators 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and every 3 to 12 months thereafter (Class I, Level A). Goals for LDL-C lowering are defined by percentage responses, and clinical efficacy is monitored by percentage reduction in LDL-C relative to baseline, which can be estimated by pretreatment measurements, chart reviews, or after a short interruption of therapy. Good adherence to LDL-lowering diets typically reduces LDL-C by 10% to > 15%, moderate-intensity statins by another 30% to 49%, and high-intensity statins by ≥ 50%.

Monitoring in response to LDL-C–lowering therapy — adherence and effects should be checked by measurement of fasting lipids and safety indicators 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and every 3 to 12 months thereafter, and the maximum percentage change will occur by 4 to 12 weeks after starting a statin or combined therapy. Good adherence to LDL-lowering diets will reduce LDL-C by 10% to > 15%; moderate-intensity statins can be expected to reduce LDL-C by another 30% to 49%, and high-intensity statins by ≥ 50%; adding ezetimibe or bile acid sequestrants to a statin typically provides an additional 15% to 25% reduction in LDL-C, with much greater additive reductions when a PCSK9 inhibitor is added to statin plus ezetimibe.

### Recommendations for statin management in primary prevention: disparities among international risk scores [^115UN3sE]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the consensus-driven process of algorithmic risk stratification as the first step to determine statin allocation in primary prevention in many prominent lipid guidelines leads to marked heterogeneity on an international scale with respect to treatment eligibility and the potential need for ancillary testing. In the context of such heterogeneity, most algorithms systematically identify candidates for treatment who are predominantly male, are of advanced age, and have co-morbidities of hypertension and/or smoking. Whether this is the best approach for reducing or eliminating lipid-specific cardiovascular risk in the general population should be re-considered.

Perspectives: core clinical competencies

Risk algorithms induce profound variance in statin treatment decisions and the potential for reliance on ancillary testing. The results bring into question whether algorithm-based approaches are optimal for lowering lipid-related risk in primary prevention.

Translational outlook

Additional studies are required to establish an internationally accepted patient phenotype warranting primary prevention therapy with statins based on available randomized clinical trial data.

### Optimising treatment of hyperlipidaemia: quantitative evaluation of UK, USA and European guidelines taking account of both LDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease risk [^114gD4a6]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Guidelines for cholesterol-lowering medication either advocate fixed dose statin treatment without low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol targets or treatment aimed at LDL cholesterol goals. The decrease in LDL cholesterol concentration determines the reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

Methods

As indices of the effectiveness of reductions in LDL cholesterol concentration achieved by the various guidelines, the number of CVD events prevented in 100 people during 10 years of treatment (N 100) and the number of people, who must be treated for 10 years to prevent one CVD event (NNT), were calculated taking into account both CVD risk and pretreatment LDL cholesterol concentration. That our method of calculating NNT and N 100, could be extended to statin regimens of different intensity or of statin combined with adjunctive cholesterol-lowering medication was demonstrated by meta-analysis.

Results

Reductions in LDL-cholesterol concentration are determined by the choice and dose of medication and by the pre-treatment LDL-cholesterol concentration. At similar CVD risk, whatever cholesterol-lowering strategy is adopted, people with higher pre-treatment LDL cholesterol benefit more than those with lower levels. Fixed dose statin regimens are less effective than target LDL cholesterol levels of 1.8 or 1.4 mmol/l when pre-treatment LDL-cholesterol levels exceed 4 mmol/l. However, fixed dose statin is more effective in people with lower initial LDL cholesterol. The predicted NNT and N 100 were closely related to the observed reduction in CVD risk in our meta-analysis.

Conclusions

In hypercholesterolaemia, aiming for LDL cholesterol targets with statin dose titration (and when necessary adjunctive medication) is essential to optimise benefit.

### Initiation patterns of statins in the 2 Years after release of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association (ACC / AHA) cholesterol management guideline in a large US health plan [^115HpzZS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In the period immediately following the release of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline, initiation of high‐intensity statins appears to have moderately increased among patients who were previously statin naïve. Specialist physicians appeared to more aggressively implement the guideline, and initiation of guideline‐approved therapy remains lower in women compared with their male counterparts. More research and/or more follow‐up time postguideline is needed to understand to what degree the guideline will be incorporated into practice patterns, and if the new guideline is implemented fully, how effective the change in practice will be in reducing LDL‐C and cardiovascular risk among patients in the 4 statin benefit groups.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1147bDQZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

Statin initiation — prior to therapy, complete baseline steps: "Counsel about side effects, potential medication interactions, contraindications, adherence", "Obtain baseline labs: ALT, AST, CK", then "Start statin". Reassess with "Recheck fasting lipids in 4 weeks, LDL-C at goal?"; if yes, evaluate "Signs of toxicity?" with toxicity defined as "Toxicity = AST, ALT > 3x ULN, or CK > 10x ULN (check CK if concern for myopathy)". If toxicity is present, "Stop statin, recheck labs in 2 weeks, if labs and symptoms normalize consider restarting lower dose or with different statin"; if no toxicity, "Continue current therapy, and monitor per page 1, 'Diabetes and lipids' algorithm". If LDL-C is not at goal, "Assess/ensure compliance, titrate statin", then "Recheck fasting lipids in 4 weeks" and "recheck every 4 weeks until at goal LDL-C level"; if still not tolerating, "see 'Beyond Statin' algorithm", and if not at goal on maximal dosing, "consider adding or switching to another agent". Safety notes specify "Side effects: muscle pain/cramp, weakness, myopathy", and interactions: "cyclosporine, niacin, fibric acid derivative, erythromycin, azole antifungal, HIV protease inhibitor". Use is restricted in special populations: "Contraindicated in pregnancy, known teratogen", and "Also contraindicated in nursing mothers, acute liver disease, hypersensitivity to statin". Pediatric labeling states, "Currently statins are approved for children starting age 7 years for hoFH and age 8 years for HeFH". A dosing principle is provided: "2x dose = ↓ 6% LDL-C".

### Updated cholesterol guidelines and intensity of statin therapy [^116VyFcQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released new cholesterol guidelines. Implications of these new guidelines for statin prescription remain uncertain, particularly in individuals already on statin therapy.

Objective

Our objective was to examine the impact of the guidelines on the intensity of statin therapy at a large academic medical center.

Methods

We queried the electronic health record at the University of Pennsylvania Health System to evaluate current practice patterns at a large academic institution in patients already on statin therapy.

Results

Among 40,036 statin-treated patients, 47% of patients may warrant an intensification of statin therapy according to the updated national cholesterol guidelines.

Conclusions

These findings highlight the magnitude of potential changes in statin prescription patterns favoring higher potency statin therapy, a sizable shift that parallels the predicted increase in statin initiation.

ACC/AHA guideline recommendations for statin intensity in clinical ASCVD — High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated, and when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated. In individuals with clinical ASCVD > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and for adverse effects, drug-drug interactions and to consider patient preferences when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and it is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it. Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, a history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA, and peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115FFUSv]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rationale — primary prevention statins in adults with risk factors: In adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (eg, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking), the USPSTF finds convincing evidence of benefit and concludes with moderate certainty that net benefit is at least moderate when the estimated 10-year CVD event risk is 10% or greater and at least small when risk is 7.5% to less than 10%. The USPSTF states that harms in adults 40 to 75 years are at most small and that evidence is inadequate for benefits and harms in adults 76 years or older; for the small-benefit group, it states the decision to initiate statin therapy should depend on individual patient preference. The USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms for adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111QWr6D]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Are statins indicated in senior citizens? A review of statin therapy in the elderly [^113vETxB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of statin therapy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has demonstrated substantial improvement in morbidity and mortality of the aging population. Despite exhaustive studies demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy linking lower cholesterol levels to decreased vascular events, statin guidelines vary greatly with age, and recommendations are unclear regarding initiation and discontinuation of statin therapy in patients 65 years and older. Data suggest that statins are highly effective at secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events and development of coronary heart disease in patients with a history of vascular disease or risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or smoking. Therefore, patients who meet these criteria, regardless of age, should begin statin therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest that statin therapy may be beneficial in primary prevention of major cardiovascular events, although these data are not as well studied as secondary prevention use of statin therapy, and should therefore be individualized for each patient.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^115frQxr]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Both in primary prevention and in the very-high-risk patients, it seems that statins reduce major cardiovascular events irrespective (at least in part) of the baseline and post-therapy LDL levels achieved. Should statins be generally prescribed in a fixed-dose manner? We would not go so far as to suggest that, but indeed, in the diabetic individual whose LDL cholesterol is seemingly within normal limits, this should be considered. The indication for statin therapy in diabetic individuals should not rely solely on LDL levels but on the inherent cardiovascular risk that accompanies this disease (even if goal LDL levels are met).

We believe that the standards of care for individuals with diabetes should mirror the evidence. Replacing a fixed-dose statin trial scheme with a treat-to-target LDL guideline is controversial. This inherent problem of the current guidelines should be amended. Evidence based on "hard" outcome trials of statin use should guide our treatment goals and considerations, not epidemiologic or extrapolated LDL-based data.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^117MxcDT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction — For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk. Statins have been shown to reduce serum LDL-C levels by 18% to 55%, non–HDL-C by 15% to 51%, and triglycerides by 7% to 30% (in hypertriglyceridemia the reduction is typically by 20% to 50%, particularly with high-potency statins) and increase HDL-C by 5% to 15%. A large body of RCT evidence demonstrates that statins are safe and generally well tolerated by most patients and that they decrease risk for ASCVD events in both primary and secondary prevention in amounts proportional to their cholesterol lowering, and for these reasons, they are considered to be first-line drug treatment in both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

Combination drug therapy in dyslipidemia management — Therapy with a statin plus a second (or third) agent may be considered for patients who have not reached their treatment goals for atherogenic cholesterol levels, particularly in patients with very high or high risk, and the maximum tolerated statin dosage should generally be used before add-on therapy is considered. Among those treated with high-dose statin therapy, more than 40% did not reach their LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL, demonstrating that statin therapy alone may be insufficient for some individuals to reach goal.

Once goals have been achieved, response to therapy should be monitored periodically, and within 4 to 12 months, to confirm maintenance of goal levels and adherence.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^111WJhXw]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 5.
Approach to the patient with statin intolerance.

Some of the muscle symptoms reported with statins may be due to a nocebo effect, suggested by the findings of N-of-1 statin trials and by the lack of a signal for SAMS in blinded trials. Furthermore, most patients who are intolerant to 1 statin can successfully be switched to another statin.

Management of SAMS (Fig. 5) starts with a conversation with the individual patient about the indication for statin treatment and the expected benefit of continued therapy. Preference for continued statin therapy over alternatives should be stressed. For those patients with SAMS and elevation in CK < 5× ULN, options include continuation of the statin without discontinuation if symptoms are tolerable. If discontinuation is favored, symptoms should be reassessed after 2 to 4 weeks. If no improvement is noted, symptoms are likely unrelated to the statin and statin can be reinitiated. If symptoms improve, options include cautiously rechallenging with the original offending statin or switching to an alternative statin, at the usual starting doses. If symptoms recur with this challenge or CK was > 5× ULN at initial assessment, options include rechallenge of the original statin at a lower dose, trial of a lower intensity statin (ie, fluvastatin, pravastatin), or trial of a high-intensity statin with longer half-life (ie, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin) with modified dosing regimen (ie, alternate days, once, twice, or 3 times weekly). Of the available statins, simvastatin may be most associated with SAMS, and fluvastatin the least. Muscle symptoms seem to be dose dependent but unrelated to the degree of LDL lowering.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro / con debate [^113tJw6v]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The other 'big' safety issue is the increased rate of diabetes by an absolute risk of 0.5% (95% CI 0.1–1%, P = 0.012). However, outcomes for those who progressed from an HbA1c below to above the diagnostic threshold to define new onset diabetes were the same as those not developing new onset diabetes in the trials (and we know that patients with established diabetes get even bigger risk reductions from statins in placebo-controlled trials). This is not a reason to be concerned over statins in 'eligible for treatment' populations.

We are unlikely to quantify adverse events much further – there is inevitable subjective weighting and interpretation of the data, which will always attract those that want to argue from one or other standpoint – and there is probably too much sediment to ever clear now.

### Statinopause [^115kh8SZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention. The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines represent a fundamental shift in how statins will be prescribed. The new guidelines recommend statins for nearly all older patients up to age 75 years, including healthy adults with low normal lipid levels and no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors other than age. Under the 2013 guidelines, age becomes a main determinant for initiating statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults. Specifically, according to the new guidelines, white males aged 63–75, white females aged 71–75, African American males aged 66–75, and African American females aged 70–75 with optimal risk factors would be recommended for statin treatment for primary prevention. Based on the new guidelines, one could term these older adults as having "statin deficiency", a condition warranting statin treatment. We call this putative condition of age-related statin deficiency "statinopause". After careful examination of the trial evidence, we find very little support for the new recommendations for primary prevention. The lack of evidence underscores the need for clinical trials to determine the risks and benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults.

4.3 European perspectives

In patients after ACS, the guideline recommends starting high‐intensity statin or the maximum tolerated dose as early as possible, and regardless of initial LDL‐C values, to reach the goals for the very high‐risk group of ≥ 50% reduction from baseline and a goal of < 55 mg/dL (class I, level A). 16 Lipid levels should be evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after ACS to determine whether a reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal < 55 mg/dL have been achieved. If the goal of < 55 mg/dL is not achieved with the maximum tolerated dose of statin, combination with ezetimibe is recommended (class I, level B). 8 If the goal < 55 mg/dL is still not achieved on a maximum tolerated dose of a statin and ezetimibe after 4 to 6 weeks, a combination with a PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended (class I, level A). 9, 15 For patients who present with an ACS and whose LDL‐C levels are not at goal, despite already taking a maximally tolerated statin dose and ezetimibe, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor early after the event (including prior to discharge) should be considered (class II, level C). 2, 17

### Harder-to-treat patients: recognizing them and adapting treatment strategies [^111CDvVj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite significant progress in pharmacologic treatment aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, a number of patient groups that often prove difficult to treat remain. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia may go undiagnosed and untreated or, despite treatment, have persistently elevated lipid levels that confer a high cardiovascular disease risk. Although the true prevalence is unknown, statin intolerance is a common clinical presentation that is difficult to assess and frequently leads to suboptimal lipid treatment. Additionally, some patients may not achieve the expected response to guideline-based therapy. For all 3 groups, a standardized approach offers the best chance for effective diagnosis and optimal treatment.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^111aWe5o]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Implications for the 2013 ACC/AHA Guidelines

Although the guidelines do not recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C goal, they do recommend monitoring LDL‐C to determine adherence and anticipated therapeutic response. There is some evidence that a majority of practitioners are not conducting follow‐up testing of LDL‐C levels. 9 We found similar rates between the pre‐ and postguidelines frequency of LDL tests (1.2 LDL‐C orders per patient in the 2–7 months of follow‐up both before and after the guidelines). It is important to note, however, that reasons for ordering LDL‐C tests cannot be determined from claims, and therefore we do not know whether physicians were continuing to order tests to treat to a LDL‐C goal or to follow guideline recommendations. This raises the larger question of how practitioners are determining treatment success and how they are determining criteria for increasing lipid‐lowering therapy. 11 It is possible that a lack of treatment goals in the guidelines is leading to confusion and a decreased focus on reducing levels of atherogenic lipids. This study and others surveying physician prescribing practices before and after the guidelines suggests a knowledge gap that may be limiting statin prescribing changes. 9 In addition, new lipid‐lowering therapies, such as PCSK9 inhibitors, are currently in use. Cardiovascular outcomes trials of PCSK9 inhibitors are expected to complete in the coming year. 12, 13 If these outcome studies are positive, it is possible that the guidelines will be updated. Our data suggest that more intensive and varied educational efforts will likely be needed in order to help clinicians adopt and more closely follow future lipid treatment guidelines. Furthermore, a simplification of the guidelines or even a return to treatment goals may provide clarity and aid the clinician in determining appropriate therapy for patients.

### Cholesterol levels and cardiovascular outcomes following statin initiation for primary prevention: a cohort study [^112BucZM]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The residual risk of incomplete control of non-HDL-C in the context of controlled LDL-C has been explored by 2 recent studies in Denmark. One study of 13,015 statin-treated patients from the general population found that a non-HDL-C above the sample median was associated with residual risk of mortality and MI even with LDL-C below median. In secondary prevention, a cohort study conducted in Denmark found that among persons with LDL-C at target (≤ 70 mg/dL [1.8 mmol/L]), a non-HDL-C ≥ 97 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) was associated with increased risk of MI, ASCVD, and death. To our knowledge, no studies have explored guideline-directed non-HDL-C thresholds after statin initiation and the association with incident CV events in primary prevention. Thus, our findings add to existing literature.

There remains debate around a treat-to-target approach vs simply initiating a moderate or high-intensity statin depending on CV risk. The Canadian Patients Experience Evidence Research (PEER) simplified lipid guidelinerecommends against repeat lipid testing and use of lipid targets/thresholds, and U.S. guidelines moved away from lipid targets in 2013 with more recent guidelines incorporating percent LDL-C lowering. In 2023, the U.S. National Lipid Association and American Society for Preventive Cardiology advocated for use of LDL-C targets. A treat-to-target approach is centered around analyses that show lower risk of CV events with lower achieved LDL-C levels in statin randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There is a lack of RCT evidence demonstrating whether targeting specific lipid levels is superior to simply initiating statins in primary prevention. Among patients with coronary artery disease, a 2023 RCTfound that a treat-to-target approach was noninferior to high-dose statins in reducing risk of adverse CV events. It is argued that a treat-to-target approach may allow for tailored therapy (eg, use of moderate dose statins to achieve lipid targets in patients at > 20% 10-year CVD risk). While our study cannot show which approach is best, we found that 20% to 30% of patients remain above guideline-directed thresholds for intensification with initial statin therapy and that there is an associated risk of adverse CV events associated with this. Given a small portion were on high-intensity statins, increasing statin doses could be considered without the need for a second agent.

### In-hospital initiation of statin therapy in acute coronary syndromes: maximizing the early and long-term benefits [^1122Dfhp]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at high risk for recurrent coronary events, sudden death, and all-cause mortality. Conventional revascularization therapies reduce the risk of further ischemia but do not affect the underlying atherosclerotic disease. Statins have a proven record in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, statins have been shown to exert varying degrees of pleiotropic effects, which may stabilize vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. A compelling body of evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrates that high-dose, potent statin therapy initiated immediately after an acute coronary event can significantly reduce early as well as longer-term morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, high-dose, potent statin therapy displays a reasonable safety profile. National guidelines now recommend that in patients with ACS, statin therapy should be initiated in hospital prior to discharge, irrespective of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, to improve clinical outcomes. Every effort should be made to ensure all eligible patients with ACS are initiated and maintained on statin therapy.

### Association of primary care providers' beliefs of statins for primary prevention and statin prescription [^111VVWee]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although community‐based PCPs often accurately estimate the benefit of statin therapy, beliefs in potential adverse effects and reported content of clinician‐patient discussions vary. In addition, statin prescription rates for primary prevention are low and minimally influenced by these beliefs, suggesting a need to address patient‐level factors that may influence decisions to initiate statin therapy.

ACC ECDP — treatment targets and intensification after statin initiation: If coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured, see Figure 6 and Section 5.5. On moderate-intensity statin, a 30% to 49% reduction LDL-C with LDL-C threshold < 100 mg/dL represents goal attainment; if not achieved, increase to high-intensity statin therapy. For high-risk patients, aim for ≥ 50% reduction LDL-C with LDL-C threshold < 70 mg/dL; if not achieved, it may be reasonable to consider ezetimibe. Ongoing management is to monitor adherence to lifestyle, medication if prescribed, and LDL-C response to therapy; for persistent hypertriglyceridemia, refer to the 2021 ACC ECDP on Management of Hypertriglyceridemia, with the footnote defining persistent hypertriglyceridemia as fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL following a minimum of 4–12 weeks of lifestyle intervention and a stable dose of maximally tolerated statin therapy when indicated.

Clinical recommendations for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) state that high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A). In individuals with clinical ASCVD in whom high-intensity statin therapy would otherwise be used, when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A). In individuals with clinical ASCVD > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate ASCVD risk-reduction benefits, adverse effects, drug–drug interactions, and patient preferences when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and it is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it (Class IIa; Level of Evidence: A). Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, a history of myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA, and peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin.

### Effect of individualizing starting doses of a statin according to baseline LDL-cholesterol levels on achieving cholesterol targets: the achieve cholesterol targets fast with atorvastatin stratified titration (ACTFAST) study [^115UtQ6Q]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate whether selecting the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target (< 2.6 mmol/L) LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) values would allow high-risk subjects to achieve target LDL-C concentration within 12 weeks, with the initial dose or a single uptitration.

Methods and Results

Twelve-week, prospective, open-label trial that enrolled 2117 high-risk subjects (statin-free [SF] or statin-treated [ST]). Subjects with LDL-C > 2.6 mmol/L (100mg/dL) but ≤ 5.7 mmol/L (220 mg/dL) were assigned a starting dose of atorvastatin (10, 20, 40 or 80 mg/day) based on LDL-C and status of statin use at baseline, with a single uptitration at 6 weeks, if required. There was no washout for ST subjects. At study end, 80% of SF (82%, 82%, 83% and 72% with 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively) and 59% of ST (60%, 61% and 51% with 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively) subjects reached LDL-C target. In the ST group, an additional 21–41% reduction in LDL-C was observed over the statin used at baseline. Atorvastatin was well tolerated.

Conclusion

This study confirms that individualizing the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target LDL-C values (i.e. the required LDL-C reduction), allows a large majority of high-risk subjects to achieve target safely, within 12 weeks, with the initial dose or with a single titration.

### A comparative analysis of current Lipid Treatment guidelines: nothing stands still [^113p5GKP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Lipid treatment guidelines have continued to evolve as new evidence emerges. We sought to review similarities and differences of 5 lipid treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, European Society for Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and U.S. Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense. All guidelines utilize rigorous evidentiary review, highlight statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emphasize a clinician-patient risk discussion. However, there are differences in statin intensities, use of risk estimators, treatment of specific patient subgroups, and consideration of safety concerns. Clinicians should understand these similarities and differences in current and future guideline recommendations when considering if and how to treat their patients with statin therapy.

### Drug insight: statin use in the elderly [^113hGSUw]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

The elderly represent a notable proportion of patients who present with myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes. This subgroup of patients also experiences a higher incidence of adverse outcomes than younger age-groups, and, therefore, has more to gain from effective, evidence-based therapies. The efficacy of statins in secondary cardiovascular disease prevention is firmly established. The starting of therapy soon after an acute coronary event has been shown to provide added benefit. Uncertainties about the effectiveness of statins in the elderly, however, have resulted in their underuse in this population. In this review we evaluate the evidence for statin use in this important and increasingly large group of patients.

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / multisociety cholesterol guideline [^1138QxsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management. It was accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Methods

A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts was chosen to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

Recommendation

The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is still strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into 4 risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before initiation of statin therapy. Among intermediate-risk patients, identification of risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium testing can assist in the decision to use a statin. Compared with the 2013 guideline, the new guideline gives more attention to percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a treatment goal and to long-term monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. To simplify monitoring, nonfasting lipid measurements are allowed.

Statin initiation — pediatric dyslipidemia: Counsel about side effects, potential medication interactions, contraindications, and adherence; obtain baseline alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatine kinase (CK). Recheck fasting lipids in 4 weeks and assess whether low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is at goal. If there are signs of toxicity — defined as AST, ALT > 3x ULN, or CK > 10x ULN — stop statin and recheck labs in 2 weeks; if labs and symptoms normalize consider restarting lower dose or with different statin, and if the patient continues to not tolerate statins, see "Beyond Statin" algorithm. If LDL-C is not at goal, assess/ensure compliance, titrate statin, and recheck every 4 weeks until at goal LDL-C level; if the patient continues to not be at goal and is on maximal dosing, consider adding or switching to another agent per the "Beyond Statin" algorithm. Continue current therapy, and monitor per page 1, "Diabetes and lipids" algorithm. Additional notes state contraindicated in pregnancy with advice to consider contraception or gynecology referral, also contraindicated in nursing mothers, acute liver disease, and hypersensitivity to statin; and a dose–response note of 2x dose = ↓ 6% LDL-C.

### Association of primary care providers' beliefs of statins for primary prevention and statin prescription [^111CHprD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Cholesterol Management Guideline included major shifts in recommended approaches to primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 The ACC/AHA guideline significantly expanded the population eligible for statin lipid‐lowering therapy for primary prevention, mainly by emphasizing recommendations based on estimated cardiovascular risk and abandoning low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. One study estimated that 12.8 million additional adults would be eligible for statin therapy compared with prior guidelines. 2 However, before initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention, the ACC/AHA guideline emphasized a clinician‐patient risk discussion. Although guidance has been published 3 detailing elements of discussions, little is known about how such discussions are currently being implemented in clinical practice or whether specific practices are associated with statin prescription.

Although the ACC/AHA guideline expanded the population eligible for statin therapy and recommended potentially higher doses of statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention, evidence to date indicates modest adoption in clinical practice. 4, 5, 6, 7 One study evaluated statin use in 161 cardiology practices before and after the ACC/AHA guideline, finding no significant difference in trends of use of moderate‐ to high‐intensity statins for eligible subgroups, with postguideline primary prevention use of 55.2% for diabetic patients and 46.9% for patients with no clinical ASCVD but elevated ASCVD risk. 8 A study using a national database of pharmacy and medical claims found that the ACC/AHA guideline publication was associated with a decrease in statin initiation. 9

Given that the current ACC/AHA guideline represented a substantial change in the approach to cholesterol management while also promoting individualized decision making, it is likely that clinician and patient beliefs impact decision making. The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the implementation of the ACC/AHA guideline from the perspective of primary care providers (PCPs), potentially helping to explain patterns of uptake as well as to identify potential barriers and solutions. We hypothesized that community PCPs hold varying beliefs of the risks and benefits of statin therapy and report varying approaches to statin risk discussions with patients. We further hypothesized that the following PCP survey responses, pertaining to recommended elements of informed discussions, would be associated with increased statin prescription for primary prevention: (1) greater reported statin efficacy; (2) fewer number of adverse effects believed to be caused by statins; (3) lower reported deviation from the guidelines because of other cardiovascular risk factors; and (4) lower reported discordance between PCP recommendations and patient preferences.

### Trends in prevalence of guideline-based use of lipid-lowering therapy in a large health system [^1153sE21]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2013 ACC/AHA (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association) cholesterol guidelines provided an evidence-based rationale for the allocation of lipid-lowering therapy based on risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Adoption of these guidelines was initially suboptimal but whether this has improved over time remains unclear.

Hypothesis

Prevalence of guideline-based statin therapy will increase over time.

Methods

Electronic health record data were used to create two cross-sectional data sets of patients (age 40–75) served in 2013 and 2017 by a large health system. Data sets included demographics, clinical risk factors, lipid values, diagnostic codes, and active medication orders during each period. Prevalence of indications for statin therapy according to the ACC/AHA guidelines and statin prescriptions were compared between each time period.

Results

In 2013, of the 219376 adults, 57.7% of patients met statin eligibility criteria, of which 61.3% were prescribed any statin and 19.0% a high intensity statin. Among those eligible, statin use was highest in those with established ASCVD (83.9%) and lowest in those with elevated ASCVD risk > 7.5% (39.3%). In 2017, of the 256074 adults, 62.3% were statin eligible, of which 62.3% were prescribed a statin and 24.3% a high intensity statin. In 2017, 66.4% of statin eligible men were prescribed a statin compared to 57.4% of statin eligible women (P < 0.001). The use of ezetimibe (3.6% in 2013, 2.4% in 2017) and protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (< 0.1% and 0.1%) was infrequent.

Conclusion

In a large health system, guideline-based statin use has remained suboptimal. Improved strategies are needed to increase statin utilization in appropriate patients.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^116uqt2p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

High levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) are associated with greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 Approximately 85.6 million people in the United States have at least 1 type of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 2 An additional 45 million people in the United States have either a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (33 million) or a > 5% to 7.4% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (12.8 million). 2 For patients at high risk for cardiovascular events or with ASCVD, statins are considered standard first‐line therapy to lower LDL‐C. The appropriate statin dose is important to effectively lower LDL‐C and therefore reduce the risk of ASCVD and cardiovascular events; however, not all patients are able to sufficiently lower their LDL‐C levels, even at the maximally tolerated statin dose. 1 Approximately 40% of patients are unable to adequately lower their LDL‐C levels despite high‐intensity statin therapy. 3 For these patients, treatment regimens may be modified to include a higher statin dose, a switch to a different statin, or combination therapy with other lipid‐lowering agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, or, when appropriate, an inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^115qCCmS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Because statins markedly reduce cardiovascular risk, poor persistence with them is an important clinical problem. If statins were stopped for valid reasons, there may be no opportunity for improvement. However, there are many invalid reasons why patients stop medication, often for symptoms that, although not causally related, are listed in package inserts. Physicians also stop statin therapy for invalid reasons. Several consensus statements, from the Canadian Cardiology Society, 1 the European Atherosclerosis Society, 2 and the National Lipid Association, 3 have reviewed aspects of the adverse effects of statins from various perspectives. In this narrative review, we discuss approaches to helping patients continue needed therapy with statins, based on experience with > 50 000 patients attending our vascular prevention clinics over many years and from the perspective of clinical pharmacology, including pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic factors that impair persistence by worsening causally related effects of statins.

### Achieving and maintaining national cholesterol education program low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals with five statins [^114XRce4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Most patients fail to achieve and maintain low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals established by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). The Atorvastatin Comparative Cholesterol Efficacy and Safety Study (ACCESS) was a randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of five statins and their ability reduce LDL cholesterol to the NCEP target level.

Subjects and Methods

Of 7542 patients screened, 3916 hypercholesterolemic patients were randomly assigned to treatment with a statin, beginning with the lowest recommended dose (atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin, 10 mg; fluvastatin and lovastatin, 20 mg). If the NCEP target was not achieved, the dose was titrated up to the recommended maximum (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and lovastatin, 80 mg; pravastatin and simvastatin, 40 mg). The total duration of treatment was 54 weeks.

Results

Atorvastatin achieved the greatest mean reduction in LDL cholesterol: 36% ± 11% at 6 weeks (initial dose) and 42% ± 13% at 54 weeks. More patients receiving atorvastatin at its initial dose (53%, 997 of 1888) achieved their NCEP target levels than patients receiving simvastatin (38%, 174 of 462), lovastatin (28%, 134 of 472), pravastatin (15%, 71 of 461), or fluvastatin (15%, 69 of 474) at the initial dose. Atorvastatin-treated patients were more likely to maintain their target levels from week 6 to week 54. The percent reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved at the initial dose correlated strongly with the proportion of patients who maintained their goals at 54 weeks (r = -0.84).

Conclusion

For patients treated with statins, providing a greater margin between the NCEP target level and the achieved LDL cholesterol level enhances the likelihood of maintaining NCEP goal levels.

### Statins as the cornerstone of drug therapy for dyslipidemia: monotherapy and combination therapy options [^111G8mpH]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction with statin treatment remains the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy to reduce risk of coronary heart disease. Combination therapy with a statin poses advantages in certain settings and may allow use of lower doses of multiple drugs rather than maximum doses of a single drug. Bile-acid sequestrants or the cholesterol-absorption inhibitor ezetimibe can be added to a statin to achieve greater LDL cholesterol reductions. Niacin or fenofibrate can be added to a statin for treatment of mixed dyslipidemia. Differences in statin efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol and meeting recommended LDL cholesterol targets as well as differences among these agents in beneficial effects on other lipid parameters can affect whether and how these agents are prescribed in monotherapy and combination therapy.

METHODS

Search Strategy

Identification and Screening of the Records

Following consultation with an experienced health research librarian, we conducted systematic electronic searches in PubMed, Emcare, and Embase for references published from January 1, 2009 (search date April 23, 2019). We combined thesaurus terms and free text to define "statins", "cardiovascular diseases", "cholesterol", and "lipids" and terms for the concept "guideline" (Supplementary Text S1 provides the complete strategies). We additionally searched the following websites of guideline development organizations and guideline repositories: Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN); Guidelines International Network (G‐I‐N); National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC); Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines Infobase; and UpToDate. For the search, we used the same terminology on April 24, 2019, with the exception of the G‐I‐N database (access date April 12, 2018) due to inaccessibility of the G‐I‐N database from July 2018.

Study Selection

After removal of duplicate records, one reviewer (M.P.) assessed the initial eligibility of the retrieved studies based on the title and abstract by checking the following exclusion criteria: (a) publication is not a guideline; (b) publication is not about statin treatment; (c) publication does not regard a general adult population (eg, disease‐ or population‐specific guidelines, such as "patients with diabetes" or "patients with stroke"); guidelines for the general adult population that also include recommendations for secondary prevention were not excluded; (d) publication is an old version of a more recently published guideline; and (e) full text is not available in English. When there was any doubt based on the title, abstract, or publication information to determine the relevance, the publication was included for further assessment. Subsequently, two investigators (M.P. and Y.D.) assessed the full‐text publications regarding inclusion and the already above mentioned exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were: (a) cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines concerning the general population and (b) published in the last 10 years. Additionally, the two investigators (M.P. and Y.D.) assessed the availability of recommendations for statin treatment discontinuation for older adults (third inclusion criterion). Guidelines without recommendations for statin discontinuation recommendations or with only recommendations not applicable to older adults (eg, pregnancy and lactation related) were excluded. During consensus meetings, the investigators compared their assessments and discussed differences until consensus was reached.

News Staff — People ages 40 to 75 at high risk for cardiovascular disease should initiate statin use to prevent a heart attack or stroke, while those in the same age range at increased risk for CVD should consult a family physician or other primary care clinician to determine whether taking a statin is appropriate, according to an updated recommendation from the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. The update, which contains three recommendations overall, also says more research is needed to determine whether people 76 or older should start taking a statin for CVD prevention. The AAFP is reviewing the final recommendation statement, final evidence review and evidence summary, which were released Aug. 23, to determine the Academy's stance. The recommendation statement is generally consistent with the task force's 2016 recommendation on the topic.

"Statins effectively and safely prevent first heart attacks and strokes for some people, " task force member John Wong, M. D., said in a USPSTF bulletin. "Whether someone should start taking a statin depends on their age and their risk for having a first heart attack or stroke. " The recommendations apply to adults 40 or older with no history, sign or symptom of CVD who are not already taking statins. They do. Adults ages 40 to 75 were considered at high risk if they had any CVD risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater, and at increased risk if they had any CVD risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7. 5% to less than 10%. The task force found that in adults at increased risk but with no history of CVD events, statin therapy significantly reduced the risk of clinical outcomes such as stroke or heart attack by 22% to 33%, while also significantly reducing the risks of all-cause mortality and composite cardiovascular outcomes.

Statin use also was found to reduce the risk for cardiovascular mortality, although this association was not statistically significant. Overall, statin therapy appeared to benefit a wide range of demographic and clinical populations, and was not significantly associated with increased risk of serious adverse events or diabetes. The task force responded to comments on drafts by clarifying language on the use of coronary artery calcium scores to determine statin use and emphasizing the need for more research to improve CVD risk prediction in all racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups.
