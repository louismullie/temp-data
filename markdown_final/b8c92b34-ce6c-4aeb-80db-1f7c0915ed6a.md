## Question

Pioglitazone for acute hepatitis B

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pioglitazone is appropriate for acute hepatitis B. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what pioglitazone is indicated for and whether any labeling or guideline supports its use in hepatitis B. Then, I should verify its hepatic safety profile, including contraindications or cautions in active liver disease. Next, I will consider the pathophysiology and standard management of acute hepatitis B to see if there is any plausible role for pioglitazone. After that, I should review where confusion might arise from NASH or HCV data. Finally, I will synthesize a risk-benefit conclusion and offer a clear clinical recommendation with any safer alternatives if glycemic control is needed during acute hepatitis B [^112kBuJE] [^116M7dME].

> Let me first confirm the drug's therapeutic class and labeled indication. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione and PPAR-γ agonist indicated for type 2 diabetes mellitus; there is no labeled or guideline-based indication for any form of hepatitis, including acute hepatitis B, and product information emphasizes its use as an antihyperglycemic agent only [^112kBuJE] [^115MLYCS] [^116sgA26].

> I need to check the hepatic safety language carefully. Hold on, I should verify whether active liver disease or abnormal LFTs are a formal contraindication. U.S. labeling repeatedly advises baseline liver tests prior to initiation, use with caution in patients with liver disease, and prompt measurement of LFTs if hepatic injury symptoms occur; importantly, treatment should be interrupted if ALT rises to more than three times the upper limit of normal with symptoms, and there are postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure with pioglitazone-containing products [^113yDCEw] [^1133AYDn] [^1143HuVF].

> Next, I should review what "acute hepatitis B" entails and how it is managed. Acute HBV is an acute viral hepatitic process with marked transaminase elevations and potential jaundice; antiviral therapy has been studied more robustly in severe flares of chronic HBV where lamivudine did not clearly reduce mortality, and routine use in acute HBV is generally selective rather than universal, with supportive care remaining foundational; critically, none of this suggests a role for an insulin-sensitizer like pioglitazone in the acute viral setting [^116M7dME].

> Wait, let me verify potential sources of confusion. Pioglitazone shows histologic and biochemical improvement in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a metabolic rather than viral liver disease, and has improved insulin resistance without virologic benefit in hepatitis C trials; these mechanistically and clinically differ from acute hepatitis B and do not justify its use in acute HBV [^111P6a58] [^114FDU6C] [^1137QHyd].

> I will now examine the risk posture in acute hepatitis B specifically. In an acutely inflamed and injured liver, adding a hepatically metabolized agent with documented postmarketing hepatic failure reports adds unnecessary DILI risk; labels also advise interrupting therapy for significant ALT elevations with symptoms, a scenario commonly encountered in acute hepatitis, and there are case reports of pioglitazone-associated hepatitis, even if rare; moreover, the historical withdrawal of troglitazone for hepatotoxicity underscores class vigilance despite pioglitazone's more favorable trial signal [^113yDCEw] [^117P7FU3] [^111xCezb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — am I overstating this as an absolute labeled contraindication. Strictly speaking, the labels emphasize caution and LFT-based interruption rather than an absolute contraindication in all liver disease; however, in the context of acute hepatitis B with markedly elevated enzymes and systemic symptoms, the practical, evidence-based approach is to avoid initiating pioglitazone because there is no efficacy for HBV and a nonzero hepatic risk signal, with trials having excluded patients with ALT > 2.5× ULN, limiting safety generalizability in this setting [^1133AYDn] [^111EGnjM] [^113yDCEw].

> But wait, what about boxed warnings — I should double-check that I am not mischaracterizing them. Hmm, wait a minute, troglitazone's experience informs class caution but pioglitazone's boxed warning pertains to heart failure risk from fluid retention, not hepatic failure; still, postmarketing hepatic failure has been reported, and the absence of a trial hepatotoxicity signal does not equate to safety in acute hepatitis B, where baseline injury is already present and most trials excluded such patients [^115hSXGq] [^111EGnjM] [^1133AYDn].

> Synthesis and direct answer: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Pioglitazone is not appropriate for acute hepatitis B because it lacks any therapeutic indication or virologic benefit, introduces avoidable hepatic risk in an acutely injured liver, and labeling advises baseline LFTs, caution or interruption with abnormal tests, and vigilance for hepatic symptoms; standard care for acute HBV prioritizes supportive measures and selective antivirals in defined severe scenarios, none of which include a role for pioglitazone [^112kBuJE] [^113yDCEw] [^116M7dME].

> Practical recommendation and glycemic management note: If the patient with acute hepatitis B also has type 2 diabetes and needs glycemic control, I need to ensure we avoid hepatically risky agents and favor options with minimal hepatic metabolism while the acute process resolves; pioglitazone should not be initiated here, and any antihyperglycemic plan should proceed with liver-aware caution per product labeling principles that advise caution or interruption in liver dysfunction [^1133AYDn] [^1143HuVF].

Pioglitazone should not be used for acute hepatitis B because there is no evidence of benefit and a risk of hepatotoxicity [^113yDCEw] [^116hxVVH]. Pioglitazone is not indicated for acute hepatitis B [^112TJ3Xt] and should be avoided in patients with active liver disease or unexplained liver enzyme abnormalities [^115S9Hhb]. Management of acute hepatitis B should follow established antiviral and supportive care guidelines.

---

## Mechanism of action and pharmacological profile

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione (TZD) that **activates PPAR-γ** [^112kBuJE], improving insulin sensitivity and modulating glucose and lipid metabolism [^111yYTdC]. It is approved for type 2 diabetes and has been studied in NASH [^111P6a58], but not for acute hepatitis B.

---

## Evidence regarding pioglitazone in acute hepatitis B

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting pioglitazone in acute hepatitis B; no trials or studies have evaluated its efficacy or safety in this setting.

---

## Hepatotoxicity and safety concerns

Pioglitazone has been associated with **hepatotoxicity**, including rare cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [^113yDCEw]. Postmarketing reports and case series describe serious liver injury, including mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury [^117P7FU3]. Given the active hepatic inflammation in acute hepatitis B, adding a potentially hepatotoxic drug is risky [^1143HuVF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend pioglitazone** for acute hepatitis B; it is not indicated [^115MLYCS] and should be avoided in patients with active liver disease or unexplained liver enzyme abnormalities [^112TJ3Xt].

---

## Alternative therapeutic options

Management of acute hepatitis B focuses on **supportive care and antiviral therapy** when indicated. For severe acute or fulminant hepatitis, recommended agents include entecavir or tenofovir. Pioglitazone is not part of standard care [^112TJ3Xt].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Pioglitazone should not be used for acute hepatitis B due to a **lack of evidence** and **potential hepatotoxicity** [^113yDCEw]. Management should follow **established antiviral and supportive care guidelines**.

### Duetact [^113yDCEw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatic effects**: There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database at the time of writing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities. They may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel — serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin — and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating Duetact therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, Duetact should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), Duetact treatment should be interrupted and an investigation done to establish the probable cause. Duetact should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

### Duetact [^116hxVVH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of pioglitazone and glimepiride. These reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, making it generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Pioglitazone**: New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events, such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Glimepiride**: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]; hemolytic anemia in patients with and without G6PD deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]; impairment of liver function (e.g. with cholestasis and jaundice), as well as hepatitis, which may progress to liver failure. Porphyria cutanea tarda, photosensitivity reactions, and allergic vascular reactions have also been observed.

### Actos [^112kBuJE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

ACTOS is a thiazolidinedione that relies on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. It decreases insulin resistance in both peripheral tissues and the liver, leading to increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Importantly, pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue; rather, it functions as an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). These PPAR receptors are present in key tissues involved in insulin action, such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver. The activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of several insulin-responsive genes associated with the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone effectively reduces hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, which are characteristic of insulin-resistant states like type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes induced by pioglitazone enhance the responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are documented across various animal models of insulin resistance.

Because pioglitazone improves the effects of circulating insulin by reducing insulin resistance, it does not lower blood glucose levels in animal models that entirely lack endogenous insulin.

### Oseni [^111EGnjM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database at the time of writing. One randomized, double-blind, three-year trial compared pioglitazone to glyburide as an add-on to metformin and insulin therapy. It was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial, then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3 out of 1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9 out of 1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database at the time of writing have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury.

- **Hypoglycemia**: In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were reported based on the clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with finger stick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo.

### Long-term pioglitazone treatment for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized trial [^111P6a58]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The metabolic defects of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) seem to be specifically targeted by pioglitazone. However, information about its long-term use in this population is limited.

- **Objective**: To determine the efficacy and safety of long-term pioglitazone treatment in patients with NASH and prediabetes or T2DM.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00994682).

- **Setting**: University hospital.

- **Participants**: Patients (n = 101) with prediabetes or T2DM and biopsy-proven NASH were recruited from the general population and outpatient clinics.

- **Intervention**: All patients were prescribed a hypocaloric diet (500-kcal/d deficit from weight-maintaining caloric intake) and then randomly assigned to pioglitazone, 45 mg/d, or placebo for 18 months, followed by an 18-month open-label phase with pioglitazone treatment.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome was a reduction of at least 2 points in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score in 2 histologic categories without worsening of fibrosis. Secondary outcomes included other histologic outcomes, hepatic triglyceride content measured by magnetic resonance and proton spectroscopy, and metabolic parameters.

- **Results**: Among patients randomly assigned to pioglitazone, 58% achieved the primary outcome (treatment difference, 41 percentage points [95% CI, 23 to 59 percentage points]) and 51% had resolution of NASH (treatment difference, 32 percentage points [CI, 13 to 51 percentage points]) (P < 0.001 for each).

### Duetact [^111yYTdC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Duetact combines two antihyperglycemic agents with different mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: pioglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione class, and glimepiride, a member of the sulfonylurea class. Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas sulfonylureas are insulin secretagogues that act primarily by stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells.

- **Pioglitazone**: Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. It decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver, resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. It is not an insulin secretagogue but an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action, such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of several insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

### Mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic liver injury after pioglitazone therapy [^117P7FU3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Pioglitazone is an oral hypoglycemic agent in the thiazolidinedione class. Only one case of hepatotoxicity related to this agent has previously been reported.

- **Objective**: To report the clinical course of a patient with hepatitis after therapy with pioglitazone.

- **Design**: Case report.

- **Setting**: A community hospital.

- **Patient**: A 49-year-old diabetic man taking pioglitazone, 30 mg/d.

- **Intervention**: Discontinuation of pioglitazone therapy.

- **Measurements**: Serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels, standard blood tests for causes of hepatitis and cirrhosis other than drug toxicity, and liver biopsy.

- **Results**: After 6 months of pioglitazone therapy, significant hepatic dysfunction developed. Blood tests excluded viral, metabolic, and autoimmune disorders. Liver biopsy showed mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury compatible with drug toxicity. After treatment with pioglitazone was discontinued, liver enzyme values returned to normal.

- **Conclusion**: Patients receiving pioglitazone may develop serious liver injury and should be observed for evidence of hepatitis.

### Evaluation of liver function in type 2 diabetic patients during clinical trials: Evidence that rosiglitazone does not cause hepatic dysfunction [^114rvP12]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the idiosyncratic liver toxicity reported with troglitazone is molecule-specific or a class effect of thiazolidinediones. This inquiry was based on liver enzyme data collected prospectively during phase 2/3 clinical trials with rosiglitazone, a new, potent, and specific member of the thiazolidinedione class. Troglitazone treatment has been associated with idiosyncratic hepatic reactions, leading to hepatic failure and death in some patients. This raises questions regarding whether all thiazolidinediones or peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists are hepatotoxic and whether data from clinical trials are adequate to detect signals of potentially serious drug-related hepatotoxicity.

The research design and methods involved an analysis of liver function in type 2 diabetic patients. These patients were evaluated at baseline and serially in 13 double-blind, 2 open-label active-controlled, and 7 open-label extension studies of rosiglitazone treatment conducted in outpatient centers throughout North America and Europe. The study included over 6,000 patients aged 30–80 years with type 2 diabetes. Patients underwent baseline liver function studies and were excluded from clinical trials if they had alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase values 2.5 times greater than the upper limit of the reference range. The main outcome measures were liver enzyme levels, assessed at screening, at baseline, every 4 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, and at 6- to 12-week intervals thereafter.

### Pioglitazone decreases fasting and postprandial endogenous glucose production in proportion to decrease in hepatic triglyceride content [^114J2EAv]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

In keeping with our hypothesis, pioglitazone treatment in type 2 diabetes resulted in an approximately 50% decrease in hepatic triglyceride and a 55% reduction in muscle triglyceride, despite significant weight gain (approximately 6 kg). This was associated with a 26% decrease in fasting endogenous glucose production (EGP) and a twofold decrease in postprandial EGP. Hepatic triglyceride content was directly correlated with fasting EGP (r = 0.64, P = 0.01) and inversely correlated with the percentage suppression of EGP (time 150 min, r = −0.63, P = 0.02) before and after pioglitazone treatment. By stepwise regression, hepatic triglyceride was found to be a significant independent predictor of fasting EGP, accounting for 53% of its variation (P < 0.001). Similarly, hepatic triglyceride content accounted for 36% of the variation seen in the percentage suppression of postprandial EGP observed at 150 min (P = 0.03). In contrast, although muscle triglyceride content decreased with pioglitazone treatment, it did not correlate with EGP. There was no relationship between visceral fat content and EGP.

In type 2 diabetes, hepatic insulin resistance is believed to underlie the elevated basal rates of EGP and subnormal postprandial suppression of EGP. In a recent study, elevated EGP was found to be a primary mechanism for postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Hepatic triglyceride content is characteristically increased in type 2 diabetes and is an important predictor of hepatic insulin resistance, even independent of obesity. In addition, hepatic triglyceride content correlated negatively with postprandial net glucose uptake, supporting its role in metabolic regulation.

### Pioglitazone decreases plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein mass, associated with a decrease in hepatic triglyceride content, in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112X64JZ]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

At baseline, patients in both treatment groups were well-matched for age (pioglitazone 56.8 ± 1.0 years and metformin 56.4 ± 0.9 years, between-group P > 0.05), duration of diabetes (pioglitazone 4 [3–6] years and metformin 3 [1–5] years, P > 0.05), and BMI (pioglitazone 28.2 ± 0.5 kg/m² and metformin 29.3 ± 0.6 kg/m², between-group P > 0.05).

- **Treatment effect**: The effects of treatment on hepatic triglyceride content and plasma lipid profiles are presented in Table 1. As shown, treatment with pioglitazone for 24 weeks decreased hepatic triglyceride content (5.9 [2.6–17.4]% vs. 4.1 [1.9–12.3]%, P < 0.05). This was accompanied by a decrease in plasma CETP mass (2.33 ± 0.10 vs. 2.06 ± 0.10 μg/ml, P < 0.05) and an increase in plasma total cholesterol (4.90 ± 0.16 vs. 5.19 ± 0.22 mmol/l, P < 0.05), partially due to an increase in HDL cholesterol levels (1.22 ± 0.05 vs. 1.34 ± 0.05 mmol/l, P < 0.05). Treatment with metformin did not significantly affect these parameters. Both pioglitazone and metformin treatments decreased plasma triglycerides and apoB100 significantly; however, no difference was observed in the reduction between the groups.

- **Correlations**: Changes in plasma CETP mass after 24 weeks in pioglitazone-treated patients correlated with changes in hepatic triglyceride content (r = 0.34, P < 0.05), although this association was not observed in the metformin group.

### Oseni [^1114ww2m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Oseni combines two antihyperglycemic agents: alogliptin and pioglitazone.

- **Mechanism of action**: Alogliptin increases concentrations of the incretin hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced, but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Alogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin selectively binds to and inhibits DPP-4 but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures.

- **Pioglitazone**: Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. It decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver, resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. It acts as an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ).

### Pharmacogenomic studies of current antidiabetic agents and potential new drug targets for precision medicine of diabetes [^112cdPk5]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

- **Thiazolidinediones**: Thiazolidinediones, a class of peripheral insulin sensitizers that consist of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, cooperate with nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in peripheral tissue. They mediate the transcription of genes related to glucose metabolism, thereby enhancing peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin and lowering blood glucose. Thiazolidinediones modulate glucose but do not target pancreatic islet β-cells.

- **Thiazolidinediones and transporter gene**: SLCO1B1 encodes the hepatic drug transporter OATP1B1, which may participate in transporting thiazolidinediones from the blood into the liver and plays a role in thiazolidinedione metabolism. The SLCO1B1 521T > C variant shows a substantial association with an enhanced glycemic response in rosiglitazone-treated patients with T2D, but no statistically significant difference has been found in the pharmacokinetics of thiazolidinediones in healthy volunteers.

- **Thiazolidinediones and target gene**: PPARγ is a nuclear hormone receptor encoded by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ gene (PPARG). The Pro12Ala (rs1801282) polymorphism is the most common variation in the PPARG and an associated risk factor for T2D. A potential association between the Pro12Ala polymorphism and better therapeutic response to pioglitazone has been consistently reported in different populations, including those from South India, China, Iran, and menopausal women in Mexico. However, some studies demonstrate statistically non-significant differences between the response to thiazolidinediones.

### Duetact [^1146u3aw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Duetact should be taken once daily with the first main meal.

- **Tablet options**: Duetact tablets are available in two combinations: 30 mg pioglitazone plus 2 mg glimepiride or 30 mg pioglitazone plus 4 mg glimepiride.

- **For patients inadequately controlled on monotherapy**:
	- **Glimepiride monotherapy**: The recommended starting dose is 30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily. Gradually titrate the dose as needed after assessing therapeutic response and tolerability.
	- **Pioglitazone monotherapy**: Initiate treatment with 30 mg/2 mg once daily, gradually titrating as needed based on therapeutic response and tolerability.

- **For patients transitioning from combination therapy**:
	- **Pioglitazone plus glimepiride as separate tablets**: Duetact should be taken at doses closely matching the current regimen of pioglitazone and glimepiride.
	- **Different sulfonylurea monotherapy or combination therapy**: For patients previously on monotherapy with a different sulfonylurea or combination therapy with pioglitazone and another sulfonylurea (e.g. glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, acetohexamide), start with 30 mg/2 mg once daily. Adjust as needed after assessing therapeutic response and observe for hypoglycemia for one to two weeks due to potential overlapping drug effects.

For patients with systolic dysfunction, it is recommended to use the lowest approved dose.

### Pioglitazone decreases plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein mass, associated with a decrease in hepatic triglyceride content, in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114BgX5b]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In the pioglitazone group, 19 of the 39 patients used a statin at the start of the study. Table 2 compares the changes in lipid levels and hepatic triglyceride content between statin users and nonstatin users in the patients treated with pioglitazone. In nonstatin users, pioglitazone decreased liver triglyceride content (6.4 [2.5–18.9] vs. 4.9 [1.9–14.7]%, P < 0.05), increased HDL cholesterol levels (1.14 ± 0.06 vs. 1.32 ± 0.06 mmol/l, P < 0.05), and decreased CETP mass (2.64 ± 0.14 vs. 2.16 ± 0.12 μg/ml, P < 0.05).

Remarkably, in statin users, pioglitazone also reduced liver triglyceride content (8.0 [2.8–16.5] vs. 3.7 [1.9–10.9]%, P < 0.05), but did not affect either HDL cholesterol or CETP mass. ApoB100 decreased significantly only in the statin users (83.07 ± 8.29 vs. 68.77 ± 5.34 mg/dl, P < 0.05).

Table 2 provides data on hepatic triglyceride content, plasma CETP mass, cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoB100 levels in patients treated with pioglitazone, selected based on the use of statins at baseline.

### Pioglitazone, vitamin E, or placebo for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^114FDU6C]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a common liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis. Currently, there is no established treatment for this disease.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 247 adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and without diabetes to receive pioglitazone at a dose of 30 mg daily (80 subjects), vitamin E at a dose of 800 IU daily (84 subjects), or placebo (83 subjects) for 96 weeks. The primary outcome was an improvement in histologic features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, assessed using a composite of standardized scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis. Given the two planned primary comparisons, P values of less than 0.025 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

- **Results**: Vitamin E therapy, as compared with placebo, was associated with a significantly higher rate of improvement in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (43% vs. 19%, P = 0.001), but the difference in the rate of improvement with pioglitazone as compared with placebo was not significant (34% and 19%, respectively; P = 0.04). Serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels were reduced with vitamin E and with pioglitazone, as compared with placebo (P < 0.001 for both comparisons), and both agents were associated with reductions in hepatic steatosis (P = 0.005 for vitamin E and P < 0.001 for pioglitazone) and lobular inflammation (P = 0.02 for vitamin E and P = 0.004 for pioglitazone) but not with improvement in fibrosis scores (P = 0.24 for vitamin E and P = 0.12 for pioglitazone). Subjects who received pioglitazone gained more wei.

### Pioglitazone decreases plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein mass, associated with a decrease in hepatic triglyceride content, in patients with type 2 diabetes [^11569BLF]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatic steatosis is a prevalent condition in patients with type 2 diabetes and is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, many patients with type 2 diabetes display dyslipidemia characterized by high plasma levels of apolipoprotein (apo) B-lipoproteins and triglycerides and low plasma levels of HDL cholesterol. Recently, Toledo et al. showed that hepatic steatosis is associated with more severe hyperlipidemia in type 2 diabetes, which might contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

To reduce this increased cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes, regular treatment algorithms include lipid-lowering drugs. Our previous studies in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP transgenic mice, a well-established model for human-like lipoprotein metabolism, showed that treatment with either statins, fibrates, or niacin resulted in a reduction in plasma apoB-lipoproteins and triglyceride levels and an increase in HDL cholesterol. Moreover, these treatments reduced hepatic lipid content (i.e. both triglycerides and cholesterol) as well as the hepatic expression and plasma levels of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). CETP is a protein that mediates the heteroexchange of cholesteryl esters from HDL to (V)LDL with a simultaneous exchange of triglycerides from (V)LDL to HDL.

These studies thus suggest that lowering of hepatic lipid content in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice increased HDL cholesterol levels by reduction of plasma CETP mass. Because the correlation between hepatic triglyceride content and plasma CETP mass has not been studied in humans, the aim of the research is to explore this relationship further.

### Pioglitazone stimulates apolipoprotein A-I production without affecting HDL removal in HepG2 cells: Involvement of PPAR-alpha [^112nofdB]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2007). Low credibility.

Pioglitazone, an antihyperglycemic drug, increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms through which pioglitazone regulates HDL levels are not clear. This study examined the effect of pioglitazone on hepatocyte apolipoprotein AI (apoA-I) and apoA-II production, as well as HDL-protein and cholesterol ester uptake.

- **Methods and results**: In human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells, pioglitazone, in a dose-dependent manner (0.5 to 10 micromol/L), increased the de novo synthesis (up to 45%), secretion (up to 44%), and mRNA expression (up to 59%) of apoA-I. Additionally, pioglitazone increased apoA-II de novo synthesis (up to 73%) and mRNA expression (up to 129%). It did not affect the uptake of HDL3-protein or HDL3-cholesterol ester in HepG2 cells. The pioglitazone-induced apoA-I lipoprotein particles enhanced cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages. The pioglitazone-induced apoA-I secretion or mRNA expression by HepG2 cells was abrogated with suppression of PPAR-alpha, achieved through small interfering RNA or a specific inhibitor, MK886.

- **Conclusions**: The data indicate that pioglitazone increases HDL by stimulating the de novo hepatic synthesis of apoA-I, without affecting hepatic HDL-protein or HDL-cholesterol removal. We suggest that pioglitazone-mediated hepatic activation of PPAR-alpha may be one of the mechanisms through which pioglitazone raises hepatic apoA-I and HDL.

### Chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 patients with insulin resistance treated with pioglitazone and peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin [^1137QHyd]. Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic hepatitis C and insulin resistance are less likely to respond to anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy and are at risk for more rapid fibrosis progression. Coadministration of pioglitazone with peginterferon/ribavirin improves insulin sensitivity and increases virologic response rates in insulin-resistant HCV genotype 4 patients, but it is unclear whether this finding applies to genotype 1 patients. For this reason, we randomized treatment-naive HCV genotype 1 patients with insulin resistance to receive either standard care (peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin for 48 weeks, n = 73) or pioglitazone 30–45 mg/day plus standard care (n = 77) in an open-label multicenter trial.

Patients randomized to pioglitazone received the drug during a 16-week run-in phase, the 48-week standard-care phase, and the 24-week untreated follow-up phase. Pioglitazone treatment improved hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), plasma glucose, insulin levels, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score, and increased serum adiponectin levels during the 16-week run-in phase, and maintained these improvements during the standard-care phase. However, we observed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the primary efficacy endpoint, the decrease from baseline to Week 12 of peginterferon alpha-2a/ribavirin treatment in mean log(10) HCV RNA titer (-3.5 ± 1.71 and -3.7 ± 1.62 IU/mL in the pioglitazone and standard-care groups, respectively, Δ = 0.21 IU/mL, P = 0.4394).

### Oseni [^1153bMvi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Pioglitazone has been shown in clinical studies to improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. It enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin. For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the decrease in insulin resistance achieved with pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and reduced A1C values. In controlled clinical trials, pioglitazone demonstrated an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Patients with lipid abnormalities were also part of pioglitazone clinical trials. Generally, patients treated with pioglitazone experienced mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol. However, there is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with pioglitazone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In a 26-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging monotherapy study, mean serum triglycerides decreased in the pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg dose groups, compared to a mean increase in the placebo group. Mean HDL cholesterol increased to a greater extent in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients. There were no consistent differences in LDL and total cholesterol between patients treated with pioglitazone and those given placebo.

### Duetact [^114gQwvs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Duetact is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are already treated with a thiazolidinedione and sulfonylurea or who have inadequate glycemic control on a thiazolidinedione alone or a sulfonylurea alone [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Important limitations of use**:
	- Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Duetact should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Duetact is a thiazolidinedione and a sulfonylurea combination product indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and glimepiride is appropriate.

- **Important limitations of use**:
	- Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Do we still need pioglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes? A risk-benefit critique in 2013 [^112gLJ69]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

An updated algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy for the management of hyperglycemia has been published as a position statement of the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes. According to this position statement, "pioglitazone appeared to have a modest benefit on CV events as a secondary outcome in one large trial involving patients with overt macrovascular disease". In the proposed algorithm, pioglitazone monotherapy can be considered an alternative to metformin monotherapy if metformin cannot be used (not tolerated or is contraindicated), as a combination therapy if monotherapy with metformin alone does not achieve/maintain an HbA1c target, or as a triple combination therapy, provided that oral agents with complementary mechanisms of action are used. Thus, pioglitazone remains an effective and useful antidiabetes drug with a unique insulin-sensitizing action. However, the clinical use of pioglitazone is currently under scrutiny because of safety issues and the availability of newer drugs (DPP-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors). None of these newer drug classes target insulin resistance, however.

At the moment, the most insulin-resistant patients — identifiable by an increased waist circumference, low HDL cholesterol level, and fatty liver — may be the best candidates for treatment with pioglitazone. In addition, patients with a high risk or history of CVD are also likely to benefit from pioglitazone.

### Expansion of the homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function and insulin resistance to enable clinical trial outcome modeling through the interactive adjustment of physiology and treatment effects: iHOMA2 [^112a1NR8]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

To model the effects of pioglitazone, we examined the outcome when insulin sensitivity was modeled to be in the liver, in the periphery, or at both sites equally, all with a standardized increase in β-cell function. Three possible sites of action on insulin sensitivity for pioglitazone were modeled:

- **Hypothesis 1**: Insulin sensitivity increases in both the periphery and hepatic sites [variables L 5 and PE 5].
- **Hypothesis 2**: Hepatic insulin sensitivity increases, and peripheral insulin sensitivity remains unchanged [variable L 5].
- **Hypothesis 3**: Hepatic insulin sensitivity remains unchanged, and peripheral insulin sensitivity increases [variable PE 5].

The development dataset comprised insulin and glucose values from a monotherapy study of pioglitazone. The changes to β-cell function and insulin sensitivity observed between the baseline visit and the end of the study (12 months later) in the development group were used as inputs to adjust the variables in the iHOMA2 model for each of the three hypotheses. A separate study of pioglitazone was used for the verification group. The data from the baseline visits of the verification group were submitted to the adjusted iHOMA2, using the model in predictive mode, to determine the effect of pioglitazone for each of the three hypotheses, using as output the expected fasting glucose and insulin after therapy.

We assessed bias and agreement using a Bland-Altman plot and assessed the fit of the model by examining the least squares deviation from the line of unity, where the observed values equal the predicted values.

### Pioglitazone decreases fasting and postprandial endogenous glucose production in proportion to decrease in hepatic triglyceride content [^112W2xkM]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatic triglyceride has been shown to be strongly associated with hepatic insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. The exact mechanism by which hepatic triglyceride induces hepatic insulin resistance is unknown but is thought to relate to the accumulation of intracellular fatty acid metabolites. This leads to the activation of a serine kinase cascade and the induction of cellular insulin resistance. Reduction in hepatic triglyceride content by moderate weight reduction normalizes rates of basal endogenous glucose production (EGP) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Hepatic insulin resistance is also associated with impaired postprandial suppression of EGP in type 2 diabetes, but the effect of a reduction in hepatic triglyceride content on postprandial suppression of EGP in type 2 diabetes is unknown.

Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone, possess insulin-sensitizing properties and have been shown to decrease hepatic triglyceride content in type 2 diabetes. Because thiazolidinediones have been shown to reduce both fasting and postprandial glucose levels, we hypothesized that pioglitazone treatment in type 2 diabetes would reduce hepatic triglyceride content and consequently reduce basal and postprandial EGP. In addition, visceral fat has also been implicated in hepatic insulin resistance, and pioglitazone has been reported to decrease visceral fat content. The effect of this on EGP requires definition.

To test our hypothesis, we used noninvasive 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess hepatic triglyceride and intramyocellular triglyceride content using magnetic resonance imaging.

### Acute hepatitis C: Current status and remaining challenges [^1158mqGp]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

The acute phase of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a key point in the evolution of hepatitis C. In some patients, the infection resolves spontaneously, whereas in others, it develops into chronic disease. However, because acute hepatitis C is often asymptomatic, detection and diagnosis are usually difficult. Furthermore, there are no established treatment guidelines, leaving physicians to make several challenging decisions, such as whether to treat, when to treat, and what treatment regimen to use. Pegylated interferon alfa monotherapy is most commonly used to treat patients with acute hepatitis C; the role of ribavirin has yet to be established.

In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of acute hepatitis C, its risk factors, routes of transmission, and treatment practices. We also examine data from published clinical studies and focus on unresolved issues for which additional studies are needed to establish standardized treatment guidelines for the management of acute hepatitis C.

### Dose-response effect of pioglitazone on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes [^113aETvJ]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

To investigate the dose-response effects of pioglitazone on glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes, 58 diet-treated patients (aged 54 ± 1 years; 34 men and 24 women; BMI 31.5 ± 0.6 kg/m²) were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo (n = 11) or pioglitazone in doses of 7.5 mg (n = 13), 15 mg (n = 12), 30 mg (n = 11), or 45 mg (n = 11) per day for 26 weeks. Prior to and following the 26 weeks, subjects underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

- **Results**: Patients treated with 7.5 or 15 mg/day of pioglitazone showed no change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and fasting plasma insulin (FPI) concentrations or in plasma glucose (PG) and insulin concentrations during the OGTT. However, those treated with 30 and 45 mg/day of pioglitazone experienced significant reductions compared to the placebo group, with decreases in HbA1c (delta = -2.0 and -2.9%), FPG (delta = -66 and -97 mg/dl), and mean PG during OGTT (delta = -84 and -107 mg/dl). While fasting plasma insulin decreased significantly in the 45-mg/day pioglitazone group, the mean plasma insulin during the OGTT did not change. The insulinogenic index (delta area under the curve [AUC] insulin/deltaAUC glucose) during the OGTT increased significantly in the 30- and 45-mg/day pioglitazone groups (from 0.13 ± 0.03 to 0.27 ± 0.05, P < 0.05). From the OGTT, a composite whole-body insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was derived, correlating well with measurements obtained via the insulin clamp technique.

### SPL drug information for glecaprevir / pibrentasvir [^1177BUww]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Labeled indications for Glecaprevir / Pibrentasvir (also known as Mavyret) include the following:

- **Adults**: Treatment of hepatitis C virus infection (acute or chronic, genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. Additionally, treatment of hepatitis C virus infection for genotype 1 without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, specifically for those previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor. Also includes treatment for genotype 3 without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis in cases of prior treatment experience with regimens containing (peg)interferon, ribavirin, and/or sofosbuvir, with no prior treatment using an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor or NS5A inhibitor. Finally, treatment for genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis for individuals with prior treatment using regimens containing (peg)interferon, ribavirin, and/or sofosbuvir, with no prior treatment with an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor or NS5A inhibitor.

### Duetact [^115hSXGq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is presented in Table 7.

- **Weight gain**: Dose-related weight gain occurs when pioglitazone is used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications. The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but likely involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 8 and 9 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone and placebo in the 16- to 26-week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16- to 24-week combination add-on therapy trials and in the PROactive trial.

- **Edema**: Edema induced from taking pioglitazone is reversible when pioglitazone is discontinued. The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. A summary of the frequency and types of edema adverse events occurring in clinical investigations of pioglitazone is provided in Table 10.

- **Hepatic effects**: There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database at the time of writing. One randomized, double-blind, three-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range.

### A pilot study of pioglitazone treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^1156Qv8s]. Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common chronic liver disease for which there is no known effective therapy. A proportion of patients with NASH progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. NASH is considered one of the clinical features of the metabolic syndrome in which insulin resistance plays a central role. This prospective study evaluates the role of an insulin-sensitizing agent in the treatment of NASH. Eighteen nondiabetic patients with biopsy-proven NASH were treated with pioglitazone (30 mg daily) for 48 weeks. Tests of insulin sensitivity and body composition, as well as liver biopsies, were performed before and at the end of treatment.

By 48 weeks, serum alanine aminotransferase values fell to normal in 72% of patients. Hepatic fat content and size, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging, decreased, and glucose and free fatty acid sensitivity to insulin were uniformly improved. Histological features of steatosis, cellular injury, parenchymal inflammation, Mallory bodies, and fibrosis were significantly improved from baseline (all P < 0.05). Using strict criteria, histological improvement occurred in two-thirds of patients.

Pioglitazone was well tolerated; the main side effects were weight gain (averaging 4%) and an increase in total body adiposity. In conclusion, these results indicate that treatment with an insulin-sensitizing agent can lead to improvement in biochemical and histological features of NASH and support the role of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of this disease. The long-term safety and benefits of pioglitazone require further study.

### Oseni [^112EAidb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients with hepatic impairment

- **Alogliptin**: Total exposure to alogliptin was approximately 10% lower and peak exposure was approximately 8% lower in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Grade B) compared to healthy subjects. The magnitude of these reductions is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Grade C) have not been studied. Use caution when administering Oseni to patients with liver disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Pioglitazone**: Compared with healthy controls, subjects with impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Grade B and C) have an approximate 45% reduction in pioglitazone and total pioglitazone (pioglitazone, M-III and M-IV) mean peak concentrations but no change in the mean AUC values. Therefore, no dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment is required. There are postmarketing reports of liver failure with pioglitazone, and clinical trials have generally excluded patients with serum ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Differentiating members of the thiazolidinedione class: a focus on efficacy [^114X8rxK]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

The thiazolidinediones (TZDs), or 'glitazones', are a new class of drugs used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Although their precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, TZDs target insulin resistance directly, thereby addressing an underlying cause of the disease. Two TZDs, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, are indicated for use in type 2 diabetes in the United States. A third, troglitazone, has been associated with significant hepatotoxicity and has been withdrawn from use.

In clinical trials, all three TZDs effectively lower blood glucose levels both as monotherapy and in combination therapy with sulfonylureas, metformin, and insulin. At the time of writing, head-to-head comparative studies among these agents have not been conducted. Therefore, it is challenging to make direct comparisons of their efficacy since variables such as baseline glucose levels and study design can significantly affect treatment outcomes. Despite this, and given the unique safety issues associated with certain TZDs, it is useful to examine closely the efficacy data for these agents. It is insufficient to assume that 'all glitazones are the same' because studies to support this assertion have not yet been completed. This article reviews the current knowledge regarding the relative efficacy of the TZDs.

### Changes in liver tests during 1-year treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with pioglitazone, metformin or gliclazide [^113Nd1Yv]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of liver damage. Therefore, it is of particular importance to investigate the hepatic effects of drugs used to treat such patients.

- **Methods**: Liver testing results performed in four 1-year, randomized, double-blind studies comparing effects of pioglitazone, metformin, or a sulphonylurea, gliclazide, in the treatment of over 3,700 patients with Type 2 diabetes have been analyzed.

- **Results**: Pioglitazone caused reductions in mean levels of hepatic enzymes between 3% and 18%, while gliclazide resulted in small increases between 3% and 13%. Metformin treatment showed either small mean increases or decreases. More patients receiving pioglitazone had liver tests within the normal range at the end of treatment (≥ 87%) compared with patients receiving metformin (≥ 80%) or gliclazide (≥ 75%). Slightly fewer patients on pioglitazone than with comparators showed a large increase (> 3 times the upper limit of normal) in alanine aminotransferase levels at any time during treatment (pioglitazone 0.9%, metformin 1.9%, gliclazide 1.9%).

- **Conclusions**: During pioglitazone treatment, there is a reduction in liver enzyme levels. Although the mechanism of this effect is not clear, the results demonstrate potential beneficial effects on the liver during the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes with pioglitazone.

### Duetact [^116xaYbZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

Pioglitazone

Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. It enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values. In controlled clinical trials, pioglitazone had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with pioglitazone. Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol. There is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with pioglitazone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In a 26-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging monotherapy study, mean serum triglycerides decreased in the 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg pioglitazone dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group. Mean HDL cholesterol increased to a greater extent in patients treated with pioglitazone than in the placebo-treated patients. There were no consistent differences for LDL and total cholesterol in patients treated with pioglitazone compared to placebo.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone in nondiabetic subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^112JiRxk]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease for which there is limited therapy available. The insulin sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties of thiazolidinediones support their use in treating NASH. We have evaluated pioglitazone in the treatment of nondiabetic patients with NASH.

- **Methods**: We randomized 74 nondiabetic patients (45 men; median age, 54 years) with histologically proven NASH to 12 months of standard diet, exercise, and either placebo or pioglitazone (30 mg/day). Sixty-one patients (30 placebo, 31 pioglitazone) had liver biopsies both at the beginning and the end of the study.

- **Results**: Compared with placebo, pioglitazone therapy was associated with an increase in weight (mean change, -0.55 vs. +2.77 kg; p = 0.04) and a reduction in glucose (+0.4 vs. -0.1 mmol/L; p = 0.02), HbA1c (+0.16% vs. -0.18%; p = 0.006), insulin C peptide level (+42 vs. -78 pmol/L; p = 0.02), alanine aminotransferase level (-10.9 vs. -36.2 u/L; p = 0.009), gamma-glutamyltransferase level (-9.4 vs. -41.2 u/L; p = 0.002), and ferritin (-11.3 vs. -90.5 microg/L; p = 0.01). Histologic features including hepatocellular injury (P = 0.005), Mallory-Denk bodies (P = 0.004), and fibrosis (P = 0.05) were reduced in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with those in the placebo group.

- **Conclusions**: Pioglitazone therapy over a 12-month period in nondiabetic subjects with NASH resulted in improvements in metabolic and histologic parameters, most notably liver injury and fibrosis. Larger extended trials are justified to assess the long-term effectiveness of this treatment.

### Thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A cohort study [^115SJUJC]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Exposure to glucose-lowering agents followed a systematic approach. Follow-up time was divided into fixed intervals of 90 days, starting from the index date. Based on the time since the most recent oral glucose-lowering drug prescription, an interval was classified as "use" (≤ 90 days) or "past use" (> 90 days). All patients were users of one of the eligible drugs at the index date, and they could move between past and use during follow-up.

- **Classification of use of glucose-lowering agents**:
	- Use of TZDs, use of SUs, concurrent use of TZDs and SUs, use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and use of other glucose-lowering agents (other than TZDs, SUs, and DPP-4 inhibitors): This classification was applied when comparing the use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) with sulfonylureas (SUs).
	- Use of insulins, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, concurrent use of insulins and GLP-1 receptor agonists, and use of other glucose-lowering agents (other than insulins and GLP-1 receptor agonists): This was the classification when comparing the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists with insulin.

At the start of each TZD interval, the cumulative prescribed TZD dosage, in pioglitazone equivalents, was reviewed. Defined daily doses were used to calculate the pioglitazone dose equivalents. Users of SUs or insulins were chosen as the reference groups in our primary analyses because we anticipated that users of these agents would have the most comparable diabetes profiles.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113hBbq6]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, especially with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, ADA 2025 guidelines suggest offering pioglitazone to lower the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction in patients with a history of stroke and evidence of insulin resistance and prediabetes. This should be balanced with the increased risk of weight gain, edema, and fractures. It is advisable to consider offering lower doses to mitigate the risk of adverse effects.

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride monotherapy improves glycemic control in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes: a 6-month randomized placebo-controlled dose-response study. The Pioglitazone 001 Study Group [^114WrM4s]. Diabetes Care (2000). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of four doses of pioglitazone monotherapy in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted. A total of 408 patients with HbA1c ≥ 7.0%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 140 mg/dl, and C-peptide > 1 ng/ml were randomized to receive either a placebo or 7.5, 15, 30, or 45 mg of pioglitazone once daily for 26 weeks.

Patients treated with 15, 30, or 45 mg of pioglitazone experienced significant mean decreases in HbA1c (ranging from -1.00 to -1.60% compared to placebo) and FPG (-39.1 to -65.3 mg/dl compared to placebo). The decrease in FPG was evident as early as the second week of therapy, with maximal reductions occurring between weeks 10–14 and maintained until study completion (week 26). Patients in the 15-, 30-, or 45-mg pioglitazone groups showed significant mean percent decreases in triglycerides and significant mean percent increases in HDL cholesterol, with only minor changes observed in total cholesterol and LDL levels. Importantly, patients naive to therapy demonstrated greater improvements in HbA1c and FPG (-2.55% and -79.9 mg/dl difference from placebo in the 45-mg group) compared to those with prior treatment.

The adverse event profile for pioglitazone was similar to placebo, with no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity or elevations in alanine aminotransferase levels observed in this study.

In conclusion, pioglitazone monotherapy significantly improves HbA1c and FPG while maintaining a favorable safety profile.

### Duetact [^116kW5X6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Hepatic impairment:

- **Pioglitazone**: Compared with healthy controls, subjects with impaired hepatic function (Child-Turcotte-Pugh Grade B/C) experience an approximate 45% reduction in pioglitazone and total pioglitazone (pioglitazone, M-III, and M-IV) mean Cmax, but no change in the mean AUC values. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment. There are postmarketing reports of liver failure with pioglitazone, and clinical trials have generally excluded patients with serum ALT levels more than 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range. Use Duetact with caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Glimepiride**: It is unknown whether there is an effect of hepatic impairment on glimepiride pharmacokinetics because the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride have not been adequately evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment.

Geriatric patients:

- **Pioglitazone**: In healthy elderly subjects, the Cmax of pioglitazone was not significantly different, but AUC values were approximately 21% higher than those achieved in younger subjects. The mean t½ of pioglitazone was also prolonged in elderly subjects (about 10 hours) compared to younger subjects (about seven hours). These changes were not of a magnitude that would be considered clinically relevant.

### Comparison of pioglitazone with other antidiabetic drugs for associated incidence of liver failure: No evidence of increased risk of liver failure with pioglitazone [^111oaUhu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of liver failure in association with antidiabetic treatment using pioglitazone versus other oral antidiabetic medications.

The study was a retrospective analysis of claim data from the PharMetrics Patient-Centric Database, with over 1.12 million enrollees with type 2 diabetes. All patients, aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes, who had initiated treatment with a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone), sulfonylurea, or metformin were identified and matched based on propensity scores, which served as a proxy for the severity of the disease. The primary measure of interest was the incidence of liver failure or hepatitis post-index date. In addition to unadjusted comparisons, Cox proportional hazard models were employed to estimate the risk of developing liver failure or hepatitis.

There was no significant difference in the 1- and 2-year incidence rates of liver failure or hepatitis (primary and secondary diagnoses) between the pioglitazone monotherapy group and the respective comparator groups. In Cox proportional hazard models controlling for age, pre-index total healthcare costs, Charlson comorbidity index, procedures, and a hospitalization or emergency room (ER) visit for pre-index hyperglycemia, pioglitazone was not associated with an increased risk of liver failure or hepatitis compared to all other defined groups. Furthermore, no primary or secondary diagnosis of liver failure was reported in the pioglitazone group during the follow-up period.

### Lessons from the glitazones: A story of drug development [^111xCezb]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Troglitazone, the first in the thiazolidinedione class of oral hypoglycaemic agents, was launched in the United States in March 1997. It reached Europe later that year, only to be withdrawn within weeks due to liver toxicity. Meanwhile, it generated sales of over $2 billion in the United States and caused at least 90 cases of liver failure (70 resulting in death or transplantation) before it was withdrawn in March 2000. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone reached the US market in 1999 as first-line agents to be used alone or in combination with other drugs. However, in Europe, the same dossiers were used one year later to apply for a limited license as second-line agents restricted to oral combination therapy. How should we use the glitazones, and how did they achieve blockbuster status without any clear evidence of advantage over existing therapy?

### Pioglitazone decreases fasting and postprandial endogenous glucose production in proportion to decrease in hepatic triglyceride content [^113Ro891]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatic triglyceride is closely associated with hepatic insulin resistance and is known to be decreased by thiazolidinediones. We studied the effect of pioglitazone on hepatic triglyceride content and the consequent effect on postprandial endogenous glucose production (EGP) in type 2 diabetes.

- **Research design and methods**: Ten subjects with type 2 diabetes on sulfonylurea therapy were treated with pioglitazone (30 mg daily) for 16 weeks. EGP was measured using a dynamic isotopic methodology following a standard liquid test meal both before and after pioglitazone treatment. Liver and muscle triglyceride levels were measured by (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and intra-abdominal fat content was measured by magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Results**: Pioglitazone treatment reduced mean plasma fasting glucose and mean peak postprandial glucose levels. Fasting EGP decreased after pioglitazone treatment (16.6 ± 1.0 vs. 12.2 ± 0.7 micromol. kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹, P = 0.005). Between 80 and 260 min postprandially, EGP was twofold lower on pioglitazone (2.58 ± 0.25 vs. 1.26 ± 0.30 micromol. kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹, P < 0.001). Hepatic triglyceride content decreased by approximately 50% (P = 0.03), and muscle (anterior tibialis) triglyceride content decreased by approximately 55% (P = 0.02). Hepatic triglyceride content was directly correlated with fasting EGP (r = 0.64, P = 0.01) and inversely correlated to percentage suppression of EGP (time 150 min, r = -0.63, P = 0.02). Muscle triglyceride, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat content were not related to EGP.

### Effects of liraglutide on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11746gMr]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common public health problem worldwide, with an estimated 415 million confirmed cases in 2015. It is expected that the number of confirmed cases of T2DM will reach 642 million by 2040. Studies have revealed a strong relationship between T2DM and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with reports suggesting that about 70–90% of patients with T2DM are likely to suffer from NAFLD. In turn, NAFLD may become a crucial contributor to liver-related mortality, with liver transplantation expected to increase at an alarming rate in patients with T2DM over the next 5 years.

The histologic spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with NAFLD who progress to NASH are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to liver and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, preventing and treating NAFLD is necessary for managing T2DM. Unfortunately, there are currently no approved therapies with beneficial effects for managing NAFLD in patients with T2DM. Lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and weight loss, continue to play a vital role in the management of NAFLD. Although many studies have explored the role of various pharmacological agents, such as statins, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E, and pioglitazone, in the treatment of NAFLD, few have reported beneficial results. Concerns regarding side effects and long-term safety also remain a challenge.

### Pioglitazone decreases fasting and postprandial endogenous glucose production in proportion to decrease in hepatic triglyceride content [^116qHERL]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine how pioglitazone affects hepatic triglyceride content and its subsequent impact on postprandial endogenous glucose production (EGP) in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Hepatic triglyceride is known to be closely associated with hepatic insulin resistance and can be decreased by thiazolidinediones.

Research design and methods: Ten subjects with type 2 diabetes undergoing sulfonylurea therapy were treated with pioglitazone (30 mg daily) for 16 weeks. EGP was measured using dynamic isotopic methodology following a standard liquid test meal, both before and after pioglitazone treatment. Liver and muscle triglyceride levels were quantified using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and intra-abdominal fat content was determined by magnetic resonance imaging.

Results: Pioglitazone treatment resulted in reduced mean plasma fasting glucose and mean peak postprandial glucose levels. Fasting EGP decreased after pioglitazone treatment (16.6 ± 1.0 vs. 12.2 ± 0.7 μmol · kg−1 · min−1, P = 0.005). Between 80 and 260 minutes postprandially, EGP was twofold lower with pioglitazone (2.58 ± 0.25 vs. 1.26 ± 0.30 μmol · kg−1 · min−1, P < 0.001). Hepatic triglyceride content decreased by approximately 50% (P = 0.03), and muscle (anterior tibialis) triglyceride content decreased by approximately 55% (P = 0.02). Hepatic triglyceride content was directly correlated with fasting EGP (r = 0.64, P = 0.01) and inversely correlated with percentage suppression of EGP (time 150 minutes, r = −0.63, P = 0.02). There was no relation between muscle triglyceride, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat content and EGP.

Conclusions: The reduction in hepatic triglyceride via pioglitazone treatment corresponded with decreased fasting and postprandial EGP in type 2 diabetes patients.

### Oseni [^1133AYDn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatic effects**: There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone or alogliptin, although some of the reports contain insufficient information to establish the probable cause [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In glycemic control trials of alogliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 1.7% of patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial, a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular (CV) risk, increases in serum alanine aminotransferase three times the upper limit of the reference range occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities. They may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating Oseni therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, Oseni should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, and right upper quadrant pain.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of autoimmune hepatitis [^1147GJRg]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for autoimmune hepatitis, specifically in terms of induction therapy, the EASL 2025 guidelines recommend initiating prednisone or prednisolone (at least 0.5 mg/kg/day, and potentially up to 1 mg/kg/day in more severe and advanced disease). This should be in combination with azathioprine when bilirubin is ≤ 6 mg/dL, ideally 2 weeks apart from corticosteroid initiation, starting at an initial dose of 50 mg/day and up to a final dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day. Mycophenolate mofetil (1.5–2 g/day) may also be considered as first-line treatment in patients with autoimmune hepatitis.

### A placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^114T6MNm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

No pharmacologic therapy has conclusively proved to be effective for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is characterized by insulin resistance, steatosis, and necroinflammation with or without centrilobular fibrosis. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that ameliorates insulin resistance and improves glucose and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 55 patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes and liver biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis to 6 months of treatment with a hypocaloric diet (a reduction of 500 kcal per day in relation to the calculated daily intake required to maintain body weight) plus pioglitazone (45 mg daily) or a hypocaloric diet plus placebo. Before and after treatment, we assessed hepatic histologic features, hepatic fat content by means of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and glucose turnover during an oral glucose tolerance test (14Cglucose given with the oral glucose load and [3H]glucose given by intravenous infusion).

- **Results**: Diet plus pioglitazone, as compared with diet plus placebo, improved glycemic control and glucose tolerance (P < 0.001), normalized liver aminotransferase levels as it decreased plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels (by 40% vs. 21%, P = 0.04), decreased alanine aminotransferase levels (by 58% vs. 34%, P < 0.001), decreased hepatic fat content (by 54% vs. 0%, P < 0.001), and increased hepatic insulin sensitivity (by 48% vs. 14%, P = 0.008). Administration of pioglitazone, as compared with placebo, was associated with improvement in histological features of the liver.

### Substitution of pioglitazone for troglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112kwmGr]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of pioglitazone therapy in patients who previously received troglitazone.

- **Methods**: We conducted an observational study involving patients with type 2 diabetes, who were originally treated with troglitazone and subsequently converted to pioglitazone therapy. Drug efficacy was evaluated by comparing baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, weight, blood pressure, and lipid profiles during troglitazone treatment with corresponding values 6 months after the final pioglitazone dose titration. Drug safety was assessed by reviewing hepatic enzyme levels and documented reports of side effects.

- **Results**: The study cohort comprised 316 patients in whom pioglitazone therapy was initiated after they had received troglitazone for at least 1 year. Discontinuation of pioglitazone treatment subsequently occurred in 43 patients; in 7 additional patients, no follow-up was conducted. We found no significant difference between baseline and follow-up mean HbA1c values. Aspartate aminotransferase levels did not significantly change after 6 months of pioglitazone therapy; however, alanine aminotransferase levels increased by a statistically significant 3.8 U/L (95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 4.9). Pioglitazone treatment was discontinued due to edema in 29 of the 309 evaluable patients (9.4%).

- **Conclusion**: Pioglitazone was as effective as troglitazone in maintaining HbA1c levels. The hepatic safety of pioglitazone was also demonstrated.

### The effects of discontinuing pioglitazone in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^114rpJ15]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

A pilot study of a 48-week course of pioglitazone demonstrated significant improvements in the biochemical and histological features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The aim of the study was to assess the effects of stopping pioglitazone. Twenty-one patients with NASH were treated with pioglitazone (30 mg/day) for 48 weeks and underwent baseline and end-of-treatment evaluation, including liver biopsy. Thirteen patients were followed for at least 48 weeks after stopping therapy and nine underwent repeat liver biopsy. Statistical comparisons were made to evaluate whether discontinuation of pioglitazone resulted in a reversal of improvements seen during therapy.

Stopping pioglitazone was associated with a subsequent elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase levels (from 34 ± 13 to 70 ± 39 IU/l), decrease in adiponectin (from 9.7 ± 9.1 to 5.1 ± 4.5 microg/ml), worsening insulin sensitivity (HOMA Index: from 2.9 ± 1.8 to 5.5 ± 5.4), and increase in total hepatic fat (from 30% ± 32% to 71% ± 33%) despite no change in average body weight compared to the end of treatment. Repeat liver biopsy in nine patients revealed significant worsening of parenchymal inflammation (from 1.2 ± 0.7 to 2.9 ± 1.1) and steatosis (from 0.9 ± 0.6 to 2.1 ± 1.3) but no change in fibrosis (from 1.1 ± 1.2 to 1.2 ± 1.3). NASH was again present on liver biopsy in seven patients.

These findings suggest that long-term therapy with pioglitazone may be necessary to maintain improvements in disease activity in patients with NASH, although weight gain during treatment may…

### The role of lamivudine and predictors of mortality in severe flare-up of chronic hepatitis B with jaundice [^116M7dME]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) may develop severe disease exacerbations (flare) with jaundice, and some may progress to fulminant hepatic failure. Whether early administration of lamivudine can prevent liver failure and mortality is uncertain. We investigated the role of lamivudine treatment in severe hepatitis B virus (HBV) exacerbations. Consecutive patients presented with severe flare-up of HBV (new onset of jaundice plus alanine aminotransferase greater than five times upper limit of normal) were treated with lamivudine, and historical controls who did not receive lamivudine were studied. All patients had no hepatic encephalopathy on admission.

Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed on various clinical and laboratory factors for the prediction of mortality. Twenty-eight patients treated with lamivudine and 18 controls were identified. Overall, nine patients died and two others received liver transplants for fulminant hepatic failure. Six of 28 (21.4%) lamivudine-treated patients versus five of 18 (27.8%) controls died or received a liver transplant (P = 0.62).

- **Independent predictors of liver-related mortality**: On multivariate analysis, platelet count of 172 micromol/L (odds ratio 18.4, 95% CI 1.5–228.5) were identified as independent predictors. The mortality rates among patients who had thrombocytopenia and high bilirubin, thrombocytopenia, high bilirubin, and no risk factor were 69.2%, 11.1%, 12.5%, and 0% respectively.

Hence, lamivudine confers no survival benefit over conventional treatment in severe exacerbations of CHB.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^117GEDfy]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

For patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly those who have experienced a stroke, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend considering the use of pioglitazone to reduce the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction. This is applicable for patients with a history of stroke who also show evidence of insulin resistance and prediabetes. The potential benefits must be weighed against risks, such as weight gain, edema, and fractures. To mitigate the risk of adverse effects, it is advisable to consider offering lower doses.

### Do thiazolidinediones still have a role in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115vedk4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Thiazolidinediones have been introduced in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) since the late 1990s. Although troglitazone was withdrawn from the market a few years later due to liver toxicity, both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone gained widespread use for T2DM treatment. In 2010, however, due to an increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with its use, the European Medicines Agency recommended suspension of rosiglitazone use, and the Food and Drug Administration severely restricted its use. Thus, pioglitazone is the only thiazolidinedione still significantly employed for treating T2DM and is the only molecule of this class still listed in the American Diabetes Association-European Association for the Study of Diabetes 2012 Position Statement. However, as with the other thiazolidinediones, the use of pioglitazone is itself limited by several side effects, some of which are potentially dangerous. This, together with the development of novel therapeutic strategies approved in the last couple of years, has made it questionable whether thiazolidinediones (namely pioglitazone) should still be used in the treatment of T2DM. This article will attempt to formulate an answer to this question by critically reviewing the available data on the numerous advantages and the potentially worrying shortcomings of pioglitazone treatment in T2DM.
