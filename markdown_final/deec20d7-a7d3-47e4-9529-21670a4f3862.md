## Question

What Is the cause of increased lower extremity blood pressure more than the upper extremity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the cause of increased lower extremity blood pressure compared to upper extremity blood pressure, and how to distinguish normal physiologic differences from potential pathologic causes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline physiologic difference expected between ankle and brachial systolic pressures. Then, I should verify the underlying hemodynamic mechanisms, especially pulse wave amplification and wave reflection. Next, I will consider measurement technique and posture effects that could confound interpretation. After that, I need to check pediatric-specific norms and how they differ from adults. Finally, I will contrast physiologic high-ankle pressure with pathologic low-ankle pressure scenarios and synthesize practical clinical takeaways with thresholds and actions.

> Let me first confirm the baseline expectation in healthy adults without vascular disease. In the general population, ankle systolic blood pressure measured supine is about 10–20 mmHg higher than brachial systolic pressure, with diastolic pressures roughly similar, a finding consistently reported in meta-analyses and society statements, with an often-cited mean difference around 17 mmHg and a pragmatic threshold of about 155/90 mmHg used when only ankle pressures are available to infer hypertension status [^111F3YMp] [^115pj5VC] [^112oSoaq].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanisms behind this amplification before I anchor on a number. As the pressure wave travels from the central elastic aorta to the more muscular and stiffer peripheral arteries, systolic pressure rises while diastolic pressure remains relatively constant, a phenomenon variously termed pulse wave amplification or the Popeye effect. This arises from wave reflection and impedance mismatch, with stiffer distal vessels reflecting waves back to augment peak systolic pressure, and the degree of amplification is influenced by arterial stiffness and peripheral resistance, including lower-extremity contributions [^116AbCqn] [^1139U2Jt] [^117C2awh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — technique and posture can distort this signal. I should confirm best practices: measure supine after rest, use a properly sized cuff (bladder width about 40% of limb circumference), and be mindful that limb position and external compression can transiently raise measured values. Leg crossing can acutely increase stroke volume and cardiac output and raise BP by a few mmHg, and discomfort at alternative sites can introduce variability, so standardized supine Doppler protocols improve reproducibility when interpreting ankle or segmental pressures [^115LvE2r] [^115pj5VC] [^113b4xaJ] [^117YHqN5].

> Next, I should review pediatric norms because I need to ensure the interpretation matches developmental physiology. In children and adolescents, leg systolic blood pressure is normally about 10–20% higher than the brachial pressure, and pediatric guidelines explicitly instruct clinicians to check right arm, left arm, and one leg when evaluating suspected hypertension to screen for secondary causes like coarctation, recognizing that the expected higher leg pressure helps distinguish physiologic from pathologic gradients [^1162YqHC] [^1116Up3C] [^113H1ph2].

> I will now examine when a high ankle pressure reflects physiology versus when it flags pathology. In the absence of peripheral arterial disease, an ankle systolic pressure that is higher than the arm is physiologic and supports using higher ankle thresholds (about 155/90 mmHg) to diagnose hypertension when arm measurements are not feasible. However, if ankle pressure is low relative to the arm, particularly with ABI less than 0.90, that suggests hemodynamically significant stenosis or occlusion and mandates further evaluation with duplex or cross-sectional angiography rather than reliance on ankle pressure as a surrogate for systemic BP [^112oSoaq] [^115pj5VC] [^111F3YMp] [^115LvE2r] [^116FtD1F].

> But wait, what if the pattern is reversed and the leg pressure is lower than the arm pressure in a patient with hypertension? Let me consider red flags. A systolic BP that is lower in the legs than in the arms, especially with weak or delayed femoral pulses, raises concern for aortic coarctation or other proximal aortic obstruction; guidelines advise measuring BP in both arms and one leg in suspected coarctation, and they define significant disease by noninvasive upper-to-lower gradients exceeding about 20 mmHg or catheterization/Doppler thresholds in the 10–20 mmHg range depending on collateral flow and ventricular function, prompting echocardiography and advanced imaging to confirm anatomy and plan intervention [^113FJ6CL] [^113Xvb72] [^111ecmzY].

> Hmm, wait a minute — do we see this reversed gradient after coarctation repair as well? I should double-check that. Even after repair, up to 80% of adults may have an abnormal exercise BP response and a subset develop recurrent coarctation; persistent or exercise-induced upper-extremity hypertension with an increased upper-to-lower gradient warrants surveillance imaging and exercise testing, reinforcing the need to compare upper and lower extremity pressures longitudinally in this population [^113Xvb72] [^1118hhmX] [^111Rmiba].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing a confounder. In healthy individuals, lower-extremity systolic pressure is higher than upper-extremity pressure by roughly 10–20 mmHg due to pulse wave amplification and wave reflection as the pressure wave travels distally. This is expected physiology and supports the use of higher ankle thresholds to infer hypertension when arm measurements are unavailable, whereas a lower ankle pressure relative to the arm indicates obstructive arterial disease and should trigger vascular imaging rather than BP threshold interpretation [^111F3YMp] [^115pj5VC] [^112oSoaq].

> Finally, I should confirm practical steps to avoid misclassification. Always measure BP in both arms and at least one leg when evaluating hypertension or suspected coarctation, use standardized supine Doppler technique with correctly sized cuffs, and interpret any between-limb or upper–lower gradient in clinical context. If the leg pressure is unexpectedly low, calculate the ABI and proceed to duplex or CTA/MRA as indicated, whereas a leg pressure that is modestly higher than the arm is physiologic and should not prompt concern by itself [^115LvE2r] [^115pj5VC] [^116FtD1F] [^111ecmzY].

Higher lower-extremity blood pressure than upper-extremity is a normal finding due to **physiological amplification** of systolic pressure as the pulse wave travels distally [^111TnpGv], with ankle systolic pressure typically 10–20 mmHg higher than brachial pressure [^115pj5VC] [^111F3YMp]. This gradient reflects **wave reflection and arterial stiffness** [^116AbCqn] and is used clinically to interpret the ankle-brachial index (ABI) [^111TnpGv], where a higher ankle pressure is expected in healthy individuals [^111F3YMp]. Pathological causes of a reversed gradient (lower-extremity pressure lower than upper-extremity) include peripheral artery disease [^111F3YMp], aortic coarctation [^113FJ6CL], and subclavian artery stenosis [^notfound]; therefore, a higher lower-extremity pressure is generally reassuring, whereas a lower-extremity pressure that is equal to or lower than the upper-extremity pressure warrants further evaluation [^115pj5VC].

---

## Physiological mechanisms

Several **physiological mechanisms** explain why lower-extremity blood pressure is higher than upper-extremity:

- **Pulse wave amplification**: As the pressure wave travels from the central aorta to the periphery, systolic pressure increases due to wave reflection and arterial stiffness, resulting in higher systolic pressure at the ankles compared to the brachial artery [^116AbCqn] [^111F3YMp].

- **Arterial stiffness and impedance mismatch**: The lower-extremity arteries are stiffer and have higher impedance than upper-extremity arteries, contributing to higher systolic pressure in the legs [^112ntPs5].

- **Distance from the heart**: The greater distance from the heart to the lower extremities results in greater pulse wave amplification and higher systolic pressure [^112ntPs5].

---

## Clinical significance

The higher lower-extremity blood pressure has important **clinical implications**:

- **Ankle-brachial index (ABI)**: The ABI is calculated by dividing the ankle systolic pressure by the brachial systolic pressure. A normal ABI is typically around 1.0–1.4, reflecting the physiological gradient between ankle and brachial pressures [^111TnpGv] [^114aZWiU].

- **Diagnostic threshold**: An ankle systolic pressure of ≥ 155/90 mmHg is considered elevated and may indicate hypertension when arm measurements are not feasible [^112oSoaq] [^115pj5VC].

- **Peripheral artery disease (PAD)**: In PAD, the ankle pressure is typically lower than the brachial pressure, resulting in an ABI < 0.9. Therefore, a higher lower-extremity pressure is generally reassuring and suggests absence of significant PAD [^115LvE2r] [^112ntPs5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **measuring blood pressure** in both upper and lower extremities, particularly in patients with suspected or confirmed hypertension or cardiovascular disease [^114aZWiU]. The American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommend measuring blood pressure in both arms and lower extremities in patients with **coarctation of the aorta** [^115N24Aj] and other cardiovascular conditions [^114aZWiU]. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) similarly recommends measuring blood pressure in **both arms and one lower extremity** in patients with suspected or confirmed cardiovascular disease [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal findings

While higher lower-extremity blood pressure is normal, certain abnormal findings may indicate underlying pathology:

| **Abnormal finding** | **Potential underlying pathology** |
|-|-|
| Lower-extremity BP ≤ upper-extremity BP | - Peripheral artery disease (PAD) [^111F3YMp] <br/> - Aortic coarctation [^113FJ6CL] <br/> - Subclavian artery stenosis [^notfound] |
| Significant inter-arm BP difference (> 10 mmHg) | - Subclavian artery stenosis [^116ikjMa] <br/> - Aortic coarctation [^1168cWEe] <br/> - Peripheral vascular disease [^116A1BSw] |

---

Higher lower-extremity blood pressure than upper-extremity is a normal physiological finding due to **pulse wave amplification** and arterial stiffness [^111TnpGv]. This gradient is clinically significant for interpreting the **ankle-brachial index (ABI)** and diagnosing hypertension when arm measurements are not feasible [^112oSoaq]. Abnormal findings, such as lower-extremity pressure equal to or lower than upper-extremity pressure, may indicate **underlying pathology** and warrant further evaluation [^115pj5VC].

### Phenomenon of declining blood pressure in elderly – high systolic levels are undervalued with korotkoff method [^116JvPp7]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Measurement of SG-BP was introduced in 1960-ies for detection of peripheral arterial disease in legs and toes. Its validity was tested in subjects 18–50 years old, and the average intra-arterial SBP was 7 mmHg above SG-BP with a sensor placed on the finger, and 8 mmHg with a sensor placed on the toe. In that study, in young and middle-aged sample, a mean difference between intra-arterial vs. brachial K-BP and brachial SG-BP was similar, which reflects the validity of the latter method. SG-BP was found to be reproducible and correlated to auscultation in finger, ankle, and arm in middle-aged subjects. Pressure gradients between arm and legs have been calculated in healthy populations sample, and in those with with vascular risk factors, when the method was widely used to examine peripheral circulation.

### Pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnoea in hypertensive patients: role of fluid retention and nocturnal rostral fluid shift [^111yf6gw]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is highly prevalent in hypertensive patients, particularly those with drug resistance. Evidence from animal experiments, epidemiologic studies and clinical trials strongly suggest a causal link. Mechanistic studies argue for increased sympathetic neural activity and endothelial dysfunction. However, disturbances in fluid volume regulation and distribution may also be involved in the pathogenesis of these two conditions. Several studies have shown a high prevalence of OSA in fluid-retaining states including hypertension, a direct relationship between the severity of OSA and the volume of fluid displaced from the legs to the neck during sleep, and a decrease in upper airway cross-sectional area in response to graded lower body positive pressure. Treatments targeting fluid retention and redistribution, including diuretics, mineralocorticoid antagonists, exercise, and possibly renal denervation lower blood pressure and reduce the apnoea-hypopnoea index, a measure of OSA severity. From these observations, it has been postulated that during the daytime, excess fluid collects in the lower extremities due to gravity, and on lying down overnight is redistributed rostrally to the neck, where it may narrow the upper airway and increase its collapsibility, predisposing to OSA when pharyngeal dilator muscle activity decreases during sleep. This article discusses the associations between OSA and hypertension and reviews the evidence for fluid accumulation and its nocturnal rostral redistribution in the pathogenesis of OSA in hypertensive patients.

### Key points… [^116EBEKX]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Peripheral arterial disease is the narrowing or blockage of the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the legs.
- Other health conditions and disorders of arteries can mimic the symptoms of PAD. What it is Peripheral arterial disease in the legs or lower extremities is the narrowing or blockage of the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the legs. It is primarily caused by the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. PAD can happen in any blood vessel, but it is more common in the legs than the arms. Signs and symptoms The classic symptom of PAD is pain in the legs with physical activity, such as walking, that gets better after rest. However, up to 4 in 10 people with PAD have no leg pain. Symptoms of pain, aches, or cramps with walking can happen in the buttock, hip, thigh, or calf. Physical signs in the leg that may indicate PAD include:

- Muscle atrophy.
- Hair loss.
- Smooth, shiny skin.
- Skin that is cool to the touch, especially if there is pain while walking.
- Decreased or absent pulses in the feet.
- Sores or ulcers in the legs or feet that don't heal.
- Cold or numb toes. Other health conditions and disorders of arteries can mimic the symptoms of PAD, and not all PAD is due to atherosclerosis. If you have PAD, you are at risk for developing coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease, which could lead to a heart attack or stroke. Prevention Get plenty of physical activity to help prevent PAD or improve symptoms of PAD. Do not use tobacco. Smoking increases the risk of PAD and makes PAD symptoms worse. Control high blood pressure and manage high blood cholesterol and diabetes. If you have PAD, participating in supervised exercise training programs can improve and prolong your ability to walk longer distances. You may need surgery to bypass blocked arteries.

A supervised exercise program is recommended for people with pain caused by too little blood flow to muscles. Such a program could improve quality of life, and reduce leg symptoms.

### Upper limb dimensions in adults presenting for elective surgery-implications for blood pressure measurement [^117VL6Uu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Our population had a high rate of diagnosed hypertension of 43%, higher than reported population rates of 34% for Australia. This is likely to be related to the mean age of the cohort and clinical selection criteria for attendance of patients at the clinic. However it does highlight the risk profile of patients presenting for surgery in our institution and the importance of accurate blood pressure measurement. The mean BMI of this cohort was in the overweight category according to the World Health Organization classification however the BMI range of 16.1–60.9 indicates a wide range of body morphology in patients presenting for care at our institution.

To our knowledge, this is the largest evaluation of arm measurements specific to NIBP measurement equipment in a pre-operative population. Obtaining these measurements has allowed us to determine if current equipment meets the needs of patients presenting for elective surgery, based on MAC. Most of our understanding of NIBP measurement error is related to the simple circumference of the arm, rather than the shape of the arm. Data from the US, reporting on over 5000 men and over 5000 women between 2007 and 2010 reported mean MAC of 34.2 cm in men and 31.9 cm in women. In those cohorts, 45% of men and 28% of women required a cuff larger than the standard adult cuff. These proportions are much higher than in our cohort (17.6% of the entire cohort) and may represent geographic and ethnicity differences. Even based on the traditional measure of MAC, our results demonstrate that there are individuals for whom the AHA recommendations simply do not cater for.

### Ankle brachial index values, leg symptoms, and functional performance among community-dwelling older men and women in the lifestyle interventions and independence for elders study [^112ntPs5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects 8 million men and women in the United States (US) and will become more common as the US population survives longer with chronic disease.PAD can be detected noninvasively with the ankle brachial index (ABI), a ratio of Doppler‐recorded systolic blood pressures in the lower and upper extremities. – Although intermittent claudication is the classic symptom, PAD is often asymptomatic or can present with atypical leg symptoms. –

A normal ABI value is 1.10 to 1.40. –, This is because among individuals without PAD, lower extremity arterial pressures increase with greater distance from the heart, due to increasing impedance with increasing arterial taper, resulting in higher systolic pressures at the ankle compared with the brachial arteries. Thus, an ABI < 0.90 is highly sensitive and specific for PAD, an ABI of 1.10 to 1.40 indicates absence of PAD, and ABI values between 0.90 and 1.09 represent borderline PAD or low normal ABI values.

### Pressure-altering agents affect central aortic pressures more than is apparent from upper limb measurements in hypertensive patients: the role of arterial wave reflections [^116XJK2M]. Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The pressure pulse does not have the same amplitude in central and peripheral arteries, but it is amplified toward the periphery; the degree of this amplification depends principally on wave reflection. Despite the conventional clinical and epidemiological focus on peripheral pressures, the most physiologically relevant pressures for both cardiac and vascular effects are central pressures. The reflected wave contributes differently in the configuration of the peripheral and central pressure waveform. Therefore, we hypothesized that agents that alter wave reflections could have an unequal effect on central and peripheral pressures in hypertensive patients. Thus, the effect of caffeine was investigated in 10 hypertensive subjects according to a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design. Central aortic pressures and wave reflection were assessed with applanation tonometry and pulse wave analysis. After caffeine, augmentation index and augmented pressure increased by 4.6%, (P < 0.005) and 5.7 mm Hg (P < 0.001), respectively, indicating increased effect of wave reflection from the periphery. The increase in aortic systolic pressure was greater compared with that in radial artery pressure at 30 minutes (25%) and marginally greater at 60 minutes (21%). Furthermore, the increase in aortic pulse pressure was greater at 30 and 60 minutes (34% and 40%, respectively). The intensified reflected wave after caffeine was largely responsible for the disparate effect between central and peripheral pressures by boosting the peak of the central and not of the peripheral waveform. This study shows that pressure-altering agents might affect central pressures more than is apparent from the corresponding upper limb values because of the concomitant changes in wave reflection.

Coarctation of the aorta — diagnostic recommendations state that initial and follow-up aortic imaging using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) is recommended in adults with coarctation of the aorta, including post-surgical or catheter intervention patients; resting blood pressure should be measured in upper and lower extremities in all adults; ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can be useful for diagnosis and management of hypertension; screening for intracranial aneurysms by magnetic resonance angiography or CTA may be reasonable; and exercise testing to evaluate for exercise-induced hypertension may be reasonable in adults who exercise.

### Epinephrine [^115PUbzE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Considerations

Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if the solution is colored or cloudy, or if it contains particulate matter. Discard any unused portion.

2.2 Hypotension associated with Septic Shock

Dilute epinephrine in 5% Dextrose Injection or 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. These dextrose containing fluids provide protection against significant loss of potency by oxidation. Administration in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection alone is not recommended. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately.

Add 1 mL (1 mg) of epinephrine from its vial to 1,000 mL of a 5% Dextrose containing solution. Each mL of this dilution contains 1 mcg of epinephrine.

Correct blood volume depletion as fully as possible before any vasopressor is administered. When, as an emergency measure, intraaortic pressures must be maintained to prevent cerebral or coronary artery ischemia, epinephrine can be administered before and concurrently with blood volume replacement.

Whenever possible, give infusions of epinephrine into a large vein. Avoid using a catheter tie-in technique, because the obstruction to blood flow around the tubing may cause stasis and increased local concentration of the drug. Occlusive vascular diseases (for example, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, diabetic endarteritis, Buerger's disease) are more likely to occur in the lower than in the upper extremity; therefore, avoid the veins of the leg in elderly patients or in those suffering from such disorders. There is potential for gangrene in a lower extremity when infusions of catecholamine are given in an ankle vein.

To provide hemodynamic support in septic shock associated hypotension in adult patients, the suggested dosing infusion rate of intravenously administered epinephrine is 0.05 mcg/kg/min to 2 mcg/kg/min, and is titrated to achieve a desired mean arterial pressure (MAP). The dosage may be adjusted periodically, such as every 10 to 15 minutes, in increments of 0.05 mcg/kg/min to 0.2 mcg/kg/min, to achieve the desired blood pressure goal.

Continuous epinephrine infusion is generally required over several hours or days until the patient's hemodynamic status improves. The duration of perfusion or total cumulative dose cannot be predicted.

After hemodynamic stabilization, wean incrementally over time, such as by decreasing doses of epinephrine every 30 minutes over a 12- to 24-hour period.

### Blood pressure measurement and assessment of arterial structure and function: an expert group position paper [^111TnpGv]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

ANKLE-BRACHIAL INDEX

Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the ratio between the SBP measured at the ankle and the SBP measured at the brachial level. Measurement of ABI is simple, noninvasive, minimally time-consuming, and inexpensive; it is used for both the diagnosis and surveillance of lower extremity artery disease (LEAD), and the assessment of general atherosclerosis advancement and CV risk.

ABI measurement involves comparing SBP in the upper and lower limbs, considering the physiological increase in these values as the pulse wave travels through the arterial vessels, resulting from combined effect of pulse wave reflections and amplification, as well as changes in vessel wall thickness and properties. The presence of stenosis in the arteries of the aorta and /or lower limbs results in a decrease in the value of SBP measured in their distal section (and therefore also in a decrease in ABI), while pathological stiffening of the vessels results in an increase in this pressure (and an abnormal increase in ABI).

Indications

ABI should be measured for the clinical purposes in patients with clinical suspicion of LEAD and in patients without clinical suspicion but at risk of LEAD. Table 6 is summarizing the major indications of ABI:

TABLE 6
Indications of ankle/brachial index (ABI)

How to measure ankle brachial index

Despite the relative simplicity of the method, the data indicate significant heterogeneity in the protocols used, which makes interpretation difficult, especially in the case of serial studies in each patient. Therefore, we suggest the following principles:

Material

1 The examination should be performed using a Doppler method. The use of other methods (oscillometric, palpation, etc.) does not ensure sufficient accuracy and repeatability.
2 Assessment of SBP should be performed consistently on the upper and lower limbs using the same method − using a manually inflated cuff and a Doppler probe. The use of automatic oscillometric assessment on arm to simplify the protocol leads to an overestimation of the ABI.
3 It is recommended to use a 5–10 MHz Doppler probe and a cuff adjusted to the limb circumference (width of at least 40% of the limb circumference at the measurement site).
4 Automatic ABI assessment methods may be a promising time-saving alternative, especially in screening. Automated oscillometric and probably photoplethysmography methods seem to be more reliable than automated volume (dual-chamber) plethysmographic methods. Further evaluation studies are necessary.

Coarctation of the aorta — epidemiology, forms, and presentation: Coarctation of the aorta occurs in approximately 1 out of 2900 live births with a 4/1 male-to-female ratio, is the seventh most common congenital heart defect, and is frequently associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), aortic arch hypoplasia, mitral valve abnormalities, Shone complex, patent ductus arteriosus and atrial or ventricular septal defects. It is classified into 2 forms relative to the ductus arteriosus (preductal and post-ductal). In young adults, the most common presentation is upper extremity hypertension, and the differential systemic blood pressure between upper and lower extremities can often exceed 20 mmHg.

### Impact of obesity on blood pressures measured at alternative locations during pregnancy [^111bvxRz]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with obesity, the distribution of subcutaneous tissue can make blood pressure measurement on the standard location of the upper arm difficult. In these cases, alternative locations, such as the lower arm or wrist, are commonly used. It is unknown whether there is a discrepancy in these measurements for pregnant patients at extremes of body mass index.

Objective

We hypothesized that noninvasive blood pressure measurements on the lower arm and wrist will differ from blood pressure measurements on the upper arm and that this difference will be greater with increasing body mass index.

Study Design

We conducted a prospective observational study of pregnant patients from July 2020 to August 2020. We collected study subjects' biometric measurements and took 3 blood pressure measurements (systolic and diastolic blood pressures) from the upper arm, lower arm, and wrist. Measurements on the lower arm and wrist were considered alternative locations and compared with measurements on the upper arm. We stratified patients by body mass index. Agreement between locations was assessed using the Bland-Altman analysis. We used linear regression to assess the blood pressure discrepancy dependence on body mass index.

Results

We included 100 patients with 20 patients from each body mass index class. Blood pressure measurements at each site correlated but were discrepant. For the lower arm, there was an upward bias of 11.5 mm Hg (limit of agreement, +30.7 to -7.8) for systolic blood pressure and 11.2 mm Hg (limit of agreement, +25.9 to -2.9) for diastolic blood pressure compared with the upper arm. For the wrist, there was an upward bias of 7.1 mm Hg (limit of agreement, +35.1 to -20.9) for systolic blood pressure and 7.3 mm Hg (limit of agreement, +26.2 to -11.7) for diastolic blood pressure compared with the upper arm. Overall, there was a greater discrepancy in blood pressure measurements between the lower and upper arms with increasing body mass index. When comparing blood pressure measurements between the lower and upper arms, the discrepancy increased by 0.43 mm Hg (P < .001) for systolic blood pressure and 0.18 mm Hg (P = 0.02) for diastolic blood pressure with each increasing body mass index unit. There was no statistically significant change in the discrepancy of systolic (P = 0.45) or diastolic (P = 0.86) blood pressure in the upper arm vs the wrist based on body mass index.

Conclusion

This study highlighted that blood pressure measurements are higher when taken at alternative locations, such as the lower arm and wrist, and that lower arm blood pressure measurements are increasingly discrepant from upper arm blood pressure measurements with increasing body mass index.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lower extremity arterial injury, more specifically with respect to physical examination, AAST/WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to do not exclude arterial injury in the presence of peripheral pulses alone. Obtain additional evaluation with ankle-brachial index or arterial pressure index measurements in hemodynamically stable patients with concerning mechanism, proximity injury, or soft signs of peripheral vascular injury.

### Defining the relationship between arm and leg blood pressure readings: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111F3YMp]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To define the relationship between arm and leg blood pressure (BP) to inform the interpretation of leg BP readings in routine clinical practice where arm readings are not available.

Methods

Systematic review of all existing studies comparing arm and leg BP measurements. A search strategy was designed in MEDLINE and adapted to be run across six further databases. Articles were deemed eligible for inclusion if they measured and reported arm and leg BP taken in the supine position and/or the difference between the two. Mean values for arm-leg BP difference and measures of precision [95% confidence intervals (CIs) or SD] were extracted and entered into a random-effects meta-analysis.

Results

A total of 887 articles were screened and 44 were included in the descriptive analyses, including 9771 patients. In the general population, ankle SBP was 17.0mmHg (95% CI 15.4–21.3mmHg) higher than arm BP in the supine position. For DBP, there was no difference between arm and ankle BP (-0.3mmHg, 95% CI -1.5–1.0mmHg). In patients with vascular disease, SBP was -33.3mmHg (95% CI -59.1 to -7.6mmHg) lower in the ankle compared with the arm.

Conclusion

This is the first review to provide empirical data defining the difference between BP in the arm and leg in the general population. Findings suggest a diagnostic threshold of 155/90mmHg could be used for diagnosing hypertension when only ankle measurements are available in routine practice.

1 The measurement should be performed on each arm (with the cuff placed in the typical place and the Doppler probe on the brachial artery) and each ankle (with the cuff placed just above the malleoli and the Doppler probe on both the posterior tibial artery and the anterior tibial/dorsal pedis artery; in the absence of a signal of the above arteries, it is recommended to try the measurement on the peroneal artery).
2 All measurements should be performed in a lying position, in a situation that ensures the patient's comfort, considering the rest period to achieve stable BP values.
3 When using the cuff on lower limbs, it is recommended to avoid areas of ulceration. The cuff should not be applied over distal bypass.
4 It is recommended to use the routine order of measurements: clockwise or counterclockwise, starting from one of the upper limbs and repeated for that limb at the end if the difference in upper limb measurements suggests a white coat reaction.
5 For diagnosing/monitoring LEAD, it is recommended to estimate the ABI for each lower limb separately (by dividing higher of systolic BP measured on the given ankle by higher of the BP measured on both arms).
6 For CV risk assessment, lower of two measured ABIs should be used.

Interpretation

1 An ABI ≤ 0.90 should be considered the threshold for confirming the diagnosis of LEAD.
2 An ABI > 1.40 suggests increased arterial stiffness. In the case of clinical suspicion of LEAD in such patients, toe-brachial index should be measured.
3 Both (≤ 0.90 and > 1.40) values of ABI should be considered as independent of others CV and mortality risk factors.

Measurement of ABI is relatively easy and requires only short training. It should be performed in all patients with symptoms or signs of LEAD as well as when arterial evaluation is needed such as in patients > 65 years or at high CV risk (Table 7).

### Clinical care for cardiovascular disease in patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome [^113ceyvu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

HYPERTENSION

Hypertension is common in WBS, occurring in nearly 50% of children and up to 70% of adults. Hypertension is often diagnosed in people with WBS in early childhood, and the prevalence increases with age and male sex. The cause of hypertension in the population of patients with WBS is multifactorial.

Haploinsufficiency at the ELN locus leads to arterial stenosis, increased arterial stiffness, and increased sympathetic activity, which result in hypertension in many patients with WBS. The arterial lesions most commonly associated with hypertension in WBS are renal artery stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, and midaortic syndrome. Conversely, those with WBS whose microdeletion includes the NCF1 gene have a lower risk of developing hypertension.

The high prevalence of hypertension in WBS necessitates regular screening that should be performed at least annually, though for those 1 year old or less, measurements should be made every 3 months. The blood pressure should be assessed manually with an appropriately sized cuff on both upper limbs and at least 1 lower limb. This is particularly important in the setting of SVAS, where the Coanda effect can result in falsely elevated blood pressure measurements. Given the high level of anxiety common in WBS, it is important to attempt to acquire blood pressure measurements when the patient is calm. In the case of elevated blood pressure (systolic or diastolic blood pressure > 95th centile for age, sex, and height), the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is beneficial. Diagnostic evaluation of a patient with WBS and new‐onset hypertension should also include (where available) imaging tests to detect the cause and possible effects of hypertension, such as echocardiography to detect coarctation or long‐segment stenosis of the aorta and assess left ventricular hypertrophy. Renal ultrasound with Doppler is often used as a screening tool for renal artery stenosis; however, when there are clinical indicators to suggest renal artery stenosis may be present (eg, abdominal bruit or hypertension), renal ultrasound is unreliable, and more advanced imaging should be undertaken with angiography using CT or magnetic resonance imaging.

### Early blood pressure targets in acute spinal cord injury: a randomized clinical trial [^115Rjyis]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Early blood pressure management is central to neurologic resuscitation of spinal cord injury; however, the role of augmented blood pressure is unclear.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of augmented vs conventional blood pressure on 6-month neurologic outcomes after acute spinal cord injury.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter randomized clinical trial took place from October 3, 2017, to July 26, 2023, and assessed patients 18 years or older with spinal cord injury followed up for 6 months at 13 large US trauma centers.

Interventions

Patients were equally randomized to augmented (> 85–90 mm Hg) or conventional (> 65–70 mm Hg) mean arterial pressure for 7 days or until intensive care unit discharge.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end points were change in motor and sensory American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale scores from baseline to 6 months. Safety end points included organ dysfunction and complications.

Results

The trial randomized 92 patients (mean [SD] age, 53.78 [18.74] years; 76 [83%] male). At 6 months, 38 patients had completed follow-up and 15 had died. Among survivors, there were no mean (SD) differences in change from baseline in upper extremity motor scores (34.95 [3.25] vs 32.95 [3.65]; difference, 2.48; 95% CI, -5.93 to 10.90; p = 0.55), lower extremity motor scores (18.53 [4.62] vs 19.95 [4.59]; difference, -4.56; 95% CI, -16.11 to 7.03; p = 0.43), or total sensory scores (108.47 [12.49] vs 130.89 [14.87]; difference, -32.00; 95% CI, -65.40 to 1.40; p = 0.06) comparing the augmented and conventional groups. The augmented group had higher mean (SD) modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (excluding cardiovascular components) at day 3 (1.65 [1.79] vs 0.80 [1.10]; difference, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.23–1.47; p = 0.008) and day 6 (1.55 [1.82] vs 0.80 [1.35]; difference, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.05–1.44; p = 0.04), longer mechanical ventilatory support (9.44 [15.27] vs 3.78 [8.42] days; difference, 5.67 days; 95% CI, 0.48–10.85 days; p = 0.03), and more respiratory complications (36 [78%] vs 18 [39%]; risk difference, 40%; 95% CI, 22%-58%; P < .001) than the conventional group. No differences in mortality or other secondary outcomes were observed.

Conclusions

Although underpowered, this randomized clinical trial of patients with spinal cord injury did not demonstrate better neurologic recovery comparing early augmented and conventional blood pressure and calls this practice into question. Further study is needed to identify groups who may benefit from augmenting blood pressure and determine potential harm mechanisms.

### Higher systolic blood pressure difference in left not right upper limb is associated with all-cause mortality risk in a community-based population [^116tkWUG]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This study investigated inter-arm systolic blood pressure difference (IASBPD) and mortality risks in 8628 Chinese community residents from an atherosclerosis cohort. IASBPD was calculated by subtracting the systolic blood pressure of the left arm from that of the right arm. Participants were categorized as |IASBPD| < 10mmHg or ≥ 10mmHg. These groups were further subdivided into four categories according to specific IASBPD values. The endpoints included all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Over a median follow-up of 9.87 years, a total of 442 all-cause and 138 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. Compared to |IASBPD| < 10mmHg group, the |IASBPD| ≥ 10mmHg group had a 53% increase in all-cause mortality risk (adjusted HR = 1.53, P = 0.002) and a 71% increase in cardiovascular mortality risk (adjusted HR = 1.71, P = 0.021). When comparing specific IASBPD, no significant increase in all-cause mortality risk was observed in the group with a right arm higher ≥ 10mmHg (adjusted HR = 1.17, P = 0.507) or in the group with a left arm higher ≤ 10mmHg (adjusted HR = 0.90, P = 0.329). Conversely, the left arm higher > 10mmHg group demonstrated a significant 59% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR = 1.59, P = 0.013). While the association with cardiovascular mortality was not statistically significant in this subgroup, the trend paralleled that observed for all-cause mortality. In conclusion, an elevated IASBPD is significantly associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risks, with higher IASBPD in the left arm showing a stronger link to all-cause mortality risk.

Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) — measurement and diagnostic performance in symptomatic PAD: The resting ABI "is measured in each leg using a blood pressure cuff and a Doppler device to detect blood flow and pressure in the pedal and the brachial arteries", and "is the ratio of the higher systolic pressure in the ipsilateral dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries divided by the higher of the left and right brachial artery systolic pressures". In symptomatic PAD, "the resting ABI has a sensitivity of 69% to 79% and a specificity of 83% to 99% compared with imaging studies showing significant arterial stenoses, although the sensitivity is reduced in the presence of diabetes". As adjuncts, "Doppler waveforms and/or plethysmographic PVR taken at the ankle can confirm concordance with the presence and severity of PAD and suggest the presence of noncompressible arteries in the setting of discordance".

### Association of blood pressure measurements with peripheral artery disease events [^115YRM3k]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend treating hypertension in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) to reduce the risk of cardiac events and stroke, but the effect of reducing blood pressure on lower extremity PAD events is largely unknown. We investigated the association of blood pressure with lower extremity PAD events using data from the ALLHAT trial (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial).

Methods

ALLHAT investigated the effect of different antihypertensive medication classes (chlorthalidone, amlodipine, lisinopril, or doxazosin) on cardiovascular events. With the use of these data, the primary outcome in our analysis was time to first lower extremity PAD event, defined as PAD-related hospitalization, procedures, medical treatment, or PAD-related death. Given the availability of longitudinal standardized blood pressure measurements, we analyzed systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse pressure as time-varying categorical variables (reference categories 120–129 mmHg for SBP, 70–79 mmHg for DBP, and 45–54 mmHg for pulse pressure) in separate models. We used extended Cox regression with death as a competing risk to calculate the association of each blood pressure component with PAD events, and report the results as subdistribution hazard ratios and 95% CIs.

Results

The present analysis included 33357 patients with an average age of 67.4 years, 53.1% men, 59.7% white race, and 36.2% with diabetes mellitus. The median baseline blood pressure was 146/84 mmHg. Participants were followed for a median of 4.3 (interquartile range, 3.6–5.3) years, during which time 1489 (4.5%) had a lower extremity PAD event, and 4148 (12.4%) died. In models adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics, SBP < 120 mmHg was associated with a 26% (CI, 5%-52%; P = 0.015) higher hazard and SBP ≥ 160 mmHg was associated with a 21% (CI, 0%-48%; P = 0.050) higher hazard for a PAD event, in comparison with SBP 120 to 129 mmHg. In contrast, lower, but not higher, DBP was associated with a higher hazard of PAD events: for DBP < 60 mmHg (hazard ratio, 1.72; CI, 1.38–2.16). Pulse pressure had a U-shaped association with PAD events.

Conclusions

In this reanalysis of data from ALLHAT, we found a higher rate of lower extremity PAD events with higher and lower SBP and pulse pressure and with lower DBP. Given the recent revised blood pressure guidelines advocating lower SBP targets for overall cardiovascular risk reduction, further refinement of optimal blood pressure targets specific to PAD is needed.

### Benefits from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor' beyond blood pressure lowering': beyond blood pressure or beyond the brachial artery? [^117C2awh]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The substantial benefits of ramipril over conventional therapy in high-risk patients are not always associated with clinically significant differences in brachial arterial pressure, and largely remain unexplained. We undertook this acute study to establish the magnitude of and reason for different acute effects of ramipril and atenolol on arterial pressure.

Methods

We enrolled 30 patients, who took 10 mg ramipril, 100 mg atenolol, and placebo at intervals of ≥ 7 days, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After baseline, measurements were taken at 30–60 min intervals for 5 h, and comprised cuff brachial pressure, radial artery tonometry with generation of central aortic pressure, and pulse wave velocity for aorta, upper limb and lower limb arteries.

Results

Both ramipril and atenolol reduced arterial pressure, and the diastolic pressure fall was similar in the aorta and brachial artery, but the systolic pressure fall for ramipril was greater than for atenolol (by 5.2 mmHg, P < 0.0001) in the aorta compared with the brachial artery. The aortic systolic pressure difference with ramipril in comparison with atenolol was accompanied by an absolute difference of 10.7% (P < 0.0001) in the augmentation index, denoting a reduction in peripheral wave reflection by ramipril. The aortic pulse wave velocity fell to a similar degree with ramipril in comparison with atenolol, but fell to a greater degree (1.35 and 0.44 m/s, respectively, P < 0.0001 for both) in muscular arteries of the lower and upper limbs.

Conclusion

A greater (average, 5.2 mmHg) decrease in aortic systolic pressure caused by ramipril may explain the greater benefit of ramipril over atenolol. The difference is attributable to decreased stiffness of peripheral arteries and a reduction in wave reflection.

### Successful surgical treatment of descending aorta interruption in a 29-year-old woman with acute paraplegia and subarachnoid hemorrhage: a case report [^111pweFg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Aortic interruption leads to elevated blood pressure proximal to the interruption, increased cardiac afterload, and ischemia of the limbs and abdominal organs distal to the interruption. Most patients are diagnosed in the neonatal period in critical condition due to congestive heart failure. Without timely treatment, the mortality rate is as great as 90% at 12 months of life. Thrombus was found proximal to the interruption during the operation, a result of blockage of blood flow at the existing total interruption of the descending aorta. Based on our intraoperative findings, including the site of interruption which was far from the aortic arch and agenesis of the interrupted descending aorta, we diagnosed this patient with a descending aorta interruption.

Interruption of the descending aorta should lead to increased blood pressure in the upper extremities and decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities. This patient had a longstanding history of hypertension in her upper extremities, and she had previously suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage 1 month ago. However prior to this hospitalization, she had neither cardiac dysfunction nor decreased muscle strength in lower extremities. This lack of end-organ damage may be due to the fact that the interruption site is far from the aortic arch, at level of T 8–10, where many thoracic collateral vessels would be able to bypass the interruption, decreasing cardiac afterload and improving perfusion of the lower limbs. This case should remind us that some patients, such as the one described in this case, may suffer severe consequences if we as physicians fail to investigate secondary causes of longstanding hypertension in the upper extremities. When faced with a young patient with unexplained hypertension, we should explore the possibility of aortic interruption. At minimum, evaluation should include measurement of the blood pressure in both upper and lower extremities.

### The normal difference in bilateral indirect blood pressure recordings in hypertensive individuals [^1154MmeH]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

If there is a significant dichotomy between bilateral systolic blood pressure determinations in both arms in hypertensive individuals, it is often taken as a sign of underlying pathology. The primary objective was to determine what the normal variation might be for a significant difference between blood pressures in both arms. A clinically significant difference was chosen as a systolic blood pressure value greater than 10 mm Hg between the upper extremities, as is commonly quoted at the bedside and in the literature.

Methods

Bilateral indirect blood pressure determinations were obtained in 100 subjects with hypertension in the sitting position. The blood pressure was obtained by two observers, one the recorder and the other who obtained the blood pressure but was blinded to the actual values taken. The order of blood pressure determination in the first arm was determined prior to the study from a table of random numbers. The coefficient of variation in obtaining the blood pressure in each arm was determined in 5 of the 100 subjects. The age, sex, and handedness of each individual were recorded as demographic variables.

Results

The average left and right systolic blood pressures were 139 ± 22 and 141 ± 22 mm Hg, respectively. The average left and right diastolic blood pressures were 78 ± 12 and 79 ± 13 mm Hg, respectively. There was no significant difference between left minus right systolic or diastolic differences (paired t-test). There was no significant difference between systolic or diastolic blood pressures between gender or between left- and right-handed individuals (nonpaired t-test). The average coefficients of variation for taking right and left arm systolic pressures were 2.90% and 1.32%, respectively. Eighteen subjects (18%) had differences in systolic blood pressure between both arms exceeding 10 mm Hg (10% to 26%, 95% confidence interval).

Conclusions

Differences of more than 10 mm Hg in indirect systolic blood pressure recordings between arms are frequent in asymptomatic hypertensive individuals and do not per se indicate any pathologic condition. In the right clinical situation, differences that are noted should be repeated and should be added to the total clinical picture when used to determine whether a pathologic condition is present. Assuming no significant aortic or subclavian disease in the population tested, the specificity of the bilateral blood pressure test was 82%.

### Variability of four limb blood pressure in normal neonates [^114dL4z6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the variation in blood pressure (BP) between limbs in normal neonates. To assess whether comparison of arm and leg BP in neonates is reproducible enough to allow the difference to raise suspicion of coarctation of the aorta.

Methods

Infants recruited from the postnatal wards and the postnatal murmur clinic underwent echocardiography and BP measurement in each limb using a Dinamap Compact T 482210. The method of BP measurement was guided by a telephone survey of 40 UK neonatal units.

Results

Forty healthy neonates underwent echocardiography and all had a normal aortic arch. BP was measured in 39. In three, BP in the arms was 20 mm Hg higher than in the legs. This gave a specificity of comparison of the upper and lower limb BPs of 92 (36/39) or a false positive rate of 8% (3/39). The standard deviation in BPs was 15.7 mm Hg between arms, 14.5 mm Hg between legs, and 11 mm Hg when the nearest arm and leg were compared.

Conclusions

With current measurement techniques, normal neonates may have a wide variation in BP between limbs. A difference of 20 mm Hg in isolation is more likely to be due to random variability in measurement than to coarctation of the aorta. If coarctation of the aorta is suspected, it can only be excluded or confirmed by echocardiography.

### Blood pressure variability in clinical practice: past, present and the future [^116AbCqn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on Site of Measurement

It is worth noting that arterial blood pressure is not the same throughout the arterial tree. However, no clinical studies have been conducted to measure and classify BPV on the basis of the site of measurement, including central (aorta), peripheral (brachial), and arteriolar (fingertip). When moving distally from central to peripheral arteries, systolic arterial pressure is often amplified depending on the level of compliance mismatch between the central and peripheral arteries (as arterial pressure waves travel from the more elastic central aorta to stiffer peripheral arteries like the brachial artery, the systolic peak of the waveform becomes narrower and taller). In comparison, DBP and mean BP remain relatively constant. This SBP amplification from the brachial to radial arteries is termed the Popeye phenomenon (named after "Popeye the Sailorman" cartoon character, with a disproportionately high muscle girth in the forearm below the elbow, compared with the shoulder and upper arm).

Studies have shown that central BP (central aortic pressure) is a better cardiovascular risk indicator than peripheral BP (brachial BP). Central BP is a more accurate representation of the continuous column of pressure to which the target organs (brain, eyes, heart, and kidneys) are exposed. Various noninvasive methods are available for the estimation of central BP. However, current guidelines for the management of hypertension are based on brachial cuff BP measurements only. The issue of site selection when measuring BP is of critical importance, as it is widely acknowledged that BP is not the same throughout the body at a given time, and one site's BP measurements cannot be substituted or used to infer results from a different site.

Most of the cuffless devices, as discussed below, rely on pulse wave analysis for analysis and estimation of BP. In addition, it has been reported that some studies attempting to validate brachial cuff‐based BP measurement devices have used intra‐arterial radial SBP as their reference standard. Given this lack of concordance between BP measurements at different sites, it stands to reason that the same site BP measurement must be used as a reference standard for validating BP measurement devices. In addition, extrapolation of brachial BP from BP measurements made at the wrist or fingertip using newer BP measurement devices may be inherently inaccurate compared with brachial measures and provide different biological insights into pathology and treatments.

### Position statement on noninvasive imaging of peripheral arterial disease by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Canadian Interventional Radiology Association [^11524gxU]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ankle-brachial index measurement — standard testing modality — defines that the ABI is the ankle systolic blood pressure divided by the brachial artery systolic blood pressure and directs that both upper-extremity brachial pressures should be taken. If there is more than a 15-mm Hg difference between the two sides, hemodynamically significant disease should be considered to be present proximal to the brachial artery with the lower pressure; if there is a brachial pressure discrepancy, the higher pressure should be used. The greater of the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery blood pressure from each side is used to determine the ankle reading.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^111inbMv]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Measurement of blood pressure (BP) — For diagnosis and management of high BP, proper methods are recommended for accurate measurement and documentation of BP (COR I, LOE C-EO). BP measurement is performed incorrectly in most clinic settings, leading to inaccurate results that do not reflect a patient's BP at rest, including measurements taken prior to a 5-minute rest period, with cuffs placed on top of clothing, while patients are talking, and on examination tables without back or arm support and without feet firmly on the ground. An inappropriately sized BP cuff is also often used, and these factors can lead to a falsely elevated BP, which increases the risk of overdiagnosis and adverse events. Use of automated oscillometric devices may lead to lower BP values than auscultatory techniques. Correctly sized cuff should be fitted on the unclothed upper arm, and arms should be supported at the level of the right atrium.

### Higher arm versus lower arm systolic blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from the INTERPRESS-IPD collaboration [^116Gt88b]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Novelty and Relevance

Differences in blood pressure readings between arms have been recognised for over a century. This raises the question of which arm blood pressure — the higher or the lower arm reading — should be routinely adopted for the diagnosis and management of hypertension? International guidelines advise checking blood pressure in both arms, when assessing people for hypertension, and adoption of the higher arm reading where differences exist; this is, however, based on expert consensus opinion alone. – Only 20% to 50% of patients in primary care reportedly have both arms measured and general practitioners do not always adopt the higher reading arm for management decisions. Inter-arm differences may arise due to stenosis, making adoption of the higher arm reading logical; however, in most instances, there is no clearly demonstrable stenosis. Studies that compare the prognostic values associated with higher and lower reading arm blood pressures are lacking.

This study examined data from the Inter-arm Blood Pressure Difference — Individual Participant Data (INTERPRESS-IPD) Collaboration. Individual-level data on systolic blood pressure in each arm allowed us to compare associations of the higher and lower arm systolic blood pressures with cardiovascular events, mortality, and hypertension diagnoses. Since treatment decisions for primary prevention of cardiovascular events are based on cardiovascular risk score thresholds, the impact of using the higher compared to the lower arm reading on reclassification across intervention thresholds was also examined.

### Does measurement of four-limb blood pressures at birth improve detection of aortic arch anomalies? [^116dcuM2]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine normal four-extremity blood pressure (BP) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at birth and the utility of upper (UE) and lower extremity (LE) BP difference to screen for coarctation of the aorta (Co-A) and interrupted the aortic arch (IAA).

Study Design

Retrospective study of BP at birth (n = 866), and case-control study of Co-A/IAA infants and matched controls (1:2).

Result

Although BP increased with gestational age (R(2) = 0.3, P < 0.0001), the pressure gradient between UE and LE did not change with gestation (P = 0.68). Forty-six cases of Co-A/IAA were identified, with 92 controls. Pressure gradient was significantly higher in patients with Co-A/IAA (7.6 ± 14.8 versus 0.4 ± 10mmHg, P = 0.004). However, there was overlap between cases and controls resulting in low sensitivity (41.3% with ⩾10mmHg gradient cutoff).

Conclusion

Evaluation of UE-LE BP gradient at birth is a poor screening test for Co-A/IAA with low sensitivity. Repeating four-limb BP after ductal closure at 24 to 48h along with SpO2 screening for critical congenital heart disease may increase sensitivity.

### Extraintestinal manifestations in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review [^116s2US6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cognitive functions, mood disorders, and fatigue are more involved in central than in peripheral hypersensitivity. Widespread hypersensitivity in IBS with comorbidity and extraintestinal manifestations suggest central rather than peripheral hypersensitivity. However, almost all chronic complaints are initiated by peripheral sensory neurons. Central hypersensitivity is characterized by an increased membrane excitability, a facilitated synaptic strength, and/or a decreased inhibitory influence on dorsal horn neurons and contributes to abnormal responsiveness to noxious and innocuous stimuli and a tenderness in several visceral and somatic organs. Functional magnetic resonance imaging has described involvement of augmented pain processing also in cortical and subcortical structures, and associations between fatigue and connectivity within a mesocorticolimbic network.

In IBS, both widespread visceral and somatic hypersensitivity may be present, and somatization is associated with more visceral hypersensitivityand anxiety and depression. When examining cold and heat pain, pressure pain, and ischemic pain, IBS patients could be divided into one group with normal pain thresholds and one group with reduced thresholds. Interestingly, the thresholds were lower in foot than in hand, and the lower cold and ischemic thresholds were accompanied with higher systolic blood pressure and higher circulating levels of corticotrophin and cortisol. Associations between blood pressure, cortisol, and hypersensitivity suggest a disturbed hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis in IBS patients, possibly due to a higher stress level. The coexistence of hypersensitivity in several visceral organs, that is, cross sensitization, along with somatic hypersensitivity, is explained by the proximity between visceral organs and the organization of the enteric nervous system, and a viscerosomatic convergence at the spinal cord level and at higher brain centers. The more pronounced hypersensitivity in lower extremities may be explained by more afferent convergence at spinal cord level with colon and lower extremities than with upper extremities.

### Levophed (r) norepinephrine bitartrate [^117SqRTw]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Avoid Hypertension: Because of the potency of LEVOPHED and because of varying response to pressor substances, the possibility always exists that dangerously high blood pressure may be produced with overdoses of this pressor agent. It is desirable, therefore, to record the blood pressure every two minutes from the time administration is started until the desired blood pressure is obtained, then every five minutes if administration is to be continued.

The rate of flow must be watched constantly, and the patient should never be left unattended while receiving LEVOPHED. Headache may be a symptom of hypertension due to overdosage.

Site of Infusion: Whenever possible, infusions of LEVOPHED should be given into a large vein, particularly an antecubital vein because, when administered into this vein, the risk of necrosis of the overlying skin from prolonged vasoconstriction is apparently very slight. Some authors have indicated that the femoral vein is also an acceptable route of administration. A catheter tie-in technique should be avoided, if possible, since the obstruction to blood flow around the tubing may cause stasis and increased local concentration of the drug. Occlusive vascular diseases (for example, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, diabetic endarteritis, Buerger's disease) are more likely to occur in the lower than in the upper extremity. Therefore, one should avoid the veins of the leg in elderly patients or in those suffering from such disorders. Gangrene has been reported in a lower extremity when infusions of LEVOPHED were given in an ankle vein.

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) — criteria for significant CoA require evidence of upper extremity hypertension or left ventricular hypertrophy and one of the following gradients: a noninvasive blood pressure difference of > 20 mm Hg between the upper and lower extremities; a catheterization peak-to-peak gradient of > 20 mm Hg across the coarct, or > 10 mm Hg with decreased left ventricular systolic function or significant collateral flow; or a Doppler echocardiography mean gradient of > 20 mm Hg, or > 10 mm Hg with decreased left ventricular systolic function or significant collateral flow.

### The consequences of high-flexion postures on arterial wave reflections [^115iW7Sv]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Although central wave reflections are critical for aortic pressure regulation, the control mechanisms involved in humans are understudied. This study investigated the impact of upper- and lower-limb high-flexion postures on central arterial wave reflections. Twenty-two healthy adults (11 females, aged 25 ± 3 years) underwent three randomized and counter-balanced positions to evaluate the effect on central wave reflection: supine legs and arms in the anatomical position; supine two legs bent and arms straight; and supine two arms bent and legs straight. Characteristic impedance, forward and backward pressure waves, and pulse characteristics were measured via the central pressure-flow relationship in the frequency domain at the end of each posture hold. Central diastolic blood pressure increased during arm flexion only (67 ± 9mmHg vs. 62 ± 9mmHg; p < 0.01). Central systolic blood pressure, augmentation index, forward wave amplitude, reflected wave amplitude, central wave reflection magnitude, and characteristic impedance were unaffected by varying limb flexion positions (all p > 0.05). Acutely bending the arms and legs did not influence central wave reflections, likely related to a minimal effect of conduit artery bending, versus microvascular involvement, as suggested in previous studies. These findings underscore the importance of identifying the specific vascular regions responsible for wave reflection generation and support the need to refine central pressure augmentation models to accurately localize the dominant sources of wave reflection in humans.

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) — post-repair imaging, hypertension, and cerebrovascular screening: After establishing stable aortic imaging after CoA repair, surveillance imaging is often obtained every 3 to 5 years. Recoarctation occurs in about 10% after surgical repair and about 8% after balloon dilation, and after endovascular repair of CoA, MRI or CT can evaluate for complications, recoarctation, or endoleaks. Patients with a significant CoA typically have hypertension in the upper extremities and a reduction in blood pressure (BP) in the lower extremities; obtaining the BP in the upper and lower extremities assesses for native and recurrent coarctation. In adults who have undergone a previous open surgical CoA repair and develop recoarctation, aneurysm, or pseudoaneurysm, an endovascular approach avoids the need for reoperation. Patients with CoA are at risk for complications of hypertension and persistent hypertension is common after CoA correction; ambulatory BP monitoring and exercise testing may be useful in the evaluation and treatment of hypertension in patients with native CoA and after repair. Screening studies suggest that adults with CoA have a 10% prevalence of intracranial aneurysms (compared with a prevalence of 2% in the normal adult population), and shared decision-making about screening may be informed by age, risk factors, and anticoagulation considerations.

### Arm and ankle blood pressure indices, and peripheral artery disease, and mortality: a cohort study [^114V9tD4]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Few studies have compared arm and ankle blood pressures (BPs) with regard to peripheral artery disease (PAD) and mortality. These relationships were assessed using data from three large prospective clinical trials.

Methods

Baseline BP indices included arm systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), pulse pressure (arm SBP minus DBP), ankle SBP, ankle-brachial index (ABI, ankle SBP divided by arm SBP), and ankle-pulse pressure difference (APPD, ankle SBP minus arm pulse pressure). These measurements were categorized into four groups using quartiles. The outcomes were PAD (the first occurrence of either peripheral revascularization or lower-limb amputation for vascular disease), the composite of PAD or death, and all-cause death.

Results

Among 40 747 participants without baseline PAD (age 65.6 years, men 68.3%, diabetes 50.2%) from 53 countries, 1071 (2.6%) developed PAD, and 4955 (12.2%) died during 5 years of follow-up. Incident PAD progressively rose with higher arm BP indices and fell with ankle BP indices. The strongest relationships were noted for ankle BP indices. Compared with people whose ankle BP indices were in the highest fourth, adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for each lower fourth were 1.64 (1.31–2.04), 2.59 (2.10–3.20), and 4.23 (3.44–5.21) for ankle SBP; 1.19 (0.95–1.50), 1.66 (1.34–2.05), and 3.34 (2.75–4.06) for ABI; and 1.41 (1.11–1.78), 2.04 (1.64–2.54), and 3.63 (2.96–4.45) for APPD. Similar patterns were observed for mortality. Ankle BP indices provided the highest c-statistics and classification indices in predicting future PAD beyond established risk factors.

Conclusions

Ankle BP indices including the ankle SBP and the APPD best predicted PAD and mortality.

### Measurement of blood pressure in the leg-a statement on behalf of the British and Irish hypertension society [^115pj5VC]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Full statement

Blood pressure (BP) is normally measured on the upper arm, but occasionally this is not possible. The presence of fractures, wounds, vascular access devices and shunts, morbid obesity, surgical procedures, lymphoedema, limb deformities (phocomelia) and amputations may prevent the satisfactory cuff placement around the upper arm. In addition, BP measurement may be inaccurate in the presence of bilateral subclavian artery stenoses such as can occur with Takayasu's arteritis or atherosclerosis. In these circumstances, measurement of BP in the leg may be necessary. It is important to recognise, however, that BP measurements in the arm may differ from those in the legs.

A recent systematic review examined the relationship between supine BP measurements in the arm and leg. A review of 44 studies involving 9771 patients concluded that ankle systolic BP was on average 17.0 mmHg (95% CI 15.4–21.3 mmHg) higher than arm systolic BP, whilst there was no difference in diastolic BP in the general population. These findings suggest that a threshold of ≥ 155/90 mmHg could be used for diagnosing hypertension in routine practice when only ankle measurements are available. This threshold is conservative and would ensure maximum sensitivity to detect hypertension at the expense of some specificity.

It should be noted that the review found much lower leg pressures in the presence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The proposed threshold should therefore be used with caution, and patients with low ankle BPs in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. diabetes, renal disease and existing cardiovascular disease) should be considered for further investigation, especially if there is a history of intermittent claudication or clinical evidence of PVD (e.g. femoral arterial bruits, poor or absent foot pulses, poor distal skin perfusion, cold peripheries or arterial ulceration). In such cases, arterial Doppler ultrasonography, CT or MR angiography can be used to confirm significant PVD which may invalidate the use of ankle BP as a surrogate for arm BP. PVD may be worse in one leg compared with the other, so ankle BPs should be taken in both legs where this is suspected.

### Arterial reservoir characteristics and central-to-peripheral blood pressure amplification in the human upper limb [^1139U2Jt]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Arterial reservoir characteristics are related to blood pressure (BP) and independently predict cardiovascular events. It is unknown if arterial reservoir characteristics are modified from the central-to-peripheral large arteries and whether there is a contributory role to BP amplification. The aim of this study was to assess central-to-peripheral changes in arterial reservoir characteristics and determine associations with BP.

Methods

Reservoir pressure (RP) and excess pressure (XSP) were derived from intra-arterial BP waveforms among 51 participants (aged 63 ± 13 years, 63% men) undergoing clinically indicated cardiac angiography. BP waveforms were recorded in the ascending aorta, brachial (mid-humerus) and radial (wrist) arteries via catheter pull-back.

Results

There was no significant difference in RP between arterial sites (54 ± 15, 53 ± 15 and 52 ± 17mmHg for the aorta, brachial and radial artery, respectively; P = 0.68). Conversely, XSP increased stepwise from the aorta to the brachial and radial arteries (24 ± 11, 42 ± 14 and 53 ± 16mmHg; P < 0.001), as did SBP (134 ± 18, 141 ± 16 and 146 ± 19mmHg; P = 0.004). There were highly significant associations between RP and SBP at all arterial sites (r = 0.821, 0.649 and 0.708; P < 0.001 for all), but the strength of associations between peak XSP and SBP increased significantly from the aorta to the radial artery (r = 0.121 and 0.508; z = 3.04; P = 0.004).

Conclusion

Arterial reservoir characteristics are modified through the large arteries of the upper limb. Although RP remains relatively constant, XSP increases significantly and is highly related to BP (SBP and pulse pressure) amplification. These data provide a new understanding on arterial reservoir characteristics and large-artery BP physiology.

Spinal cord injury

In endurance athletes with an SCI V̇O 2peak is 15%–60% lower than their able-bodied counterparts due to lower active muscle mass when exercising with the upper body only and due to cardiorespiratory limitations. Active muscle mass and cardiorespiratory function are increasingly affected by higher levels of the SCI. More specifically, athletes with a motor and sensory complete SCI at the Th6 level or above lack sympathetic innervation of the lower extremities and organs. This leads to a lack of vasoconstriction, which reduces blood redistribution to the active musculature. Furthermore, in athletes with tetraplegia, sympathetic innervation of the heart is affected, which may cause lower blood pressure and a lack of increase in heart rate during training and competitions. In line with the lower V̇O 2peak, the V̇O 2 at the anaerobic threshold is also lower in athletes with SCI due to exercising with a lower active muscle mass of the upper body. Accordingly, exercise efficiency was lower during upper- compared with lower-body exercise. However, exercise efficiency during upper-body exercise was not different in athletes with SCI compared with their able-bodied counterparts, that is, athletes with an SCI produced lower power output but also used proportionally less V̇O 2. While higher blood lactate concentration (BLa) values were found at a given speed or perceived exertion during upper- compared with lower-body exercise, BLa clearance after exercise during upper-body exercise was similar for athletes with and without an SCI. Sport-specific demands in athletes with SCI may also be negatively affected by overuse injuries to the shoulder, osteoporosis, pressure ulcers, impaired thermoregulation and neuropathic pain, factors that are presented more specifically in table 1.

### The difference in blood pressure readings between arms and survival: primary care cohort study [^116A1BSw]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with existing literature

Prevalence of an interarm difference in blood pressure varies with the population studied and tends to be higher in the presence of hypertension. Whether this reflects a truly higher prevalence or is merely a function of higher achievement of an arbitrary cut-off point where absolute values are increased is unclear, but the prevalence values reported here are consistent with our previous meta-analysis of similar cohorts measured with robust techniques.

Some previous series have suggested a bias towards higher readings from the right arm, whereas others have failed to show this; studies looking specifically at left or right handedness have also failed to show an association with the arm producing the higher reading. This study has not found a consistent bias to one side for interarm differences in either systolic or diastolic blood pressures, and shows that measurement using both arms at initial assessment is required to avoid future underestimation of blood pressure owing to an unrecognised difference between arms. In fact the direction of mean differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressures was opposite, in keeping with some other reported series, and we suggest this may be related to differing pulse pressures along the aorta. Current guidance suggests that an interarm difference of less than 10 mm Hg can be considered to be normal and that differences of 20/10 mm Hg or more warrant specialist referral. Previous studies have proposed a normal range for differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressure of up to 10 mm Hgand it has been argued from other cross sectional series that the high prevalence of differences above these cut-off points implies that this is a physiological rather than a pathological finding. Our recent meta-analysis has, however, shown that an interarm difference in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more or 15 mm Hg or more is associated with peripheral vascular disease in cross sectional studies, with a pooled risk ratio of 2.4 or 2.5, respectively. Peripheral vascular disease is recognised as a risk factor for future cardiovascular events and mortality, and we have previously proposed that an interarm difference in blood pressure is due to peripheral vascular disease. An interarm difference in systolic blood pressure of 15 mm Hg or more is associated with angiographic evidence of carotid or aortic artery disease, and vascular disease of the arms is associated with hypertension. Thus evidence supports the association of an interarm difference with existing peripheral vascular disease, and we propose that this accounts for the survival differences seen.

### Pediatric pulmonary hypertension: guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society [^111tp8XA]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn — clinical diagnosis and general care specify that clinical manifestations include labile oxygenation, differential saturation with higher Spo2 in the right upper extremity compared with a lower extremity, or profound hypoxemia despite oxygen and mechanical ventilation; these findings are not specific for PPHN, and echocardiography is required to exclude CHD and thus establish the diagnosis while also determining whether LV dysfunction is present. Management includes optimization of lung volume and function, oxygen delivery, and support of cardiac function; systemic blood pressure should be maintained at normal levels for age with volume and cardiotonic therapy, whereas increasing blood pressure to supraphysiological levels solely to drive a left-to-right shunt across the PDA may transiently improve oxygenation but will not reduce PVR and should be avoided. Oxygen is commonly used, but extreme hyperoxia (Fio2 > 0.6) may be ineffective and may aggravate lung injury; poor lung expansion will exacerbate PPHN, exogenous surfactant may improve lung expansion and reverse PPHN in significant parenchymal disease but did not reduce ECMO use and carries a risk for acute airway obstruction, therefore the use of surfactant should be considered only for infants with severe parenchymal lung disease and poor lung recruitment. Acidosis can induce pulmonary vasoconstriction and should be avoided; forced alkalosis induced by hyperventilation or infusion of sodium bicarbonate yields transient improvements in Pao2 without demonstrated long-term benefit.

Coarctation of the aorta — In adults with coarctation of the aorta (CoA), intracranial aneurysm occurs in approximately 10% and abnormal exercise blood pressure responses are common after repair, with up to 80% showing elevated upper extremity exercise blood pressure; restenosis may be suggested by increased peak exercise blood pressure, increased upper-to-lower extremity gradient with exercise, and increased Doppler velocity across the coarctation during exercise transthoracic echocardiography. Significant native or recurrent coarctation is defined as follows: upper extremity/lower extremity resting peak-to-peak gradient ≥ 20 mm Hg or mean Doppler systolic gradient ≥ 20 mm Hg; upper extremity/lower extremity gradient > 10 mm Hg or mean Doppler gradient > 10 mm Hg plus either decreased LV systolic function or AR; or upper extremity/lower extremity gradient > 10 mm Hg or mean Doppler gradient > 10 mm Hg with collateral flow, and this should be coupled with anatomic evidence for CoA, typically by advanced imaging. The best evidence to proceed with intervention for CoA includes systemic hypertension, upper extremity/lower extremity blood pressure gradient and echocardiography Doppler gradient as defined above, and anatomic evidence of CoA. Long-term complications are generally related to chronic upper body systemic hypertension; therefore, systemic hypertension should be identified by resting, ambulatory, or exercise blood pressure assessment and medical treatment should follow GDMT. Balloon angioplasty alone is associated with a higher rate of intimal tears and aneurysm formation compared with stent placement.

### Which physiological mechanism is responsible for the increase in blood pressure during leg crossing? [^113b4xaJ]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine which physiological mechanism is responsible for the blood pressure increase during leg crossing at knee-level in the sitting position.

Methods

Finger blood pressure was measured with the Finometer in 102 participants (47 men) before and during leg crossing: 24 treated hypertensive patients, 50 diabetic individuals (25 with and 25 without antihypertensive medication) and 28 healthy volunteers. Mean age, 53 ± 15 years (range 21–82 years). All participants crossed their legs at knee-level, with the upper part of the popliteal fossa on the suprapatellar bursa, in the sitting position. Differences in mean blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate and total peripheral resistance were assessed with legs crossed versus legs uncrossed.

Results

Mean blood pressure [+3.3 ± 5.5 mmHg; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.7–3.8], stroke volume (+7.6 ± 5.4 ml; 95% CI = 6.7–8.6) and cardiac output (+0.4 ± 0.9 l/min; 95% CI = 0.3–0.5) were significantly higher with legs crossed than in the uncrossed position, while the heart rate (-1.8 ± 3.9 beats/min; 95% CI = -2.2 to -1.4) was significantly lower. Total peripheral resistance did not differ significantly (-0.01 ± 0.16 AU; 95% CI = -0.03 to 0.00). The largest differences occurred in the hypertensive diabetic individuals, the smallest in the healthy volunteers. The changes were similar in men and women. There were no significant correlations in the total group between the differences of the hemodynamic variables and sex, age, body mass index or leg circumference.

Conclusion

The study shows that higher blood pressure with legs in the crossed position is due to higher cardiac output and not to a higher total peripheral resistance.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^1122izTf]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Stage 1 hypertension (HTN) management in children and adolescents: If the BP reading is at the stage 1 HTN level and the patient is asymptomatic, provide lifestyle counseling and recheck the BP in 1 to 2 weeks by auscultation. If the BP reading is still at the stage 1 level, upper and lower extremity BP should be checked (right arm, left arm, and 1 leg), and BP should be rechecked in 3 months by auscultation; nutrition and/or weight management referral should be considered as appropriate. If BP continues to be at the stage 1 HTN level after 3 visits, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) should be ordered (if available), diagnostic evaluation should be conducted, treatment should be initiated, and subspecialty referral should be considered.

### Artificial intelligence-based, non-invasive assessment of the central aortic pressure in adults after operative or interventional treatment of aortic coarctation [^1168cWEe]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

The brachial pulse pressure was 63.2 ± 13.8 mm Hg (ranging from 36 to 112 mm Hg).

The lateral difference at the arms, which may be attributed to variations in vascular anatomy at the origin of the brachial arteries, a difference in preferential flow and/or differences in the type and efficacy of the surgical and/or interventional treatments, was 12.4 ± 17.3 mm Hg (ranging from 33 to 55 mm Hg) (table 4).

Table 4
Peripheral blood pressure values

Only in two patients, the blood pressure at the upper extremities was > 20 mm Hg higher compared with the lower extremities, potentially indicating a clinically relevant re-CoA, with a blood pressure difference of 33 mm Hg (149 vs 116 mm Hg) and 22 mm Hg (134 mm Hg vs 112 mm Hg) in respective cases.

In the CABP measurement in AI-PWA, the central SBP based on the radial pulse pressure curves with the higher pressure averaged 114.3 ± 15.8 mm Hg (ranging from 91 to 154 mm Hg). The aortic pulse pressure was 42.9 ± 16.2 mm Hg (ranging from 21 to 95 mm Hg), and when deriving CABP from both arms, the calculated aortic difference at the arms was 5.7 ± 7.5 mm Hg (ranging from 0 to 41) mm Hg (table 5).

Table 5
Central (aortic) blood pressure values and AI-pulse wave parameters

According to the systolic CABP in AI-PWA, a total of four patients were classified as hypertensive (figure 1).

The central diastolic CABP in AI-PWA was 74.3 ± 11.0 mm Hg, with four patients having a DBP above 90 mm Hg.

The CABP, derived from the radial pulse pressure curves with higher pressure, was up to 44 mm Hg lower than the brachial PBP with the higher value (p < 0.001), with an average difference of 21.1 ± 11.6 mm Hg (p < 0.001).

### Influence of age on upper arm cuff blood pressure measurement across the lifespan [^113TMUyg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
The difference between cuff and invasive aortic blood pressure across age.

The y axes represent systolic blood pressure (SBP; A), diastolic blood pressure (DBP; B), and pulse pressure (PP; C); and the x axes represent age (in years). The solid lines are estimated marginal means from linear mixed models, and the ribbons are the associated 95% CIs. The dashed lines are 0 reference lines.

This is the first study to reveal sizable and systematic associations between age and the accuracy of cuff SBP, DBP, and PP compared with invasive aortic measurements over an age group covering the lifespan.

The findings may draw into question the true (intra‐arterial) pattern of BP that occurs over the human life course. This potentially affects all aspects of clinical BP epidemiology, including guideline thresholds, global hypertension prevalence, and control rates. As an example, we speculate that cuff SBP overestimation in younger age groups may contribute to greater prevalence of high BP than actually exists. Conversely, in older age groups, cuff underestimation of SBP and overestimation of DBP suggest that there would be a higher prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension than appreciated from cuff measurements, even though this is already the dominant subtype of high BP in elderly people. However, it is important to highlight that among people of middle age in particular, the average cuff SBP was similar to invasive SBP. Moreover, because hypertension thresholds are based on decades of clinical trial evidence from cuff BP, this remains the clinical standard by which treatment decisions are made, irrespective of intra‐arterial BP. There are some limitations. The data were collated from multiple research sites retrospectively; thus, data collection procedures were not standardized. However, strict criteria were used to ensure only high‐quality BP measurement data were included. There were a small number of younger participants and only one‐third were women; thus, the findings may not be generalizable to these groups. Some cuff devices were not validated, and study sites used different invasive BP methods, which could contribute to variability in the findings. However, sensitivity analyses from previous studies showed no major differences in accuracy findings based on these variables.

In conclusion, the accuracy of cuff BP compared with intra‐arterial BP varies through the lifespan. Efforts to improve accuracy should be prioritized with the goal of better management of hypertension to reduce potentially avoidable cardiovascular disease events.

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^116ikjMa]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure assessment in peripheral artery disease — Patients with PAD should undergo noninvasive blood pressure measurement in both arms at least once during the initial assessment. Measuring blood pressure in both arms identifies the arm with the highest systolic pressure, a requirement for accurate measurement of the ABI. An inter-arm blood pressure difference of > 15 to 20 mm Hg is abnormal and suggestive of subclavian (or innominate) artery stenosis, and patients with PAD are at increased risk of subclavian artery stenosis. Although a difference in arm systolic pressures of > 15 to 20 mm Hg suggests subclavian (or innominate) artery stenosis, in the absence of symptoms (e.g., arm claudication or symptoms of vertebral artery steal), no further imaging or intervention is warranted.

### Lower-extremity arterial stiffness vs. aortic stiffness in the general population [^112RibpQ]. Hypertension Research (2013). Low credibility.

While determinants of aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) are well known, much less is known about factors affecting lower-extremity pulse wave velocity (lePWV). Unlike aPWV, increased lePWV does not predict cardiovascular risk, but limits lower-extremity blood flow and is associated with increased left ventricular mass. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of cardiovascular risk factors on aPWV and lePWV. A total of 911 individuals from the Czech post-MONICA study (a randomly selected 1% representative population sample, mean age 54 ± 13.5 years, 47% men) were examined. Pulse wave velocity was measured using the SphygmoCor device. Aging had a large effect on aPWV, but only a small effect on lePWV. After adjustment for covariates, we observed that hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and dyslipidemia were positively and significantly associated with aPWV. However, only hypertension had a significant effect on lePWV. Increased ankle systolic blood pressure was associated with increased aPWV independently of brachial blood pressure. Ankle systolic blood pressure was more closely related to aPWV than lePWV. Subjects with an ankle-brachial index < 1.0 had higher aPWV and lower lePWV compared with individuals with a normal ankle-brachial index. Lower-extremity arterial stiffness is affected by age and cardiovascular risk factors to a lesser extent than aortic stiffness. Increased ankle systolic blood pressure is linked not only to increased lower-extremity arterial stiffness, but also increased aortic stiffness. In subjects with a low ankle-brachial index, lower-extremity arterial stiffness is spuriously decreased.

### Role of vascular adaptation in determining systolic blood pressure in young adults [^114ufibD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Two individuals can have a similar pulse pressure (PP) but different levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP), although the underlying mechanisms have not been described. We hypothesized that, for a given level of PP, differences in SBP relate to peripheral vascular resistance (PVR); and we tested this hypothesis in a large cohort of healthy young adults. Methods and Results Demographic, biochemical, and hemodynamic data from 3103 subjects were available for the current analyses. In both men and women, for a given level of PP, higher SBP was associated with significantly higher body weight, body mass index, heart rate, and PVR (P < 0.05 versus those with lower BP for all comparisons). Moreover, stratifying individuals by quartiles of PP and PVR revealed a stepwise increase in SBP from the lowest to highest quartile for each variable, with the highest SBP occurring in those in the highest quartile of both PP and PVR (P < 0.001 for overall trend for both sexes). PVR was also increased with increasing tertile of minimum forearm vascular resistance, in both men (P = 0.002) and women (P = 0.03). Conclusions Increased PVR, mediated in part through altered resistance vessel structure, strongly associates with the elevation of SBP for a given level of PP in young adults. An impaired ability to adapt PVR appropriately to a given level of PP may be an important mechanism underlying elevated SBP in young adults.

The femoral artery is the largest artery used for arterial catheter placement, and the complication rate of arterial catheter placement in the femoral artery is comparable to those of other sites. The femoral artery is best palpated just below the midpoint of the inguinal ligament with the patient lying supine and the patient's leg being extended, slightly abducted, and externally rotated. Puncture of the femoral artery should be performed distally to the inguinal ligament to minimize the risk of hemorrhage into the pelvis or retroperitoneum.

The axillary artery is the only alternative to the femoral artery for central BP measurement. In some situations, the axillary artery may be preferred over the femoral artery (e.g. obesity, ilio-femoral vascular disease, and lower extremity edema). The axillary artery can be palpated best when the arm is abducted and externally rotated. The cannulation site should be as high into the apex of the axilla as possible.

The morphology of the BP waveform changes when the BP wave moves from the aorta to a more peripheral artery due to pulse wave amplification phenomena. In the periphery, the BP waveform shows a higher systolic BP, a steeper slope of the systolic upstroke, a lower diastolic BP, and a lower and later dicrotic notch compared to BP waveforms recoded at the aortic root. The decrease in diastolic BP is less pronounced than the increase in systolic BP.

Step 2: Choosing the type of arterial catheter

The choice of the type of the arterial catheter depends on several factors, including the artery to be cannulated and expected cannulation problems.

The catheter length should be chosen primarily depending on the cannulation site. When using the brachial, femoral, or axillary artery, a longer catheter is recommended because of the distance between the surface of the skin and the lumen of the artery; using longer arterial catheters reduces the risk of dislocation. The length and inner diameter of the catheter influence the damping properties of the BP measurement system (for details regarding the dynamic response of the pressure transducer, see step 5). Twenty gauge catheters have been shown to be less affected by underdamping than 18-G catheters and can be generally recommended for radial cannulation. Complications occur less often with 20-G catheters compared to larger catheters.

In difficult situations (e.g. edema, vascular sclerosis, obesity, cannulation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation) or after unsuccessful direct puncture, a separate or integral guidewire approach is recommended, as it is the technique with the highest success rates.

Perioperative recommendations — blood pressure and beach chair positioning: (1) While no specific thresholds are recommended to reduce stroke risk, an effect of relative hypotension cannot be excluded based on current evidence (Level B-NR, Class IIb). (2) For surgery in the beach chair position, blood pressure measurement should be performed on the nonoperative upper arm (as opposed to lower extremity) and consideration should be given to the blood pressure gradient between the brachial artery and brain (Level C-LD, Class I). (3) Induced hypotension for shoulder surgery in the beach chair position should always be approached with caution, especially in patients at risk for stroke (Level C-LD, Class I).

Patient management on the basis of office BP — normal and elevated blood pressure: If BP is normal or normalizes after repeat readings (ie, BP < 90th percentile), then no additional action is needed, and practitioners should measure the BP at the next routine well-child care visit. If the BP reading is at the elevated BP level, lifestyle interventions should be recommended (healthy diet, sleep, and physical activity), the measurement should be repeated in 6 months by auscultation, and nutrition and/or weight management referral should be considered as appropriate. If BP remains at the elevated BP level after 6 months, upper and lower extremity BP should be checked (right arm, left arm, and 1 leg), and lifestyle counseling should be repeated.

Blood pressure targets and outcomes in PAD — evidence context: SPRINT found that an aggressive SBP target of < 120 mm Hg, compared with standard treatment (SBP target of < 140 mm Hg), in patients with known cardiovascular disease reduced rates of cardiovascular outcomes and associated mortality, though only a small subset had PAD. In ABCD, among participants with PAD (defined as ankle-brachial index [ABI] < 0.90), intensive blood pressure control (mean blood pressure, 128/75 mm Hg) was associated with a reduction in MACE compared with moderate control (mean blood pressure, 137/81 mm Hg). Recommended blood pressure goals for patients with PAD are stated to be consistent with the 2017 ACC/AHA high blood pressure guideline.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) clinical evaluation — vascular examination includes palpation of lower extremity pulses, auscultation for femoral bruits, and inspection of the legs and feet; pulses are rated 0, absent; 1, diminished; 2, normal; or 3, bounding. Patients with confirmed PAD are at increased risk for subclavian artery stenosis, and an inter-arm blood pressure difference of > 15 to 20 mm Hg is abnormal; measuring blood pressure in both arms identifies the arm with the highest systolic pressure, a requirement for accurate measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI). To confirm the diagnosis of PAD, abnormal physical examination findings must be confirmed with diagnostic testing, generally with the ABI as the initial test.

Pediatric hypertension — physical examination and history suggesting secondary causes or end-organ damage are organized by system, with representative examples as follows: Vital signs such as "Tachycardia" may indicate "Hyperthyroidism, PCC, [or] Neuroblastoma", and vascular findings like "Decreased lower extremity pulses; drop in BP from upper to lower extremities" suggest "Coarctation of the aorta". Ocular findings of "Retinal changes" are noted as "Severe HTN, more likely to be associated with secondary HTN". Characteristic head and neck features include "Elfin facies" linked to "Williams syndrome" and "Webbed neck" linked to "Turner syndrome". Skin findings include "Café-au-lait spots" pointing to "Neurofibromatosis" and "Acanthosis nigricans" associated with "T2DM". Cardiac examination may reveal "Apical heave" consistent with "LVH", while abdominal auscultation of an "Epigastric, flank bruit" suggests "RAS". Genitourinary history of "Ambiguous or virilized genitalia" indicates "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia". Extremity symptoms of "Muscle weakness" may reflect "Hyperaldosteronism, Liddle syndrome, [or] Reninoma", and neurologic/metabolic symptoms such as "Hypokalemia, headache, dizziness, polyuria, nocturia" point to "Monogenic HTN (Liddle syndrome, GRA, AME)".

Blood pressure management in noncardiac surgery — associations with perioperative stroke are mixed. Hsieh et al found no association between intraoperative hypotension and perioperative stroke; hypotension was defined as the time-integrated area under a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 70 mm Hg with both depth and duration of MAP < 70 mm Hg measured, and median exposure was 19 (4, 55) mm Hg-minutes in cases versus 19 (6, 48) mm Hg-minutes in controls. Sensitivity analyses with lower MAP thresholds (eg, 65, 60 mm Hg) also demonstrated no association with stroke. In a broad noncardiac, non-neurosurgical population (> 48,000 patients), time with MAP > 30% below baseline was associated with postoperative stroke (OR = 1.013/min hypotension, 99.9% CI: 1.001–1.025), whereas no other threshold studied, including time with MAP > 40% below baseline, was associated with stroke, and routine intraoperative blood pressures (ie, MAPs ≥ 60 to 70 mm Hg) are unlikely to be a major driver of overt perioperative stroke. In the beach chair context, blood pressure measurement should account for an upper extremity–brain gradient, such that MAP may be 12 to 24 mm Hg lower in the brainstem than the nonoperative upper extremity.

### A difference in systolic blood pressure between arms and between lower limbs is a novel risk marker for diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113HmGaV]. Hypertension Research (2013). Low credibility.

Recent studies have demonstrated that a difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between arms is associated with both vascular disease and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between a difference in SBP between arms and between lower limbs and the degree of albuminuria, which is an established marker for cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes. We measured blood pressure in the arms and lower limbs of 314 consecutive patients with Type 2 diabetes, and we calculated a difference in SBP between arms and between lower limbs. We then evaluated the relationship of the difference in SBP between arms and between lower limbs to the degree of urinary albumin excretion (UAE). The average difference in SBP between arms and between lower limbs was 3.52 ± 3.94 and 9.66 ± 14.1mmHg, respectively. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that a difference in SBP between arms (β = 0.172, P = 0.0239) and between lower limbs (β = 0.238, P = 0.0033) independently correlated with the logarithm of the UAE. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that a difference in SBP of 10mmHg between arms (odds ratio 12.23 (95% CI 1.130–132.35), P < 0.0393) and a difference in SBP of 15mmHg between lower limbs (odds ratio 4.291 (95% CI 1.403–13.123), P < 0.0106) correlated with the risk of albuminuria. A difference in SBP between arms and between lower limbs, therefore, could be a novel risk marker for diabetic nephropathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

### Inter-arm blood pressure difference, when is it a useful risk marker for cardiovascular events? [^112TqfL9]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

In a linked paper Nolde et al. consider whether IAD could also be useful for the stratification of higher-risk groups. They examined the associations of IAD with vascular target organ damage in 199 patients recruited from a tertiary hypertension outpatient clinic; carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was adopted as a surrogate marker of hypertension-mediated vascular organ damage. In this selected cohort, they were unable to show a cross-sectional relationship between IAD and PWV. Further analyses also failed to find an association of IAD with either absolute blood pressure (BP) levels or BP variability.

PWV provides a quantitative assessment of arterial stiffening and is a recognised risk marker for cardiovascular events. The aetiology of an IAD is not clearly established; initially regarded as subclavian stenosis on the side of the lower reading arm, to date there has been a paucity of evidence to support such an association in the absence of substantial (i.e. ≥ 35 mmHg) systolic BP differences between arms. There is a growing body of evidence to associate IAD with elevated arterial stiffness manifested as increased PWV and/or pulse pressure. It seems likely that IAD is largely, if not fully, mediated by asymmetries in arterial stiffness, and that this pathophysiology underlies the independent associations of IAD with cardiovascular risk. In truth, it is probable that both stenoses and stiffening of arteries make contributions to the phenomenon of IAD and since both pathologies share common underlying causes the distinction is, perhaps, somewhat academic. We have previously observed that substantial sample sizes, probably in excess of 1000 for carotid-femoral PWV and higher for brachial-ankle PWV, are required before cross-sectional associations with an IAD can be reliably demonstrated. Thus, the numbers examined by Nolde et al. may have been underpowered in their ability to demonstrate a true relationship, and restriction to dichotomous rather than continuous analysis may have further compounded this.

### The cardiovascular effects of upper-limb aerobic exercise in hypertensive patients [^115fS8ER]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Aerobic exercise is broadly recommended as a helpful adjunct to obtain blood pressure control in hypertension. Several hypertensive patients, however, are limited by musculoskeletal complaints or vascular occlusive disease from lower-limb exercise such as jogging or cycling. In the present randomized-controlled study, we evaluate whether an aerobic arm-cycling program provides a measurable cardiovascular benefit.

Methods

Twenty-four probands were randomly assigned to sedentary activity or a heart rate controlled 12 week exercise program, consisting of arm-cycling at target lactate concentrations of 2.0 ± 0.5 mmol/l. Endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery. Augmentation index and large/small artery compliance (C(1) and C(2)) were measured by computerized pulse-wave analysis of the radial artery.

Results

The exercise program led to a significant reduction in systolic (134.0 ± 20.0 to 127.0 ± 16.4 mmHg; P = 0.03) and diastolic blood pressure (73.0 ± 21.6 to 67.1 ± 8.2 mmHg; P = 0.02) accompanied by a significant improvement in C(2) (3.5 ± 1.6 to 4.8 ± 2.0 ml/mmHg x 100; P = 0.004). Flow-mediated dilation, augmentation index, and C(2) were not significantly affected (P > 0.05). Physical performance as derived from lactate and heart rate curves of lower-limb stress tests was unchanged, whereas maximal workload in an upper-limb ergometry significantly increased (P = 0.005). Blood pressure and vascular parameters remained unchanged in the control group.

Conclusion

Regular arm aerobic exercise leads to a marked reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and an improvement in small artery compliance. Arm-cycling is a reasonable option for hypertensive patients who want to support blood pressure control by sports despite having coxarthrosis, gonarthrosis, or intermittent claudication.

### Central blood pressure in the management of hypertension: soon reaching the goal? [^113ti3mn]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) is conventionally measured by cuff at the brachial artery as an indication of pressure experienced by the organs. However, individual variation in pulse pressure amplification means that brachial cuff BP may be a poor representation of true central BP. Estimation of central BP is now possible using non-invasive methods that are amenable for widespread use. This paper reviews the evidence regarding the potential value of central BP in hypertension management. The major lines of evidence that support the use of central BP as a clinical tool include the: (1) major discrepancies in central BP among people with similar brachial BP; (2) independent relationship of central BP with end-organ damage; (3) independent relationship of central BP with cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality; (4) differential central and brachial BP responses to antihypertensive medications and; (5) improvements in end-organ damage after therapy more strongly relate to central than brachial BP. Despite all this, important evidence gaps relating to clinical use of central BP need fulfilling. These include the lack of central BP reference values and randomized, controlled studies to determine if: (1) central BP can help with diagnostic/therapeutic decisions and; (2) CV outcome is improved by targeting therapy towards lowering central BP levels. Additional challenges such as standardization of central BP methods, and understanding which patients are most likely to benefit from central BP monitoring also need to be determined. Overall, the future for central BP as a worthwhile clinical instrument appears positive, but there is much to be done.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement and diagnostic performance: The resting ABI is measured in each leg using a blood pressure cuff and a Doppler device to detect blood flow and pressure in the pedal and the brachial arteries, and the ABI is the ratio of the higher systolic pressure in the ipsilateral dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries divided by the higher of the left and right brachial artery systolic pressures. In patients with symptoms of PAD, the resting ABI has a sensitivity of 69% to 79% and a specificity of 83% to 99% compared with imaging studies showing significant arterial stenoses, although the sensitivity is reduced in the presence of diabetes. As an adjunct to ABI, Doppler waveforms and/or plethysmographic PVR taken at the ankle can confirm concordance with the presence and severity of PAD and suggest the presence of noncompressible arteries in the setting of discordance.

### Angioplasty of flow-limiting stenosis reduces aortic and brachial blood pressure in patients with peripheral artery disease [^112RP6em]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Current prevention guidelines recommend a medical treatment for arterial hypertension in particular in patients with manifest cardiovascular disease. Although blood pressure (BP) control in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) reduces cardiovascular mortality, the management of risk factors, including BP, is often suboptimal in these patients. Only 30% to 50% of treated patients with PAD achieve adequate BP control.

Isolated systolic hypertension occurs in up to 90% of patients with PAD. It is now appreciated that wave reflection and arterial stiffness are important determinants of age‐related isolated systolic hypertension. In the context of PAD, arterial stenoses and occlusions may cause local reflection of the pulse wave increasing aortic augmentation and contribute to the development of isolated systolic hypertension. We have previously shown that peripheral arterial angioplasty acutely improves endothelium‐dependent flow‐mediated dilation and decreases local arterial stiffness associated with superficial femoral artery stenoses. Elimination of a proximal stenosis might affect wave reflection or shift it toward more distal sites in the lower limbs such as to the level of resistance arteries. However, the direct effect of peripheral arterial angioplasty on aortic blood pressure (aBP) and brachial blood pressure (bBP) has not been investigated to date. Therefore, we hypothesized that endovascular treatment of peripheral flow‐limiting arterial stenoses acutely reduces aBP and bBP.

Using serial and segmental invasive measurement of hemodynamics in the proximal to distal aorta in combination with vascular ultrasound, we demonstrate here for the first time that endovascular treatment of peripheral arterial stenoses through restitution of blood flow into the target leg significantly reduces aBP and bBP, improves augmentation index (AIx), whereas pulse wave velocity (PWV) remained unaffected. In a large prospective all‐comer registry of patients with PAD scheduled for endovascular treatment, these findings were corroborated with beneficial effects becoming more evident with higher systolic bBP and treatment of the more proximal lesion site.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^1116Up3C]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) physical examination — blood pressure (BP) measurement and coarctation clues: A complete physical examination may provide clues to potential secondary causes of HTN and assess possible hypertensive end organ damage, and poor growth may indicate an underlying chronic illness. At the second visit with confirmed elevated BP or stage 1 HTN or the first visit with confirmed stage 2 HTN, BP should be measured in both arms and in a leg. Normally, BP is 10 to 20 mm Hg higher in the legs than the arms; if the leg BP is lower than the arm BP, or if femoral pulses are weak or absent, coarctation of the aorta may be present, and obesity alone is an insufficient explanation for diminished femoral pulses in the presence of high BP. The physical examination in hypertensive children is frequently normal except for the BP elevation.

The suitability of alternative sites for non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement was investigated in 100 awake healthy volunteers.

There was a poor agreement between the different sites with respect to systolic blood pressure: the agreement was closer for diastolic and mean measurements. The mean blood pressure calf measurement was on average 4 mmHg (95% limits of agreement -12 to 20), higher than the arm. The ankle was 8 mmHg higher (-8 to 24) than the arm. ANOVA demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the discomfort scores between the sites (p < 0.001). The calf demonstrated the highest discomfort score and the ankle the lowest. We suggest that the ankle should be considered in preference to the calf as an alternative site for NIBP measurement if use of an arm is undesirable or impossible.

### Is tourniquet pain the result of increased compartment pressure in the forearm? [^112G8Y3f]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The pneumatic tourniquet has been a mainstay in upper extremity surgery by allowing the surgeon to operate in a blood-free field. Many upper extremity surgical procedures are done under local anesthesia or minimal sedation, and the problem of tourniquet pain is a vexing one. The question is posed: Is tourniquet pain the result of increased compartment pressure in the forearm? This study measured compartment pressures of the volar forearm in 10 healthy normotensive volunteers before inflation of a pneumatic tourniquet and compared it with pressure measurements taken while the tourniquet was still inflated after 15 minutes. Compartment pressures were measured using a Stryker needle manometer; all measurements were taken in the volar forearm by the senior author (C.H.M.). There was no increase in the volar/flexor compartment pressure of the forearm after 15 minutes of tourniquet inflation. All subjects complained of pain of the forearm, characteristically what is commonly called "tourniquet pain". We therefore conclude that in the upper extremity, at least for relatively short operating times, appropriate inflation of a tourniquet does not induce the early onset of increased compartment pressure in the forearm.

### Measurement of blood pressure in the leg-a statement on behalf of the British and Irish hypertension society [^112oSoaq]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Executive summary

Ankle blood pressure (BP) measurement is necessary for the diagnosis of hypertension where measurements are not possible due to medical conditions or limb deformities. Based on a recent review of the evidence, we recommend an ankle BP threshold of ≥ 155/90 mmHg to define high blood pressure in patients who do not have vascular disease. We recommend that ankle BP readings are taken with the subject lying down, using a validated automated device with the cuff placed around the ankle/lower calf.

Coarctation of the aorta — postrepair imaging, blood pressure assessment, and intracranial aneurysm considerations include that after successful transcatheter stenting or balloon angioplasty, follow-up CMR or CTA imaging is recommended to evaluate for long-term complications; patients with prior surgical patch repair are at increased aneurysm risk evaluable by CMR or CTA. Unoperated adults with CoA almost invariably have upper-extremity systemic arterial hypertension, and upper and lower extremity noninvasive blood pressure measurement is recommended in all patients; because hypertension may not be consistently identifiable at rest, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can be useful. Upper body systemic hypertension may be present in up to one third after intervention, and approximately 10% have intracranial aneurysms; providers and patients should be aware of management uncertainties when considering routine screening. Despite repair or transcatheter intervention, up to 80% exhibit an abnormally elevated upper extremity exercise blood pressure response, and restenosis may be suggested by increased peak exercise blood pressure, increased upper-to-lower extremity exercise gradient, and increased Doppler velocity across the coarctation during exercise TTE.

Coarctation of the aorta — diagnostic recommendations emphasize multimodality imaging and blood pressure assessment. Initial and follow-up aortic imaging using CMR or CTA is recommended in adults with coarctation of the aorta, including those who have had surgical or catheter intervention. Resting blood pressure should be measured in upper and lower extremities in all adults with coarctation of the aorta. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in adults with coarctation of the aorta can be useful for diagnosis and management of hypertension. Screening for intracranial aneurysms by magnetic resonance angiography or CTA may be reasonable in adults with coarctation of the aorta, and exercise testing to evaluate for exercise-induced hypertension may be reasonable in adults with coarctation of the aorta who exercise.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lower extremity arterial injury, more specifically with respect to physical examination, AAST/WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain ankle-brachial index and arterial pressure index as effective screening methods for detecting major arterial injury. Do not obtain additional imaging in patients with an ankle-brachial index/arterial pressure index of > 0.9.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta — clinical features and examination of unrepaired adults emphasize upper–lower extremity blood pressure differences, pulse delays, and characteristic murmurs. Hypertension is described in the right arm relative to the legs unless there is an anomalous right subclavian artery, and a pulse delay between the right arm and femoral or popliteal arteries may be present. Murmurs or bruits can be heard in the left interscapular area or over parasternal regions due to collaterals, and auscultation should assess for findings suggesting bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, or aortic regurgitation (AR).

### Extremity tourniquets raise blood pressure and maintain heart rate [^112gAuah]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Tourniquets have been modified and used for centuries to occlude blood flow to control hemorrhage. More recently, the occlusion of peripheral vessels has been linked to resultant increases in blood pressure, which may provide additional therapeutic potential, particularly during states of low cardiac output.

Objective

The objective of this study was to investigate a causal relationship between tourniquet application and blood pressure in healthy adults.

Methods

Healthy adult volunteers were recruited to participate in this IRB-approved study. Each participant met inclusion criteria and demonstrated baseline normotension. Brachial cuff blood pressure and heart rate were recorded pre- and post-tourniquet application to the bilateral legs.

Results

Twenty-seven adults aged 22 to 35 years participated and were included in analysis. The average systolic blood pressure was 122 ± 7 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure was 72 ± 9 mmHg, and heart rate was 70 ± 13 bpm. Following bilateral tourniquet application over the femoral vasculature, we observed a statistically significant increase in systolic (7 mmHg, p < 0.001) and diastolic (4 mmHg, p = 0.05) blood pressures with no significant change in heart rate (2 bpm, p > 0.05).

Conclusions

The elevations in systolic and diastolic blood pressures establish a dependent relationship between tourniquet application to the lower extremities and blood pressure elevation. These results may support new indications for tourniquet-use or extremity vessel occlusion in settings of hemodynamic instability.

### A comparison of blood pressure measurements in newborns [^1177b5Ea]. American Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Blood pressure monitoring is an essential component of neonatal intensive care. We compared invasive and noninvasive (Dinamap, Marquette, and Dash) recordings in newborns and also noninvasive values obtained from upper and lower limbs. Infants' blood pressure was recorded every 6 hours for 72 hours using three noninvasive devices and compared with invasive readings taken simultaneously. Twenty-five babies were enrolled in the study, with birth weights of 560 to 4500 g and gestation 24 + 1 to 40 + 5 weeks. Three hundred thirty-two recordings were obtained. Comparison between invasive and noninvasive readings revealed that all three noninvasive monitors overread mean blood pressure. There was no significant difference between the cuff recordings obtained from the upper or lower limbs. All three noninvasive devices overestimated mean blood pressure values compared with invasive monitoring. Clinicians may be falsely reassured by noninvasive monitoring. Mean blood pressure values obtained from the upper and lower limb are similar.
