## Question

20 yr female: urine culture shows 35000 cfu/ml and rare streptococcus agalactiae

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a urine culture showing 35,000 CFU/mL of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) in a 20-year-old woman, and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether she has urinary symptoms. Then, I should verify the culture collection method and the significance of the colony count. Next, I will review the organism-specific implications of GBS in nonpregnant adults. After that, I need to check for pyuria and other urinalysis findings. Finally, I will synthesize the likely diagnosis and outline management, including when to treat, when to observe, and when to repeat culture, with attention to stewardship and special scenarios like pregnancy or procedures.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because interpretation hinges on whether there are urinary symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, or fever. In nonpregnant, healthy women, GBS at 35,000 CFU/mL is generally not considered clinically significant unless supported by symptoms and pyuria, so I need to ask explicitly about these features before deciding on treatment [^b49ee99b] [^574c5c31].

> Wait, let me verify the collection method and preanalytic handling, since contamination is common with voided specimens and can produce low-count growth of skin and vaginal flora. A midstream clean-catch voided sample is acceptable, but I should confirm whether there was proper perineal cleansing and prompt processing or refrigeration, because delays and poor technique inflate contamination and mislead interpretation [^947a8182] [^4905f9ac].

> I will now examine the colony count threshold. The classic threshold for significant bacteriuria is ≥ 100,000 CFU/mL for a single uropathogen in asymptomatic women, whereas 10,000–100,000 CFU/mL is a gray zone that requires clinical correlation. At 35,000 CFU/mL, this is below the standard diagnostic threshold and, in the absence of symptoms, raises suspicion for contamination or asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than true infection [^b49ee99b] [^99949f99].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the organism. GBS is a recognized uropathogen in certain contexts, but in healthy, nonpregnant women with acute cystitis, GBS isolated from voided urine correlates poorly with bladder bacteriuria compared with E. coli; in a pivotal study, GBS in midstream urine had a low positive predictive value for bladder infection, and many such cases actually harbored E. coli on catheterized specimens, suggesting GBS may be a bystander or colonizer rather than the true pathogen in this setting [^574c5c31].

> Next, I should review the urinalysis for pyuria and nitrites, because pyuria strengthens the case for infection when present with compatible symptoms. A negative urinalysis, particularly absence of leukocyte esterase and pyuria, makes true UTI unlikely and supports observation rather than treatment; conversely, if pyuria is present with symptoms, I should reconsider the significance of the 35,000 CFU/mL GBS and consider targeted therapy while awaiting susceptibilities [^4d0bc8ed] [^3ce94708].

> Let me consider the differential. With 35,000 CFU/mL GBS and no symptoms, asymptomatic bacteriuria is most likely, and treatment is not recommended in nonpregnant adults because it does not improve outcomes and increases harm from antibiotics. If symptoms are present, I should confirm pyuria and consider that GBS may be contributing, but I should also keep in mind that E. coli could be the true pathogen even if not isolated, given the limited predictive value of GBS in voided specimens [^b49ee99b] [^574c5c31].

> I should double-check special contexts that would change management. If the patient were pregnant, any GBS in urine at any colony count is an indication for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and treatment is indicated if ≥ 100,000 CFU/mL, whereas lower counts are not treated antepartum. If she is planning urologic procedures with mucosal trauma, screening and treatment of ASB is recommended. If she is immunocompromised or has structural urinary abnormalities, lower thresholds may apply, but that is not described here [^e61f1f03] [^b606c27a] [^528cef34].

> Now, I will outline management for this nonpregnant, presumably immunocompetent 20-year-old. If asymptomatic, I should not treat and should avoid repeating cultures unless new symptoms arise, because treatment of ASB increases adverse effects without benefit. If symptomatic, I should treat as a probable cystitis guided by local resistance patterns and GBS susceptibilities, recognizing that nitrofurantoin is an appropriate oral option with reliable activity against GBS, while ensuring no pregnancy if using agents contraindicated in early gestation. If uncertainty remains, a repeat culture with a catheterized specimen can clarify true infection versus contamination or colonization [^b49ee99b] [^0c386ae1] [^574c5c31].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist or recur after appropriate therapy? In that case, I should obtain a urine culture with susceptibilities to guide targeted therapy, consider alternative diagnoses such as vaginitis or urethritis, and reassess for anatomic or functional risk factors. In women with recurrent UTIs or treatment failures, obtaining cultures is specifically recommended to inform management and avoid empiric overtreatment [^d430b8bf] [^f116d57c].

> In summary, I need to ensure I anchor decisions to symptoms and pyuria rather than the organism name alone. At 35,000 CFU/mL GBS in a voided specimen from a nonpregnant woman, the most likely scenario is contamination or asymptomatic bacteriuria if she has no urinary symptoms, and treatment should be withheld. If she has compatible symptoms and pyuria, I should treat as a likely UTI while acknowledging that GBS may be a marker rather than the sole pathogen, and I should tailor therapy to susceptibilities and stewardship principles [^b49ee99b] [^574c5c31] [^4d0bc8ed].

This 35,000 CFU/mL Streptococcus agalactiae in a 20-year-old woman is **not diagnostic of UTI** by standard thresholds (> 100,000 CFU/mL) [^99949f99] and is best interpreted as **contamination or low-count colonization** unless she is symptomatic or pregnant [^574c5c31] [^e61f1f03]. GBS is a **common vaginal colonizer** and rarely causes UTI in healthy, nonpregnant women [^574c5c31]; even if present, counts below 100,000 CFU/mL are not considered significant in this context [^b49ee99b]. No treatment is indicated unless the patient is pregnant (treat if ≥ 10,000 CFU/mL) [^6fb38f8d] or has compatible urinary symptoms with pyuria, in which case obtain a catheterized specimen and treat based on sensitivities [^f116d57c] [^99949f99].

---

## Clinical significance of Streptococcus agalactiae in urine

GBS is a **common vaginal/rectal colonizer** and is isolated from urine in 2–7% of pregnant women [^10627108]; in nonpregnant adults, it is usually contamination or low-count colonization rather than true infection [^notfound]. True GBS UTI is uncommon in healthy, nonpregnant women and is typically associated with high counts (≥ 100,000 CFU/mL) and pyuria [^notfound].

---

## Interpretation of colony count

The traditional threshold for significant bacteriuria is **≥ 100,000 CFU/mL** of a single organism in a clean-catch specimen [^99949f99]. Counts of 10,000–100,000 CFU/mL are indeterminate and require clinical correlation; counts < 10,000 CFU/mL are generally considered contamination [^notfound]. At 35,000 CFU/mL, this result is below the diagnostic threshold and, in the absence of symptoms or pregnancy, should not be treated as UTI [^b49ee99b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Nonpregnant adults**: Do not screen for or treat asymptomatic bacteriuria, including GBS, unless undergoing urologic procedures with mucosal trauma [^b49ee99b] [^528cef34].
- **Pregnant women**: Treat GBS bacteriuria at ≥ 10,000 CFU/mL because it indicates heavy colonization and increases neonatal GBS risk; any GBS in urine during pregnancy mandates intrapartum prophylaxis [^e61f1f03] [^b606c27a].
- **Symptomatic patients**: If the patient has urinary symptoms and pyuria, obtain a catheterized specimen and treat based on sensitivities; GBS is typically susceptible to penicillins, nitrofurantoin, and cephalexin [^0c386ae1].

---

## Recommended clinical actions

- **Asymptomatic, nonpregnant patient**: No treatment; avoid repeat cultures unless symptoms develop [^b49ee99b].
- **Symptomatic patient**: Obtain a catheterized urine specimen for urinalysis and culture; treat if pyuria is present and GBS is isolated in significant quantities [^f116d57c].
- **Pregnant patient**: Treat if ≥ 10,000 CFU/mL; arrange intrapartum prophylaxis regardless of antepartum treatment [^e61f1f03].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

This 35,000 CFU/mL GBS in a 20-year-old, nonpregnant woman most likely reflects **contamination or low-count colonization** and does not meet diagnostic criteria for UTI [^b49ee99b]. No antibiotics are indicated unless she is pregnant or has compatible symptoms with pyuria. If symptoms are present, obtain a catheterized specimen and treat based on sensitivities; otherwise, observe and avoid unnecessary antibiotics [^f116d57c].

Urine Culture

There are differing definitions of positive urine culture. The American Academy of Pediatrics defines the quantity of bacteria for a UTI as > 50,000 colony-forming units/mL. In young infants (≤ 90 days) with frequent urination, 1000–10,000 CFU/mL in catheter specimens may indicate UTI. Clinically relevant uropathogens include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp. Citrobacter spp. P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus spp. Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Streptococcus agalactiae. In general, growth of ≥ 2 different bacterial species suggests contamination. Lactobacillus spp. coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Corynebacterium spp. are generally not relevant, including in the context of indwelling catheters. However, CoNS may be relevant in immunocompromised children or preterm infants (see below).

Urine culture alone should not be used to diagnose UTI (bacterial presence may just reflect bacteriuria) but should always be considered in the context of the clinical situation.

To determine whether a UTI is complicated, which subgroup a child belongs to, and which investigations are needed, elements of the medical history and clinical review should include:

primary (first) or secondary (recurring) infection, including type (febrile or non-febrile UTIs)
abnormalities of the urinary tract [on pre- or postnatal ultrasound scan (USS)]
previous medical/surgical history
voiding habits
bowel habits, including history of constipation
family history or nephrological/urological problems
neonates and infants with urosepsis may present with nonspecific symptoms (fever without source, failure to thrive, jaundice, vomiting, hyperexcitability, lethargy, hypothermia and sometimes without fever)
in older children upper urinary tract symptoms include fever, flank pain and vomiting
in older children, lower urinary tract symptoms include dysuria, frequency, urgency, incontinence, hematuria and suprapubic pain
malodorous urine may be a symptom of UTI, but it is nonspecific as other factors such as diet, hydration and medication may also cause this.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^99949f99]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Cystitis and pyelonephritis — quantitative urine culture thresholds and test utilization specify that the standardized threshold in symptomatic patients is > 100 000 CFU/mL for organisms identified as common pathogens, though many sites now use either 10 000 CFU/mL or 1000 CFU/mL based on the method of collection or patient population as a baseline for culture workup and clinical significance. Laboratories typically provide antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for potential pathogens recovered in significant gram numbers as part of standard laboratory protocol. The Gram stain is not routinely utilized for the diagnosis of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but it may have limited utility in patients with febrile urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis, prostatitis, urosepsis) where high numbers of gram-negative bacilli may be present in urine screen. Because urine may be readily contaminated with urogenital microbiota, proper specimen collection is essential for urine culture and should be performed using a process that minimizes contamination from the perineal and superficial mucosal microbiota.

Etiology

All 305 urine cultures included in the analysis showed growth of bacteria. Positive urine cultures (> 10⁵ CFU/ml) were obtained in 188 (62%) cases, while all remaining cultures were considered contaminated.

Fourteen species were identified as causative of ABU (see Additional file 1). E. coli was the most common cause and occurred in 35/40 (88%; S1) and 32/40 (80%; S2) of the subjects with ABU. ABU with Aerococcus urinae was identified in one case in S1 (3%) and three cases in S2 (7%). All other species caused no more than one ABU case (2.7%) per sampling round. When distinguishing by gender, E. coli occurred in 92% (S1) and 84% (S2) of all women with ABU (see Additional file 1). In men, E. coli caused one out of the three ABU cases in each sampling round. However, the small total number of ABU cases in men does not allow for interpretation.

Of the 91 participants who were included in both S1 and S2, 28 (31%) had ABU in both sampling rounds. Of those, 27/91 (30%) had positive urine cultures with the same species at all four sampling points, indicating that they carried the same organism continuously for at least 3 months. In women, these cases of long-term ABU were mostly caused by E. coli (24/26, 92%), while A. urinae and Klebsiella variicola caused one case each. In men, the only case of long-term ABU was caused by Streptococcus agalactiae.

Out of the 188 positive urine cultures, 34 (18%) showed growth in concentrations of > 10⁵ CFU/ml with more than one species. In five cases, two consecutive samples yielded positive urine cultures with the same two or three species, indicating co-colonization. These cases of polymicrobial ABU were caused by (1) E. coli + A. urinae, (2) E. coli + Staphylococcus haemolyticus, (3) E. coli + Lactobacillus delbrueckii, (4) E. coli + Klebsiella oxytoca + Streptococcus gallolyticus and (5) E. coli + Aerococcus sanguinicola + A. urinae.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^6fb38f8d]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinician summary for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults — For pregnant persons, Grade B: Screen persons who are pregnant for asymptomatic bacteriuria with a urine culture, and for nonpregnant adults, Grade D: Do not screen adults who are not pregnant for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Screening in pregnancy is implemented using a midstream, clean-catch urine culture at the first prenatal visit or at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation, whichever is earlier; a urine culture showing > 100 000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen or > 10 000 CFU/mL if the pathogen is group B Streptococcus indicates treatment. This applies to adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection. It does not apply to persons who have chronic medical or urinary tract conditions or are hospitalized or living in institutions such as nursing homes.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis — urine culture thresholds and organism relevance: In infants and children, an appropriate threshold to consider bacteriuria significant is at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single urinary pathogen, and reducing the threshold from 100 000 CFUs per mL to 50 000 CFUs per mL may increase sensitivity but decrease specificity; laboratories that report categorical results (0 to 1000, 1000 to 10 000, 10 000 to 100 000, and more than 100 000 CFUs per mL) require contextual interpretation for results in the 10 000 to 100 000 CFUs per mL range, and organisms such as Lactobacillus spp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium spp are not considered clinically relevant urine isolates for otherwise healthy, 2- to 24-month-old children; infants with positive culture alone are recognized as having asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than a true UTI when pyuria is absent.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — laboratory reporting limits and interpretation: Many laboratories will not report colony counts < 10³ CFU/mL, and strict use of a low threshold is likely to lead to overdiagnosis; therefore, determining whether a standard urine culture represents clinically significant bacteriuria must factor the clinical presentation, urine collection method, and suggestive findings such as pyuria and urinary nitrites.

Diagnosis: culture

Laboratory culture is the gold standard for UTI diagnosis. Urine is sterile; therefore, the presence of bacteria in sufficient quantity, with concurrent evidence of active infection, suggests UTI. Urine is added to a growth medium, from which bacteria and antibiotic sensitivities are identified. Culture takes around 24 hours, then the presumptive diagnosis can be reviewed. All major UTI guidelines recommend culture is required for UTI diagnosis.

How many bacteria are needed to diagnose UTI in children? Thresholds vary between guidelines and collection methods. The commonly quoted threshold of 100 000 CFU/mL of a single organism is based on a seminal study in adult women by Kassfrom 1956. Does this threshold apply in children? American guidelines suggest a 50 000 CFU/mL threshold with concurrent pyuria for SPA and catheter specimens. More recent evidence suggests an even lower 10 000 CFU/mL threshold would slightly increase sensitivity without reducing diagnostic specificity. Many guidelines suggest that any growth on SPA is abnormal, as SPA has negligible contamination.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is the presence of bacteria in the urine without active infection. ASB prevalence is estimated at 1.4%–1.9% in childhood. Bacterial growth without evidence of active infection (eg, pyuria) does not suggest UTI.

In reality, these diagnostic thresholds are not binary. Low colony counts on culture may represent early infection, contamination or ASB. Pyuria may occasionally be absent in early infection or immunocompromise. Screening and culture results must always be considered in the clinical context.

Contamination

Contamination muddies the waters when evaluating UTI. Assuming a single uropathogen causes UTI, multiple organisms suggests sample contamination. Incidental flora colonise the perigenital skin and can get flushed into the urine sample on voiding. Missed diagnosis can occur if a true uropathogen is concealed in the mix or misdiagnosis if a single contaminant dominates the culture. Contamination can be minimised by cleaning the perigenital skin before sample collectionand avoiding touching inside the specimen jar or holding the jar against the child's skin.

What is on the horizon?

Current tests for UTI lack absolute sensitivity or specificity. Urinary biomarkers such as interleukin 6 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin have been proposed to differentiate between active infection and ASB. Real-time PCR has been proposed to identify common uropathogens such as E. coli. Further research is required to understand the clinical utility of these emerging tests.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — urine culture diagnostic thresholds and reporting: A positive urine culture is typically characterized by bacteriuria of at least 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, although according to the European Association of Urology guidelines, a count of 10² CFU/mL in symptomatic patients is sufficient for diagnosis; Canadian guidelines state that even 10² CFU is sufficient in the setting of UTI symptoms, and certain laboratories may report 10⁴ or less as "no growth".

### Culturing of female bladder bacteria reveals an interconnected urogenital microbiota [^a2658411]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Contrary to medical dogma, urine is not sterile, even in asymptomatic individuals –. For over 60 years, the standard urine culture protocol has represented the primary tool for detecting bacteria in clinical microbiology laboratories. This aerobic protocol was designed to detect causative agents of pyelonephritisand is particularly effective at detecting abundant Escherichia coli (> 10⁵ colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml) but little else. Culture-independent analysis of urine obtained by suprapubic aspirate, which bypasses the vulva, vagina, and urethra, demonstrates the presence of bacteria in the bladders of women. The microbial profiles observed in aspirated urine are similar to those in urine obtained by transurethral catheter (TUC), indicating the avoidance of urethral contamination in catheterized samples. We note the difference between TUC, which is transient and not associated with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and indwelling catheters that are known to harbor biofilms and result in CAUTI. Analyzing urine sampled by TUC, we previously found that the majority of asymptomatic women contain bacterial genera typically not detected by standard urine culture. These genera, including Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium, tend to be in low abundance (between 10 and 10⁴ CFU/ml)and require growth conditions and carbon sources not available in standard urine culture. Therefore, we developed an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol that captures a broad range of bacterial taxa.

Previous studies, using EQUC in combination with 16S rRNA sequencing, suggest the bladder microbiota of asymptomatic women typically contains low bacterial diversity, with increases in diversity indicative of urgency urinary incontinence symptoms and a decreased response to anticholinergic medication. They also highlight bacterial species (e.g. Streptococcus anginosus and Gardnerella vaginalis) that are associated with urgency urinary incontinence symptoms and others (e.g. Lactobacillus crispatus) that are associated with the lack of lower urinary tract symptoms. Evidence also exists that women with communities dominated by specific Lactobacillus species are less likely to develop post-instrumentation and postoperative urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, owing to the lack of bladder-specific bacterial reference genomes, high-resolution taxonomic characterization to the bacterial strain level, functional analysis, and comparison to other microbiota communities remain to be performed.

### Antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired urine bacterial isolates in French amazonia [^abb0ba11]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Data collection.

We collected data from the computerized database of the microbiology laboratory. A community-acquired isolate is defined as a culture collection from an outpatient (i.e. consulting in the ED, OC, or RHCC). Significant density of growth refers to the breakpoints defined by the French society of microbiology. In women, they are defined as ≥ 10³ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL for E. coli and Staphylococcus saprophiticus; ≥ 10⁴ CFU/mL for enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL for Streptococcus agalactiae, nonsaprophiticus coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), and non– P. aeruginosa nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). In men, they are defined as ≥ 10³ CFU/mL for E. coli, S. saprophiticus, Enterobacterales, and P. aeruginosa; and ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL for S. agalactiae, nonsaprophiticus CNS, and non– P. aeruginosa non fermentative GNB. Redundant cases are defined as positive culture urinalysis in the same patient growing to the same organism in an interval of < 6 months. Each patient with nonredundant results is considered as a new patient. Enterobacterales were divided into three groups according to their enzymatic resistance profile to β-lactams at the basal state (natural resistance). Group I are those without enzymatic resistance at the basal state (e.g. E. coli, Proteus mirabilis), group II are those producing low-level penicillinase (e.g. K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter koseri), and group III are those producing low-level AmpC (e.g. Enterobacter spp. Serratia marcessens, Citrobacter freundii). Cross-resistance refers to resistance to several antibiotics with a similar mechanism of action. Coresistance refers to resistance to more than one class of antibiotics. For each included urine culture, we collected the patient's age and gender, the isolated bacteria, and its susceptibility to different classes of antibiotics.

In this third episode of the Microbiologist in the Clinic series, clinicians and laboratory scientists share their perspectives about a 32 y/o female who has become antibiotic-dependent for her urinary symptoms. Despite escalating methods of antibiotic administration, the patient has persistent and recurrent "UTI" symptoms. Extensive testing has not provided guidance for her treating clinicians. The challenges of this clinical presentation are discussed with evidence for evaluation and treatment.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^f2a634fb]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests and intervals — pregnancy urine culture thresholds: Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is done with urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit; urine culture is currently recommended for screening in pregnancy and is the established method for diagnosis. A culture obtained using a midstream, clean-catch urine sample with greater than 100 000 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of a single uropathogen is considered a positive test result, and greater than 10 000 CFU/mL of group B Streptococcus is an indicator of vaginal colonization and is commonly used as the threshold for treatment of infection in pregnancy. There is little evidence on the optimal timing and frequency of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

### A multicenter evaluation of viral bloodstream detections in children presenting to the emergency department with suspected systemic infection [^6f4ced1c]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of standard of care test results

Sixty-three subjects (63/1114, 5.7%) were found to have serious bacterial infections, which consisted of 29 bloodstream infections, 37 urinary tract infections, and one case of bacterial meningitis (Table 1). Four of these subjects had concurrent blood and urine cultures positive for the same organism.

Table 1
Standard-of-care (SOC) culture results with respect to viral pathogen detections by the emvPCR test

a Denominator represents the number of subjects who had urine cultures performed

b Denominator represents the number of subjects who had CSF cultures performed

c Total number of SBIs may be less than sum of individual SBIs if individual subjects had multiple types of SBIs

Among the subjects with bacterial bloodstream infections, six had Staphylococcus aureus and five had Escherichia coli bacteremia. One subject each had Salmonella Typhi, Samonella non- Typhi, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecalis, S. anginosus group, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The remainder had Gram-negative rod bacteremia, with the exception of one subject who had both Candida parapsilosis and Staphylococcus simulans and was classified as having an SBI with diagnosis of a central-line associated tunnel infection. Thirty-five additional subjects had positive blood cultures growing presumed contaminants which were not isolated on subsequent blood cultures. These organisms were CoNS, viridans streptococcus (other than S. anginosus group), Micrococcus sp. and Corynebacterium sp. Thus, the majority of positive blood cultures in children presenting to the ED with suspected bloodstream infection (35/64, 54.7%) represented presumed contaminating organisms.

Of the 383 subjects who had urine cultures performed, 37 (9.7%) had a UTI defined as a urine culture growing a predominant uropathogen at ≥ 50,000 CFU/ mL. Thirty-four of these (34/37, 91.9%) screened positive by leukocyte esterase on urinalysis, whereas only 12 (12/37, 32.4%) had positive nitrites. All patients with UTIs with nitrites detected on their urinalyses were also positive for leukocyte esterase. An additional 38 (9.9%) of subjects grew contaminating organisms or pathogens at a concentration less than the defined threshold for the diagnosis of UTI. The single subject with bacterial meningitis grew Neisseria meningitidis from his CSF culture.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^80ac2714]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

KAS 1 Clinicians Should Obtain Urine Specimen by Catheterization or SPA — clinicians should obtain a urine specimen by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA) for urinalysis and, if the urinalysis result is positive, for culture; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Quality A. For 1000 infants, approximately 94 to 98 infants with urinary tract infections will be detected by a positive urinalysis result, and 2 to 6 may be missed; if the urinalysis result is negative, an estimated 200 to 500 catheterizations or SPAs followed by cultures would be required to detect 1 additional infant with bacteriuria. The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline basis used pyuria and at least 50 000 colony-forming units (cfu) per mL in appropriately collected urine, whereas 10 000 colony-forming units/mL is now an acceptable threshold for diagnosing urinary tract infection from catheterized urine specimens when pyuria and fever are also present, and this addresses laboratories not reporting graduations from 10 000 to 100 000. Culture of urine specimens not collected by catheterization or SPA is not recommended because of an unacceptable rate of false-positive results attributable to contamination, and positive urine culture results without an abnormal urinalysis indicating inflammation are likely to represent asymptomatic bacteriuria or contamination; SPA is effective and complications are rare.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^ebb22780]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) diagnostic definitions and specimen requirements — In patients without indwelling catheters, ASB is defined as ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in a voided urine specimen without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). For women, 2 consecutive specimens obtained preferably within 2 weeks are used to confirm persistence, and between 10% and 60% of women do not have persistent bacteriuria on repeat screening after an initial positive specimen. For men, a single urine specimen meeting these quantitative criteria is sufficient for diagnosis. In patients with indwelling devices, ≥ 10³ CFU/mL remains the most appropriate diagnostic criteria for bladder bacteriuria, while lower quantitative counts (≥ 10² to < 10⁵ CFU/mL) from "in and out" catheterization or after insertion of a new indwelling catheter suggest true bacteriuria, although the clinical significance of these lower counts in asymptomatic people has not been evaluated.

### Hierarchical AI enables global interpretation of culture plates in the era of digital microbiology [^05dcefce]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

A quantitative description of the colony-level dataset is provided in Supplementary Table 1. From 1351 pure flora plate images (1321 from clinical specimens and 30 from ATCC), 26,213 isolated colony images (24,781 clinical and 1432 from ATCC) were extracted. A 60/20/20 subdivision in training/validating/testing subsets was performed at the plate level (random selection among each of the 32 represented species) in order to avoid having colonies from the same plate appearing in different portions of the colony-level dataset. The table also provides information about the 16 proposed groups, which were derived from phylogenetic relations and diagnostic relevance criteria. In particular, phylogenetically related species, like Morganellaceae, Aereococaceae, Enterococcaceae, were collapsed together, as were pathogens where a joint identification could have a most diagnostical/clinical relevance than separate identifications (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae KES, grouping the pathogens Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae with Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae). However, in some cases, despite the phylogenetic relationship with neighbour species, the clinical relevance of a single species led us to maintain it as a separated category, e.g. Staphylococcus saprophyticus versus other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), or Streptococcus agalactiae versus beta-haemolytic streptococci, or Candida albicans versus other non- Candida albicans species.

Plate-level clinical dataset

comprises 5,051 WaspLab™ clinical images (from same number of plates) taken from the whole flow of about one week of examinations from urine sample cultures performed at TriCore Reference Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM (US). As for the colony-level dataset, all the plates were inoculated from urine clinical specimens using a 1 μl loop on REMEL™ blood agar, and incubated from 17 to 23 h in CO₂ at 37 °C. After screening them with a Sismex TM urine analyser, which identifies negative urine samples that can be excluded from the culturing process, plates were labelled by the staff on duty according to shared laboratory rules (depicted in Fig. 5a and detailed below), nominally adopted by both lab technologists/microbiologists and DeepColony, to determine the clinical significance of the culture.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline — diagnostic thresholds and pyuria: For urine obtained by catheterization, 50 000 cfu/ml was proposed as the appropriate threshold; lower colony counts are sufficient if obtained by SPA, and most (80%) cases of UTI documented with urine obtained by SPA have 10⁵ cfu/ mL or more. Colony counts lower than 50 000 cfu/mL are currently being considered for the diagnosis of UTI if 10 000 cfu/ml is coupled with symptoms (eg, fever) and evidence of inflammation (pyuria), and significant pyuria is ≥ 10 white blood cells/mm³ on an "enhanced urinalysis" or ≥ 5 white blood cells per high power field on a centrifuged specimen of urine or any leukocyte esterase on a dipstick.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^366707c4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) treatment in pregnant individuals — clinicians should prescribe a 5–7-day course of targeted antibiotics for colony counts of 100,000 CFU/mL or higher, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against repeat screening after appropriate treatment; ASB is clinically significant at 100,000 CFU/mL (10⁵ CFU/mL) or higher, treatment should start once bacteriuria is confirmed and be adjusted per sensitivities, and normal vulvovaginal flora should not be treated. Group B strep should be treated if present in counts greater than 100,000 CFU/mL, whereas lower colony counts do not require treatment but should be noted for group B streptococcus prophylaxis at delivery; several randomized studies show that a 5–7-day duration is superior to single-dose treatment, with no difference in ASB recurrence, pyelonephritis, or preterm birth. Fosfomycin is an exception with single-dose efficacy making it a reasonable choice for 1-day treatment of ASB, and there are no studies assessing a 3-day treatment duration for ASB; there are also no studies to recommend for or against whether a test of cure or repeat screening is indicated after treatment.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months — To establish the diagnosis, clinicians should require both urinalysis results that suggest infection (pyuria and/or bacteriuria) and the presence of at least 50 000 colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL of a uropathogen cultured from a urine specimen obtained through catheterization or SPA (evidence quality: C; recommendation).

### A performance comparison of the fully automated urine particle analyzer UF-5000 with UF-1000i and Gram staining in predicting bacterial growth patterns in women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^e935715a]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Gram staining is associated with a sensitivity rate of 88%, a specificity rate of 95%, a negative predictive value of 96%, and a positive predictive value of 84% for identifying bacteriuria. When differentiating bacterial growth patterns, gram staining has good sensitivity and specificity for gram negative (80.6% and 96.7%, respectively) and gram positive bacteria (60% and 100%, respectively). Although real-time reporting of gram staining could reduce the blind initiation of antibiotics, and thus prevent unnecessary expenditure and drug treatment, gram staining is time consuming and labor-intensive. The UF-5000 offers comparable efficacy and a much faster and far easier way of providing the same information, compared with the classic method of Gram staining.

Detecting Gram positive bacteria has significant clinical implications. First, the most commonly isolated Gram-positive uropathogens are Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. A previously published review suggested that urologic diseases involving Gram-positive bacteria may be easily overlooked due to the limited culture-based assays that are typically utilized for urine analysis in hospital microbiology laboratories. Hooton et al. found that only Staphylococcus saprophyticus correlated well with catheterized urine whereas, enterococci and streptococci were poorly correlated with catheterized urine cultures. Therefore, patients with gram positive bacteria shown on the UF-5000 may not have uUTI by classical GNB and may not need empirical antibiotics. Second, in patients with Gram positive cocci as determined by the UF-5000, a urine culture is recommended as well as the administration of antibiotics targeting Gram positive bacteria, as opposed to empirical antibiotics for gram negative bacteria. In this way, patients can avoid unnecessary waiting times, the overuse of antibiotics and increased medical costs. Third, immediately identifying Gram positive bacteria in ascites, cerebral spinal fluids and pleural fluids may help clinicians make appropriate and timely antibiotic choices for these life threatening infections. More clinical studies to explore the use of the UF-5000 in these situations is encouraged.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^10627108]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) bacteriuria in pregnancy — prevalence, risk, colony counts, and screening — includes that GBS is found in the urine of 2%–7% of pregnant women, and maternal GBS bacteriuria is a marker for heavy genital tract colonization with an increased risk for early-onset disease in the newborn; antibiotics do not eliminate GBS and recolonization after a course of antibiotics is typical. Some women with GBS bacteriuria during the first trimester might not have vaginal-rectal colonization detected at 35–37 weeks' gestation or at the time of delivery, yet maternal GBS bacteriuria at any point during pregnancy is a recognized risk factor for early-onset GBS disease and has been included as an indication for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis since 1996. Most risk data concern significant GBS bacteriuria (generally > 10⁵ colony-forming units per milliliter of urine); lower concentrations (< 10⁴ cfu/ mL) can be associated with vaginal-rectal colonization, but relatively few data address risk among women with low-colony-count bacteriuria. Routine screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended in pregnant women, and identification of GBS through this screening represents an opportunity to detect women at high risk; however, in the context of universal late antenatal GBS screening, it is unclear how much additional disease is prevented by screening for low colony-count GBS bacteriuria and whether identification of low colony-count bacteriuria is cost-effective.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^4905f9ac]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

URINE CULTURE AS A STANDARD OF CARE

Bacterial cultures have been the cornerstone to the diagnosis of UTIs since the 1950s. It is therefore important to understand the basis of these culture-based techniques, against which any new technologies are compared. Even before a urine specimen arrives in the lab, culture protocols are defined by pre-analytic steps that begin with collection. Into the early 1950s, urine specimens were more frequently collected via catheterization to reduce contamination, although the practice as conducted at the time not infrequently led to iatrogenic UTIs. Voided specimens have since become the norm, with a midstream clean catch required to minimize periurethral contamination. While first-morning specimens yield higher bacterial concentrations than samples collected later in the day, the impact on collection practices is likely minimal. If not processed within 30 minutes to 2 hours, urine must be kept refrigerated at 4°C to minimize changes in bacterial composition. Boric acid (20 g/L) is commonly used as a bacteriostatic agent to stabilize specimens for up to 48 hours.

Semi-quantitative urine culture is performed by most laboratories. For voided specimens, 1 µL of urine is plated onto a non-selective and Gram-negative-selective media which are incubated aerobically for a minimum of 12–18 hours, leading to growth of non-fastidious aerobes and facultative anaerobes. Over the years, various additional selective/differential media have been developed to aid in presumptive identification. Catheterized, cystoscopic, and aspirated suprapubic collections may be inoculated with 10 µL of specimen and plates held for up to 48 hours. The inoculation volume defines the lower limit of detection: 1,000 CFU/mL for 1 µL, 100 CFU/mL for 10 µL. Furthermore, the 1 µL–10 µL inoculum helps reduce potential co-isolation of periurethral contaminants, which rarely exceed 1,000 CFU/mL under proper clean-catch conditions. Plates are observed for the quantity and purity of microbial growth, which are both summarized in the reported result. Higher-abundance growth is more strongly associated with clinical significance, while multiple colony morphotypes (typically ≥ 3) are considered evidence of periurethral contaminant. At the same time, the latter phenomenon must be weighed alongside the possibility of polymicrobial UTIs in at-risk patients.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^b49ee99b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) guideline — definition and scope: ASB is defined as the presence of 1 or more species of bacteria in urine at specified counts (≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL or ≥ 10⁸ CFU/L), irrespective of pyuria, and without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). The 2005 IDSA guideline recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures, and treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The current guideline reviews and updates the 2005 guideline, and the recommendations also consider populations not addressed previously, such as children and patients with solid organ transplants or neutropenia, noting that antimicrobial stewardship programs have identified management of ASB as an important opportunity for decreasing inappropriate antimicrobial use.

### Urine is not sterile: use of enhanced urine culture techniques to detect resident bacterial flora in the adult female bladder [^6a1ee710]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Our previous study showed that bacterial genomes can be identified using 16S rRNA sequencing in urine specimens of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who are culture negative according to standard urine culture protocols. In the present study, we used a modified culture protocol that included plating larger volumes of urine, incubation under varied atmospheric conditions, and prolonged incubation times to demonstrate that many of the organisms identified in urine by 16S rRNA gene sequencing are, in fact, cultivable using an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol. Sixty-five urine specimens (from 41 patients with overactive bladder and 24 controls) were examined using both the standard and EQUC culture techniques. Fifty-two of the 65 urine samples (80%) grew bacterial species using EQUC, while the majority of these (48/52 [92%]) were reported as no growth at 10³ CFU/ml by the clinical microbiology laboratory using the standard urine culture protocol. Thirty-five different genera and 85 different species were identified by EQUC. The most prevalent genera isolated were Lactobacillus (15%), followed by Corynebacterium (14.2%), Streptococcus (11.9%), Actinomyces (6.9%), and Staphylococcus (6.9%). Other genera commonly isolated include Aerococcus, Gardnerella, Bifidobacterium, and Actinobaculum. Our current study demonstrates that urine contains communities of living bacteria that comprise a resident female urine microbiota.

Conventional bacterial culture, bacterial identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Ninety of the 141 samples in the study had a corresponding same day urine culture. Each of these clean-catch midstream culture urine samples was inoculated onto tryptic soy agar with sheep blood (Becton, Dickinson and Company [BD], Franklin Lakes, NJ) and MacConkey agar (BD) using a 1-μL inoculation loop and incubated in ambient air at 35 °C. Four urine samples were reported as mixed bacterial flora and were excluded because of lack of further identification and 86 samples were defined as either negative urine culture (n = 43) or positive urine culture (n = 43) for the cfDNA/bacterial correlation analyses and ROC analyses.

A positive urine culture was defined as a culture growing an organism identified to at least the genus level (almost all bacterial isolates were recovered at a colony count ≥ 10,000 cfu/mL, while three isolates were recovered at a colony count < 10,000 cfu/mL). A urine culture was defined as negative when either no organism was isolated in culture (35 cultures, < 1000 cfu/mL) or the organism was unidentified to either the genus or species level (i.e. unidentified) and the colony count was < 10,000 cfu/mL (8 cultures).

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^15a8f0c0]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^7477bf48]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) — pediatric colony count thresholds, special pathogen testing, and molecular methods are described as follows: In febrile infants and young children (2–24 months), an abnormal urinalysis and a catheterized urine colony count of > 50 000 CFU/mL of a single organism is considered diagnostic, and ≥ 10⁴ CFU/mL with reliable detection of pyuria would pick up an additional significant proportion of children with true UTI; identification of a single potential pathogen in numbers as low as 200 CFU/mL may be significant, but if recovery at < 1000 CFU/mL is desired, the workup must be discussed in advance with the laboratory to achieve this lower level of detection. Yeast in urine may rarely indicate systemic infection and clinical correlation with additional diagnostic testing is recommended, recovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is best with first morning void urine samples of > 20 mL, adenovirus cystitis testing is typically performed using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) primarily available at reference laboratories, and polyoma BK virus viremopathy is best diagnosed by quantitative molecular determination of circulating virus in blood rather than urine. Although there are no current rapid molecular-based FDA approved technologies available for diagnosis of urinary tract infection, several applications of next generation sequencing direct on urine are in development or are commercially available; this strategy is not appropriate for all patient populations and clinical presentations and may lead to overtreatment with antibiotics, and studies evaluating utilization are scant and more evidence is needed before these technologies become widely adopted.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^07acb1bc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

GBS specimen collection and processing — key components and updates include that GBS colonization status should be determined by collecting both vaginal and rectal specimens at 35–37 weeks' gestation, and a single combined vaginal-rectal specimen can be collected (AII). Specimens should undergo 18–24 hour incubation at 35°–37°C in an appropriate enrichment broth medium to enhance the recovery of GBS (AI). Accurate results are more important than rapid turnaround time for antenatal screening (AIII), and clinicians must inform laboratories when submitted urine specimens are from pregnant women (AIII). NAAT, such as commercially available PCR assays, can also be used after enrichment if laboratories have validated performance and instituted appropriate quality controls (CII). A direct plating option can be included in addition to enriched culture (CII), but direct plating has a lower sensitivity than enriched culture and should not be used as sole means to identify GBS. Testing for inducible clindamycin resistance should be performed on antenatal GBS isolates that are susceptible to clindamycin, resistant to erythromycin, and are from penicillin-allergic women at high risk for anaphylaxis (CIII). Laboratories should report GBS in urine culture specimens when present at concentrations of ≥ 10⁴ colony-forming units/mL in pure culture or mixed with a second microorganism (AII).

Investigations

Investigations included Complete Blood Count which revealed neutrophilic leucocytosis (white blood cell 31.10× 10⁹ /L), Basic Metabolic Profile and Arterial Blood Gas Analysis which showed acute kidney failure (creatinine of 3.06 mg/dL, hyperkalaemia of 6.3 mmol/L and phosphorus of 7.0 mg/dL), metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Liver Function Tests were consistent with shock liver (AST of 4902 units/mL and an ALT of 3073 units/mL). Infectious workup was negative and included — CXR which was normal. CT chest/abdomen and pelvis failed to reveal any focal signs of infection. Blood and urine culture were negative for any bacterial, fungal growth. Superficial wound culture grew Streptococcus agalactiae, rare Proteus mirabilis, rare Klebsiella and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus — polymicrobial growth which was expected of a skin swab. Skin biopsy was performed which later showed diffuse spongiosis, as well as numerous subcorneal pustules filled with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, predominately consisting of neutrophils, with some associated lymphocytes, establishing a diagnosis of AGEP (figures 3 and 4).

Figure 4

Differential diagnosis

Other differentials included septic shock, pustular psoriasis, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). While these differential diagnoses were possible, they were less likely. A comprehensive evaluation, including a thorough physical examination, CXR, CT scan, blood and urine cultures did not reveal any infectious aetiology, making Septic Shock less likely. Although the clinical manifestations of AGEP and pustular psoriasis are similar and at times can be difficult to distinguish, it was less likely to be pustular psoriasis for several reasons. Aside from the classic skin biopsy findings described above, the abrupt onset, short duration and rapid improvement after drug withdrawal support AGEP compared with a prolonged duration with quiescence and recurrence over the course of years in pustular psoriasis. Additionally, the patient had no evidence of arthritis, nor did he have a personal or family history of psoriasis, which would be more consistent with pustular psoriasis. Finally, this was less likely to be TEN or SJS as well there was no mucous membrane involvement in our patient, as well as the latency period between drug exposure and clinical manifestations is often prolonged in these syndromes compared with AGEP.

### Impact of laboratory-reported urine culture colony counts on the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection for hospitalized patients [^c9bb364d]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Reducing health care-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a National Patient Safety Goal. The purpose of this investigation was to establish a colony count threshold to predict clinically significant UTIs that develop in hospitalized patients. A total of 185 cases were reviewed sequentially by 2 physicians. The information extracted included subjective complaints, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, clinical signs and symptoms, WBC count, urinalysis, and urine culture results. The first reviewer recorded whether the patient was diagnosed and treated for a UTI by the clinician. The second reviewer determined if the patient met National Healthcare Safety Network guidelines for nosocomial UTI. Compared with patients with colony counts less than 100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL), patients with colony counts 100,000 CFU/mL or more were 73.86 times more likely to have a clinically significant UTI (odds ratio, 73.86; 95% confidence interval, 24.23 ∼ 225.15; P < .0001; c-statistic, 0.859). Reporting positive results only for patients with 100,000 CFU/mL or more would have reduced the number of positive cultures by 38%. These data suggest that reporting colony counts less than 100,000 CFU/mL encourages treatment of non-clinically significant UTIs in hospitalized patients, causing inappropriate antibiotic use.

### Subsp.andas emerging human uropathogens in elderly patients [^059bbb3c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common human infections in both community and hospital settings, affecting 150 million people each year worldwide, with significant morbidity and high medical costs. In both settings, Enterobacterales are responsible for the vast majority of UTIs, predominantly uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates. Besides Gram-negative bacilli, UTIs can also be caused by Gram-positive bacteria such as enterococci, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, or Streptococcus agalactiae. Furthermore, emerging Gram-positive species have recently been described as true uropathogens: Actinotignum (formerly Actinobaculum) schaalii and Aerococcus spp. (A. urinae and A. sanguinicola).

Lactobacilli are non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic or microaerophilic, non-nitrate-reducing, non-motile Gram-positive rods. These microorganisms are ubiquitous and widespread commensals in human and animal microbiota. In humans, they are usually considered non-pathogenic as they are common inhabitants of the oropharynx, the gastrointestinal tract, and the female genital tract. Like other lactic acid bacteria (e.g. pediococci, lactococci) and bifidobacteria, they are widely used as starter cultures in the food industry (for fermented milk products or sausages) or as probiotic preparations. Due to their fastidious growth under aerobic conditions and their resemblance to bacterial species of the resident microbiota, lactobacilli have frequently been overlooked or regarded as contaminants. Additionally, it has long been challenging to identify them to the species level using conventional phenotypic-based methods. Although the advent of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry has greatly improved their identification, molecular identification is still required in some cases. Nonetheless, they can occasionally cause invasive infections, such as bacteremia and endocarditis, which are the most frequent, followed by intra-abdominal and respiratory infections, UTIs, endophthalmitis, chorioamnionitis, and meningitis as well as various abscesses and wound infections. The main species recovered from human infections, knowing that the genus Lactobacillus was extensively modified and several species have been reassigned to novel genus names, include Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (formerly Lactobacillus rhamnosus), Lacticaseibacillus casei (formerly Lactobacillus casei), and Lactobacillus gasseri followed by Limosilactobacillus fermentum (formerly Lactobacillus fermentum), Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (formerly Lactobacillus paracasei), Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (formerly Lactobacillus plantarum). These infections are often associated with underlying conditions such as immunosuppression, neutropenia, cancer, diabetes, previous surgery or endoscopy, invasive procedures (central venous or urinary catheterization, intubation/ventilation, dental procedure), prosthetic material, renal failure, or prolonged ineffective antibiotic therapy.

### Bacterial profile and prevalence of urinary tract infections in pregnant women in latin America: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b5ec8955]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria are markedly common among Latin American pregnant women. The prevalence of bacteriuria among Brazilian pregnant women tends to be higher than the mean of Latin America or other regions worldwide. These results reinforce the need for universal screening with urine culture during early prenatal care. Evidence supporting repeated screening for bacteriuria during different trimesters or gestational ages is lacking. Among Latin American pregnant women, the most common microorganism in the etiology of bacteriuria was E.coli. Another frequently isolated uropathogen was S. agalactiae, with a higher prevalence than that reported in other international studies. This information is highly relevant, as maternal colonization with Lancefield group B streptococci has been associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, such as neonatal sepsis. Given the higher frequency of UTI among Latin American pregnant women, additional studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of screening protocols and better identify the different microbial sensitivity profiles of uropathogens isolated from these women.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^111605bf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The growing incidence of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria poses a significant public health threat, driven heavily by inappropriate antibiotic use. Diagnostic stewardship, including tools like reflex urine culture, can help reduce unnecessary testing and subsequent unwarranted antibiotic treatments, though optimal thresholds are not well-defined. In our analysis of urinary parameters, urine microscopy WBC count demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting the presence of uropathogens.

Our study findings show that no single urinalysis parameter achieves both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting uropathogens from urine culture. However, WBC count on the microscopic portion of the urinalysis showed the best test performance with an AUC of 0.72, indicating acceptable or fair discriminative power.

Our results align with an analysis of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center healthcare system data, which assessed urinalysis parameters for diagnostic accuracy of "significant bacteriuria", a proxy definition for UTI. They found that WBC had the best diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.79), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.78) and bacteria (AUC = 0.77). Interestingly, our AUC values were lower. Differences may stem from test ordering practice variation, with some systems performing urinalysis with urine cultures more or less discriminately, including ordering tests for patients without UTI symptoms. The bias introduced by selecting patients based on clinician-initiated urinalysis ordering, rather than on symptoms, has been shown to underestimate diagnostic accuracy and may have contributed to inter-study variability in AUC results. Another key difference is our mean population age was lower (48 versus 57 years), attributed to our inclusion of children, whereas the other study included only adults. Increased age is associated with a higher prevalence of pyuria and colonization in women, – which might contribute to test performance differences. Finally, uropathogen definition differences may explain discrepant AUC values. The previous study's outcome was > 10,000 colony forming units (CFU)/mL, whereas our definition was organisms likely to prompt clinical action.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^4d0bc8ed]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinalysis performance and interpretation in recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — A negative urinalysis (i.e., negative nitrites and < 5 WBC/hpf) is useful in ruling out acute cystitis and is associated with a very low risk of progression to bacteremia; in a study of more than 12,000 urinalyses, a negative urinalysis showed high predictive accuracy for absence of clinically relevant UTI with specificity 92.2% and positive predictive value (PPV) 97.4%, and stewardship programs that reflex culture only after a positive urinalysis are estimated to reduce inappropriate antibiotics by five-fold; by contrast, positive leukocyte esterase (≥ 1+), pyuria (≥ 10 WBC/hpf), nitrite (≥ 1+), and bacteriuria (≥ 50 cells/field) all have PPVs for UTI lower than 50%, and discordance such as urine culture with > 100,000 CFU/mL E. coli but absent urine nitrites may reflect sampling or handling issues, where identifying epithelial cells or mucus can suggest contamination and obtaining a catheterized specimen may be reasonable; overall, urinalysis is specifically helpful due to its high negative predictive value, but positive findings should not be interpreted as evidence of a clinically significant UTI.

ASB screening method and specimen quality in pregnancy — collection of the screening urine sample at a visit early in prenatal care is prudent, though there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific gestational age; routine urine dipstick testing for infection at each prenatal visit does not have benefit and is not sufficiently sensitive to detect ASB, and a midstream urine culture is recommended for ASB screening; providing clean-catch instructions during midstream collection has not been shown to reduce vulvovaginal bacterial contamination, and both midstream and midstream clean catch specimens commonly have at least moderate contamination; in one-third of pregnant patients, either collection method shows growth of skin flora at colony counts up to 10,000 (10⁴) CFU/mL; there is no evidence specifically addressing whether to repeat a sample that demonstrates vulvovaginal bacterial contamination.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^12109d25]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Evidence base and diagnostic performance for urinalysis components: Searches included January 2003 through recent search dates of February 6, 2015 and March 13, 2015, identifying four hundred ninety-two articles; one hundred nine were selected for further review, with 10 studies included for this critical question, consisting of 2 Class II and 8 Class III studies including infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years. In a subset of the Pediatric Research in Office Settings febrile infant study of 38,066 infants aged 0 to 3 months with a fever (≥ 38°C [100.4°F]), urinary tract infection was defined as pure growth of a single pathogen with ≥ 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL for bag samples and ≥ 10,000 CFU/mL for catheterization samples; of the 1,482 infants who had urinalysis and urine cultures, 1,384 specimens were bag or catheterization, and for all specimens nitrites had better specificity (99% nitrites versus 91% leukocyte esterase).

### Nitrofurantion [^0c386ae1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of the antimicrobial action of nitrofurantoin is unusual among antibacterials.

Nitrofurantoin is reduced by bacterial flavoproteins to reactive intermediates which inactivate or alter bacterial ribosomal proteins and other acromolecules. As a result of such inactivations, the vital biochemical processes of protein synthesis, aerobic energy metabolism, DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and cell wall synthesis are inhibited. Nitrofurantoin is bactericidal in urine at therapeutic doses. The broad-based nature of this mode of action may explain the lack of acquired bacterial resistance to nitrofurantoin, as the necessary multiple and simultaneous mutations of the target macromolecules would likely be lethal to the bacteria.

Interactions with Other Antibiotics

Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between nitrofurantoin and quinolone antimicrobials. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

Development of Resistance

Development of resistance to nitrofurantoin has not been a significant problem since its introduction in 1953. Cross-resistance with antibiotics and sulfonamides has not been observed, and transferable resistance is, at most, a very rare phenomenon.

Nitrofurantoin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage]:

Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms:

Staphylococcus aureus

Enterococci (e.g. Enterococcus faecalis)

Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms:

Escherichia coli

NOTE: While nitrofurantoin has excellent activity against Enterococcus faecalis, the majority of Enterococcus faecium isolates are not susceptible to nitorfurantoin.

At least 90 percent of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for nitrofurantoin. However, the efficacy of nitrofurantoin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms has not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials.

Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms:

Coagulase-negative staphylococci (including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus)

Streptococcus agalactiae

Group D streptococci

Viridans group streptococci

Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms:

Citrobacter amalonaticus

Citrobacter diversus

Citrobacter freundii

Klebsiella oxytoca

Klebsiella ozaenae

NOTE: Some strains of Enterobacter species and Klebsiella species are resistant to nitrofurantoin.

### Discovery and characterization of human-urine utilization by asymptomatic-bacteriuria-causing Streptococcus agalactiae [^cf50217f]. Infection and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

Streptococcus agalactiae causes both symptomatic cystitis and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU); however, growth characteristics of S. agalactiae in human urine have not previously been reported. Here, we describe a phenotype of robust growth in human urine observed in ABU-causing S. agalactiae (ABSA) that was not seen among uropathogenic S. agalactiae (UPSA) strains isolated from patients with acute cystitis. In direct competition assays using pooled human urine inoculated with equal numbers of a prototype ABSA strain, designated ABSA 1014, and any one of several UPSA strains, measurement of the percentage of each strain recovered over time showed a markedly superior fitness of ABSA 1014 for urine growth. Comparative phenotype profiling of ABSA 1014 and UPSA strain 807, isolated from a patient with acute cystitis, using metabolic arrays of > 2,500 substrates and conditions revealed unique and specific l-malic acid catabolism in ABSA 1014 that was absent in UPSA 807. Whole-genome sequencing also revealed divergence in malic enzyme-encoding genes between the strains predicted to impact the activity of the malate metabolic pathway. Comparative growth assays in urine comparing wild-type ABSA and gene-deficient mutants that were functionally inactivated for the malic enzyme metabolic pathway by targeted disruption of the maeE or maeK gene in ABSA demonstrated attenuated growth of the mutants in normal human urine as well as synthetic human urine containing malic acid. We conclude that some S. agalactiae strains can grow in human urine, and this relates in part to malic acid metabolism, which may affect the persistence or progression of S. agalactiae ABU.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^fae4b23d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Despite substantial progress in prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease since the 1990s, GBS remains the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States. In 1996, CDC, in collaboration with relevant professional societies, published guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: a public health perspective. MMWR 1996;45[No. RR-7]); those guidelines were updated and republished in 2002 (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: revised guidelines from CDC. MMWR 2002;51[No. RR-11]). In June 2009, a meeting of clinical and public health representatives was held to reevaluate prevention strategies on the basis of data collected after the issuance of the 2002 guidelines. This report presents CDC's updated guidelines, which have been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Nurse-Midwives, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Society for Microbiology. The recommendations were made on the basis of available evidence when such evidence was sufficient and on expert opinion when available evidence was insufficient. The key changes in the 2010 guidelines include the following:

- expanded recommendations on laboratory methods for the identification of GBS,
- clarification of the colony-count threshold required for reporting GBS detected in the urine of pregnant women,
- updated algorithms for GBS screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes,
- a change in the recommended dose of penicillin-G for chemoprophylaxis,
- updated prophylaxis regimens for women with penicillin allergy, and
- a revised algorithm for management of newborns with respect to risk for early-onset GBS disease. Universal screening at 35–37 weeks' gestation for maternal GBS colonization and use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has resulted in substantial reductions in the burden of early-onset GBS disease among newborns. Although early-onset GBS disease has become relatively uncommon in recent years, the rates of maternal GBS colonization (and therefore the risk for early-onset GBS disease in the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis) remain unchanged since the 1970s. Continued efforts are needed to sustain and improve on the progress achieved in the prevention of GBS disease. There also is a need to monitor for potential adverse consequences of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., emergence of bacterial antimicrobial resistance or increased incidence or severity of non-GBS neonatal pathogens). In the absence of a licensed GBS vaccine, universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the cornerstones of early-onset GBS disease prevention.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^5887d644]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB.

All mothers with asymptomatic GBS bacteriuria also carried GBS at the VR site. Median urinary bacterial count was 40,000 CFU/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 10,000–100,000 CFU/mL; range 1,000–1 million CFU/mL). GBS bacteriuria was significantly more likely to be detected at the time of LOD onset (17/90 tested) rather than during pregnancy (2/92 tested; p < 0.01).

Among 17 women with a positive breast milk culture, 1 mother had mastitis (1 million CFUs/mL) and 16 had no mastitis (median bacterial count 300,000 CFU/mL; IQR 100,000–725,000 CFU/mL; range 9,000–6,400,000 CFU/mL). Fourteen (82.4%) of the 17 mothers were GBS colonized at the VR site at the prenatal screening or at the time of onset, or both, but the other 3 (17.6%) were persistently not colonized.

The purpose of this study was to survey expert opinion on the management of low colony counts (< 100,000 colony forming units/mL) of asymptomatic group B streptococcus (GBS) bacteriuria discovered in the first trimester. A survey was sent to the 241 senior obstetricians affiliated with each of the Obstetrics and Gynecology training programs in the United States on July 10, 2002. Surveys received by the deadline (September 1, 2002) were included in the dataset. Eighty-five completed surveys were returned for a response rate of 35%. Seventy-seven percent reported treating low colony counts of asymptomatic GBS bacteriuria in the first trimester at the time of diagnosis, whereas 23% stated they did not treat prior to labor (margin of error 7.5% with 95% confidence). Nine percent stated that their institution had a written protocol for the treatment of low colony counts of asymptomatic GBS bacteriuria. Two physicians indicated that they screened for asymptomatic GBS bacteriuria at 28 weeks. Currently, no generally accepted protocol for the management of low colony counts of asymptomatic GBS bacteriuria exists. This survey indicates that most of the responding senior obstetricians at United States training programs treat low colony counts of asymptomatic GBS bacteriuria in the first trimester.

Bacteriuria in pregnancy — treatment thresholds and intrapartum prophylaxis are specified as follows: If GBS bacteriuria at any colony count is detected during pregnancy, the woman is at increased risk of GBS colonization during labor and antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered empirically during labor; treatment is recommended for women who are symptomatic, and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is defined as 105 colony forming units (CFU)/mL or more, has been shown to reduce the risks of pyelonephritis, birth weight less than 2,500 grams, and preterm birth (less than 37 weeks of gestation); in asymptomatic women, treatment of GBS bacteriuria is recommended only if test results indicate a level of 105 CFU/mL or higher; although laboratories may report concentrations of GBS in urine at 104 CFU/mL or lower, no correlation has been found between concentrations of less than 105 CFU/mL and preterm birth, and there is no evidence that prenatal treatment of asymptomatic women with GBS bacteriuria less than 105 CFU/mL provides better maternal or neonatal outcomes; however, any GBS colony count, even one less than 105 CFU/mL, still indicates a higher level of anogenital colonization and is established as an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis in the intrapartum period.

### Targeting asymptomatic bacteriuria in antimicrobial stewardship: the role of the microbiology laboratory [^74972032]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

This minireview focuses on the microbiologic evaluation of patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, as well as indications for antibiotic treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as two consecutive voided specimens (preferably within 2weeks) with the same bacterial species, isolated in quantitative counts of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml in women, including pregnant women; a single voided urine specimen with one bacterial species isolated in a quantitative count ≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml in men; and a single catheterized urine specimen with one or more bacterial species isolated in a quantitative count of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml in either women or men (or ≥ 10² CFU/ml of a single bacterial species from a single catheterized urine specimen). Any urine specimen with ≥ 10⁴ CFU/ml group B Streptococcus is significant for asymptomatic bacteriuria in a pregnant woman. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs, irrespective of pyuria, in the absence of signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection. The two groups with the best evidence of adverse outcomes in the setting of untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria include pregnant women and patients who undergo urologic procedures with risk of mucosal injury. Screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in the following patient populations: pediatric patients, healthy nonpregnant women, older patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting, diabetic patients, patients with an indwelling urethral catheter, patients with impaired voiding following spinal cord injury, patients undergoing nonurologic surgeries, and nonrenal solid-organ transplant recipients. Renal transplant recipients beyond 1 month posttransplant should not undergo screening and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening of renal transplant recipients within 1 month, patients with high-risk neutropenia, or patients with indwelling catheters at the time of catheter removal. Unwarranted antibiotics place patients at increased risk of adverse effects (including Clostridioides difficile diarrhea) and contribute to antibiotic resistance. Methods to reduce unnecessary screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria aid in antibiotic stewardship.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1b80a32c]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urine culture and microbial identification strategy in recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — When clinical presentation and urinalysis suggest possible infection, examination for urinary bacteria using standard urine culture should be performed to inform antibiotic selection; in a propensity-matched cohort study of 48,283 women with localized UTIs, having a urine culture > 50% of the time was associated with fewer UTI-related hospitalizations and lower rates of intravenous antibiotic usage compared with not having cultures > 50% of the time; nonetheless, standard urine culture has significant limitations with contamination, mishandling, and false negatives affecting up to 40% of clinically apparent UTIs, and no current test reliably distinguishes infection from colonization across all patients, so the Guideline emphasizes individualized interpretation and serial evaluation; the Panel recognizes that, in select rUTI recurrences, presumptive treatment with antibiotics can be initiated prior to finalization of testing results based on prior speciation, susceptibilities, and local antibiogram, and for reliable patients the Panel recommends a process of shared decision-making regarding deferring therapy prior to obtaining urine culture results.

### Bacterial profile and asymptomatic bacteriuria among pregnant women in Africa: a systematic review and meta analysis [^f257cf0f]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Due to the hormonal and physiological changes during pregnancy; women's are more susceptible to infections. Different physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy, such as Hydroureter, dilatation of the renal pelvis, glycosuria and aminoaciduria, were responsible for the stasis of urine and create the best medium for the growth of different species of bacteria. Also, low urine osmolality due to physiologic change facilitate bacterial colonization and increase ascending infection increased in addition to the dysfunctional vesicoureteral reflux and ureteric valves.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) in pregnancy is defined as the presence of ≥ 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU) /ml of urine taken from a clean catch midstream urine specimen in the absence of specific symptoms of acute urinary tract infection. Globally, it happens in 2% to 15% of all pregnancies. Pregnancy boosts the progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic bacteriuria. Due to this, ABU is a main risk factor for the development of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

The most common organism responsible for 75–90% of bacteriuria in pregnancy is Escherichia coli. Other microbial agents include, Proteus mirabilis, group B Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis.

The maternal and fetal outcomes related to ABU are numerous. Untreated ABU result in abnormal maternal outcomes such as development of pyelonephritis in 20–50% of cases, higher rate of preterm labor, chronic infection resistant to drugs, preeclampsia, anemia, chorioamnionitis, endometritis and UTI in the postpartum period. Fetal complications associated with ABU include prematurity, Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), low birth weight, increase in perinatal mortality, stillbirth, mental retardation and development delay.

Maternal and fetal complications that may arise due to infection can be prevented by timely detection and treatment. Urine culture is the gold standard diagnostic technique for ABU which occurs during pregnancy. It's recommended that three up to seven days antibiotics therapy reduces the risk of symptomatic UTI by 80 to 90%. Also, antimicrobial treatment of ABU will reduce the risk of risk of having a low birth weight baby from 15% to 5% and pyelonephritis from 20 to 35% to 1–4%.

### Streptococcus agalactiae activities… [^a754b9c7]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Background S. agalactiae are bacteria that are commonly called group B Streptococcus or group B strep bacteria. They cause infection in people of all ages that is collectively called group B strep disease. These bacteria are a common cause of severe infections in newborns during the first weeks of life. More recently, experts recognized the increasing impact invasive group B strep disease has on adults. Keep Reading: Group B Strep Disease. Surveillance activities The laboratory supports CDC's Active Bacterial Core surveillance through the following activities:

- Serotyping S. agalactiaeisolates
- Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
- **Strain characterization by whole genome sequencing Keep Reading**: ABCs. Typing and characterization S. agalactiae are currently divided into 10 serotypes based on type-specific capsular antigens. The serotypes are designated as Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX.

Methods There are multiple methods to perform S. agalactiae serotyping: Lancefield precipitation test Latex agglutinationA Real-time polymerase chain reaction Conventional PCR Whole-genome sequencing Real-time PCR Real-time PCR assays target the cfb gene in order to detect S. agalactiae.

### Streptococcus agalactiae colonization is common among pregnant women with HIV infection and is neither predicted by hospital tier nor trimester in mwanza, tanzania [^09373fcb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Estimates from a systematic review and meta-analysis showed an overall prevalence of S. agalactiae colonization during pregnancy of 17.9%, with the prevalence being relatively lower in the Americas (19.7%), Europe (19.0%) and Southern Asia (11.1%) compared sub-Saharan Africa 22.4%. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of maternal GBS colonization in sub-Saharan Africa highlighted the imbalanced nature of available data from the region, with more than half of the available studies originating from just three countries (Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Africa). Furthermore, the immediate need for screening of pregnant women at health care facilities has raised pertinent questions about suitability of screening methods in the context of African health care facilities; and concerns about antimicrobial resistance, whereby approximately a quarter of GBS isolates were resistant to erythromycin, a safe antibiotic during pregnancy which is most often used as an alternative to beta lactam antibiotics like penicillin. Another important consideration in many African countries is that a few studies have shown GBS colonization to be higher among HIV-infected pregnant women than those who are not infected, for instance, 24% versus 13.7% in Ethiopia, and 50% versus 19.1% in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The two Tanzanian studies that were included in the meta-analysis were conducted in Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) and Bugando Medical Centre (BMC), and showed the prevalence of GBS to be 23% and 9.5%, respectively, suggesting the possibility of considerable differences even within countries. Of note, in the MNH study, swabs were enriched in Todd-Hewitt broth containing nalidixic acid and gentamicin, followed by inoculation onto conventional blood agar media, whereas in the BMC study, swabs were directly inoculated onto the conventional blood agar media. Low sample sizes in these studies among HIV-infected women, dependent on conventional culture with low bacterial yield (as opposed to ultrasensitive media like CHROMagar TM StrepB), confinement to tertiary hospitals and the fact that they were conducted over a decade ago have altogether limited plausible extrapolation of the findings in the current context. Building on a similar study on urinary tract infections which spanned from primary health care facilities (health centers and district hospitals), through regional referral hospital to tertiary hospital in the north-western part of Tanzania, the current study was designed to address several research and implementation gaps, by considering GBS detection using multiple methods across three tiers of health care facilities, followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, to inform specific preventive measures and expedite provision of GBS antimicrobial prophylaxis. Moreover, stratification of GBS colonization among pregnant women by HIV infection status was considered to ascertain whether both groups, or only those with HIV infection should be prioritized in the future GBS screening and vaccination programs.

Endourologic procedures and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — For endoscopic urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma, we recommend screening for and treating ASB prior to surgery (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest obtaining a urine culture prior to the procedure and prescribing targeted antimicrobial therapy rather than empiric therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In patients with ASB who will undergo a urologic procedure, we suggest a short course (1 or 2 doses) rather than more prolonged antimicrobial therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and antimicrobial therapy should be initiated 30–60 minutes before the procedure.

Urine collection and transport for suspected urinary tract infection — handling and special populations are detailed with explicit directives. Skin cleansing is still generally recommended. Use of urine transport media with preservative or refrigeration immediately after collection decreases the proliferation of microorganisms, whereas urine samples that are delayed in processing and held at room temperature for extended periods of time (> 4hours) are likely to demonstrate moderate to large increases in colony counts that are misleading and, in the majority of cases, are not recommended for culture. Straight or "in-and-out" catheterization of a properly prepared patient usually provides a less contaminated specimen, and while urine samples collected via a midstream void or straight catheterization are preferred to optimize urine culture performance, some diagnostic testing, specifically NAAT for STI, requires a first voided sample for optimal performance. Culture from indwelling catheters is therefore strongly discouraged, and if culture is required the specimen should be taken from the sampling port of a newly inserted device that has been in place for < 48 hours. Cultures of Foley catheter tips and urine from the bag of a catheterized patient are of no clinical value and should be rejected, and bagged urine collections, primarily used for pediatric patients, should be strongly discouraged in favor of straight catheterization. For patients with stents or stones, culture of the removed stent or stone is appropriate, but results should be interpreted in the context of the pathogens identified, the method of device or stone removal, and other laboratory data, including urine culture. For chronic or recurrent UTI, urine culture conditions and interpretive and reporting criteria (ie, lower reporting thresholds) may require modifications, while expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) can recover additional potential urinary tract pathogens but data do not support routine use of these methods for all patient populations. Specimens obtained by more invasive means, such as cystoscope or suprapubic aspirations, are routinely cultured to allow for recovery of bacteria in concentrations as low as 1000 CFU/mL.

### Management of neonates born at ≥ 35 0 / 7 weeks' gestation with suspected or proven early-onset bacterial sepsis [^0d1236c7]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Laboratory testing — blood culture in early-onset sepsis (EOS): In the absence of validated, clinically available molecular diagnostics, blood culture remains the diagnostic standard for EOS, and newborn surface cultures and gastric aspirate analysis cannot be used to diagnose EOS; urine culture is not indicated in sepsis evaluations performed at < 72 hours of age. In modern systems, these systems are used to reliably detect bacteremia at a level of 1 to 10 colony-forming units per mL if a minimum blood volume of 1 mL is inoculated, and a median blood culture time to positivity of < 24 hours is reported among term infants when using contemporary techniques. Pediatric blood culture bottles generally require a minimum inoculum of 1 mL of blood for optimal recovery, the use of 2 separate culture bottles may provide the opportunity to determine if commensal species are true infections by comparing growth in the 2 cultures, and the use of 1 aerobic and 1 anaerobic culture bottle may be done to optimize recovery; most neonatal pathogens, including GBS, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, will grow under anaerobic conditions. In critically ill term newborn infants, a prolonged empirical antibiotic treatment may occasionally be appropriate despite negative culture results.

### Reducing unnecessary urine culture testing in residents of long term care facilities [^e845d174]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

At least nine randomised controlled trials have shown the lack of clinical benefit of treating ASB with antibiotics in adults, as well as significant potential harms. Recommendations from Choosing Wisely and international guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and the European Association of Urology, each recommend against antibiotic prescribing for ASB (table 1). Despite this, observational studies in long term care settings across different countries show that 30–80% of residents with ASB receive antibiotics.

Table 1
International guideline statements on reducing urine tests and antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria

This gap, between strong international consensus not to prescribe antibiotics for ASB and what happens in practice, is created by pervasive over-ordering of urine cultures in long term care. This article explores the use of urine cultures in residents in long term care facilities and highlights the changes needed to improve this practice and reduce antibiotic overuse in this patient population.

### About group B strep disease… [^41b6047f]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Group B Streptococcus bacteria cause GBS disease.
- GBS disease includes many types of infections — some can be life threatening.
- Anyone can get GBS disease, but it's most common in newborns.
- If pregnant, get tested for GBS bacteria and get antibiotics during labor, if needed. Types GBS bacteria can cause many types of infections. Some of these infections can be life threatening. Infections include:

- Bacteremia
- Sepsis
- Bone and joint infections
- Urinary tract infections
- Meningitis
- Pneumonia
- Skin and soft tissue infections. Most common infections Newborns: GBS bacteria most commonly cause bacteremia, sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis in newborns.

Adults: Bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and skin and bone infections are the most common GBS infections among men and non-pregnant women. It's very uncommon for GBS bacteria to cause meningitis in adults. How it spreads GBS bacteria come and go naturally in people's bodies. How people spread GBS bacteria to others is generally unknown. From mothers to babies Pregnant women can pass the bacteria to their babies during delivery. Most babies who get GBS disease in the first week of life are exposed to the bacteria this way. It can be hard to figure out how babies who develop GBS disease after the first week of life got the bacteria. The bacteria may have come from the mother during birth or from another source. Screening and diagnosis Screening Healthcare providers should screen all pregnant women for GBS bacteria.

Keep Reading: GBS Screening During Pregnancy Diagnosing GBS disease After seeing someone who is sick, healthcare providers may take samples depending on the type of infection they suspect:

- Blood
- Spinal fluid
- Urine Healthcare providers may also order a chest x-ray to help determine if someone has GBS disease.

Culture methods and susceptibility testing

The method used for culture and susceptibility testing has been described elsewhere. Briefly, uncentrifuged urine was inoculated with a 0.01 mL loop on blood and UriSelect chromogenic agar (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA) in a semi-quantitative dilution method. Urine diluted in saline (1:10) was inoculated with a 0.01 mL and 0.001 mL loop on Columbia blood agar (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA) and UriSelect chromogenic agar. Agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 20–24 h. Microorganisms were identified by their phenotypical characteristic and using the semi-automatic system MIKROLATEST ID (Erba-Lachema, Brno, Czech Republic).

Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the disc diffusion method on Mueller–Hinton agar (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA) and by the MIC dilution method (TRIOS MIC, Prague, Czech Republic until 2017, then MICRO-LA-TEST ATB (MIC) Erba-Lachema, Brno, Czech Republic). EUCAST MIC breakpoint tables were used. Intermediate results were excluded from this analysis. The cut-off used for significant bacterial presence was 10⁵ colony-forming units/mL (10³ for aseptically catheterised urine specimens).

This survey covers the following antimicrobial agents: ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam; cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime; ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin; gentamicin and amikacin; ertapenem, meropenem and imipenem; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), nitrofurantoin and colistin.

Cochrane-Armitage test was used to assess statistical significance of trends. Statistical analyses were performed in XLSTAT 2020.1.3 (Addinsoft, New York, USA). Alpha level of 0.05 was considered significant.

### Effect of microbiology comment nudging on antibiotic use in asymptomatic bacteriuria: a before-and-after quasi-experimental study [^7f358162]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is the isolation of 1 or more species of bacteria in a urine culture without signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI). The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends against the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria except in pregnancy and patients undergoing genitourinary procedures in which mucosal bleeding is expected. Approximately 20% of elderly, otherwise healthy females in the community and up to 80% of those hospitalized are affected. Inappropriate treatment of ASB is associated with emergence of resistant organisms and subsequent UTIs in females with a history of recurrent UTIs. Inappropriate treatment has been attributed to factors such as abnormal urinalysis results, older patients, and patients with altered mental status. Therefore, reduction in treatment of ASB is an important goal for antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). Current strategies include clinical decision support to reduce urine testing, interactive education sessions, withholding culture results, and audit and feedback.–

Microbiology comment nudging refers to a guideline-based recommendation in which the recommendation is typed and reported on a culture and susceptibility report to guide antimicrobial therapy. Musgrave et aldemonstrated this behavioral intervention to be effective in treatment of pneumonia. After implementation of a comment nudge in their study, de-escalation and discontinuation of unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics increased, reducing harm in patients hospitalized with pneumonia. Alternative microbiology reporting interventions, such as selective or modified reporting of cultures and susceptibilities, have also been shown to improve antibiotic prescribing patterns. This low-cost, simple behavioral intervention has the potential for high yield when incorporated into ASPs, including other types of infections.

At our institution, we noticed a high tendency to treat asymptomatic patients with urine cultures growing < 100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). Therefore, a comment nudge was initially approved for urine cultures with < 100,000 CFU/mL, with the goal of reducing inappropriate treatment and a plan to expand to all urine cultures in the future. We evaluated the effect of implementing a microbiology comment nudge on treatment of positive urine cultures.

### Nitrofurantoin monohydrate and nitrofurantoin, macrocrystalline (macrobid) [^fb6a7482]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Microbiology: Nitrofurantoin is bactericidal in urine at therapeutic doses. The mechanism of the antimicrobial action of nitrofurantoin is unusual among antibacterials. Nitrofurantoin is reduced by bacterial flavoproteins to reactive intermediates which inactivate or alter bacterial ribosomal proteins and other macromolecules. As a result of such inactivations, the vital biochemical processes of protein synthesis, aerobic energy metabolism, DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and cell wall synthesis are inhibited. The broad-based nature of this mode of action may explain the lack of acquired bacterial resistance to nitrofurantoin, as the necessary multiple and simultaneous mutations of the target macromolecules would likely be lethal to the bacteria. Development of resistance to nitrofurantoin has not been a significant problem since its introduction in 1953. Cross-resistance with antibiotics and sulfonamides has not been observed, and transferable resistance is, at most, a very rare phenomenon.

Nitrofurantoin, in the form of Macrobid, has been shown to be active against most strains of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections: (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE .)

Gram-Positive Aerobes
Staphylococcus saprophyticus
Gram-Negative Aerobes
Escherichia coli

Nitrofurantoin also demonstrates in vitro activity against the following microorganisms, although the clinical significance of these data with respect to treatment with Macrobid is unknown:

Gram-Positive Aerobes
Coagulase-negative staphylococci
(including Staphylococcus epidermidis)
Enterococcus faecalis
Staphylococcus aureus
Streptococcus agalactiae
Group D streptococci
Viridans group streptococci
Gram-Negative Aerobes
Citrobacter amalonaticus
Citrobacter diversus
Citrobacter freundii
Klebsiella oxytoca
Klebsiella ozaenae

Nitrofurantoin is not active against most strains of Proteus species or Serratia species. It has no activity against Pseudomonas species.

Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between nitrofurantoin and quinolone antimicrobials. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

### Predictive performance of urinalysis for urine culture results according to causative microorganisms: an integrated analysis with artificial intelligence [^b9fd2daa]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are pervasive and prevalent in both community and hospital settings. Recent trends in the changes of the causative microorganisms in these infections could affect the effectiveness of urinalysis (UA). We aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of UA for urinary culture test results according to the causative microorganisms. In addition, UA results were integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) methods to improve the predictive power. A total of 360,376 suspected UTI patients were enrolled from two university hospitals and one commercial laboratory. To ensure broad model applicability, only a limited range of clinical data available from commercial laboratories was used in the analyses. Overall, 53,408 (14.8%) patients were identified as having a positive urine culture. Among the UA tests, the combination of leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests showed the highest area under the curve (AUROC, 0.766; 95% CI, 0.764–0.768) for predicting urine culture positivity but performed poorly for Gram-positive bacteriuria (0.642; 0.637–0.647). The application of an AI model improved the predictive power of the model for urine culture results to an AUROC of 0.872 (0.870–0.875), and the model showed superior performance metrics not only for Gram-negative bacteriuria (0.901; 0.899–0.902) but also for Gram-positive bacteriuria (0.745; 0.740–0.749) and funguria (0.872; 0.865–0.879). As the prevalence of non- Escherichia coli -caused UTIs increases, the performance of UA in predicting UTIs could be compromised. The addition of AI technologies has shown potential for improving the predictive performance of UA for urine culture results. IMPORTANCEUA had good performance in predicting urine culture results caused by Gram-negative bacteria, especially for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriuria, but had limitations in predicting urine culture results caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. We developed and externally validated an AI model incorporating minimal demographic information of patients (age and sex) and laboratory data for UA, complete blood count, and serum creatinine concentrations. The AI model exhibited improved performance in predicting urine culture results across all the causative microorganisms, including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi.

### Urogenital cultures and preterm birth in women with cervical cerclage: a single center retrospective cohort study [^b53c29a4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective observational study aimed to investigate the relationship between pre- or post-cerclage urogenital cultures and GA at delivery in a contemporary cohort of women who underwent cervical cerclage. In line with our hypothesis, positive pre-cerclage cultures in clinically-indicated cerclage negatively influenced GA at delivery (p = 0.036). However, positive pre-cerclage urogenital cultures in history-indicated group had a positively influence on the GA at delivery (p = 0.021). Additionally, treating positive cultures did not significantly affect GA at delivery. The latter results should be interpreted with care, because of a small number of patients in some of the groups.

Our main findings are in line with two previous studies who reported that positive vaginal culture at time of clinically indicated cerclage is an independent risk factor for PTB. These two studies did also not find an association between post-cerclage positive vaginal cultures and GA at delivery, nor with treated abnormal vaginal flora and GA at delivery. Compared to our results, Gundabuttulaet et al. reported a higher incidence of positive pre-cerclage vaginal (64%) and urine (15%) cultures. In this study, the cultured organisms on vaginal swab were mostly Escherichia coli (14%), followed by Klebsiella (10%), Enterococcus (2%), Staphyloccous aureus (2%). In the second study, Kanbayashi et al. reported mainly GV (30%), followed by Group B streptococcus (25%) and Staphyloccocus species (8.3%) in pre-cerclage vaginal cultures. In contrast, we mainly cultured Streptococcus agalactiae (25%) and GV (13%) on the vaginal swab before clinically indicated cerclage. The heterogeneity between cultured micro-organisms from vaginal cultures in association with PTB suggest that multiple organisms could have an impact on PTB in clinically-indicated cerclage. Hence, we advise routine pre-cerclage culture tests and treatment of positive cultures in those undergoing a clinically-indicated cerclage.

### Optimizing reflex urine cultures: using a population-specific approach to diagnostic stewardship [^3ce94708]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians and laboratories routinely use urinalysis (UA) parameters to determine whether antimicrobial treatment and/or urine cultures are needed. Yet the performance of individual UA parameters and common thresholds for action are not well defined and may vary across different patient populations.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we included all encounters with UAs ordered 24 hours prior to a urine culture between 2015 and 2020 at 3 North Carolina hospitals. We evaluated the performance of relevant UA parameters as potential outcome predictors, including sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). We also combined 18 different UA criteria and used receiver operating curves to identify the 5 best-performing models for predicting significant bacteriuria (≥ 100,000 colony-forming units of bacteria/mL).

Results

In 221,933 encounters during the 6-year study period, no single UA parameter had both high sensitivity and high specificity in predicting bacteriuria. Absence of leukocyte esterase and pyuria had a high NPV for significant bacteriuria. Combined UA parameters did not perform better than pyuria alone with regard to NPV. The high NPV ≥ 0.90 of pyuria was maintained among most patient subgroups except females aged ≥ 65 years and patients with indwelling catheters.

Conclusion

When used as a part of a diagnostic workup, UA parameters should be leveraged for their NPV instead of sensitivity. Because many laboratories and hospitals use reflex urine culture algorithms, their workflow should include clinical decision support and or education to target symptomatic patients and focus on populations where absence of pyuria has high NPV.

### FAQs: urinary tract infection (UTI) events | NHSN… [^be99a983]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

100, 000 CFU/ml included in more than 1 laboratory category My lab offers culture counts that are: 75k-100, 000 CFU/ml > 100, 000 CFU/ml You must check with your laboratory to determine if they can identify whether at least 100, 000 CFU/ml are identified in the urine culture, and if yes, to report it as ≥ 100, 000 CFU/ml. Some laboratories have been able to clarify this. If the laboratory cannot clarify the culture count and cannot say for certain that a culture has at least 100, 000 CFU/ml, do not use that culture for NHSN UTI surveillance. The same is true for perineal flora, normal flora, and vaginal flora. Morphology determining what equates to > 2 organisms E. coli #1 > 100, 000 CFU/ml E. coli #2 > 10, 000 CFU/ml Staph Aureus > 100, 000 CFU/ml No. NHSN surveillance identification of an organism to the genus level or the species level, for example.

Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus species is as far as you can get for reporting purposes. The E. coli #1 and E. coli #2 is considered one organism, and then S. aureus would be considered the second organism. Antimicrobial susceptibility results and colony morphology difference do not equate to a report of separate organisms. This urine culture result is not > 2 organisms, and therefore, is an eligible specimen. 40, 000–50, 000 CFU/ml Klebsiella oxytoca > 100, 000 CFU/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa < 10, 000 CFU/ml Candida, not albicans No, the urine culture would be ineligible for use to meet NHSN UTI criteria, because there would be a total of three organisms present, including the candida. An excluded organism, such as candida, can be in a positive urine culture, however, there can only be one other organism present that has. Urine specimen source No.

Any urine specimen submitted for culture is eligible for review to see if that urine specimen meets NHSN UTI criteria.

OBJECTIVE To describe current practice around urine testing and identify factors leading to overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in community nursing homes (NHs) DESIGN Observational study of a stratified random sample of NH patients who had urine cultures ordered in NHs within a 1-month study period SETTING 31 NHs in North Carolina PARTICIPANTS 254 NH residents who had a urine culture ordered within the 1-month study period METHODS We conducted an NH record audit of clinical and laboratory information during the 2 days before and 7 days after a urine culture was ordered. We compared these results with the urine antibiogram from the 31 NHs. RESULTS Empirical treatment was started in 30% of cases. When cultures were reported, previously untreated cases received antibiotics 89% of the time for colony counts of ≥ 100,000 CFU/mL and in 35% of cases with colony counts of 10,000–99,000 CFU/mL. Due to the high rate of prescribing when culture results returned, 74% of these patients ultimately received a full course of antibiotics. Treated and untreated patients did not significantly differ in temperature, frequency of urinary signs and symptoms, or presence of Loeb criteria for antibiotic initiation. Factors most commonly associated with urine culture ordering were acute mental status changes (32%); change in the urine color, odor, or sediment (17%); and dysuria (15%). CONCLUSIONS Urine cultures play a significant role in antibiotic overprescribing. Antibiotic stewardship efforts in NHs should include reduction in culture ordering for factors not associated with infection-related morbidity as well as more scrutiny of patient condition when results become available.

### Voided midstream urine culture and acute cystitis in premenopausal women [^574c5c31]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

The cause of acute uncomplicated cystitis is determined on the basis of cultures of voided midstream urine, but few data guide the interpretation of such results, especially when gram-positive bacteria grow.

Methods

Women from 18 to 49 years of age with symptoms of cystitis provided specimens of midstream urine, after which we collected urine by means of a urethral catheter for culture (catheter urine). We compared microbial species and colony counts in the paired specimens. The primary outcome was a comparison of positive predictive values and negative predictive values of organisms grown in midstream urine, with the presence or absence of the organism in catheter urine used as the reference.

Results

The analysis of 236 episodes of cystitis in 226 women yielded 202 paired specimens of midstream urine and catheter urine that could be evaluated. Cultures were positive for uropathogens in 142 catheter specimens (70%), 4 of which had more than one uropathogen, and in 157 midstream specimens (78%). The presence of Escherichia coli in midstream urine was highly predictive of bladder bacteriuria even at very low counts, with a positive predictive value of 10² colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of 93% (Spearman's r = 0.944). In contrast, in midstream urine, enterococci (in 10% of cultures) and group B streptococci (in 12% of cultures) were not predictive of bladder bacteriuria at any colony count (Spearman's r = 0.322 for enterococci and 0.272 for group B streptococci). Among 41 episodes in which enterococcus, group B streptococci, or both were found in midstream urine, E. coli grew from catheter urine cultures in 61%.

Conclusions

Cultures of voided midstream urine in healthy premenopausal women with acute uncomplicated cystitis accurately showed evidence of bladder E. coli but not of enterococci or group B streptococci, which are often isolated with E. coli but appear to rarely cause cystitis by themselves.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^58da72d5]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

KAS 15 — urine specimen collection and culture pathway: Clinicians Should Obtain Urine Specimen by Bag, Spontaneous Void, or Stimulated Void for Urinalysis and, If Urinalysis Result Is Positive, Obtain a Catheterization or SPA Specimen for Culture, or Obtain Urine Specimen by Catheterization or SPA of Bladder for Urinalysis and, if Result Is Positive, for Culture. Evidence Quality: A, Strong Recommendation. A positive urinalysis result prompts initiation of empirical antimicrobial therapy, whereas a negative urinalysis result signifies a low likelihood of a UTI and obviates catheterization or SPA (if not already performed). Parents opposed to catheterization should be offered a choice of SPA and informed about the higher rate of ambiguous or false-positive culture results obtained from bagged or voided specimens.

Characteristics of the kidney transplant cohort

One hundred sixty-eight kidney transplant recipients provided a total of 510 fecal specimens in the first 3 months after transplantation. Fecal specimens were collected at post-transplant week 1, week 2, week 4, and week 12 and during episodes of diarrhea as well as during episodes of UTIs. Conventional urine cultures were performed at every routine clinic visit (twice weekly in the first month, weekly in the second month, every 2 weeks in the third month, and monthly up to 6 months), allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of bacteriuria in these subjects. 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing of the V4–V5 hypervariable region was performed on the 510 fecal specimens and the mean average ± standard deviation (SD) high quality classified reads were 18,179 ± 11,033.

Among the 168 kidney transplant recipients, 102 subjects developed bacteriuria (≥ 10,000 colony-forming units [cfu]/mL) (Bacteriuria Group) and 66 subjects did not in the first 6 months after transplantation (No Bacteriuria Group) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Differences in clinical and transplant characteristics are found in Supplementary Table 1. Female gender and older age were significantly associated with the Bacteriuria Group (P < 0.05). The five most abundant bacteria identified included: 36 subjects with Escherichia species (spp.) bacteriuria, 36 subjects with Enterococcus spp. bacteriuria, 20 subjects with Klebsiella spp. 44 subjects with Staphylococcus spp. and 19 subjects with Streptococcus spp. The full list of bacteriuria episodes and the organisms isolated are found in Supplementary Table 2.

Gut abundance and respective bacteriuria group

We evaluated the relative gut abundance of the five most abundant genera associated with bacteriuria (Escherichia, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) and its relationship to respective bacteriuria group within the first 3 months of transplantation (Fig. 1). The Escherichia relative gut abundance was significantly higher in the Escherichia Bacteriuria Group than in the No Escherichia Bacteriuria Group (Fig. 1a) (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test), and the Enterococcus relative gut abundance was significantly higher in the Enterococcus Bacteriuria Group than in the No Enterococcus Bacteriuria Group (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Fig. 1b). The relative gut abundances of Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus were not significantly higher in their respective Bacteriuria Group than in their respective No Bacteriuria Group (P > 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Fig. 1c–e).
