## Question

Low platelet in a healthy adult

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage low platelet count in a healthy adult. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true thrombocytopenia and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should verify severity and immediate bleeding risk. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis in a "healthy" adult, prioritize likely etiologies, and outline a staged diagnostic workup. After that, I need to align management with platelet count, bleeding phenotype, and patient-specific risk factors, including when to treat versus observe. Finally, I should address special scenarios like pregnancy, perioperative planning, and when to involve hematology, and close with a concise decision algorithm and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and exclude pseudothrombocytopenia, because platelet clumping, giant platelets, or EDTA artifacts can artifactually lower automated counts. I should request a manual platelet count on a peripheral smear and, if needed, collect blood in citrate or heparinized tubes to verify the true platelet number before labeling someone as thrombocytopenic [^3238e3a0].

> Next, I should review severity and bleeding risk, since management hinges on both. Mild thrombocytopenia is 100–149 × 10⁹/L, moderate 50–99 × 10⁹/L, and severe less than 50 × 10⁹/L. Spontaneous bleeding risk rises as counts fall below 50 × 10⁹/L and becomes substantial below 20 × 10⁹/L, though bleeding is unpredictable and not linearly related to count, so I need to ask about petechiae, easy bruising, mucosal bleeding, and menorrhagia, and examine for cutaneous bleeding signs [^90c7cfb2] [^39f0187b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology in a "healthy" adult. I should construct a prioritized differential that includes immune thrombocytopenia, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis C, inherited platelet disorders, bone marrow failure syndromes including myelodysplastic syndrome, pseudothrombocytopenia, and, less commonly, thrombotic microangiopathies or disseminated intravascular coagulation, tailoring pretest probabilities to age, sex, medications, and family history [^6950a17d] [^90c7cfb2].

> I will now examine the initial workup, because in a truly healthy adult with isolated thrombocytopenia, the first pass should be focused and cost-effective. I need a careful history of bleeding, recent infections, alcohol, and all prescription, OTC, and herbal agents; a targeted physical exam for stigmata of liver disease, infection, or autoimmune disease; a CBC with differential and indices; and a peripheral smear to assess platelet morphology, schistocytes, blasts, dysplasia, and red/white cell abnormalities, since smear findings can redirect the diagnosis toward TTP/HUS, DIC, MDS, or inherited macrothrombocytopenia [^6950a17d] [^c3866631].

> Wait, let me verify the need for bone marrow examination. In adults over 60 with isolated thrombocytopenia, the risk of hematologic malignancy is substantially elevated, so I should have a lower threshold to perform bone marrow aspirate/biopsy during hematology consultation, whereas in younger adults with a typical ITP phenotype, routine marrow is not required. Similarly, any cytopenias beyond thrombocytopenia, dysplasia on smear, or atypical features should prompt marrow evaluation rather than assuming ITP [^bae851ba] [^c68ead77] [^1508c449].

> Next, I should review secondary causes that are actionable. I need to check HIV and hepatitis C serologies in all adults with suspected ITP because results change management and treatment of the infection can improve platelets; I should also consider H. pylori testing in appropriate geographic contexts or refractory cases, and keep drug-induced thrombocytopenia in mind by correlating with initiation timelines and using resources like the Naranjo scale when needed [^4df5863d] [^a95d6bcb] [^997ad436].

> Let me consider inherited platelet disorders if there is a family history, lifelong thrombocytopenia, or abnormal platelet morphology. I should confirm with a smear, consider genetic testing in select cases, and remember that some inherited thrombocytopenias mimic ITP and are misdiagnosed without molecular evaluation, which can avert unnecessary immunosuppression [^1a1b083a] [^18dcfa77].

> I should double-check for pseudothrombocytopenia whenever the clinical picture is discordant, especially with very low automated counts but no bleeding. Repeating the count in citrate, reviewing a smear for platelet clumps, and communicating with the lab can prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment [^3238e3a0].

> Now, management should be aligned with platelet count, bleeding, and patient-specific risks. For platelets 50 × 10⁹/L or higher, observation with patient education is generally sufficient. For 30–49 × 10⁹/L, observation is reasonable if asymptomatic, with treatment if there is bleeding, high bleeding risk, or need for procedures. For less than 30 × 10⁹/L, treatment is usually indicated, particularly if less than 20 × 10⁹/L or if there is any bleeding, older age, antiplatelet/anticoagulant use, or comorbidities [^782995a3] [^b9bc75b5].

> But wait, what if the patient prefers to avoid steroids? I need to ensure shared decision-making. In newly diagnosed adults with platelets 30 × 10⁹/L or higher, ASH recommends against corticosteroids and favors observation given steroid toxicities and uncertain benefit at higher counts, whereas for counts less than 30 × 10⁹/L, a short course of corticosteroids is suggested, with either prednisone 0.5–2 mg/kg/day or dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days, limiting total steroid exposure to 6 weeks or less to mitigate adverse effects [^333ef55b] [^782995a3] [^b7e3cbb5].

> I should confirm escalation strategies if first-line therapy fails or if rapid count increase is needed. IVIG 1 g/kg once, with repeat dosing if needed, or anti-D in appropriate Rh-positive patients can be used with or without corticosteroids when a rapid rise is required, such as active bleeding or urgent procedures, recognizing that evidence quality varies and choices should be individualized [^4df5863d] [^d3a00920].

> Next, I should review second-line options for persistent or chronic ITP. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists and rituximab are reasonable alternatives to splenectomy, and splenectomy remains an option for refractory cases with counseling on infection risk and vaccination strategies. Emerging data and guideline updates continue to refine sequencing and safety, so I need to revisit evolving recommendations periodically [^0069e39a] [^d07b0421] [^71e3e3a4].

> Hold on, I should verify inpatient versus outpatient thresholds. Adults with newly diagnosed ITP and platelets less than 20 × 10⁹/L are generally managed as inpatients, whereas those with 20 × 10⁹/L or higher can be managed as outpatients with close follow-up, with the caveat that social determinants, diagnostic uncertainty, or significant comorbidities may lower the threshold for admission [^0457afe0] [^492ab6f5].

> I need to ensure follow-up cadence and safety netting. Newly diagnosed ITP warrants hematology follow-up within 24–72 hours, and patients should receive clear bleeding precautions, activity guidance, and instructions for urgent care if bleeding occurs. I should also monitor for corticosteroid side effects and reassess quality of life impacts during treatment [^c6226f45] [^63370acb] [^782995a3].

> Let me consider special scenarios. In pregnancy, mild thrombocytopenia is often gestational, but I should distinguish this from ITP and hypertensive disorders using history, smear, and serial counts, and coordinate peripartum planning with obstetrics. In perioperative patients, platelet thresholds vary by procedure, and transfusion decisions should balance bleeding risk against transfusion harms. In older adults, I should maintain a lower threshold for marrow evaluation and consider age-specific bleeding risks and comorbidities in treatment choices [^b25bb358] [^e42e98fa] [^313b8657] [^c1cc8799] [^de4f8842].

> I should double-check that I have not overlooked thrombotic microangiopathies. If there is anemia, renal dysfunction, neurologic symptoms, or schistocytes, I need to urgently evaluate for TTP/HUS and initiate appropriate therapy without delay, as this is a hematologic emergency with different management than ITP [^c3866631].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision pathway: confirm true thrombocytopenia and exclude spurious causes. Assess severity and bleeding. Obtain focused history, exam, CBC with differential, and smear. Screen for HIV and hepatitis C. Consider H. pylori or other secondary causes based on context. Manage according to count and bleeding: observe if 50 × 10⁹/L or higher, treat if less than 30 × 10⁹/L or if bleeding, using corticosteroids first-line with IVIG or anti-D when rapid effect is needed. Escalate to second-line agents if refractory. And arrange close hematology follow-up with patient education and safety planning throughout [^6950a17d] [^4df5863d] [^782995a3] [^0069e39a].

Low platelets in a healthy adult are defined as **< 150 × 10⁹/L** [^90c7cfb2] and are most often due to **immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)** [^90c7cfb2], drug effects, or viral infections (HIV, hepatitis C) [^a95d6bcb]. Initial evaluation should include a **CBC with smear**, medication review, and HIV/HCV testing [^4df5863d]; bone marrow biopsy is reserved for atypical features or age ≥ 60 [^bae851ba]. Management is guided by platelet count and bleeding: observe if ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L without bleeding [^333ef55b]; treat if < 30 × 10⁹/L or with bleeding, using corticosteroids or IVIG [^782995a3] [^4df5863d]. Most adults with ITP have a chronic course, but prognosis is favorable with modern therapy [^ebeb73d4].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count **< 150 × 10⁹/L** [^53a2bdad]. In healthy adults, counts below this threshold are abnormal and warrant evaluation [^90c7cfb2]. The clinical significance depends on severity: counts > 50 × 10⁹/L rarely cause symptoms, 30–50 × 10⁹/L may cause easy bruising, 10–30 × 10⁹/L increases bleeding risk with minor trauma, and < 10 × 10⁹/L carries a risk of spontaneous bleeding and is considered a hematologic emergency [^90c7cfb2].

## Common causes in healthy adults

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Immune-mediated | - Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) [^00102d57] <br/> - Drug-induced thrombocytopenia (e.g. heparin, antibiotics) [^5958fcb1] <br/> - Autoimmune disorders (e.g. SLE) [^notfound] |
| Infectious | - HIV [^a95d6bcb] <br/> - Hepatitis C [^a95d6bcb] <br/> - Epstein-Barr virus [^notfound] <br/> - Cytomegalovirus [^aa52a5c6] |
| Bone marrow disorders | - Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) [^cbccb1eb] <br/> - Aplastic anemia [^notfound] <br/> - Acute leukemia [^notfound] |
| Inherited | - Bernard-Soulier syndrome [^notfound] <br/> - Glanzmann thrombasthenia [^notfound] <br/> - MYH9-related disorders [^notfound] |
| Pseudothrombocytopenia | - Platelet clumping due to EDTA [^3238e3a0] <br/> - Cold agglutinins [^notfound] |

---

ITP is the **most common cause** of isolated thrombocytopenia in healthy adults, characterized by immune destruction of platelets [^00102d57].

---

## Initial diagnostic evaluation

A systematic approach is essential to identify the cause and guide management:

- **Confirm thrombocytopenia**: Repeat CBC with differential and peripheral smear to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia [^3238e3a0].
- **History and physical examination**: Assess bleeding symptoms, recent infections, medication use, family history, and signs of systemic disease [^6950a17d].
- **Laboratory tests**: HIV and hepatitis C serology [^a95d6bcb]; autoimmune screening (ANA, anti-dsDNA) if clinically indicated; liver function tests; renal function tests.
- **Bone marrow examination**: Consider if there are atypical features, abnormal smear, or age ≥ 60 years [^bae851ba] [^1508c449].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **cause, severity, and bleeding risk**:

- **Observation**: Appropriate for mild thrombocytopenia (≥ 30 × 10⁹/L) without bleeding symptoms [^333ef55b].
- **Corticosteroids**: First-line therapy for ITP with platelets < 30 × 10⁹/L or symptomatic patients [^782995a3].
- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: Rapid effect for severe thrombocytopenia or bleeding [^4df5863d].
- **Second-line therapies**: Rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (romiplostim, eltrombopag), or splenectomy for refractory cases [^0069e39a].
- **Treat underlying cause**: Discontinue offending drugs, treat infections, or manage systemic diseases [^90c7cfb2].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis varies by cause and response to therapy. ITP in adults is often chronic, but **modern treatments achieve durable remissions** in many patients [^ebeb73d4]. Severe thrombocytopenia (< 20 × 10⁹/L) increases bleeding risk, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, though this remains rare (about 1.4% in adults) [^39f0187b]. Overall, with appropriate management, most patients maintain a good quality of life and favorable long-term outcomes [^ebeb73d4].

---

Low platelets in a healthy adult are defined as **< 150 × 10⁹/L** and require a structured evaluation to determine the cause and guide management. ITP is the most common etiology, and treatment is tailored to platelet count, bleeding risk, and patient-specific factors, with most patients experiencing favorable outcomes.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^1a1b083a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to the pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most will be acquired (especially in adult patients), but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step: defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. We also intend to provide some guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytopenia? [^53b5bbef]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia, usually defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL, is a common reason for a hematology consult in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. In most patients, the cause of the thrombocytopenia can be identified and treated. This article reviews the clinical approach to the patient with thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms that underlie it, and the laboratory tests available to investigate it. A practical approach to the investigation and management of thrombocytopenia in the clinical settings commonly encountered by the hematology consultant is then described.

### Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in childhood: controversies and solutions [^f76ba39f]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding disorder in patients who are otherwise healthy and present with thrombocytopenia with normal red cells and leukocytes. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion and is in origin heterogeneous. The unknown etiology and the lack of clinical data from controlled prospective studies are reasons for controversies in diagnosis and management. Study endpoints traditionally include the velocity of platelet increase after drug intervention or observation, although a rapid elevation of the platelet count is of questionable clinical value. Evaluation of other endpoints is needed.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^6950a17d]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

### How I diagnose and treat thrombocytopenia in geriatric patients [^de4f8842]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Thrombocytopenia in older individuals is a common but diagnostically challenging condition that has variable clinical impact to those who are affected. Diagnostic approach requires evaluation of the preexisting clinical conditions, detailed review of medications, and assessment for disorders that warrant urgent treatment. In this article, we describe a systematic approach to diagnosis of thrombocytopenia and present a schematic review for management strategies. Three clinical scenarios are presented that are relevant for their prevalence and management challenges in an older adult population. The first scenario addresses primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and reviews different treatment options. The second one addresses complications of thrombocytopenia in management of the myelodysplastic syndrome. The last one reviews diagnostic challenges of drug-induced ITP.

### Pediatric ITP: is it different from adult ITP? [^9f387683]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has historically been thought to occur in 2 distinct forms: childhood ITP and adult ITP. This division is based largely on the presumption that childhood ITP is often benign and self-limited, whereas ITP in adults tends to be more chronic and difficult to treat. Although data exist to justify a different approach to the diagnosis and treatment in young children and the elderly, ITP in older children, adolescents, and younger adults is likely to share more similar pathology. This article will highlight the most recent data describing the natural history, diagnostic approach, management strategies, and disease-related outcomes in children and adults with ITP. These data reveal many unexpected similarities between the 2 groups, while confirming some of the more well-described differences. Discussion of these findings aims to highlight similarities and differences between ITP in children and adults, which will underscore important areas of future research and/or changes in management guidelines.

### Clinical updates in adult immune thrombocytopenia [^ebeb73d4]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs in 2 to 4/100000 adults and results in variable bleeding symptoms and thrombocytopenia. In the last decade, changes in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to the publication of new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ITP and standards for terminology. Current evidence supports alternatives to splenectomy for second-line management of patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding. Long-term follow-up data suggest both efficacy and safety, in particular, for the thrombopoietin receptor agonists and the occurrence of late remissions. Follow-up of patients who have undergone splenectomy for ITP reveals significant potential risks that should be discussed with patients and may influence clinician and patient choice of second-line therapy. Novel therapeutics are in development to address ongoing treatment gaps.

### Updated International Consensus Report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^b5ef6e82]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the last decade, there have been numerous developments and changes in treatment practices for the management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This article is an update of the International Consensus Report published in 2010. A critical review was performed to identify all relevant articles published between 2009 and 2018. An expert panel screened, reviewed, and graded the studies and formulated the updated consensus recommendations based on the new data. The final document provides consensus recommendations on the diagnosis and management of ITP in adults, during pregnancy, and in children, as well as quality-of-life considerations.

### International Consensus Report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^db2a6f3a]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Previously published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) require updating largely due to the introduction of new classes of therapeutic agents, and a greater understanding of the disease pathophysiology. However, treatment-related decisions still remain principally dependent on clinical expertise or patient preference rather than high-quality clinical trial evidence. This consensus document aims to report on new data and provide consensus-based recommendations relating to diagnosis and treatment of ITP in adults, in children, and during pregnancy. The inclusion of summary tables within this document, supported by information tables in the online appendices, is intended to aid in clinical decision making.

### Does my patient have a life-or limb-threatening thrombocytopenia? [^58f2c9fd]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of severe thrombocytopenias can be difficult, but is necessary to avoid significant morbidity and mortality. The causes of severe thrombocytopenias, often with a platelet count of less than 10 × 10(9)/L, include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the thrombotic microangiopathies, the catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, preeclampsia/HELLP, and posttransfusion purpura. This review provides a brief overview of the key clinical features of each of these major clinical entities, and strategies for their diagnostic workup and therapeutic management.

### Differential diagnosis and management of thrombocytopenia in childhood [^d2b6f5ec]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a firm knowledge of the major causes of thrombocytopenia and their treatments, and to form a broad differential diagnosis, so that it will be clearer when to consider a rare etiology. The various etiologies are presented by known disease entities, grouped by age, and described as they would occur and be considered in a realistic clinical setting. A brief categorization of causes of thrombocytopenia by mechanism, notably abnormal platelet production, platelet destruction, or sequestration, is included. With each disease process, the pathophysiology as it is currently known is described and discussed.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — inpatient versus outpatient management with platelet count < 20 × 10⁹/L: In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of < 20 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel suggests admission to the hospital rather than management as an outpatient (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯). In adults with an established diagnosis of ITP and a platelet count of < 20 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel suggests outpatient management rather than hospital admission (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯). Remarks specify that patients with social concerns, uncertainty about the diagnosis, significant comorbidities with risk of bleeding, and more significant mucosal bleeding may benefit from admission to the hospital; patients not admitted to the hospital should receive education and expedited follow-up with a hematologist, and the need for admission is also highly variable across the range of platelet counts represented (0 to 20 × 10⁹/L).

### The 2022 review of the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines on immune thrombocytopenia [^71e3e3a4]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

Regarding medical management for essential thrombocythemia, more specifically with respect to cytoreductive therapy, ELN 2018 guidelines recommend to avoid initiating cytoreductive therapy in otherwise low- or intermediate-risk patients with well-controlled cardiovascular risk factors. Initiate cytoreductive therapy in patients with ET as soon as they shift to the high-risk category by reaching the age of 60 years or by the occurrence of a major thrombotic or hemorrhagic event, or if platelet counts increase > 1, 500×10⁹/L.

### Perioperative thrombocytopenia: evidence, evaluation, and emerging therapies [^c1cc8799]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common perioperative clinical problem. While global haemostasis is influenced by many patient- and procedure-related factors, the contribution of thrombocytopenia to bleeding risk is difficult to predict, as platelet count does not linearly correlate with likelihood of bleeding. Thus, the widely used definition of thrombocytopenia and grading of its severity have limited clinical utility. We present a summary and analysis of the current recommendations for invasive procedures in thrombocytopenic patients, although the platelet count at which any given procedure may safely proceed is unknown. The benefits and risks of preoperative platelet transfusions should be assessed on a patient-by-patient basis, and alternatives to platelet transfusion should be considered. In non-emergent surgeries or in postoperative thrombocytopenic patients, haematology consultation should be considered to guide diagnostics and management. We present a pragmatic approach to the evaluation of perioperative thrombocytopenia.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^336ab654]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia — research priorities emphasize that the panel was able to make a strong recommendation for approximately one-fifth (5/21) of the prioritized questions and recommend methodological directions for future evidence generation. The panel recommends that collaborative cohort studies (retrospective and prospective), registries, and other observational studies addressing these issues could contribute much to improve the current levels of evidence and are likely more feasible than RCTs. These studies should apply standard dosing regimens and definitions, consistently report on patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL and side effects, and report long-term follow-up data. The panel also recommends ongoing collaborative engagement of patients to best understand how to apply these guidelines within the context of shared decision-making. Lastly, the panel recognizes that many of the management options covered in these recommendations are unavailable in certain countries; therefore global cost-effective strategies should also be assessed.

### Inherited thrombocytopenia: when a low platelet count does not mean ITP [^18dcfa77]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital thrombocytopenias, once considered rare and obscure conditions, are today recognized with increasing frequency, especially due to the measurement of platelet number as part of routine blood testing. The clinical spectrum of congenital thrombocytopenia ranges from severe bleeding diatheses, recognized within the first few weeks of life, to mild conditions that may remain undetected even in adulthood. For the latter group of diseases, distinguishing between inherited (primary) and acquired (secondary) thrombocytopenia, especially immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), is essential to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments. In this review, the congenital thrombocytopenia syndromes are discussed with specific attention focused on diagnostic criteria, clinical presentations, genetic etiology, and current medical management. The mutated genes responsible for each syndrome are reviewed as well as the potential implications for using gene therapy or gene repair in the future.

### Pathogen-reduced platelets for the prevention of bleeding in people of any age [^ec5f2f50]. JAMA Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

Are pathogen-reduced platelets as effective as standard platelets for the prevention of bleeding in people of any age requiring platelet transfusions?

Bottom Line

In people with cancer who have a low platelet count due to their disease or its treatment, pathogen-reduced platelet transfusions increase risk of platelet refractoriness and platelet transfusion requirement (high-quality evidence) but probably do not effect all-cause mortality, risk of clinically significant or severe bleeding, or risk of a serious adverse event (moderate-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence for people with other diagnoses.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: can we change outcomes? [^b43f6486]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, prevention of bleeding, and inducing remission. Current standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable. This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### Campylobacter jejuni and cytopenias [^6fba9715]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in a febrile patient are not uncommon and may be a diagnostic clue in patients without an alternative explanation for cytopenias. This has not been reported in Campylobacter jejuni infections.

Methods

A healthy patient with fever, rigors, and an acute diarrheal illness was noted to have a white blood cell count of 2.65 × 10(9)/L and platelet level of 125 × 10(9)/L. Retrospective chart review of all adult C. jejuni stool-positive cases admitted over 1 year revealed leukopenia in 6 of 20 (30%), thrombocytopenia in 5 of 20 (25%), and both in 1 of 20 (5%).

Results

Cytopenias were mild, transient, and not associated with prolonged hospital stay or complications.

Conclusions

Acute C. jejuni infections should be added to the differential diagnosis of acute febrile illnesses that may be associated with leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Cytopenias can be an important diagnostic clue in febrile illnesses, and their differential is presented.

### Chronic immune thrombocytopenia in adults: epidemiology and clinical presentation [^82e8c908]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Data concerning the prevalence of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) among adults are limited and are confounded by lack of concordance of definitions of stage of disease. In the largest series of outpatients, prevalence has been estimated to range from 5.6 to 20 per 100,000 population and increases with advancing age. A female predominance is most pronounced among middle-aged patients, and no racial variation is apparent. Adult patients with chronic ITP may have a better prognosis than previously thought, although bleeding risk increases dramatically in association with severe thrombocytopenia and older age; a small minority of patients may recover spontaneously. More systematic analyses, with standardized definitions of cases and adequate duration of follow up, are needed.

### The prevalence and clinical significance of preoperative thrombocytopenia in adults undergoing elective surgery: an observational cohort study [^8ba9c3c8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative thrombocytopenia is associated with inferior outcomes in surgical patients, though concurrent anemia may obfuscate these relationships. This investigation assesses the prevalence and clinical significance of preoperative thrombocytopenia with thorough consideration of preoperative anemia status.

Methods

This is an observational cohort study of adults undergoing elective surgery with planned postoperative hospitalization from January 1, 2009 to May 3, 2018. Patients were designated into 4 groups: normal platelet and hemoglobin concentrations, isolated thrombocytopenia (ie, platelet count < 100 × 109/L), isolated anemia (ie, hemoglobin < 12 g/dL women, < 13.5 g/dL men), and thrombocytopenia with anemia. Thrombocytopenia was further defined as incidental (ie, previously undiagnosed) or nonincidental. Multivariable regression analyses were utilized to assess the relationships between thrombocytopenia status and clinical outcomes, with a primary outcome of hospital length of stay.

Results

A total of 120,348 patients were included for analysis: 72.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 72.1–72.6) normal preoperative laboratory values, 26.3% (26.1–26.6) isolated anemia, 0.80% (0.75–0.86) thrombocytopenia with anemia, and 0.52% (0.48–0.56) isolated thrombocytopenia (0.38% [0.34–0.41] nonincidental, 0.14% [0.12–0.17] incidental). Thrombocytopenia was associated with longer hospital length of stay in those with concurrent anemia (multiplicative increase of the geometric mean 1.05 [1.00, 1.09] days; P = 0.034) but not in those with normal preoperative hemoglobin concentrations (multiplicative increase of the geometric mean 1.02 [0.96, 1.07] days; P = 0.559). Thrombocytopenia was associated with increased odds for intraoperative transfusion regardless of anemia status (nonanemic: 3.39 [2.79, 4.12]; P < .001 vs anemic: 2.60 [2.24, 3.01]; P < .001). Thrombocytopenia was associated with increased rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in nonanemic patients (1.56 [1.18, 2.05]; P = 0.002) but not in those with preoperative anemia (0.93 [0.73, 1.19]; P = 0.578).

Conclusions

Preoperative thrombocytopenia is associated with clinical outcomes in elective surgery, both in the presence and absence of concurrent anemia. However, isolated thrombocytopenia is rare (0.5%) and is usually identified before preoperative testing. It is unlikely that routine thrombocytopenia screening is indicated for most patients.

Grading of recommendations — interpretation of strong versus conditional: The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends… ") or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests… ") and has defined interpretations. For patients, strong means most individuals would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, whereas conditional means the majority would want the suggested course of action but many would not and decision aids may be useful. For clinicians, strong means most individuals should follow the recommended course of action, while conditional indicates different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2019 immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) guideline — corticosteroids versus observation in newly diagnosed adults: In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel suggests corticosteroids rather than management with observation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), with a remark that there may be a subset for whom observation might be appropriate based on severity of thrombocytopenia, additional comorbidities, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, need for upcoming procedures, and patients' values and preferences. For patients with a platelet count of ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel recommends against corticosteroids and in favor of management with observation (strong recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), noting that for patients at the lower end of this threshold; for those with additional comorbidities, anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, upcoming procedures; and for elderly patients (> 60 years old), treatment with corticosteroids may be appropriate. A good practice statement specifies that the treating physician should ensure that the patient is adequately monitored for potential corticosteroid side effects and should conduct an assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (depression, fatigue, mental status, etc) while patients are receiving corticosteroids.

### Increased risk of haematological malignancy in adults over age 60 with thrombocytopenia compared with matched controls: time for an upfront bone marrow evaluation? [^bae851ba]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

International societies have conflicting recommendations on whether bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (BMB) is needed during workup for isolated thrombocytopenia. Our objective was to determine if thrombocytopenia in patients aged ≥ 60years is associated with an increased incidence of haematological malignancy. We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study in patients aged ≥ 60years between January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2019. Exposed patients had specialist consultation for thrombocytopenia, with platelet count < 100×10 9 /L, but normal haemoglobin and white blood cell count. Unexposed patients were those who never had specialist consultation for thrombocytopenia and whose platelets were ≥ 100×10 9 /L. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of haematological malignancy using a competing risk of death model. During 4.0years (IQR 2.2–6.7) of follow-up, 378/4930 exposed (19.1/1000PY, 95% CI 17.1–21.0), and 204/17556 unexposed patients (2.5/1000PY, 95% CI 2.2–2.8) were diagnosed with haematological malignancy (HR 15.5 (95% CI 11.3–21.4, p < 0.0001) in year 1, and 5.3 (95% CI 4.4–6.6, p < 0.0001) in years 2+). This finding persisted in analyses stratified by sex, age, severity, or duration of thrombocytopenia, and treatment with corticosteroids within 2weeks of consultation. This study found a strong association between isolated thrombocytopenia and haematological malignancy in patients ≥ 60years, supporting consideration of diagnostic testing including BMB during outpatient specialist consultation.

### Thrombocytopenia [^90c7cfb2]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of less than 150 × 10(3) per µL. It is often discovered incidentally when obtaining a complete blood count during an office visit. The etiology usually is not obvious, and additional investigation is required. Patients with platelet counts greater than 50 × 10(3) per µL rarely have symptoms. A platelet count from 30 to 50 × 10(3) per µL rarely manifests as purpura. A count from 10 to 30 × 10(3) per µL may cause bleeding with minimal trauma. A platelet count less than 5 × 10(3) per µL may cause spontaneous bleeding and constitutes a hematologic emergency. Patients who present with thrombocytopenia as part of a multisystem disorder usually are ill and require urgent evaluation and treatment. These patients most likely have an acute infection, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, liver disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or a hematologic disorder. During pregnancy, preeclampsia and the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome are associated with thrombocytopenia. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia commonly have drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pseudothrombocytopenia, or if pregnant, gestational thrombocytopenia. A history, physical examination, and laboratory studies can differentiate patients who require immediate intervention from those who can be treated in the outpatient setting. Treatment is based on the etiology and, in some cases, treating the secondary cause results in normalization of platelet counts. Consultation with a hematologist should be considered if patients require hospitalization, if there is evidence of systemic disease, or if thrombocytopenia worsens despite initial treatment.

The evidence review "included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that had internal comparators", and due to scarcity also "included all single-arm prospective studies of ≥ 50 adults with newly diagnosed ITP" and, for observation, "retrospective studies of ≥ 50 adults". No direct comparative studies were found: "We found no studies that directly compared corticosteroids vs management with observation in adult patients with ITP with a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L", though "We found 5 RCTs… and 2 prospective studies" of corticosteroids. Reported outcomes included "Four studies reported data on response within 7 days; 6 studies reported on remission; 3 studies reported on major bleeding; 4 studies reported on mortality; 0 studies reported on overall HRQoL", and "There were no studies in ITP patients with platelet counts of < 30 × 10⁹/L who were managed with observation alone". Consequently, "The relative effects were not estimable from the data because of a lack of direct comparisons".

### How do we diagnose immune thrombocytopenia in 2018? [^6341a9bd]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

In this report, we will review the various clinical and laboratory approaches to diagnosing immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), with a focus on its laboratory diagnosis. We will also summarize the results from a number of laboratories that have applied techniques to detect anti-platelet autoantibodies as diagnostic tests for ITP. Although there is considerable variability in methods among laboratories, there is general agreement that platelet autoantibody testing has a high specificity but low sensitivity. This suggests several possibilities: (1) the ideal test for ITP has yet to be developed, (2) current test methods need to be improved, or (3) ITP is the clinical expression of a variety of thrombocytopenic disorders with different underlying mechanisms. Even the clinical diagnosis of ITP is complex, and experienced clinicians do not always agree on whether a particular patient has ITP. Improvements in the diagnostic approach to ITP are necessary to improve the management of this disorder.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This network meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the PRISMA extension statement. The research was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022296179). PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched by two researchers independently to find relevant articles up to April 31, 2022. For multiple reported data of an outcome in the same trial, only the most recent data was kept. The detailed search strategy was shown in Appendix p 1. Then we screened the eligible studies by skimming through the titles and abstract of these articles. We included published phase II/III RCTs reported in English that met the following inclusion criteria: Trials that enrolled patients (age ≥ 18 years) with previously untreated, newly diagnosed (≤ 3 months), primary immune thrombocytopenia who had platelet count of less than 30 × 10 9 /L or a platelet count of less than 50 × 10 9 /L and clinically significant bleeding symptoms. To expand diversity of treatment options, this study includes latest conference abstract. We excluded trials with secondary or chronic or refractory or relapsed primary immune thrombocytopenia or with receiving previous treatments. Patients who are pregnant or under 18 years and articles not written in English were also excluded.

Two researchers extracted data independently. If they have a contradiction, they reach consensus by negotiation or seeking help for the senior researchers. Main data of qualified trials such as study ID, first author, publication year, number of patients, treatments and outcomes were extracted into a spreadsheet for further analysis. Two investigators independently extracted data parameters using a unified data extraction form.

Data analysis

The primary outcomes were 6-month sustained response and early response. Secondary outcome was grade 3 or higher adverse events (≥ 3 AEs). All available direct and indirect evidence was synthesised to compare different treatments in terms of efficacy and safety, reported as odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% credible intervals (CrI).

Two investigators (Y.W. and L.S.) independently assessed risk of bias of individual studies. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved by M.X. and M.H. to reach a consensus. The bias risk of included trials was assessed as low, high, or unclear using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool with the following aspects: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias.

### Immune thrombocytopenia [^5a56a26e]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by autoimmune-mediated platelet destruction and impairment of thrombopoiesis. ITP may occur in the absence of an evident predisposing etiology (primary ITP) or secondary to a growing list of associated conditions (secondary ITP), and must be differentiated from other causes of thrombocytopenia. This review focuses on primary ITP in adults. The traditional goal of therapy in this population is to achieve a hemostatic platelet count of 30×10(9)/L or above for most patients while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. This approach has been called into question by the recent advent of well-tolerated and effective agents for the management of ITP, including pulse-dose dexamethasone, rituximab, and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists. Recent studies suggest the potential for aggressive therapy at the time of diagnosis to alter the natural history of ITP and point to the importance of quality-of-life considerations in therapeutic decision making.

### How different are blood platelets from women or men, and young or elderly people? [^0bf3ee25]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Age, sex and platelets. Some characteristics of human platelets vary according to age and sex. The changes in platelet count are emblematic. The number of platelets decreases with age and after 15 years of age, women have more platelets than men.

The reasons why platelet count and/or some platelet function parameters (and perhaps the response to antiplatelet drugs) vary by age and sex (and possibly by other factors, such as different lifestyles) remain speculative at present. The differences between platelet counts of individuals adhering or not to a Mediterranean diet, as well as those reported in the Letter by Sabrkhany et al.are statistically significant, but quite small in absolute terms. Although it is obvious that statistical significance does not necessarily imply biological or clinical relevance, it has been observed that a difference of only 10,000 platelets/mL corresponds to an average of 50 billion circulating platelets. On the other hand, very small variations in platelet count were reported in men at different 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Only a few thousand circulating platelets are reportedly able to prevent serious hemorrhage in adults with acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, even minor changes in platelet number and/or function could be associated with different phenotypes and lead to different health outcomes, such as neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

The following statement made by Giulio Bizzozero in 1882 "it is hardly permitted to assume that elements represented in blood in a constant fashion and at great number, as is the case for blood platelets, are active only under abnormal or pathological conditions. Their physiological significance therefore remains to be investigated… " is still worth consideration. Adopting personalized, sex- and agematched controls of platelet number and/or platelet-derived biomarkers will help the studies of platelet (micro)variability in health and disease. This may open a new interesting window on platelet physiology and will also contribute to better targeted and successful antiplatelet therapy. For example, in a meta-analysis of 53 different studies (and 6,450 individuals) on aspirin-treated normal subjects or cardiovascular patients, the response variability to aspirin, as assessed by the point-of-care platelet function test PFA-100, was similar between men and women, but populations with higher mean age had a significantly higher prevalence of non-responders to aspirin than those with a lower mean age.

### The safety and effectiveness of pegfilgrastim to reduce cancer chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in real-world practice in Japan: a post-marketing surveillance study [^026d3621]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

While thrombocytopenia was not designated as an AE of special interest, serious thrombocytopenia cases were observed in the past and a study using data from MID-NET® database showed an increased risk of thrombocytopenia by pegfilgrastim administration (adjusted OR 7.4 vs. no treatment; 95% CI 2.0–28.1). Therefore, we paid special attention to thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was not observed very frequently (43 patients, 2.9% in total) and most AEs were mild. Thrombocytopenia was previously observed with administration of pegfilgrastim at 3.6 mg or 7.2 mg (66.7% and 78.3%, respectively) in Japanese healthy adults; all these AEs were mild. In a study conducted in the United States, pegfilgrastim at 30, 60, 100, or 300 µg/kg in healthy adults caused changes in platelet count from the baseline of − 11.7% (− 50%, 36%) (median (min, max) in all adults with any dose). These studies suggest a slight effect of pegfilgrastim on platelet production when administered alone and that it would be clinically not significant. Clinically significant thrombocytopenia was observed in this survey when pegfilgrastim was combined with chemotherapy regimens with strong bone marrow suppression (e.g. platinum-based chemotherapy). Thus, caution for thrombocytopenia is required depending on the chemotherapy regimen or medical history of individual patients. Nonetheless, the occurrence and frequency are as already known from previous studies and no new safety signal was observed.

General evaluation components include comparison of platelet counts before and during pregnancy and a thorough evaluation of bleeding history and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and knowing that 25%–46% of healthy patients without a bleeding diathesis will have at least 1 symptom normally associated with a bleeding diathesis supports determining whether further workup is needed before admission for delivery.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^3238e3a0]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platelets play an important role in hemostasis, as evidenced by the fact that defects in their number or function are associated with bleeding diatheses. In addition, the platelet count has important implications in the evaluation of patients with a variety of disorders. It is, therefore, extremely important for the treating physician to be able to rely on accurate estimations of the number of circulating platelets. For example, the severity of abnormalities of the platelet count guides decision-making on patients' treatment. Despite greatly improved efficiency and performance with the widespread availability of automated hematology analyzers in routine and specialized laboratories, there are still technical and biological variables that hamper their diagnostic accuracy. This review describes the most common and important conditions that are associated with inaccurate platelet counting resulting in spuriously low platelet counts.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) guideline — panel, scope, and key emphases: In 2016, ASH formed a multidisciplinary panel including 9 clinical experts, 5 pediatric clinical experts, 2 methodologists with expertise in ITP, and 2 patient representatives, used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach with evidence-to-decision frameworks to appraise evidence up to May 2017, and agreed on 21 recommendations covering management of ITP in adults and children with newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic disease refractory to first-line therapy who have non–life-threatening bleeding; management approaches included observation, corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, rituximab, splenectomy, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists. The background notes minimal randomized-trial data to assist management, and the conclusions state there was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations, that strategies avoiding medication side effects were favored, that a large focus was placed on shared decision-making (especially second-line therapy), and that future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^aa52a5c6]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

What if the immune thrombocytopenia is secondary to a subclinical viral infection?

Multiple viruses have been associated with ITP. In children, ITP is often thought to be a post-infectious sequela. There may also be an underlying viral disease which is asymptomatic and thus eludes detection. It remains unclear whether all patients with ITP should be screened for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus; with the coronavirus pandemic, it might be appropriate to screen for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Treatment of these three viral infections would alter ITP management. The primary treatment for both hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus would likely increase the platelet count. However, if hepatitis C has progressed to cirrhosis, the platelet effects of antiviral treatment may be limited. Another viral infection that could be subclinical is cytomegalovirus which might be revealed only by atypical lymphocytes and/or mildly elevated liver tests. Cytomegalovirus can worsen ITP in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments because these agents will activate the cytomegalovirus and thus worsen the ITP making it more resistant to treatment. Helicobacter pylori may "cause" ITP, but only in certain places, e.g. Japan and Italy, is searching for it at diagnosis of ITP routine and is its eradication a uniformly effective approach to ITP.

### ITP in the 21st century [^a2cee839]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

Immune (or idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is commonly encountered by the practicing hematologist. Clinical management decisions have traditionally been guided by individual training and past experience. Input from the literature has been more from observational reports of case series than from scientific results of hypothesis-driven research. Practice guidelines and several surveys of clinical hematology practice have highlighted important questions in the field, and in the past 5 to 10 years both clinical and laboratory investigations have produced valuable new information. Thrombopoietin levels are normal or only slightly increased in ITP, and stimulation of thrombopoiesis appears to be a promising new therapeutic approach in clinical trials. Chronic, refractory ITP in children or adults remains a challenge for the hematologist. It is this group that has the greatest risk of serious bleeding, particularly among the elderly. The anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody, anti-CD20, has shown benefit in phase I/II clinical trials in patients who had failed a number of previous therapeutic modalities. The standard for clinical research into therapy for ITP has become evidence-based medicine, and more prospective, randomized clinical trials are being completed by multi-institutional study groups.

### Clinical, biochemical, and hematological characteristics of community-dwelling adolescent and young adult males with anorexia nervosa [^5ebbac4c]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Data regarding clinical characteristics in males with AN are limited. We aimed to delineate clinical, biochemical, and hematological features in community-dwelling adolescent and young adult males with AN.

Method

A retrospective chart review of electronic medical records from 2000 to 2016 was conducted for 53 males aged 10-23years old; AN (n = 36) and healthy controls (n = 17) were similar for Tanner stage.

Results

Adolescent and young adult males with AN were diagnosed at a mean age of 15.9 ± 3.0years. The most prevalent strategy for weight loss (following calorie restriction) was over-exercising. Labs demonstrated polycythemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, but no electrolyte abnormalities. Compared with healthy controls of similar Tanner stage, males with AN had lower total testosterone levels. A significant proportion of males with AN had traumatic bone fractures.

Discussion

Over-exercising is a common secondary weight loss strategy in males with AN. Testosterone levels are lower than in controls, but electrolyte abnormalities are rare. With enhanced provider awareness, diagnostic delays may be prevented.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2011 immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults — initial diagnosis and first-line therapy — We recommend testing patients for HCV and HIV (grade 1B*); We suggest further investigations if there are abnormalities (other than thrombocytopenia and perhaps findings of iron deficiency) in the blood count or smear (grade 2C) and that a bone marrow examination is not necessary irrespective of age for patients presenting with typical ITP (grade 2C); For first-line treatment, We suggest IVIG be used with corticosteroids when a more rapid increase in platelet count is required (grade 2B), either IVIG or anti-D in appropriate patients be used as a first-line treatment if corticosteroids are contraindicated (grade 2C), and that if IVIG is used, the dose should initially be 1 g/kg as a 1-time dose; this dosage may be repeated if necessary (grade 2B).

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^5958fcb1]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

An important cause of thrombocytopenia in elderly patients is myelodysplastic syndrome. A bone marrow examination is necessary to diagnose this condition. Typically, marrow will be hyperplastic, but marrow cells will be undergoing apoptosis and not producing mature blood cells and reveal dyspoiesis. Diagnostics have improved remarkably as has clinical discrimination of different subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome. Nonetheless. cases of myelodysplastic syndrome early in their evolution may be difficult to distinguish from "difficult" ITP.

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is a possibility since older patients may be taking more medications. Limited laboratory testing is available to demonstrate that thrombocytopenia is drug-induced. Diagnosis generally relies on recognizing medications likely to cause thrombocytopenia; one approach is to change medications if any are newly initiated. Viral infections could also occur in this population e.g. hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus.

Patients over the age of 60 are thought to have a higher likelihood of fatal and non-fatal serious bleeding compared to younger patients ;77–79 recent studies of intracranial hemorrhage have supported earlier findings demonstrating a higher risk in those above 60 years of age. Thus, it may be appropriate to pursue an aggressive approach in this patient, such as the addition of IVIG to steroids.

Which second-line treatment is optimal for a 63-year-old male?

Rituximab in an older male

In this case of ITP, the older man has a reasonable likelihood of a response but, even if he responds well, his response will very likely last only 6–12 months. The chance of a long-term (> 1 year) response is low. Furthermore, as discussed previously, after rituximab it would not be possible to vaccinate the patient against SARS-CoV-2, which is important since this 63-year-old is in a high-risk group and would benefit from boosters. As indicated, there is a 10–20% possibility of developing significant hypogammaglobulinemia when the combination of dexamethasone with rituximab is used. A good initial response followed by the expected relapse would allow rituximab to be reused, but it remains unlikely to lead to a cureand the probability of hypogammaglobulinemia occurring is thought to increase with repeated use.

### Impact of baseline thrombocytopenia on early outcomes in patients with acute venous thromboembolism [^91c43c71]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, thrombocytopenia is associated with significantly worse short‐term prognosis for PE patients, less for isolated DVT. The findings of our study underscore the need for a nuanced approach to managing VTE in patients with thrombocytopenia. Moderate thrombocytopenia is not substantially safer than severe thrombocytopenia inviting a paradigm shift in treatment strategies, ensuring that all thrombocytopenic patients receive the vigilant care necessary to mitigate the risks of adverse outcomes.

### Adolescents and young adults with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia [^d51a259b]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by increased platelet destruction and impaired production. Most textbooks and practice guidelines describe pediatric ITP as acute and profound but self-limiting, with a low risk of life-threatening bleeding in the majority of patients. In contrast, adult ITP is a chronic disease with an insidious onset of bleeding that is sometimes diagnosed incidentally. Adult ITP carries a high risk of severe bleeding in patients with a platelet count of < 20–30×10 9 /L, with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients aged > 60 years. Platelet-enhancing therapy is usually advised for adults with severe thrombocytopenia, especially the elderly or those with comorbidities. In contrast, a watch-and-wait strategy is recommended for children with non-severe bleeding. Recently, comparative studies in children and adults demonstrated unexpected similarities in the clinical and laboratory findings of both groups, particularly at disease onset, although differences in long-term prognosis and some aspects of patient management have been confirmed.

Adolescents and young adults (AYAS) are recognized as a specific age group with symptoms, disease course, treatment goals, side effects, needs, and expectations that differ from children and adults. AYAS are of particular interest in oncology and transition medicine. Characteristic features of AYAS include a high disease burden and poor compliance. The disease and treatment may negatively affect their personal development. Some treatment difficulties in this age group can be partly attributed to their physiological development. Adolescents have rapid hormonal, behavioral, and social changes, all of which can potentially modify the disease or symptoms. There is no international consensus on the definition of AYAS. In the literature, age differs from 12–16 years at the lower and 25–40 years at the upper limit.

AYAS are poorly studied in ITP-related literature, and clinical studies in this specific age group are lacking. Recommendations for AYAS with ITP are usually not covered by practice guidelines; therefore, the institutions providing care guide treatment options, are often designed exclusively for children or adults. However, in most ITP studies, the median age of patient cohorts is > 40–50 years for adults, and < 10 years for children. Thus, treatment goals and guidelines for AYAS are biased.

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^313b8657]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical setting 2 — adult patients having minor invasive procedures — features two weak AABB suggestions: Recommendation 2 states the AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for elective central venous catheter placement with a platelet count less than 20 × 10⁹ cells/L (quality of evidence: low; strength: weak), and Recommendation 3 states the AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for elective diagnostic lumbar puncture with a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹ cells/L (quality of evidence: very low; strength: weak). The rationale notes that serious bleeding complications after CVC placement are rare and often unrelated to the platelet count, that this recommendation is intended to be broadly applicable to adult patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, and that the LP threshold is intended for simple diagnostic or therapeutic LPs only.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^a85bb8f6]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Definition of terms in 2019 ASH guideline on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — standardized thresholds for responses, disease phases, and bleeding severity are specified. Corticosteroid-dependent is defined as ongoing need for continuous prednisone > 6 mg/d (or corticosteroid equivalent) or frequent corticosteroid courses to maintain a platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and/or to avoid bleeding. Response categories include durable response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling of the baseline count at 6 mo), early response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling baseline at 1 wk), and initial response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling baseline at 1 mo). Disease duration terms are newly diagnosed ITP (ITP duration of < 3 mo), persistent ITP (ITP duration of 3–12 mo), and chronic ITP (ITP duration of ≥ 12 mo), and remission is platelet count > 100 × 10⁹/L at 12 mo. Bleeding severity includes major bleeding defined as (1) WHO grade 3 or 4 bleeding, (2) Buchanan severe grade, (3) Bolton-Maggs and Moon "major bleeding", (4) IBLS grade 2 or higher, or (5) life-threatening or intracerebral hemorrhage bleeding, whereas minor bleeding is any bleeding not meeting the criteria for "major bleeding".

NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes — management of thrombocytopenia notes that severe thrombocytopenia is associated with an increased risk for bleeding events and is currently managed with platelet transfusions. The mechanism of thrombocytopenia in patients with MDS may be attributed to decreased platelet production related to endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO) pathways and increased destruction of bone marrow megakaryocytes or circulating platelets. Compared with healthy individuals, patients with MDS have increased endogenous TPO levels and decreased TPO receptor sites per platelet. High endogenous TPO levels correlated with decreased platelet counts in patients with RA, but not in patients with MDS-EB or MDS-EB-T.

### Heterogeneity of terminology and clinical definitions in adult idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: a critical appraisal from literature analysis [^27e59d33]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

We have carried out a literature review on diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in adults, based on the articles published during the years 2000–2005, aimed at assessing the variability in the terminology and clinical definitions. A total of 85 articles were considered eligible. In particular, the platelet level for initiating treatment, the definition of response to treatment in terms of platelet count and timing, the evaluation of bleeding symptoms, the criteria to define chronic and refractory forms were compared in the different articles. The study revealed confounding terminology and an unacceptable heterogeneity for clinical definitions relevant to management decisions and outcomes reporting.

### Identification of occult cerebral microbleeds in adults with immune thrombocytopenia [^96f1bcb8]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Management of symptoms and prevention of life-threatening hemorrhage in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) must be balanced against adverse effects of therapies. Because current treatment guidelines based on platelet count are confounded by variable bleeding phenotypes, there is a need to identify new objective markers of disease severity for treatment stratification. In this cross-sectional prospective study of 49 patients with ITP and nadir platelet counts < 30 × 109/L and 18 aged-matched healthy controls, we used susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to detect cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) as a marker of occult hemorrhage. CMBs were detected using a semiautomated method and correlated with clinical metadata using multivariate regression analysis. No CMBs were detected in health controls. In contrast, lobar CMBs were identified in 43% (21 of 49) of patients with ITP; prevalence increased with decreasing nadir platelet count (0/4, ≥ 15 × 109/L; 2/9, 10–14 × 109/L; 4/11, 5–9 × 109/L; 15/25 < 5 × 109/L) and was associated with longer disease duration (P = 7 × 10–6), lower nadir platelet count (P = 0.005), lower platelet count at time of neuroimaging (P = 0.029), and higher organ bleeding scores (P = 0.028). Mucosal and skin bleeding scores, number of previous treatments, age, and sex were not associated with CMBs. Occult cerebral microhemorrhage is common in patients with moderate to severe ITP. Strong associations with ITP duration may reflect CMB accrual over time or more refractory disease. Further longitudinal studies in children and adults will allow greater understanding of the natural history and clinical and prognostic significance of CMBs.

### Cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia elucidate the syndrome [^78520959]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can have a dramatic presentation and often an unfortunate outcome. Each episode has the real potential to result in clinical catastrophe. From the > 100 such patients that we see yearly, patients have been selected to illustrate aspects of HIT such as history, epidemiology, clinical features, and improving treatment strategies. Delayed recognition continues to contribute to the morbidity and mortality of these patients. It is not adequate to just stop heparin therapy even with isolated HIT, therapy with low-molecular-weight heparins is contraindicated, and care must be used not to initiate warfarin therapy early or unopposed. A moderate suspicion for HIT should trigger the institution of therapy with an alternative anticoagulant even before laboratory confirmation. The potential beneficial impact of therapy with direct thrombin inhibitors makes it more important to maintain awareness of and vigilance for this syndrome.
