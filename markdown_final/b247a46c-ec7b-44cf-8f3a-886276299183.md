## Question

Metastatic osteosarcoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about metastatic osteosarcoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions, epidemiology, and prognostic context. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care treatment framework for primary metastatic disease. Next, I will examine prognostic factors that drive outcomes and how they modify management. After that, I should review special scenarios like indeterminate pulmonary nodules, multifocal disease, and extraskeletal osteosarcoma. I will then assess evidence gaps and controversies, including chemotherapy intensification and immunotherapy. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and surveillance, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and baseline prognosis. Metastatic osteosarcoma is defined by clinically detectable distant disease at diagnosis, most commonly pulmonary, with bone as the next frequent site, and it accounts for roughly 10–20% of new presentations, though some series report up to 20–25% depending on detection sensitivity and cohort selection, and the 5-year overall survival remains poor at approximately 20–30% despite modern therapy, which is substantially lower than the 60–70% survival seen in localized disease [^115GBoHt] [^1137HnaX] [^116DkaTX] [^116T2hPo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment without anchoring the standard approach. I need to ensure the framework aligns with high-quality guidance. The cornerstone is curative-intent multimodality therapy: neoadjuvant multiagent chemotherapy, surgical resection of the primary tumor and all metastatic sites when feasible, and adjuvant chemotherapy, with the MAP backbone (high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin) widely used and ifosfamide commonly added in metastatic presentations; this approach is consistently endorsed by NCCN and ESMO-aligned guidelines and supported by cooperative group experience [^115r24Sf] [^116MQB7P] [^1179rBiS] [^1137HnaX].

> Wait, let me verify the prognostic determinants that truly change management. The number of metastases at diagnosis and the ability to achieve complete surgical remission are the most powerful independent predictors; patients with one or two metastases fare far better than those with three or more, and those who undergo complete resection of all disease have markedly improved survival compared with those in whom surgery is incomplete or not feasible, with long-term survival approaching that of nonmetastatic patients in highly selected oligometastatic cohorts; histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, axial primary site, and larger tumor size also portend worse outcomes, reinforcing the centrality of surgery and chemotherapy response in risk stratification [^117AgGt2] [^1137HnaX] [^113njs3Q] [^116gkk3m].

> I should double-check the role of metastasectomy and local control options. For resectable pulmonary disease, metastasectomy is standard; when surgery is not feasible, stereotactic body radiotherapy or ablation can be considered for oligometastases, and in select cases, radiopharmaceuticals such as radium-223 may be used, though evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized within MDT review; importantly, achieving a complete second surgical remission at relapse confers meaningful long-term survival in a subset, underscoring the need to pursue resection whenever possible [^116MQB7P] [^112inQWR] [^115jsuCe].

> Let me consider special diagnostic dilemmas. Indeterminate pulmonary nodules at presentation are common and prognostically intermediate; close surveillance is warranted, as a meaningful fraction evolve into metastases within the first year, yet patients with only indeterminate nodules can have outcomes similar to localized disease if nodules remain stable or prove benign; central radiology review and, when feasible, histologic confirmation help refine staging and prognosis, and prolonged follow-up is prudent given late progression in a minority [^112YhBUs] [^1111iBD3] [^11716i3X].

> But wait, what if the disease is multifocal within bone without lung involvement. Multifocal osteosarcoma presents a classification challenge between synchronous primaries and metastases; management still hinges on curative-intent resection of all sites when feasible, with chemotherapy tailored to high-risk disease biology, and outcomes are generally poor unless complete surgical control is achieved, reinforcing the same principles of aggressive local control and systemic therapy [^113VtwbS] [^1179rBiS].

> I need to check extraskeletal osteosarcoma, which behaves differently. ESOS is rare, tends to affect older adults, shows limited chemosensitivity, and carries a poor prognosis; surgical resection remains the mainstay when possible, and systemic therapy decisions should be individualized, often prioritizing local control and clinical trials given the lack of standardized regimens [^117J3He6] [^113fkt54].

> Next, I should review controversies and evidence gaps. Attempts to intensify chemotherapy, such as adding ifosfamide/etoposide to MAP in poor responders, have not consistently improved survival and may increase toxicity, as illustrated by EURAMOS-1; similarly, high-dose ifosfamide-based regimens in metastatic disease show activity but not durable benefit, highlighting the need for novel strategies rather than mere cytotoxic escalation [^115TQWXj] [^1137HnaX].

> Hold on, I should verify the status of immunotherapy. PD-1 blockade has shown minimal activity in unselected osteosarcoma, likely reflecting low tumor mutational burden and immune exclusion phenotypes; however, MSI-high/dMMR tumors may respond to pembrolizumab per tissue-agnostic approvals, and guidelines advise considering TMB/MMR testing in advanced disease, while correlative work suggests that overcoming immune exclusion in metastases could be key to future immunotherapeutic success [^1175XM5n] [^114DzqH2] [^115MB16G] [^113H6hCn].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations. All patients with metastatic osteosarcoma should be managed in specialized centers with access to aggressive surgery and multiagent chemotherapy; upfront imaging should include chest CT, whole-body FDG-PET/CT or bone scan, and MRI of the primary to define resectability; serum LDH and ALP are prognostic and should be obtained, though they do not supplant clinical factors; comprehensive genomic profiling can be considered to identify MSI-H/dMMR or other actionable alterations; and surveillance after remission should be intensive in the first 2–3 years given the high early relapse risk, with chest CT every 2–3 months in year one and then gradually extending intervals thereafter [^112RcPJ3] [^1166HcT4] [^1156N1TC] [^111ZLFNL].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that all patients with metastatic disease have uniformly poor outcomes; I should correct that. In carefully selected patients with solitary or oligometastatic, completely resectable disease and good chemotherapy response, long-term survival approximating nonmetastatic cohorts has been reported, so prognostic counseling must be individualized and treatment plans should avoid nihilism when curative-intent resection is feasible [^117AgGt2] [^1137HnaX].

> Finally, I need to ensure the take-home is coherent. Metastatic osteosarcoma remains a high-mortality disease in which survival is primarily dictated by disease burden and surgical remissibility; curative-intent multimodality therapy with complete resection of all sites offers the only realistic path to long-term survival, while chemotherapy intensification has plateaued and immunotherapy requires biomarker selection and strategies to overcome immune exclusion; management in expert centers with early MDT involvement, meticulous staging, and aggressive but judicious local control is essential to optimize outcomes [^111ZLFNL] [^1179rBiS] [^116MQB7P].

Metastatic osteosarcoma is defined by **lung metastases** at diagnosis or recurrence, with bone and other sites less common [^1176DjRY]. Prognosis is poor, with 5-year survival **20–30%** [^1175XM5n] and median survival 12–18 months; outcomes are best with complete surgical resection of all disease [^1137HnaX] and good chemotherapeutic response [^117AgGt2]. Standard therapy is **neoadjuvant chemotherapy** (MAP ± ifosfamide) [^115r24Sf], surgical resection of primary and metastases [^114T3gBg], and adjuvant chemotherapy; unresectable disease relies on chemotherapy and radiotherapy [^114MKcNN] [^111VihHi]. Immunotherapy has limited activity [^1175XM5n], though MSI-H/dMMR tumors may respond to pembrolizumab [^114DzqH2]. Prognosis worsens with multiple metastases, axial primaries, and poor chemo-response; **oligometastatic disease** [^1137HnaX] and complete resection offer the best chance of cure [^117AgGt2].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical presentation

- **Incidence**: Metastatic disease at presentation occurs in ~10–20% of osteosarcoma cases [^1137HnaX].
- **Age**: Peak incidence is in adolescents and young adults, with a second peak in older adults [^115GBoHt].
- **Symptoms**: Localized pain, swelling, and systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue) are common [^notfound].

---

## Sites of metastasis

The **lungs** are the most common site (75–80%) [^notfound], followed by bone (10–15%) and other sites (5–10%).

---

## Prognostic factors

- **Number of metastases**: Fewer metastases correlate with better outcomes [^1137HnaX] [^117AgGt2].
- **Site of metastasis**: Pulmonary metastases have better prognoses than bone or visceral metastases [^notfound].
- **Histologic response**: ≥ 90% necrosis after chemotherapy indicates better prognosis [^113NJh33].
- **Age and sex**: Younger age and female sex are associated with better outcomes [^116gkk3m] [^117AgGt2].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Systemic chemotherapy

Standard regimens include **MAP** (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin) [^116AoSkN] and MAP plus ifosfamide for high-risk disease [^1137HnaX] [^115r24Sf]. High-dose ifosfamide with etoposide yields a 59% response but with significant toxicity [^1137HnaX].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical management entails **metastasectomy** — complete resection of all metastases markedly improves survival [^1137HnaX] [^117AgGt2] — and **limb salvage**, which achieves outcomes comparable to amputation when margins are adequate [^114hYWUT].

---

### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is used for **palliation** — particularly for pain control in unresectable or symptomatic metastases [^112mhR5G] — and for **oligometastases**, where stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is considered for limited lesions [^112inQWR].

---

## Emerging therapies and clinical trials

- **Immunotherapy**: Limited efficacy; pembrolizumab may benefit MSI-H/dMMR tumors [^114DzqH2] [^1175XM5n].
- **Targeted therapy**: Under investigation (e.g. TKIs, antiangiogenic agents) [^115GDW3h].
- **Clinical trials**: Encouraged to access novel agents and combinations [^116AoSkN].

---

## Survival outcomes

| **Clinical scenario** | **5-Year survival rate** |
|-|-|
| Localized disease | 60–70% [^116DkaTX] |
| Metastatic disease at diagnosis | 20–30% [^113njs3Q] |
| Complete surgical remission | 48% [^1137HnaX] |
| Incomplete surgical resection | 5% [^1137HnaX] |

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Imaging includes regular **chest CT** [^112RcPJ3] and periodic **FDG-PET/CT** or bone scans to detect recurrence [^notfound]. Laboratory monitoring tracks **alkaline phosphatase and LDH** as prognostic markers [^1166HcT4].

---

Metastatic osteosarcoma remains a **challenging disease** with poor prognosis, but **aggressive multimodal therapy** — including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation — offers the best chance for survival. Emerging therapies and clinical trials are essential to improve outcomes [^117XGikA].

Bone cancer — prognosis and survival outlines outcomes with current therapy. The development of multiagent chemotherapy regimens for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment has markedly improved the prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. With current multimodality treatment, approximately 60% to 70% of patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma (without clinically evident metastases) are cured, and ~90% of patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma can be treated with limb-sparing approaches. Five-year relative survival rates have improved to 82% in patients with localized Ewing sarcoma, and in patients with Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma, a cure is still achievable in selected patients diagnosed with metastatic disease at presentation. The 5-year survival across all types of primary bone cancers is 68%.

### Osteosarcoma: an evolving understanding of a complex disease [^112MyAao]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone sarcoma and affects both children and adults. The cornerstone of treatment for patients with localized and oligometastatic disease remains neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical resection of all sites of disease, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. This approach is associated with up to an 80% 5-year survival. However, survival of patients with metastatic disease remains poor, and overall, osteosarcoma remains a challenging disease to treat. Advances in the understanding of molecular drivers of the disease, identification of poor prognostic factors, development of risk-stratified treatment protocols, successful completion of large collaborative trials, and surgical advances have laid the ground work for progress. Advances in computer navigation, implant design, and surgical techniques have allowed surgeons to improve patients' physical functional without sacrificing oncologic outcomes. Future goals include identifying effective risk stratification algorithms which minimize patient toxicity while maximizing oncologic outcomes and continuing to improve the durability, function, and patient acceptance of oncologic reconstructions.

### New paradigms for therapy for osteosarcoma [^116gW4Py]. Current Oncology Reports (2005). Low credibility.

Osteosarcoma is a primary bone malignancy generally affecting the young, with 60% of cases occurring before the age of 25 years and the peak incidence at 15 years. Survival has improved over the past several decades, with non- metastatic disease having an approximately 70% chance of long-term survival. Unfortunately, patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis or those who have recurrent disease have a dismal prognosis, with approximately 20% surviving long term. In this review article we describe several new therapies in development for osteosarcoma. These include immune-based therapies, strategies to inhibit tumor growth, radiotherapy, and the introduction of new chemotherapies and targets.

### Stratifying osteosarcoma: minimizing and maximizing therapy [^1126fUcP]. Current Oncology Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Patients who are newly diagnosed with osteosarcoma face a daunting year of medical and surgical therapy, often filled with hospitalizations and changes in lifestyle. Fortunately, the majority of patients endure this struggle to become long-term survivors. However, follow-up studies of cancer survivors are revealing the sequelae of this curative therapy. Just as disturbingly, there remains a large subset of patients for whom conventional therapy is inadequate and who succumb to disease. In this review, we propose that therapeutic strategies for osteosarcoma patients must rely on stratification of patients into risk categories, in order to minimize therapy for some, while expanding treatment for others. We then focus on two molecular targets for the treatment of patients with high-risk osteosarcoma.

### Osteosarcoma [^112fSRXf]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Osteosarcoma, the most common bone sarcoma, affects approximately 560 children and adolescents annually in the United States. The incidence of new diagnoses peaks in the second decade of life. Twenty percent of patients present with clinically detectable metastases, with micrometastases presumed to be present in many of the remaining patients. Treatment typically includes preoperative chemotherapy, surgical resection, and postoperative chemotherapy. Limb-salvage procedures with wide surgical margins are the mainstay of surgical intervention. Advances in chemotherapy protocols have led to a 5-year survival rate of 60% to 78%. Among the goals of future treatment regimens are improved chemotherapeutic agents with higher specificity and lower toxicity.

### Osteosarcoma [^115GBoHt]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumour of the bone. Osteosarcoma incidence is bimodal, peaking at 18 and 60 years of age, and is slightly more common in males. The key pathophysiological mechanism involves several possible genetic drivers of disease linked to bone formation, causing malignant progression and metastasis. While there have been significant improvements in the outcome of patients with localized disease, with event-free survival outcomes exceeding 60%, in patients with metastatic disease, event-free survival outcomes remain poor at less than 30%. The suspicion of osteosarcoma based on radiographs still requires pathological evaluation of a bone biopsy specimen for definitive diagnosis and CT imaging of the chest should be performed to identify lung nodules. So far, population-based screening and surveillance strategies have not been implemented due to the rarity of osteosarcoma and the lack of reliable markers. Current screening focuses only on groups at high risk such as patients with genetic cancer predisposition syndromes. Management of osteosarcoma requires a multidisciplinary team of paediatric and medical oncologists, orthopaedic and general surgeons, pathologists, radiologists and specialist nurses. Survivors of osteosarcoma require specialized medical follow-up, as curative treatment consisting of chemotherapy and surgery has long-term adverse effects, which also affect the quality of life of patients. The development of osteosarcoma model systems and related research as well as the evaluation of new treatment approaches are ongoing to improve disease outcomes, especially for patients with metastases.

### Novel targets with potential therapeutic applications in osteosarcoma [^112esuSb]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

For patients with osteosarcoma, the development of metastases, often to the lungs, is the most common cause of death. Long-term outcomes for patients who present with localized or disseminated disease have largely remained unchanged over the past 20 years. Further improvements in outcome are not likely to come from intensification of cytotoxic chemotherapy; as such, new targets for treatment are needed. A view toward such targets in osteosarcoma may be constructed based on three common clinical features of the disease. These include the origin of osteosarcoma in the bone or primitive mesenchymal cells, the predictable process of metastatic progression characterized by this disease, and the development of metastatic lesions almost exclusively in the lung. It is likely and potentially favorable for some targets to be relevant for more than one process. This review summarizes novel targets under evaluation for the treatment of osteosarcoma based on these three features of the disease.

### Characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with osteosarcoma: an analysis of outcomes from the national cancer database [^116B2eNC]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study evaluated more than 4,000 patients with osteosarcoma and defined modern survival rates as largely unchanged from more dated studies. Surgical excision remains the best predictor of survival for osteosarcomas. Furthermore, factors correlating with decreased survival include distant metastases, increasing age, male sex, and axial location. With survival having remained similar over the time frames studied, the need for further advances in this area are highlighted and leaves room for additional studies as cancer care progresses.

### Bone cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114T3gBg]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Resectable metastatic osteosarcoma — management and outcomes include that for patients with resectable metastases (pulmonary, visceral, or skeletal) at presentation, the guidelines recommend preoperative chemotherapy followed by wide excision of the primary tumor, with chemotherapy, metastasectomy, and SRT included as options for the management of resectable metastatic disease. In the event that pulmonary metastasectomy is not feasible, ablation procedures may be considered. In a retrospective review of 83 patients with high-grade osteosarcoma and widespread metastases who underwent complete resection of the primary tumor and surgical removal of all detectable metastases followed by chemotherapy, nine (10.8%) patients had an initial complete remission, of which one patient remained 12.7 years later; sixty-three of the remaining 74 patients died secondary to their disease, and 2 died from other causes; actuarial EFS and OS after 5 years was 1.4 ± 1.4%, and 8.7 ± 3.3%, respectively.

### Bone cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117AgGt2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Osteosarcoma — prognostic factors and outcome associations include: Tumor site and size, patient age, presence and location of metastases, histologic response to chemotherapy, and type of surgery and surgical margins are significant prognostic factors for patients with osteosarcoma of the extremities and trunk. A meta-analysis and systematic review of 18,126 participants identified patient sex, tumor site, tumor size, response to chemotherapy, and surgery as prognostic factors; in extremity osteosarcoma, size and location within the limb at diagnosis also had significant influence on outcome, and all factors except age were significant in multivariate testing, with surgical remission and histologic response to chemotherapy emerging as key prognostic factors. In a meta-analysis of prospective neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials in 4838 patients, female sex was associated with increased chemotherapy-induced tumor necrosis and greater overall survival (OS), and children had better outcomes than adolescents and adults. A combined analysis of three European Osteosarcoma Intergroup randomized controlled trials reported that good histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy, distal location (other than proximal humerus/femur), and female gender were associated with improved survival, while high body mass index (BMI) was associated with lower OS compared with normal BMI. In proven primary metastatic osteosarcoma, the number of metastases at diagnosis and the completeness of surgical resection of all clinically detected tumor sites are of independent prognostic value, and patients with one or a few resectable pulmonary metastases have a survival rate that approaches that of patients without metastatic disease.

### Bone cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1118PYnV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Bone Cancer — Relapsed or refractory disease epidemiology and prognostic factors — Approximately 30% to 40% of patients with localized disease and 80% of patients presenting with metastatic disease will relapse. The presence of solitary metastases, time to first relapse, and complete resectability of the disease at first recurrence have been reported to be the most important prognostic indicators for improved survival, whereas patients not amenable to surgery and those with a second or third recurrence have a poor prognosis. In patients with primary non-metastatic osteosarcoma, a longer relapse-free interval to pulmonary metastases was significantly associated with better survival. The prognostic significance of surgical clearance among patients with second and subsequent recurrences was also confirmed in a report of survival estimates derived from large cohorts of unselected patients treated at the COSS group trials.

### Indeterminate nodules in osteosarcoma: what's the follow-up? [^112YhBUs]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background:

Indeterminate pulmonary nodules in patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma present a challenge for accurate staging and prognosis. The aim of this study was to explore the significance of this finding.

Methods:

A retrospective cohort study of 120 patients with osteosarcoma was performed in the North East of England. Chest computed tomographies (CTs) at presentation were reviewed and the incidence of 'indeterminate' nodules recorded. Follow-up scans were reviewed and survival as well as prognostic features were analysed.

Results:

25% of our cohort presented with indeterminate nodules. Of these, 33% were subsequently confirmed as metastases, the majority within a year. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that patients with indeterminate nodules fared better than those with frank metastatic disease, and similar to those who presented with a normal chest CT. We found no radiographic features that predicted survival.

Conclusions:

Indeterminate nodules remain a clinical and diagnostic dilemma. Close monitoring of patients is advised during the first year from presentation, and there is potential for indeterminate nodules to develop into frank metastases later than five years from presentation.

### Bone cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1137HnaX]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Metastatic disease at presentation — approximately 10% to 20% of patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, and the 2-year DFS rate was significantly higher for patients with only one or two metastatic lesions than for those with three or more lesions (78% and 28%, respectively). In a study of 57 patients with metastatic disease at presentation treated with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and a high dose of methotrexate and ifosfamide, the 2-year EFS and OS rates were 21% and 55%, respectively, compared to 75% and 94% in patients with non-metastatic disease at presentation, treated with the same chemotherapy protocol. High-dose ifosfamide plus etoposide in a phase II/III trial of 43 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic osteosarcoma revealed an ORR of 59% ± 8%, but considerable toxicity. Among patients with primary metastases treated in cooperative osteosarcoma trials, long-term survival rates were higher when metastases were excised compared to when they could not be removed (48% and 5%, respectively).

### Primary metastatic osteosarcoma: presentation and outcome of patients treated on neoadjuvant cooperative osteosarcoma study group protocols [^113njs3Q]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine demographic data and define prognostic factors for long-term outcome in patients presenting with high-grade osteosarcoma of bone with clinically detectable metastases at initial presentation.

Patients and Methods

Of 1,765 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated high-grade osteosarcomas of bone registered in the neoadjuvant Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group studies before 1999, 202 patients (11.4%) had proven metastases at diagnosis and therefore were enrolled onto an analysis of demographic-, tumor-, and treatment-related variables, response, and survival. The intended therapeutic strategy included pre- and postoperative multiagent chemotherapy as well as aggressive surgery of all resectable lesions.

Results

With a median follow-up of 1.9 years (5.5 years for survivors), 60 patients were alive, 37 of whom were in continuously complete surgical remission. Actuarial overall survival rates at 5 and 10 (same value for 15) years were 29% (SE = 3%) and 24% (SE = 4%), respectively. In univariate analysis, survival was significantly correlated with patient age, site of the primary tumor, number and location of metastases, number of involved organ systems, histologic response of the primary tumor to preoperative chemotherapy, and completeness and time point of surgical resection of all tumor sites. However, after multivariate Cox regression analysis, only multiple metastases at diagnosis (relative hazard rate [RHR] = 2.3) and macroscopically incomplete surgical resection (RHR = 2.4) remained significantly associated with inferior outcomes.

Conclusion

The number of metastases at diagnosis and the completeness of surgical resection of all clinically detected tumor sites are of independent prognostic value in patients with proven primary metastatic osteosarcoma.

### Bone cancer: diagnosis and treatment principles [^1112SDdC]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Primary bone cancers include osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma. They account for less than 1% of diagnosed cancers each year and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Timely diagnosis is challenging because of late patient presentation, nonspecific symptoms that mimic common musculoskeletal injuries, and low suspicion by physicians. Plain radiography is the preferred diagnostic test. Radiographic suspicion of a bone malignancy should prompt quick referral to a cancer center for multidisciplinary care. Osteosarcoma, the most common bone cancer, most often occurs in children and adolescents. It typically develops in the metaphysis of long bones, specifically the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. Metastasis to the lungs is common. Use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy, in combination with surgery, has improved survival rates to nearly 80% for patients with localized disease, and 90% to 95% of patients do not require limb amputation. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone cancer and is similar to osteosarcoma in terms of presenting symptoms, age at occurrence, and treatment. Prognosis for osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma depends on the presence of metastasis, which lowers the five-year survival rate to 20% to 30%. Chondrosarcoma is the rarest bone cancer, primarily affecting adults older than 40 years. Survival rates are higher because most of these tumors are low-grade lesions.

### Indeterminate nodules in osteosarcoma: what's the follow-up? [^11716i3X]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Sarcomas metastasise most frequently to the pulmonary parenchyma. Computed tomography (CT) has become the standard for detecting and monitoring pulmonary lesions, but frequently identifies nodules of uncertain clinical significance. Often the assumption is that, especially in children, these nodules represent metastatic disease. However, up to 60% of pulmonary nodules found in adults and 33% in children may be non-malignant.

Differentiating benign and malignant lesions is essential for planning treatment and determining prognosis. When nodules are detected, invasive procedures may be necessary to establish the histopathologic diagnosis, but in many cases the nodules are simply monitored with repeat CT scans. From the patients' perspective, such nodules cause stress and concern as their significance remains uncertain.

Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumour arising in children and adolescents. Up to 20% of patients will have synchronous metastatic pulmonary disease detectable radiologically at initial presentation. However, the positive predictive value of radiographic criteria for pulmonary nodules using CT has been estimated at 53%. Among patients with normal chest CTs on presentation, 20–25% will relapse, usually in the lungs (metachronous metastatic pulmonary disease). A cohort of these patients will have indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) at presentation, the majority of which will turn out to be malignant.

Indeterminate pulmonary nodules are those that have some risk of cancer. There remains controversy around their definition, but in general IPNs fall under the category of non-calcified nodules. Their diameters can vary but based on recent studies nodules arising from a range of solid cancer types with a diameter < 10 mm have caused greatest discussion.

Our institution performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the significance upon survival of IPNs reported at initial presentation on chest CT in patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Furthermore, we tried to characterise features of these nodules for patients at risk. Our null hypothesis was that the presence of such nodules had no effect on long-term survival when compared to a non-metastatic group.

Regarding medical management for osteosarcoma - NCCN, more specifically with respect to regimens for systemic therapy, NCCN 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining comprehensive genomic profiling with a validated and/or FDA-approved assay to determine targeted therapy opportunities for patients with high tumor mutational burden who have unresectable or metastatic tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.

### Characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with osteosarcoma: an analysis of outcomes from the national cancer database [^113PbthV]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Previous studies about osteosarcoma patient characteristics, management, and outcomes have limited patient numbers, combine varied tumor types, and/or are older studies.

Methods:

Patients with osteosarcoma from the 2004 to 2015 National Cancer Database data sets were separated into axial, appendicular, and other. Demographic and treatment data as well as 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival were determined for each group. A multivariate Cox analysis of patient variables with the likelihood of death was performed, and the Kaplan Meier survival curves were generated.

Results:

Four thousand four hundred thirty patients with osteosarcoma (3,435 appendicular, 810 axial, and 185 other) showed survival at 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year and was highest among the appendicular cohort (91.17%, 64.43%, and 58.58%, respectively). No change in survival was seen over the periods studied. The likelihood of death was greater with increasing age category, distant metastases, and treatment with radiation alone but less with appendicular primary site, treatment with surgery alone, or surgery plus chemotherapy.

Discussion:

Despite advances in tumor management, surgical excision remains the best predictor of survival for osteosarcomas. No difference was observed in patient survival from 2004 to 2015 and, as would be expected, distant metastases were a poor prognostic sign, as was increasing age, male sex, and axial location.

### Characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with osteosarcoma: an analysis of outcomes from the national cancer database [^113NJh33]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary osseous sarcoma. The incidence has been estimated to be approximately 5.0 per million patients aged zero to 19and 3.5 per million patients for patients aged older than 60. Osteosarcoma has a predilection for invading the metaphysis of the long bones of the appendicular skeleton, chiefly the distal femur and proximal tibia. Osteosarcoma can also affect the axial skeleton/other locations, although this is less common.

Owing to the relatively rare nature of osteosarcoma, previous studies have been limited in sample size (ranging from 34 to 648). These have tended to show positive prognostic factors to include but are not limited to younger age at the time of diagnosis, lack of metastases at the time of diagnosis, time to treatment initiation, parosteal subtype, smaller tumor size, and greater than 90% necrosis with chemotherapy. Depending on the combination of these prognostic factors, 5-year survival rates for osteosarcoma have been reported to vary from 70% in patients with local disease at the time of diagnosis to 20% in patients with metastatic or recurrent disease.

The mainstay of treatment for osteosarcoma consists of surgical resection and reconstruction along with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (before surgery) and adjuvant chemotherapy (after surgery). Despite advances and numerous attempts to refine treatment regimens, the survival rates of patients with osteosarcoma have largely remained unchanged over the last 3 decades. Radiation therapy is not a mainstay in the treatment of osteosarcoma and is largely reserved for cases without negative resection margins. No treatment is rarely considered except in cases of exceedingly poor prognosis/patient choice.

Previous studies investigating treatment management of osteosarcoma have largely been limited by patient numbers. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) contains patient information from multiple centers across the United States with more than 30 million patient records representing a unique opportunity to learn additional insights concerning this patient population. To our knowledge, no previous studies assessing the outcomes in patients with primary osteosarcoma using the NCDB database exist. Thus, this study sought to evaluate the incidence, treatment, and outcomes of patients with osteosarcoma using the large, robust, and multicenter national patient population found within the NCDB database to further characterize the osteosarcoma population, treatments, and survivals.

### Recurrent osteosarcoma with a single pulmonary metastasis: a multi-institutional review [^113a29SP]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Despite aggressive surgery and intensive chemotherapy, osteosarcoma recurs in ∼30–40% of patients initially diagnosed with non-metastatic disease. The outcome of patients with recurrent osteosarcoma is generally poor, with long-term survival rates of ∼20%. The most common site of relapse is the lung, and 50–75% of patients with recurrent osteosarcoma initially have lung involvement only. Favourable prognostic indicators in recurrent disease include a longer disease-free interval from initial diagnosis to relapse, good histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the primary tumour, a solitary lesion, and the ability to achieve a second complete surgical remission. For patients with pulmonary relapse, fewer nodules, unilateral involvement, complete surgical resection, and absence of pleural disruption are favourable prognostic factors.

Although adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary for the treatment of newly diagnosed osteosarcoma, the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of recurrent disease is uncertain, especially for patients with solitary recurrent pulmonary metastasis. A study demonstrated that a disease-free interval > 12 months before developing osteosarcoma lung metastasis and complete surgical metastasectomy correlated with increased overall survival (OS;). Therefore, patients with recurrent osteosarcoma presenting with a single pulmonary nodule more than 1 year after diagnosis may represent a group of patients with favourable outcome for whom chemotherapy does not add benefit. The goals of this study were to characterise the clinical features and outcome of these patients and to evaluate the role of chemotherapy in this setting.

### Time dependency of prognostic factors in patients with stage II osteosarcomas [^115xNm5n]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Although several clinicopathologic parameters may be related to metastasis-free survival in osteosarcoma, the importance of prognostic factors with time is largely unknown. Therefore, we asked whether the clinical characteristics of patients with osteosarcoma with metastasis after 2 years differed from those of patients with an earlier metastatic event. We retrospectively reviewed 420 patients with Stage IIB osteosarcoma treated with surgery and chemotherapy. The minimum followup was 3 months (mean, 71.4 months; range, 3–257 months). Among the 420 patients, 167 patients had a metastatic event. A large proportion (43%) of the 35 good responders showed metastasis after 2 years, whereas 24% of the 96 poor responders showed late metastasis. Histologic response and chondroblastic subtype showed time-related changes. Poor histologic response showed a gradual decline in prognostic value and lost its importance after 2 years. Most metastatic events occurred within 2 years after diagnosis; therefore, we recommend new predictive strategies and followup protocol for patients experiencing late relapse.

### Bone cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1134MWKw]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). Medium credibility.

Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma constitute 36% of all primary bone cancers. However, these 2 subtypes represent the most commonly diagnosed bone cancer types in the pediatric and adolescent population. Although still largely unknown, certain genetic mutations, rearrangements, and/or predisposition syndromes likely play a role in the pathogenesis of bone cancer. Osteosarcoma may also develop as a direct result of the long-term side effects of radiation therapy. With the implementation of a multimodality approach to treatment, including multiagent neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, targeted therapy options, surgery, and radiation, individuals with Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma are showing higher cure rates and improved overall survival. The NCCN Guidelines for Bone Cancer provide a consensus and evidence-based framework for the workup, management, and surveillance of local and recurrent/metastatic disease.

### Extraskeletal osteosarcoma: spectrum of imaging findings [^111F9vgV]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to present the spectrum of imaging findings of primary and metastatic extraskeletal osteosarcoma and highlight the differences from primary osteogenic osteosarcoma in bone.

Conclusion

Extraskeletal osteosarcoma is a rare mesenchymal malignancy of soft tissue, histologically indistinguishable from primary osteosarcoma of bone. However, there are distinct differences in demographics, imaging features, prognosis, and management compared with osteogenic osteosarcoma. Imaging characteristics reflect tumor morphology, with only 50% of primary tumors showing mineralization. Metastases may or may not show mineralization, even if present in the primary tumor. The overall prognosis is poor.

### Immunotherapy for osteosarcoma: where do we go from here? [^113u7too]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Osteosarcoma is the most common bone tumor in children and young adults, with few advances in survival and treatment, especially for metastatic disease, in the last 30 years. Recently, immunotherapy has begun to show promise in various adult cancers, but the utility of this approach for osteosarcoma remains relatively unexplored. In this review, we outline the mechanisms and status of immunotherapies currently in clinical trials as well as future therapies on the horizon, and discuss their potential application for osteosarcoma.

### Pathways of immune exclusion in metastatic osteosarcoma are associated with inferior patient outcomes [^113H6hCn]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteosarcoma is the most common bone malignancy in children and young adults. While patients with localized disease have a cure rate approaching 70%, patients who develop metastatic disease have a 5-year overall survival of less than 25%, with most patients dying from pulmonary metastases (PMs). Unfortunately, the treatment paradigm for osteosarcoma has remained unchanged for approximately 30 years. Adjuvant chemotherapy offers no benefit for patients who suffer metastatic relapse, and new classes of therapeutics are urgently needed for this chemotherapy-insensitive disease.

Several pieces of evidence point to an important role for the immune system in the clearance of osteosarcoma, offering hope that tumor immunotherapy could be successful in osteosarcoma as it has been for many types of cancer. Furthermore, loss of human leukocyte antigen class 1 expression on tumor cells correlates with poor overall survival in patients with osteosarcoma, suggesting that evading immune recognition confers a survival advantage for tumor cells. While immune-based therapies have been successful in some sarcomas and other pediatric cancers, these beneficial findings have not been generalizable to many sarcomas, including osteosarcoma specifically.

While immunotherapy has not changed outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma, correlative findings and preclinical studies show that the tumor microenvironment (TME) of osteosarcoma can be altered. Rigorous understanding of the mechanisms regulating the tumor–immune system interface is a crucial prerequisite for rationally designed therapies to alter the TME in a way that will allow immunotherapy to be effective in osteosarcoma. The TME of any cancer has different systems to prevent recognition and attack by the immune system, and instead promote tolerance, thus allowing tumor progression. Understanding the TME in PMs is crucial, and analyses derived from study of these specimens have resulted in controversial conclusions. One recent paper suggests that vascular dysfunction in metastatic osteosarcoma results in lower expression of a number of immune markers compared with primary tumors, while contrasting reports show that metastatic lesions have a higher number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), higher expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and are marked by a number of immunosuppressive mechanisms. Nevertheless, a deeper and more granular understanding of the metastatic TME, particularly the precise regional distribution and interplay of immune cells along with the operative immunoregulatory signaling programs, are greatly needed.

### Poor prognosis osteosarcoma: new therapeutic approach [^116YEkKB]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Over the past 30 years, a significant improvement in the prognosis of localized osteosarcoma of the extremities has been observed. Despite these results, approximately 30–40% of patients will relapse, mostly within the first 3 years from diagnosis. The prognosis of patients with recurrent disease or metastases at diagnosis is poor. To improve the survival in this patient population, several attempts have been made. An increased dose intensity of chemotherapy induces short lasting remission but does not increase the survival. In the era of targeted therapy, few drugs have been tested with dismal results. The use of biological agents endowed with immunomodulant activity (that is IL-2) or reduced-intensity allogeneic hemopoietic SCT has produced intriguing results that need further confirmation. In this context, an ongoing study explores the antitumor activity of specific T-cytotoxic lymphocytes.

### Osteosarcoma: a comprehensive review of management and treatment strategies [^114TbZUd]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteosarcoma, a bone cancer usually seen in children and young adults, is generally a high-grade malignancy presented by extreme metastases to the lungs. Osteosarcoma has a tendency for appearing in bones with rapid growth rate. The etiology of osteosarcoma is multifaceted and poorly understood. A molecular consideration of this disease will lead to a directed tumor treatment. The present treatment for osteosarcoma comprises of an arrangement of systemic chemotherapy and wide surgical resection. Survival rate is increased by the progress of destructive systemic chemotherapies. So, the development of new treatment approaches for metastatic osteosarcoma is essential. Immunomodulation has been used in clinical settings. Through targeting surface antigens expressed on tumor cells, particular antibodies and exploitation of cellular immunotherapy against sarcomas have been confirmed to be effective as cancer therapeutics. In this article, we have reviewed epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of osteosarcoma and we have focused on different methods of immunotherapy including vaccines, cell-based immunotherapy, cytokines, and monoclonal antibodies.

Osteosarcoma — prognostic serum markers and survival: Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are identified as prognostic indicators, with higher LDH at presentation in metastatic versus localized disease in a cohort of 1421 extremity cases (36.6% vs. 18.8%; P < .0001), and 5-year disease-free survival correlated with LDH (39.5% for high LDH vs 60% for normal). In a retrospective analysis of 789 extremity cases, ALP was a significant prognostic factor for event-free survival, with 5-year EFS 24% when serum ALP was more than four times the normal value and 46% when elevated below this limit (P < .001). However, in multivariate analyses, these markers did not retain prognostic significance when compared with tumor volume, age, and histologic response to chemotherapy.

### Prognostic impact of pulmonary nodules diagnosed at initial presentation in patients with osteosarcoma [^1111iBD3]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Resection of all lung metastases in patients with osteosarcoma improves survival. The increased computed tomography (CT) scan quality allows detecting smaller nodules. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of those nodules that do not meet the classical criteria for lung metastases.

Methods

A central radiology review (CRR) on lung CT scans performed during the treatment of patients included in OS2006 trial and treated with a high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy from 2007 to 2013 was realized in three centers.

Results

At trial enrollment, among 77 patients, six (8%) had nodules meeting the trial's criteria for metastatic disease, 46 (60%) were classified as having localized disease, and 25 (32%) as having doubtful nodules. After CRR, 218 nodules were found at diagnosis (all in patients classified as "metastatic or doubtful" and 13 patients classified as "localized") (median two nodules per patient [1–52]). The 5-year event-free survival/overall survival (EFS/OS) of patients with at least one nodule versus no nodule were similar (67.7%/79.2% vs. 81.8%/91%). After histological analysis, two of 46 (4.3%) "localized" and eight of 25 (32.0%) "doubtful" patients were re-classified as "metastatic", whereas there was no change in patients initially "metastatic". The 5-year OS of confirmed histological metastatic versus nonmetastatic patients were different (56% vs. 92%, p < .01).

Conclusion

Central review of lung CT scan increased the detection of nodules in osteosarcoma. Patients with small lung nodules classified as doubtful had a quite similar outcome as those with a localized disease. However, patients with confirmed metastatic nodules have a poorer prognosis, even if considered as "localized" at diagnosis.

### Osteosarcoma: a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment [^1135E2Ft]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of osteosarcoma requires a multidisciplinary approach involving the family physician, orthopedic oncologist, medical oncologist, radiologist and pathologist. Osteosarcoma is a mesenchymally derived, high-grade bone sarcoma. It is the third most common malignancy in children and adolescents. The most frequent sites of origin are the distal femur, proximal tibia and proximal humerus. Patients typically present with pain, swelling, localized enlargement of the extremity and, occasionally, pathologic fracture. Most patients present with localized disease. Radiographs commonly demonstrate a mixed sclerotic and lytic lesion arising in the metaphyseal region of the involved bone. Computed tomography and bone scanning are recommended to detect pulmonary and bone metastases, respectively. Before 1970, osteosarcomas were treated with amputation. Survival was poor: 80 percent of patients died from metastatic disease. With the development of induction and adjuvant chemotherapy protocols, advances in surgical techniques and improvements in radiologic staging studies, 90 to 95 percent of patients with osteosarcoma can now be treated with limb-sparing resection and reconstruction. Long-term survival and cure rates have increased to between 60 and 80 percent in patients with localized disease.

### Prognostic factors in high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremities or trunk: an analysis of 1, 702 patients treated on neoadjuvant cooperative osteosarcoma study group protocols [^116gkk3m]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To define prognostic factors for response and long-term outcome for a wide spectrum of osteosarcomas, extending well beyond those of the typical young patient with seemingly localized extremity disease.

Patients and Methods

A total of 1,702 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with high-grade osteosarcoma of the trunk or limbs registered into the neoadjuvant studies of the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group before July 1998 were entered into an analysis of demographic, tumor-related, and treatment-related variables, response, and survival. The intended therapeutic strategy included preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy with multiple agents as well as surgery of all operable lesions.

Results

Axial tumor site, male sex, and a long history of symptoms were associated with poor response to chemotherapy in univariate and multivariate analysis. Actuarial 10-year overall and event-free survival rates were 59.8% and 48.9%. Among the variables assessable at diagnosis, patient age (actuarial 10-year survival ≥ 40, 41.6%; < 40, 60.2%; p = 0.012), tumor site (axial, 29.2%; limb, 61.7%; P < .0001), and primary metastases (yes, 26.7%; no, 64.4%; P < .0001), and for extremity osteosarcomas, also size (≥ one third, 52.5%; < one third, 66.7%; P < .0001) and location within the limb (proximal, 49.3%; other, 63.9%; P < .0001), had significant influence on outcome. Two additional important prognostic factors were treatment related: response to chemotherapy (poor, 47.2%; good, 73.4%; P < .0001) and the extent of surgery (incomplete, 14.6%; macroscopically complete, 64.8%; P < .0001). All factors except age maintained their significance in multivariate testing, with surgical remission and histologic response emerging as the key prognostic factors.

Conclusion

Tumor site and size, primary metastases, response to chemotherapy, and surgical remission are of independent prognostic value in osteosarcoma.

Survival Data and Kaplan Meier Curves

Survival is also shown in Table 2. The appendicular cohort demonstrated a statistically higher 1-year survival rate (91.17%), 5-year survival rate (64.43%), and 10-year survival rate (58.58%) than the other two cohorts (axial: 1-year [74.22%], 5-year [45.97%], and 10-year [38.27%]; other: 1-year [67.33%], 5-year [45.57%], and 10-year [N/A]).

The Kaplan Meier curve analysis of proportional survival of patients with distant metastases on diagnosis revealed markedly decreased life expectancy in patients with distant metastases at 1, 5, and 10 years from time of diagnosis (Figure 1). The long-term survival of axial, appendicular, and other cohorts showed markedly a poorer long-term survival at 1, 5, and 10 years of those with tumors in the axial or other cohorts (Figure 2). Furthermore, no notable difference was observed in the long-term survival for patients diagnosed since the mid-2000s (Figure 3).

### Characteristics and prognosis of primary pulmonary osteosarcoma: a pooled analysis [^1117Jp5e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PPOS is one of the extraskeletal osteosarcomas that originated from the lung with an extremely low incidence and highly invasive potential. Due to its extreme rarity, the clinical characteristics and prognosis of PPOS remain unclear. In this way, we collected the cases with PPOS from the SEER database and conducted a systematic literature review to explore the potential effective treatment and prognostic factors, which helped provide some suggestions for the management of PPOS. The median OS was eight months, and the 1-year OS rate was 30.8%. Besides surgical performance, tumor size and microscopic findings of osteoid were also identified as the independent prognostic factors, and a nomogram was successfully established to predict the prognosis of patients with PPOS with relatively high accuracy. Thus, our findings suggested that surgical resection might be considered for the primary treatment modality. To our knowledge, our research was the first study to demonstrate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of PPOS systematically and put forward a potential prediction model based on a relatively large scale.

PPOS was more common in males (65.3%), higher than the ratio reported before. The median age at diagnosis was 67 years, parallel with other studies. Previously, age was significantly associated with survival, while different from our study, we did not find significant correlations between age and prognosis among patients with PPOS. Clinical symptoms might not be notable at an early stage of the disease, and chest pain was the most common as the tumor grew, which was in line with the previous reports. Metastases were only observed in 10 cases in our study, which was correlated with both OS and CSS in the univariable analysis. However, it was not an independent factor in the multivariable analysis. Therefore, the role of metastases in prognosis is required to be further studied because of the limited included cases with the metastasic disease. Our findings might remind us of the typical invasiveness and aggressiveness of PPOS regardless of metastasis.

### Characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with osteosarcoma: an analysis of outcomes from the national cancer database [^1148ebCK]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Osteosarcoma remains a clinical challenge. This study evaluated 4,430 patients with osteosarcoma from the NCDB database, which is the largest osteosarcoma cohort presented to date in the literature. Despite advances in tumor management, long-term survival of patients with osteosarcoma was found to be similar over the last 15 years. As expected, metastasis at presentation heralded a worse prognosis and being a surgical candidate was correlated with increased life-expectancy.

Most cases identified were appendicular in nature. This is consistent with known epidemiology of osteosarcoma. In fact, 77.5% of the cases were appendicular. The second most common site was axial (18.3%). The least common site was other (eg, head, neck, or mandible, 4.2%). Again, these figures are consistent with previous studies and substantiate the representative nature of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) population.

The overall 1-year osteosarcoma survival was 87.1%, the 5-year survival was 60.17%, and then 10-year survival was 53.92%, which is consistent with previous reports. These figures were slightly better for the appendicular cohort (1-year 91.17%, 5-year 64.43%, and 10-year 58.58%), but note that the overall numbers were largely driven by the appendicular numbers because of their overwhelming majority of the study population. Conversely, there was worse survival for the axial cohort (1-year 74.22%, 5-year 45.97%, 10-year 38.27%) presumably because of later stage diagnosis and more limited surgical options. The other group was more similar to axial group for presumed similar reasons.

### Survival in high-grade osteosarcoma: improvement over 21 years at a single institution [^1127fRpP]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to analyze improvements in overall survival over 21 years (1982–2002), with a 5-year minimum follow-up, in the largest series from a single center ever reported.

Materials and Methods

All diagnoses of high-grade osteosarcoma were included despite histological varieties, age, site and stage. Of the 1656 cases observed, 198 patients were excluded (41 consultation only, 129 low-grade varieties, and 28 lost to follow-up). Within 1458 included patients, 1032 had characteristics to be enrolled in conventional clinical trials (classic histology, age < 41, localized, and extremity disease). Data are also analyzed in subgroups to define patients who benefited most.

Results

With a median follow-up of 12 years (5–25 years), 754 patients (51.7%) are alive, of whom 613 continuously disease free. Survival at 5, 10, and 15 years is 57%, 52%, and 51%, respectively. Patients candidates for clinical trials have a survival rate of 68%, 64%, and 61%, respectively. Survival for the other patients is 30%, 25%, and 24%, respectively. Trend (joinpoint statistical analysis at real 5-year follow-up) shows a yearly statistically significant improvement of 1.31% (95% confidence interval 0.5% to 2.1%) from 51% for patients treated in 1982 to 68% for those treated in 2002. Patients who statistically benefited were those who relapsed or presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis or had axial tumors.

Conclusions

Despite the lack of new drugs for osteosarcoma, survival has statistically improved, especially for those patients with the worst outcome. Aggressive treatments are recommended for all patients including those with poor prognosis.

### Osteosarcoma development and stem cell differentiation [^111zMD5j]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2008). Low credibility.

Osteosarcoma is the most common nonhematologic malignancy of bone in children and adults. The peak incidence occurs in the second decade of life, with a smaller peak after age 50. Osteosarcoma typically arises around the growth plate of long bones. Most osteosarcoma tumors are of high grade and tend to develop pulmonary metastases. Despite clinical improvements, patients with metastatic or recurrent diseases have a poor prognosis. Here, we reviewed the current understanding of human osteosarcoma, with an emphasis on potential links between defective osteogenic differentiation and bone tumorigenesis. Existing data indicate osteosarcoma tumors display a broad range of genetic and molecular alterations, including the gains, losses, or arrangements of chromosomal regions, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, and the deregulation of major signaling pathways. However, except for p53 and/or RB mutations, most alterations are not constantly detected in the majority of osteosarcoma tumors. With a rapid expansion of our knowledge about stem cell biology, emerging evidence suggests osteosarcoma should be regarded as a differentiation disease caused by genetic and epigenetic changes that interrupt osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells. Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of human osteosarcoma could ultimately lead to the development of diagnostic and prognostic markers, as well as targeted therapeutics for osteosarcoma patients.

### Multiple receptor tyrosine kinases promote the in vitro phenotype of metastatic human osteosarcoma cell lines [^115kZoin]. Oncogenesis (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osteosarcoma, the most common primary bone sarcoma, predominantly affects adolescents in areas of rapid bone growth. With the introduction of high-dose, multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in combination with surgical resection in the 1970s, the long-term survival rate increased from 20 to 70% for patients with localized disease. Approximately 20% of patients present with overt metastases and 30–40% of patients diagnosed with localized disease go on to develop metastases, with the lungs being the most common sites for metastasis. The prognosis for patients with metastases remains poor, with only 20–30% experiencing long-term survival. Therefore, a better understanding of the underlying biology is required to develop improved therapeutic tools.

Unlike cancers with reciprocal chromosomal translocations, osteosarcoma is defined by complex karyotypes with multiple genetic alterations. In addition, there is a large variation of mutations between osteosarcoma patients. Therefore, patient-tailored, targeted therapy might benefit patients that are unresponsive to chemotherapy. Targeted therapy may also be less likely to induce the toxic side effects caused by conventional chemotherapy.

Tyrosine kinases are frequently involved in malignant transformation. The human genome encodes 58 transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Most RTKs undergo dimerization and autophosphorylation upon ligand binding, consequently activating downstream signaling cascades. Dysregulation or mutations in RTKs can induce aberrant activity and malignant transformation. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have emerged in the development of targeted anticancer therapy and are available for select RTKs.

Overexpression of several RTKs and their ligands occurs in osteosarcoma, including EGFR, ErbB2, IGF-1R, met, NGFR, PDGFR, VEGFR and their ligands. Specifically, overexpression of ErbB2, PDGF, PDGFR, VEGF and VEGFR correlates with metastasis and overall poor prognosis in osteosarcoma. However, the underlying role of RTKs in osteosarcoma has not been well characterized and inhibitors have not been approved for treatment.

### A comprehensive overview of liquid biopsy applications in pediatric solid tumors [^1175tMr3]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

As tumor recurrence and metastasis are the leading causes of death in osteosarcoma patients, there is a particular need for biomarkers assessing tumor clonal evolution, prediction of treatment resistance, and metastatic potential and/ or early relapse detection. CTCs can be an additional sensitive target for this purpose. CTCs circulate freely in the bloodstream with genetic resemblance to their tumor origin. They constitute a very small fraction of cells in the bloodstream and require validated methods for detection, enrichment, and enumeration. CTC sampling provides live information regarding disseminated tumor cell heterogeneity, and has already been implemented in clinical practice for metastatic tumor prognosis of several adult tumors such as colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. CTCs have been described as potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers for osteosarcoma metastasis. Dai et al.recently investigated CTCs using the Canpatrol CTC detection platform in 50 osteosarcoma patients (23 children and 27 adults, 34 with localized disease and 16 with metastatic disease). They detected CTCs in 43/50 patients and counts were significantly higher in Enneking Stage III (regional or distant metastasis) patients versus IIB (no metastasis) patients. Also, CTC detection with positive Insulin-like growth factor mRNA-binding protein 3 signal best diagnosed osteosarcoma metastasis (87.5% sensitivity, 82.4% specificity). Finally, serial monitoring in one patient suggested that total CTCs were associated with disease progression. Future studies focusing on CTC detection and implementation in osteosarcoma should include large cohorts involving serial sampling during treatment and follow-up. This will allow for dynamic CTC monitoring to assess chemotherapy response and timely detection of recurrence or metastasis, as well as investigate relationships among CTC detection and survival.

Osteosarcoma is a rare tumor that requires complex multidisciplinary management. This paper reviews the general management and standard radiotherapy guidelines for osteosarcoma in both North America and Europe in a joined effort between the Children's Oncology Group and International Society of Pediatric Oncology. Standard treatment involves multiagent induction chemotherapy followed by surgical resection for local tumor control and consolidation local control to metastatic sites. Radiotherapy is reserved for cases with a marginal or incomplete resection or for definitive treatment in the case of unresectable disease. We present supporting data for the role of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy.

### Toward a drug development path that targets metastatic progression in osteosarcoma [^114bgerr]. Clinical Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

Despite successful primary tumor treatment, the development of pulmonary metastasis continues to be the most common cause of mortality in patients with osteosarcoma. A conventional drug development path requiring drugs to induce regression of established lesions has not led to improvements for patients with osteosarcoma in more than 30 years. On the basis of our growing understanding of metastasis biology, it is now reasonable and essential that we focus on developing therapeutics that target metastatic progression. To advance this agenda, a meeting of key opinion leaders and experts in the metastasis and osteosarcoma communities was convened in Bethesda, Maryland. The goal of this meeting was to provide a "Perspective" that would establish a preclinical translational path that could support the early evaluation of potential therapeutic agents that uniquely target the metastatic phenotype. Although focused on osteosarcoma, the need for this perspective is shared among many cancer types. The consensus achieved from the meeting included the following: the biology of metastatic progression is associated with metastasis-specific targets/processes that may not influence grossly detectable lesions; targeting of metastasis-specific processes is feasible; rigorous preclinical data are needed to support translation of metastasis-specific agents into human trials where regression of measurable disease is not an expected outcome; preclinical data should include an understanding of mechanism of action, validation of pharmacodynamic markers of effective exposure and response, the use of several murine models of effectiveness, and where feasible the inclusion of the dog with naturally occurring osteosarcoma to define the activity of new drugs in the micrometastatic disease setting.

### Update on survival in osteosarcoma [^116VA45e]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children. Treatment has evolved to include systemic chemotherapy and local control surgery. Although survival improved initially in a drastic fashion with this approach, recent decades have seen little to no further gains in this area. Limb salvage surgery evolved with effective chemotherapy and advances in imaging, and continues to improve in the recent era. This article serves as a review of survival in high-grade osteosarcoma: prognostic factors, advances in chemotherapy and surgery, late effects of chemotherapy and surgery in survivors, and future directions.

### Poor survival for osteosarcoma of the pelvis: a report from the children's oncology group [^115tGx9J]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The pelvis is an infrequent site of osteosarcoma and treatment requires surgery plus systemic chemotherapy. Poor survival has been reported, but has not been confirmed previously by the Children's Oncology Group (COG). In addition, survival of patients with pelvic osteosarcomas has not been compared directly with that of patients with nonpelvic disease treated on the same clinical trials.

Questions/Purposes

First, we assessed the event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with pelvic osteosarcoma treated on COG clinical trials. We then asked whether patient survival compared with that of patients treated on the same clinical trials with nonpelvic disease. Finally, we asked whether patients with metastatic disease at initial diagnosis had worse survival.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed data from 1054 patients with osteosarcoma treated in four studies between 1993 and 2005. Twenty-six of the 1054 patients (2.5%) had a primary tumor of the pelvis. At diagnosis, nine patients had metastatic disease. The minimum followup was 2 months (mean, 34 months; range, 2–102 months).

Results

Two of the nine patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis and five of the 17 with localized disease were alive at last contact. Estimates of the 5-year EFS for localized versus metastatic disease of the pelvis were 22% versus 23%. OS for patients with localized versus metastatic disease was 47% versus 22%. Patients with osteosarcoma in all other locations had a 5-year EFS of 57% and OS of 69%.

Conclusions

Our analysis confirms poor survival for patients with pelvic osteosarcoma. Survival with metastatic disease in the absence of a pelvic primary tumor is similar to that for localized or metastatic pelvic osteosarcoma. Improved surgical or medical therapy is needed, and patients with pelvic osteosarcoma may warrant alternate or experimental therapy.

### EURAMOS-1, an international randomised study for osteosarcoma: results from pre-randomisation treatment [^113qBJEb]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

outcome measures

The primary outcome measure was event-free survival (EFS), defined as time from randomisation to the first of: detection of local recurrence or metastases, progression of metastatic disease, detection of secondary malignancy or death from any cause. EFS was chosen because prevention of first recurrence is the principal goal of adjuvant treatment of osteosarcoma, given the low rate of survival after first recurrence. Furthermore, treatment of recurrence is heterogeneous; treatment guidance for relapse accompanied the protocol, but sites' existing standard practice was accepted. Secondary outcome measures were overall survival (OS), toxicity and QL. Toxicity was assessed using CTCAE version 3.0.

sample size calculations

We assumed 70% 3-year EFS on MAP for good response and 45% for poor response, timed from randomisation. Each sample size was based on 5% two-sided significance level and 80% power. The Good Response randomisation needed 147 EFS events to detect improved 3-year EFS from 70% to 80%, i.e. hazard ratio (HR) = 0·63. Five-year survival was estimated as 70% so long-term analyses for survival were planned for when 147 deaths are reported, for the same relative and absolute improvements. For poor response, 378 events were targeted to detect improved 3-year EFS and 5-year OS from 45% to 55% (HR = 0·75).

We anticipated 45% (567) randomised patients would have good response and 55% (693) poor response. We planned to register ∼1400 patients over 3.5 years to randomise 1260, assuming 10% non-randomisation for ineligibility or non-consent. The observed non-randomisation rate was higher and the registration target was increased to ∼2000 patients.

### Temporal chromatin accessibility changes define transcriptional States essential for osteosarcoma metastasis [^111xozio]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Cancer cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic changes during metastatic progression. At the level of the enhancer epigenome, these pro-metastatic changes have been characterized by our lab and others across numerous cancer types –. Despite recognition that these changes occur sometime during the evolution of the tumor, when, why, and how they occur remain open questions. Prior studies have relied on profiling and comparing primary tumors to clinically resectable metastases. By limiting comparison to these endpoints, the natural history of cellular states throughout the metastatic cascade is lost. Additionally, while such an approach may be sufficient to capture inherited and somatic genetic mutations that persist in the final output, epigenetic changes are inherently plastic and context-dependent. Thus, they could easily be missed. This leaves the potential for transient intermediate cell states that are undetectable with these static comparisons. Temporal profiling over a defined time course of metastatic colonization is required to investigate this. Genetically engineered mouse models are ideal systems for studying tumor evolution from a single cell, but the stochastic nature of lesion formation makes isolating defined stages of metastasis development challenging. To chart the landscape of epigenetic changes that occur during metastatic colonization, we need a tractable and controlled experimental system with well-characterized growth dynamics from metastatic seeding to full colonization. Further, a system amenable to functional perturbation across multiple different human cancer specimens, within the in vivo microenvironment, would be ideal.

The lung is the second-most frequent site of cancer metastasis, with twenty-five to thirty percent of all patients with cancer at autopsy having visible lung metastases. This occurs across many primary tumor types. One of these is osteosarcoma — a particularly aggressive bone cancer that is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in adolescents and young adults. Despite its favorable prognosis in patients with localized disease, osteosarcoma that has metastasized portends a five-year survival rate below 30% — a statistic that has not improved in the last four decades.

Here, leveraging osteosarcoma models and functional genomics to study regulatory programs that underlie lung metastasis, we find that colonization is not a single step defined by a single transcriptional program. Instead, it is a trajectory of cell states regulated by distinct factors essential for metastatic progression.

Osteosarcoma — histologic subtypes and clinical features are as follows: Osteosarcoma is broadly classified into intramedullary, surface, and extraskeletal forms, with high-grade intramedullary osteosarcoma comprising nearly 80% of osteosarcomas and most frequently arising in the metaphysis of the distal femur or proximal tibia; low-grade intramedullary osteosarcoma comprise < 2% of cases. Parosteal and periosteal osteosarcomas are juxtacortical variants; parosteal osteosarcomas are low-grade lesions accounting for up to 5% of all osteosarcomas, most commonly in the posterior distal femur, have very low metastatic potential, and can transform to high-grade osteosarcoma in 24% to 43% of cases. High-grade surface osteosarcomas are very rare, accounting for 10% of all juxtacortical osteosarcomas. Osteosarcoma spreads hematogenously, with the lung the most common metastatic site, and "skip lesions" in the same bone can also occur; pain and swelling are the most frequent early symptoms.

### Phase II trial of VEGFR2 inhibitor apatinib for metastatic sarcoma: focus on efficacy and safety [^115GDW3h]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcoma is a rare tumor that accounts for ~1% of all adult and 15% of all pediatric malignancies. An estimated 16,490 people will be diagnosed with bone and soft tissue sarcomas (STS) in the US in 2018, and ~6740 will die of this disease. The National Central Cancer Registry of China estimated that there were 28,000 new bone sarcoma diagnoses and 20,700 deaths from bone sarcoma in China in 2015. The prognosis of sarcoma patients in stage IV is poor, with a median overall survival (mOS) time for STS of ~12 months and a 5-year survival rate of < 10% –. Patients with advanced bone sarcomas such as osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor also have a very poor prognosis. Although chemotherapy is widely used to treat metastatic sarcomas, conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as ifosfamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, cisplatin, dacarbazine, gemcitabine, and docetaxel are not curative, and combined or dose-dense regimens have largely failed to improve response rates. Furthermore, the long-term use of cytotoxic drugs increases the risk of adverse events (AEs). For example, cumulative-dose and dose-intense doxorubicin cause cardiomyopathy, with an associated mortality risk. New therapies for metastatic sarcomas are therefore urgently needed.

### The strategy and clinical relevance of in vitro models of MAP resistance in osteosarcoma: a systematic review [^114vS15T]. Oncogene (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone cancer and affects approximately 2.5 per million people in England equivalent to 135 cases per year. OS is more common in males and a higher incidence rate has been observed in Black patients. The peak age at diagnosis of bone sarcoma for females and males is 13 and 15–17 years, respectively. This reflects a pattern of disease progression in line with growth, with bone development occurring approximately 2 years earlier in pubescent females than males. A second peak is also evident in those above 65 years and is associated with Paget's disease, secondary cancer and a poorer outcome.

The 5-year survival rate increased from 17% to 68% for OS patients with localised disease during the 1970s when chemotherapy was introduced into practice. However, whilst the average 5-year survival for all cancer patients increased by around 20% from 1980 to 2010, 5-year overall survival and recurrence rates for localised OS have stagnated since the 1980s. This is despite an increase in the rate of limb-salvage surgery owing to advancement in surgical technique and earlier detection. This lack of progress is impacted by an absence of improved treatment options over the last 40 years with approximately one third of patients relapsing commonly more than once, with overall survival for these patients reported at 23–29%. In addition, 16% of patients have detectable metastases at diagnosis and up to 77% of these will succumb to the disease within 5 years.

### Comparison of MAPIE versus MAP in patients with a poor response to preoperative chemotherapy for newly diagnosed high-grade osteosarcoma (EURAMOS-1): an open-label, international, randomised controlled trial [^115TQWXj]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

The number of events was lower than anticipated, as event-free survival results were based on 307 event-free survival events, rather than the planned 378; event rate was lower than predicted and our 3-year event-free survival estimate for MAP was 55% (95% CI 49–60) rather than 45%. Follow-up visits started later in the MAPIE group because treatment was longer (40 weeks vs 29 weeks). Therefore early imaging assessments might not have been identically timed by group, resulting in the apparent early separation observed in the event-free survival curve in favour of the MAPIE group.

The timing of our intervention might have been too late because the first cycle of ifosfamide plus etoposide was administered at week 17 (5 weeks from resumption of postoperative therapy). Also, the overall intensity of therapy might have contributed to the inability of MAPIE-treated patients to receive all intended treatment. Ultimately, the best strategy for patients with a poor histological response might not be therapy intensification since this approach has been unsuccessful in childhood soft tissue sarcomasand in a previous study in osteosarcoma. The use of functional imaging early during treatment might identify patients who will have a poor response and allow incorporation of alternative treatment strategies earlier. This technique has been assessed in patients with osteosarcomaand found to predict both histological response and outcome.

We included patients with both initially localised and initially metastatic disease in the same trial because it was not always possible to differentiate up-front between patients with localised disease and those with metastatic disease, and we have therefore also included patients with "possible" metastatic disease; other prognostic factors are the same in patients with both metastatic and localised disease. The inclusion of patients with initial metastases into the EURAMOS-1 trial was unique. The patients with localised disease needed to have no metastatic progression during preoperative therapy to be eligible for randomisation. Additionally, these patients had to undergo resection of all metastatic lesions during the postoperative period. The 3-year event-free survival for patients with metastases was 24% (13–38) in the MAP group and 18% (6–33) in the MAPIE group, and these results are similar to those of other published series. The EURAMOS-1 trial included only 77 patients with metastases, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the outcome for these patients. Additionally, since the EURAMOS-1 patients with metastases needed to have resectable disease, the population included might not be entirely comparable to those included in the previous trials.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for osteosarcoma of the extremities with metastases at presentation: recent experience at the rizzoli institute in 57 patients treated with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and a high dose of methotrexate and ifosfamide [^1144VhLH]. Annals of Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Effective adjuvant or neoadjuvant regimens of chemotherapy have dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity, localized at diagnosis. Currently, little is known about patients with metastatic disease at presentation.

Patients and Methods

From May 1995 to May 2000, 57 patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity, metastatic at presentation, were treated according to the following scheme: primary chemotherapy, restaging, simultaneous resection of primary tumor and metastatic lesions, and maintenance chemotherapy.

Results

Thirty-five patients achieved remission. At a follow-up ranging from 2 to 7 years, seven remained continuously free of disease, one died of chemotherapy-related toxicity and 27 patients relapsed. Twenty-one of the 22 patients who never achieved remission died as a result of the tumor, as well as 20 of the 27 who achieved remission but then relapsed. Of the remaining seven relapsing patients, six are alive with uncontrolled disease, while one is alive and free of disease 24 months after the last post-relapse treatment. Two-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 21% and 55%, respectively. These results are significantly poorer than those achieved in 128 contemporary patients with non-metastatic disease at presentation, treated with the same chemotherapy protocol (2-year EFS and OS of 75% and 94%, respectively).

Conclusions

The results of our study confirm that the prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity, metastatic at presentation, remains poor, despite the use of aggressive treatments.

### Extraskeletal osteosarcoma: an international rare cancer network study [^117J3He6]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Osteosarcoma is a common primary bone cancer which is invasive and arises from mesenchymal cells. It produces osteoid, which is capable of invading local tissue structures and causing metastasis. Extraskeletal osteosarcomas (ESOS) are a rare variant of osteosarcoma located in soft tissue and organs which are not extensions of a primary bone osteosarcoma. It represents < 1% of all de novo sarcomas, and is historically believed to be an aggressive tumor connoting a poor prognosis.

Researchers have long known that ESOS behaves differently than its primary counterpart of osseous origin. ESOS seems to affect more elderly patients, and it does not respond well to chemotherapy. Local and distant failures are common. However, due to the rarity of ESOS, there have been limited advances in trimodality therapies or new biological agent testing. It has been estimated that no more than 350 cases have been recorded, with most being limited to single case reports or small case series. The purpose of this project is to present a recent and relatively large series of ESOS and their associated treatment and survival outcome.

### Assessment of the interval to diagnosis in pediatric bone sarcoma [^112jT7qr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are the 2 most common primary bone malignances in the pediatric population. – Sarcoma patients often present with persistent limb pain that is initially evaluated through plain radiographs, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and then definitively diagnosed by tissue biopsy. In the past few decades, advancements in chemotherapy, surgical technique, and imaging technology have improved the prognosis of these cancers. Prolonged interval to diagnosis remains a modifiable factor that can affect burden of disease and prognostic factors at the time of diagnosis. –

The timely diagnosis of primary bone malignancies in pediatric patients poses a unique challenge. Previous literature on pediatric bone sarcomas report that patient symptoms of pain can be misdiagnosed as sports-related injuries (ie, tendonitis, stress fracture), infection (ie, osteomyelitis), benign processes (ie, myositis ossificans), or even benign nocturnal limb pains ("growing pains") as part of normal development.– Further complicating diagnosis is rarity; these malignancies account for roughly 6% of all childhood malignancies. Prolonged interval to diagnosis may be associated with a poorer prognosis through larger primary tumor size and higher likelihood of metastatic spread at presentation. The delay can also limit future surgical treatment options. Therefore, it is important to evaluate current clinical practice for patterns in the initial presentation of pediatric patients with bone sarcoma.

In this study, we conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with biopsy-proven diagnoses of osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma to investigate interval to diagnosis and clinical and imaging patterns in their initial presentation to our health care system. We hypothesize that some patients have a prolonged interval to diagnosis and that features are present in this subset to indicate early advanced imaging.

### Recurrent osteosarcoma with a single pulmonary metastasis: a multi-institutional review [^111db11B]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Our study is limited by its retrospective nature and the small cohort size that may have affected our ability to further delineate whether some of the clinical prognostic factors would have reached statistical significance. Because our study included only patients who had a relapse more than 1 year after diagnosis and the median time to relapse was 2.5 years, we could not further ascertain whether patients who present with a solitary pulmonary nodule recurrence may in fact represent a subset of relapsed patients with longer duration of disease-free interval, a known good prognostic factor. In the COSS study, a correlation was noted between solitary site of relapse and longer interval to relapse.

In conclusion, our multi-institutional study demonstrated that approximately half of the patients with recurrent osteosarcoma as a solitary pulmonary nodule more than 1 year after diagnosis were long-term survivors. Whether this improved outcome compared with that of patients with recurrent osteosarcoma in general could be related to low disease burden or favourable tumour biology remains to be determined. Our analyses did not reveal factors that help identify patients who are likely to survive or die, although there was a trend for improved outcome for those with smaller nodules or later relapse. It is hoped that clinical genomics or the ability to detect circulating sarcoma cells will help discern which patients will require further therapy in addition to surgery. While the use of salvage chemotherapy did not confer a survival advantage in our study, perhaps novel therapies that are likely to be effective in the setting of minimal residual disease such as immunotherapy, will prove to be beneficial.

### Enhanced immune responses are accompanied by increased MAGEA expression in osteosarcoma metastases [^1175XM5n]. BMJ Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone sarcoma, predominantly occurring in children and young adults, with a second incidence peak in older adults. The 5-year survival rate for localised osteosarcoma is approximately 70% but drops to 20%–30% in the case of metastatic disease, which develops in approximately 50% of osteosarcoma patients. Unfortunately, the clinical prognosis of osteosarcoma patients has barely improved in the last few decades, underlining the need for the development of more effective therapies.

T cell checkpoint blockade immunotherapies have revolutionised cancer treatment, but their impact has been limited in osteosarcoma. For instance, treatment with the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab resulted in a clinical response in only 1 out of 22 osteosarcoma patients. Additionally, a phase 2 clinical trial with the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab, in combination with the CTLA-4 blocker tremelimumab, yielded no responses in five patients with metastatic osteosarcoma. In another completed phase 2 clinical trial that assessed the efficacy of avelumab in 18 patients with recurrent or progressive osteosarcoma, 17 patients showed disease progression and 1 died off study (NCT03006848). The lack of sensitivity of osteosarcomas to these immunotherapies may be attributed to their low mutation burden, which affects the availability of neoantigens. Neoantigen load is closely linked to the therapeutic activity of checkpoint blockade antibodies. A paradigmatic example for this association is provided by the successful outcomes following treatment with PD-1 blockade in a small proportion of patients diagnosed with undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas that presented with high mutation burden. Instead, most osteosarcomas present a highly complex genome where structural variants and copy number alterations can further contribute to immune evasion.

### Pathways of immune exclusion in metastatic osteosarcoma are associated with inferior patient outcomes [^114929Do]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

We hypothesized that (1) the TME of osteosarcoma PMs is significantly different from that of the primary bone tumors, and (2) that a comprehensive analysis of the metastatic TME would reveal multifactorial determinants of osteosarcoma immune responsiveness. Herein, we undertook an orthogonal interrogation approach for studying the TME of metastatic osteosarcoma, implementing human tumor samples and freshly isolated TILs. Our analysis reveals that, compared with the relative 'immune desert' TME of primary bone tumors, the TME of metastatic osteosarcoma represents the 'immune-excluded' phenotype and suggests the engagement of an immunosuppressive host response which could be exploited for clinical benefit of patients.

### Progression before local control in osteosarcoma: outcome and prognosis-predictive factors [^1166UB2v]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The prognosis and impact of early disease progression in patients with osteosarcoma prior to local control (LC), and the potential therapeutic benefits of ifosfamide/etoposide (IE) remain underexplored in the medical literature.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted on pediatric patients (≤ 18 years) with osteosarcoma who presented to King Hussein Cancer Center between June 2006 and March 2022. We studied patients with disease progression before LC.

Results

Among 195 patients, 31 (17males) exhibited disease progression before LC. The median age at diagnosis was 14.1 years, and patients were followed for a median of 23.1 months (range: 5.8–94.7). The majority of tumors were located in the extremities (n = 28). Ten patients (48%) had lung-only metastasis. Twenty-five patients showed progression at the local site only, and six showed progression both at local/metastatic sites. For the 25 patients with local-site-only progression, the decision for 24 was immediate LC via LSS (n = 9), amputation (n = 10), hemimandibulectomy (n = 1), and radiation therapy (n = 1). Three families refused amputation. Among the six patients with combined local/metastatic site progression, the decision was for two to intensify chemotherapy by adding IE, while the other four were recommended immediate LC. However, two of them refused surgery. In total, five patients received IE as intensification for progression, all of whom subsequently progressed. The 5-year event-free survival and overall survival were 27.2% and 31.3%, respectively.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that early disease progression before LC in patients with osteosarcoma is associated with poor prognosis. However, patients initially diagnosed with localized disease and who later exhibited local-disease-only progression appeared to have better outcomes. The potential role of IE in the treatment of patients exhibiting early progression merits further investigation in a larger study cohort.

### Comparison of MAPIE versus MAP in patients with a poor response to preoperative chemotherapy for newly diagnosed high-grade osteosarcoma (EURAMOS-1): an open-label, international, randomised controlled trial [^115r24Sf]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Treatment strategies for high-grade osteosarcoma with multidrug chemotherapy and resection result in 3-year event-free survival of 60–70%. The most common factors predicting survival are presence of metastases, histological response to preoperative chemotherapy, and complete surgical resection. Three of the active drugs in osteosarcomainclude cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate;, this combination (MAP), given preoperatively and postoperatively, is widely used for the treatment of osteosarcoma. Ifosfamide with, or without etoposidealso has activity in this setting and when incorporated into the treatment of patients with metastatic disease seems to improve event-free survival. Though uncontrolled studies suggested that changing therapy on the basis of histological response improves outcomes, the efficacy of this strategy had not been tested in a randomised trial.

### Osteosarcoma: current treatment and a collaborative pathway to success [^117XGikA]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Osteosarcoma is the bone tumor that most commonly affects children, adolescents, and young adults. Before 1970, treatment primarily included surgical resection. However, the introduction of chemotherapy led to a dramatic improvement in prognosis for patients with localized osteosarcoma; long-term survival rates of less than 20% improved to 65% to 70% after the advent of multiagent chemotherapy regimens. Controversy concerning the ideal combination of chemotherapy agents ensued throughout the last quarter of the 20th century because of conflicting and often nonrandomized data. However, large cooperative group studies and international collaboration have demonstrated that the most effective regimens include the combination of high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MAP). The introduction of biologic agents such as muramyl tripeptide and the use of additional cytotoxic chemotherapy such as ifosfamide have not definitively improved the survival of patients with osteosarcoma. Collaborative efforts to increase understanding of the biology of osteosarcoma and the use of preclinical models to test novel agents will be critical to identify the path toward improving outcomes for patients. Once promising agents are identified, an international infrastructure exists for clinical trials. Herein, biologic, preclinical, and clinical trial efforts will be described along with future international collaborative strategies to improve outcomes for patients who develop this challenging tumor.

### Characteristics and prognosis of primary pulmonary osteosarcoma: a pooled analysis [^113GGaH3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment and prognosis

In total, there were 32 patients (65.3%) recorded to have surgery, 10 patients (20.4%) to receive chemotherapy, and 11 patients (22.4%) to receive radiotherapy (Table 1, Additional file 1: Table 1, and Additional file 1: Table 3). While six cases were excluded in further survival analysis due to the unavailable survival in the raw data, and thus, 43 patients were included in subsequent survival analysis. The median OS of these patients was eight months (interquartile range 4.5–12 months), and the 1-year OS and CSS rates were 30.8% and 38.5%, respectively. In the univariable analysis, surgery was associated with improved survival (median OS, ten versus five months; OS, HR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.11–0.50; P < 0.001; Fig. 1). Tumor size (> 7 cm versus ≤ 7 cm, HR = 2.86; 95% CI 1.28–6.40; P = 0.009), metastatic diseases (non-metastasis versus metastasis, HR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.18–0.87; P = 0.017), and pleural effusion (absence versus presence, HR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.15–0.83; P = 0.016) were also significantly associated with OS (Fig. 1; Table 2).

### Osteosarcoma [^111ZLFNL]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The successful treatment of patients with osteosarcoma requires close cooperation within an experienced multidisciplinary team including pediatric or medical oncologists, surgeons, pathologists and radiologists. Therefore, therapy should be performed in specialized centers able to provide access to the full spectrum of care. As in other rare malignancies, treatment should be administered within prospective multicenter trials. Therapy must include complete surgical removal of all detectable tumor sites as well as multiagent chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen should include several or all of the following four drugs: doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate with leukovorin-rescue, cisplatin and ifosfamide. Preoperative (neoadjuvant) plus postoperative (adjuvant) polychemotherapy should be preferred, because it allows preparation for safe surgery and preparation of the appropriate prosthesis for the individual patient. The choice of the postponed definitive surgical procedure should be influenced by the anatomical site of the primary tumor, its relationship to neighboring structures, such as vessels and nerves, age and growth potential of the patient, and probably also by the response of the tumor to preoperative chemotherapy. A major, as yet unsolved, problem is the dismal prognosis for patients with unresectable or relapsed osteosarcomas. Novel approaches are needed in order to improve their prognosis.

### How do you design randomised trials for smaller populations? A framework [^112S2Cn5]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Case study: thetrial

Osteosarcoma is a rare disease by any definition, with 150–200 new cases per year in the UK. Theprotocol consisted of two RCTs designed to assess the effect of post-operative therapy on care. All patients underwent a three-drug induction regimen, consisting of two cycles of cisplatin and doxorubicin along with four cycles of methotrexate (MAP), before proceeding to surgical resection. After an assessment of the histological response of the tumour to chemotherapy at the time of surgery, one randomised comparison was conducted in 'poor responders' and another in 'good responders' (an example of subsetting referred to in the introduction). Here, we focus on the good responders, who were randomised between further MAP chemotherapy and MAPifn (which involved adding pegylated interferon α -2b as maintenance therapy for approximately 18 months after MAP).

The sample size calculation used event-free survival as the primary outcome. It was assumed that about 70% of good responders would experience events on the control arm by 3 years, and looked to detect a hazard ratio of 0.63 (a 10% absolute improvement) with 80% power, using a two-sided 5% significance level. This required 147 events across the two arms, which would necessitate accrual of 576 good responders over 3.5 years for an answer after 5 years in total.

After outlining the framework, we will consider how it could have been applied to the design and analysis of.

High grade osteosarcoma

Curative treatment for high-grade osteosarcoma comprises neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, typically taking 6–9 months. Combination treatment increases survival from 10–20% (surgery alone) to around 60%. If possible, patients should enter clinical trials. For older patients, it is reasonable to consider surgery first, followed by adapted chemotherapy protocols.

Advantages of neoadjuvant treatment include rapid improvement of symptoms; early treatment of micrometastatic disease; facilitated resection in responsive tumours; time to plan primary surgery (e.g. manufacture customised endoprostheses); and prognostic information about the histological response, although a survival benefit over postoperative chemotherapy alone is unproven.

The most widespread regimen is multi-agent therapy with MAP (high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX), doxorubicin and cisplatin) and is recommended for UK patients with potentially resectable tumours up to 40 years of age (Table 2). Impaired renal function and certain drugs can delay methotrexate clearance, causing mucositis and nephrotoxicity and close monitoring is required.

Table 2
Systemic treatment for Osteosarcoma and other high-grade bone sarcomas*.

*Includes leiomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, spindle cell sarcoma, dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, malignant giant cell tumour.

Compassionate-access in osteosarcoma.

For patients over 40 years and those who cannot tolerate HDMTX, regimens without methotrexate may still be effective. AP alone is considered suitable therapy, although doses are not standardised and may vary according to performance status, cardiac and renal function and other co-morbidities.

The aim of surgery is complete tumour removal, preserving function where possible. Limb salvage is safe for most extremity tumours if adequate surgical margins can be achieved. Wide surgical margins reduce the risk of local recurrence but may not be possible. If there is a good histological necrosis rate (> 90%) after chemotherapy, a closer surgical margin can be considered safe. However, if there is a poor response to chemotherapy and "close" or positive margins, it is unclear whether amputation improves survival despite the increased risk of local recurrence.

### Deep domain adversarial learning for species-agnostic classification of histologic subtypes of osteosarcoma [^1146oXDg]. The American Journal of Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is a rare but aggressive pediatric malignancy with approximately 800 cases reported annually in the United States. Patients with metastatic or relapsed disease have dismal outcomes, with survival rates of < 30% despite aggressive salvage regimens that typically include additional surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with agents such as ifosfamide, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine, and topotecan. Most osteosarcomas display osteoblastic differentiation, sometimes intermixed with one or more additional histologic patterns, including chondroblastic, fibroblastic, giant cell rich, and vessel rich. Currently, the only reliable histologic marker for prognosis in human OS is the amount of necrosis achieved after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This assessment is based on review of tumor sections harvested after local tumor control via surgery. Despite this, a subset of patients with high necrosis still develop metastatic disease after completion of frontline therapy. Hence, additional prognostic biomarkers are needed for accurate prognosis prediction. Because naturally occurring canine osteosarcoma has strong biological, molecular, and histologic similarities to human osteosarcoma and is at least 10 times more common than human osteosarcoma, it can serve as a powerful translational model for cancer biomarker investigation and drug development.

Soft tissue sarcomas comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies of mesenchymal origin. Although sarcomas can arise virtually anywhere, the most common primary site is the extremity. The development of metastatic disease poses a major clinical problem because it is seldom amenable to a curative treatment. However, with careful and expert multidisciplinary team selection of patients with metastatic sarcoma-balancing probability of benefit with certain toxicity-a combined multimodality approach may provide hope to a select few for prolonged survival and even cure.

Table 3 summarizes the univariate and multivariate analyses for OS in all patients. Univariate analysis showed that poor OS was related to primary size > 10 cm (P = 0.002), no surgery (P < 0.001), and older age at diagnosis (P = 0.002). In the final multivariate analysis, pathologic size and age at diagnosis were dropped as variables in the best-fitting Cox model. Primary size > 10 cm (P = 0.005) remained prognostic for OS in the multivariate Cox model.

In multivariate analysis for DFS, primary size > 10 cm (P = 0.01) and age (P < 0.001) remained significant. Similar to the findings of the OS analysis, the DFS analysis showed older age to be associated with poor DFS.

### Results of treatment for metastatic osteosarcoma with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery [^1177Zdkt]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of the current study was to define the survival outcome variables for the 85 patients with Stage IIB osteosarcoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the authors' institution from 1982 to 1997. A minimum 4-year followup or death was a requisite for inclusion. Forty-three patients were relapse-free survivors and 14 had no evidence of disease at followup for an overall survival of 67%. Twenty-nine patients had thoracotomy and nine have no evidence of disease with a minimum 4-year followup from last thoracotomy. The mean time to metastasis after diagnosis for patients presenting with Stage IIB disease was 12.8 months. There was no difference in the survival for any of the three chemotherapy protocols, used during the 15 years included in this analysis. There was a significant relation between length of time to relapse and survival. For each additional year without relapse, there is an 18% increase in chance of survival. In patients who were treated with thoracotomy, the number of metastatic nodules was a significant predictor of survival; specifically, each nodule increased the risk of death by 43%. A favorable outcome in this cohort of patients is related to the length of time between initiation of therapy and diagnosis of metastasis, and the number of metastatic foci.

### UK guidelines for the management of bone sarcomas [^112cPBwv]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Craniofacial osteosarcoma

Jaw and other craniofacial osteosarcomas present specific management problems, especially for local control, and must be referred to a bone sarcoma MDT before surgery. The use of chemotherapy is not clearly defined but is considered a standard treatment option. 18FDG PET is more reliable than standard imaging in evaluating response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in craniofacial bone sarcomas and may correlate better with outcome than histological response. Radiotherapy with techniques such as proton beam or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) may be offered to primary tumours where surgery is not possible or would lead to significant morbidity. Similarly, adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered if surgical margins are close or involved, or there is a high risk of local recurrence and further surgery is not possible.

Metastatic disease

Patients with metastatic osteosarcoma are a heterogeneous group and may be treated using the same regimens as for non-metastatic osteosarcoma, provided surgical resection of all disease sites is feasible. Approximately 30% of patients with primary metastatic osteosarcoma and over 40% of those who achieve complete surgical remission become long-term survivors. For those with inoperable disease, the intensity and toxicity of therapy regimens need to be carefully balanced with the impact on quality of life.

### Clinical and molecular analysis of pathologic fracture-associated osteosarcoma: microRNA profile is different and correlates with prognosis [^116h2H2m]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

MicroRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of posttranslational genes. The presence of some specific microRNAs has been associated with increased risk of both local recurrence and metastasis and worse survival in patients with osteosarcoma. Pathologic fractures in osteosarcoma are considered to be more the manifestation of a neoplasm with a more aggressive biological behavior than the cause itself of worse prognosis. However, this has not been proved at the biological or molecular level. Currently, there has not been a microRNA profiling study of patients who have osteosarcoma with and without pathologic fractures that has described differences in terms of microRNA profiling between these two groups and their correlation with biologic behavior.

Questions/Purposes

(1) In patients with osteosarcoma of the extremities, how do the microRNA profiles of those with and without pathologic fractures compare? (2) What relationship do microRNAs have with local recurrence, risk of metastasis, disease-specific survival, and overall survival in osteosarcoma patients with pathologic fractures?

Methods

Between 1994 and 2013, 217 patients were diagnosed and treated at our institution for osteosarcoma of the extremities. Patients were excluded if (1) they underwent oncologic resection of the osteosarcoma at an outside institution (two patients) or (2) they were diagnosed with an extraskeletal osteosarcoma (29 patients) or (3) they had less than 1 year of clinical follow-up and no oncologic outcome (local recurrence, metastasis, or death) (four patients). A total of 182 patients were eligible. Of those, 143 were high-grade osteosarcomas. After evaluation of tumor samples before chemotherapy treatment, a total of 80 consecutive samples were selected for sequencing. Demographic and clinical comparison between the sequenced and non-sequenced patients did not demonstrate any differences, confirming that both groups were comparable. Diagnostic samples from the extremities of 80 patients with high-grade extremity osteosarcomas who had not yet received chemotherapy underwent microRNA sequencing for an ongoing large-scale osteosarcoma genome profiling project at our institution. Six samples were removed after a second look by a musculoskeletal pathologist who verified cellularity and quality of samples to be sequenced, leaving a total of 74 patients. Of these, two samples were removed as they were confirmed to be pelvic tumors in a second check after sequencing. The final study sample was 72 patients (11 patients with pathologic fractures and 61 without). Sequencing data were correlated with fractures and local recurrence, risk of metastasis, disease-specific survival, and overall survival through Kaplan-Meier analyses.

Results

Several microRNAs were expressed differently between the two groups. Among the markers with the highest differential expression (edgeR and DESeq algorithms), Hsa-mIR 656–3p, hsa-miR 493–5p, and hsa-miR 381–3p were upregulated in patients with pathologic fractures, whereas hsa-miR 363, hsa-miR 885–5p, and has-miR 20b-5p were downregulated. The highest differential expression fracture and nonfracture-associated microRNA markers also distinguished groups of patients with different metastasis risk, a well as different disease-specific and overall survival. Furthermore, the profile of pathologic fractures demonstrated a higher differential expression for microRNA markers that were previously associated with a higher risk of metastasis and lower survival rates in patients with osteosarcoma.

Conclusions

In patients who have osteosarcoma, the microRNA profiles of those with pathologic fractures are different than of patients without pathologic fractures. The highest differential expression mircroRNA molecules in patients with pathologic fractures predict also higher risk of metastatic disease as well as worse disease-specific survival and overall survival. Furthermore, we found higher differential expression of microRNAs in the pathologic fracture group previously associated with poor prognosis. The higher risk of metastasis and poorer overall survival in patients with pathologic fractures is inherent to tumor aggressive biologic behavior. It is plausible that the fracture itself is not the direct cause of worse prognosis but another manifestation of tumor biologic aggressiveness. Identification of these molecules through liquid biopsies may help to determine which patients may benefit from surgery before fractures occur. The same technology can be applied to identify patterns of response to conventional chemotherapy, assisting in more specific and accurate systemic therapy.

Osteosarcoma — diagnostic workup and imaging: Initial workup should include imaging of the primary site (contrast-enhanced MRI with or without CT), chest imaging including chest CT, and head-to-toe FDG-PET/CT and/or bone scan. More detailed imaging (MRI with and without contrast or CT) of skeletal metastatic sites to identify abnormalities identified on primary imaging is required for suspected metastatic disease. Plain x-rays show cortical destruction and irregular reactive bone formation; bone scan may be useful to identify additional synchronous lesions; MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast, may be essential for operative planning, and is the best imaging modality to define extent within bone and soft tissues, detect "skip" metastases, and evaluate anatomic relationships.

### Outcome of postradiation osteosarcoma does not correlate with chemotherapy response [^112YwGzR]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Postradiation osteosarcoma is a rare tumor with a historically poor prognosis. Recent reports concerning the prognosis of the disease have been conflicting. We ascertained the long-term outcome of patients with this disease treated in the era of contemporary chemotherapy. Twenty-seven patients diagnosed with postradiation osteosarcoma and treated with chemotherapy and surgical resection from 1980–2003 were identified. Demographics, anatomic location, stage, chemo- therapy, necrosis rate, recurrence and metastatic rates were recorded; Kaplan-Meier survival rates were estimated. The median age was 54 years (range, 12–86 years). Nineteen patients were female and eight patients were male. Median followup was 39.2 months (range, 0–218 months). Twenty-two patients received induction chemotherapy for a mean of four cycles (range, 2–6 cycles). Mean tumor necrosis was 63.5%. Seven patients had 90% necrosis; four of these patients died of their disease. The mean survival was 23 months, and the 5-year disease free survival estimate was 27.2%. Histologic response to chemotherapy did not correlate with survival. Patients who had a latency of greater than 10 years after radiation had a better prognosis. Unlike conventional osteosarcoma, response to chemotherapy (necrosis) did not have prognostic significance. Current chemotherapy regimens fail to impact survival in postradiation osteosarcoma.

Abstract

We present the case of a 75-year-old man with osteosarcoma of the sternum in whom 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT showed high radiotracer activity in the primary tumor and metastatic lesions than 18F-FDG PET/CT. The present case shows that 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT is very useful for staging of osteosarcoma due to in vivo expression of PSMA. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT can have potential effects on prognosis and in response assessment following treatment in osteosarcoma. The use of PSMA-targeted radioligand treatments may be beneficial especially in metastatic chemorefractory osteosarcoma.

### Targeted inhibition of SCFconfers anti-tumor activities resulting in a survival benefit in osteosarcoma [^111fow3g]. Oncogene (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents, characterized by aggressive growth and frequent metastases. Despite an aggressive treatment protocol, including multi-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy and ablative surgery, the long-term survival of patients has remained unchanged for decades. Patients who present with overt metastatic or relapsed diseases sustain a 5-year survival rate of less than 30%, illustrating the inadequacy of the existing treatment approach. Unfortunately, efforts to modify or intensify current chemotherapy have failed to improve outcomes. New strategies, including immunotherapeutic approaches, have been disappointing to date. At present, the treatment options for patients with either metastatic or relapsed OS are minimal.

OS is characterized by a high level of genomic heterogeneity and instability, coupled with the lack of a defining fusion gene product or mutation, which may account for the lack of a targeted therapeutic approach. However, recent next-generation sequencing studies have revealed that OS tumors share specific common alterations that can be identified from their genomic landscape. While a single treatment for OS is unlikely, these findings offer new hope for a targeted genome-informed approach. Given that RB1 and TP53 are the most common co-inactivated tumor suppressors in OS, it is likely that the loss of function of these genes is a critical failure of the anti-tumor mechanism in this cancer. Our previous study revealed that RB1 and TP53 was the only pair of genetic alterations co-occurring in OS with statistical significance across multiple datasets. Since p53 and Rb1 cannot be reactivated or re-introduced into the patient's tumor, their inactivation poses a formidable challenge, making OS very difficult to treat.

### Extraskeletal osteosarcoma: an international rare cancer network study [^115mHRe9]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Rare Cancer Network (RCN) is a consortium of international oncology investigators dedicated to advancing the knowledge of care for patients with rare tumors. A project was initiated to study the collective multi-institutional experience of ESOS. Inclusion criteria were confirmed pathologic diagnosis and a minimum of 6-month follow-up after treatment completion. Pathology was reviewed in each case to reconfirm the diagnosis of ESOS. The local medical records were reviewed in full, and anonymized data were sent to 1 author (T.T.S.) for further analysis. Every effort has been made to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the collected data. Patient and tumor characteristics and multimodality treatment information were included. If ESOS originated from an organ site, the exclusion of carcinoma as a diagnosis had to be confirmed. Clinically, the sequence and choices of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were determined according to each hospital's local policy.

Thirty-seven eligible patients were analyzed. The patients were diagnosed between 1998 and 2010, with an additional long-term survivor who was initially diagnosed in 1972. All patients received definitive combined modality therapies, including surgery, radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy, except for 4 patients with initially metastatic disease. The patients with metastases at diagnosis were all included in the overall survival (OS) but not in the disease-free survival (DFS) analyses. DFS, calculated for the 33 patients who initially presented with nonmetastatic ESOS, was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or local/metastatic relapse, whichever was earliest. OS was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or death from any cause. The work-up of studied patients included a complete history and physical, laboratory examination, computed tomography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging, and tissue biopsy. For patients who experienced relapse, salvage therapy was given and information collected. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at all participating institutions.

### Comparison of MAPIE versus MAP in patients with a poor response to preoperative chemotherapy for newly diagnosed high-grade osteosarcoma (EURAMOS-1): an open-label, international, randomised controlled trial [^1113pJMC]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Our trial has several strengths, including being an international randomised controlled trial in a rare disease with widely applicable results. It also has several limitations including the lower-than-expected acceptance of randomisation and the lower-than-predicted observed event rate. The percentage of viable tumours, at the individual patient level was not collected in this study. This limits our ability to assess overall prognosis by percentage of viable tumour. Because the study question was whether altering therapy on the basis of histological response improved outcome, we do not think collection of those data is crucial to the study results overall. Another potential limitation is the fact that we did not include central imaging review. This could have resulted in local sites removing patients from the study for apparent local disease progression, which might actually have had represented only pseudoprogression. In addition, the inclusion of patients deemed to have resectable metastases without undergoing central review increases the possibility that those patients did not truly have resectable disease. The fact that a higher proportion of patients with metastatic disease were not randomised raises the possibility that some local institutions misjudged the ability to do a complete resection. The number of patients removed from protocol therapy because metastases were unresectable might be anticipated to be balanced between the treatment groups. Lastly, although we collected total dose received by each patient, we did not collect it in a way that allows us to present relative dose intensity received. This is a potential limitation especially because patients treated in the experimental group appeared to receive less of the intended therapy.

The addition of mifamurtide to the MAP chemotherapy regimen for patients with localised osteosarcoma resulted in improved overall survival. The drug was approved for use in Europe on the basis of those results, but has not been approved for use in the United States. However, the results suggest that assessment of drugs such as mifamurtide that stimulate the immune system might improve outcome. We have subsequently reached an apparent plateau in outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma. The development of strategies to better understand the biology of this tumourmight aid in the identification of drug targets. Collaboration with veterinary oncologists might speed up target identification in human beings as canine osteosarcoma is more common than human osteosarcoma. Genome-wide analysis of osteosarcoma samples might also help identify important targetable genetic mutations. The identification of genetic alterations that could be used as therapeutic targets is an important step to develop better treatment approaches.

### Update on osteosarcoma [^117679KU]. Current Oncology Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common primary tumor of bone, mainly affecting children and adolescents. Here we discuss recent advances in surgical and systemic therapies, and highlight potentially new modalities in preclinical evaluation and prognostication.

Recent Findings

The advent of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy has markedly improved the disease-free recurrence and overall survival of OSA. However, treatment efficacy has been stagnant since the 1980s. This plateau has prompted preclinical and clinical research into in precision surgery, inhaled chemotherapy to increase pulmonary drug concentration without systemic side effects, and novel immunomodulators intended to block molecular pathways associated with OSA proliferation and metastasis. With the advent of novel surgical techniques and new forms and vectors for chemotherapy, it is hoped that OSA treatment outcomes will exceed their currently sustained plateau in the near future.

### Single-center experience with ifosfamide monotherapy as second-line treatment of recurrent / metastatic osteosarcoma [^117636vs]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

One of the important results of this study is the prognostic impact of PS. This was already shown for some other tumors, for example, soft tissue sarcoma 19.

This study is limited by its retrospective character, the long study period, and no routine monitoring interval of computed tomography scan. All patients underwent computed tomography scan at least every two to three cycles. We made an effort to report the toxicity of ifosfamide therapy, but this is probably an underestimation of the real toxicity and is probably also biased. The toxicity of ifosfamide monotherapy is well known. The long study period and the different time periods the study groups were treated in (5 g/m 2 until 1997 and 9 g/m 2 from 1997 until now) hamper the study because supportive care has improved during the years and this could cause a difference in OS. Also, the improvements in imaging could result in an earlier diagnosis of recurrent disease and therefore a suggested improvement in OS. Although in univariate analysis OS was better for 9 g/m 2 and there was a trend toward a better PFS for patients treated with 9 g/m 2, no significant impact of the dose on OS was found in multivariate analysis. This study is still underpowered because of the still small number of patients included, but other causes are also present. At baseline, there were differences in the number of pretreated patients between both groups (higher number of patients with two lines of chemotherapy in the 5 g/m 2 group). This could have an impact on the results in several ways: selecting for patients with a more indolent disease and a more chemosensitive tumor or creating more chemoresistant tumors. It is not possible to determine what the most dominant effect is. Also, PS was slightly imbalanced at baseline, favoring the 9 g/m 2 group, which could improve the OS in this patient group. Due to the still small patient group it is not possible to distinguish the effect of PS and ifosfamide dose. Although it was the largest series, the small number of patients did not allow us to detect differences in for example histologic subtypes of osteosarcoma. Lastly, we could not compare the outcomes of ifosfamide treatment with an untreated patient cohort of the Leiden University Medical Center. Although an untreated patient group exists, most of these patients had a reason for which they were not treated, and the comparison would result in a biased study. However, we did compare the data with the placebo arm of the REGOBONE study and with the retrospective study of the Children's Oncology Group, showing that ifosfamide is an effective treatment (as reported above) 16, 17.

### Biology and therapeutic advances for pediatric osteosarcoma [^116mCi2G]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. Survival for these patients was poor with the use of surgery and/or radiotherapy. The introduction of multi-agent chemotherapy dramatically improved the outcome for these patients and the majority of modern series report 3-year disease-free survival of 60%-70%. This paper describes current strategies for treating patients with osteosarcoma as well as review of the clinical features, radiologic and diagnostic work-up, and pathology. The authors review the state of the art management for patients with osteosarcoma in North America and Europe including the use of limb-salvage procedures and reconstruction as well as discuss the etiologic and biologic factors associated with tumor development. Therapy-related sequelae and future directions in the biology and therapy for these patients are also discussed.

Chemotherapy and Radiation

One pitfall regarding this patient is the inability to administer chemotherapy. For high-grade osteosarcomas and primary bone sarcomas, chemotherapy is standard, and without chemotherapy, there is only a 20% 5-year survival rate for osteosarcoma. Limb salvage for most bone sarcomas without chemotherapy is unlikely to result in long-term survival. The hope for this patient is that micrometastases are not present and the sarcoma was identified in the early stages of transformation from a benign GCT. Ideally, this patient will have an improved quality of life and functional status if she does develop metastatic disease. Similarly, many soft-tissue sarcomas require radiation therapy to prevent local recurrence. Tumors that require chemotherapy or radiation should be approached with caution because limb salvage may be a more extensive procedure with more complications for a patient that may not survive to appreciate the benefits. At minimum, a chest radiograph should be performed to evaluate for lung metastases because metastatic disease found on presentation is likely to result in a shorter course of survival. The complexity of the surgery should also be a consideration. A superficial soft-tissue sarcoma where a 2-cm margin of normal tissue can be resected safely with primary closure or a skin graft is a better candidate than a tumor that is compressing the major vasculature or requires a free flap for coverage. In many cases, palliative care or a palliative amputation should be the treatment of choice if limb-salvage surgery is risky or extensive (Figure 5).

Given the lack of chemotherapeutic options, the patient's prognosis is poor. Owing to the risk of infection and blood loss with surgical reconstruction, palliative amputation would be an option for both resection of the tumor and pain control.

### Multifocal osteosarcoma: unusual presentation and imaging findings [^113VtwbS]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Multifocal osteosarcoma is usually defined as the occurrence of a tumor at 2 or more sites in a patient without pulmonary metastases and may be synchronous with more than one lesion seen at presentation or metachronous with new tumors developing after the initial treatment. It is difficult to determine whether these represent synchronous multiple primary lesions or metastases. We present a rare case of widespread synchronous multifocal osteosarcoma and a brief review of the literature.

### Metastatic osteosarcoma at diagnosis: analysis of 92 cases from a single institution… [^1173R3gi]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract e23506 Background: Metastatic osteosarcoma with synchronous metastases accounts for 20–25% of all new cases of osteosarcoma. Lungs are the most common site of metastases at presentation followed by Bone. 5- years Overall Survival of MOS ranges from 11 to 40%. In a previous study from our institution on 57 pts < 40 years old the 2- and 5-year OS were 55% and 18%. Results: From August 2000 to October 2018, 92 patients had a diagnosis of MOS: median age 16. 5 yrs, gender rate was M 51/F 41, axial primary tumor in 15 cases, extremity in
77. 2, Cyclophosphamyde-Etoposide, TKI, and a few received experimental drugs. Complete remission was obtained in 26/92, in 19 cases after surgical metastasectomy.

In 30 pts the information of PGP was available; patients with positive PGP had a worst overall survival as compared to those PGP negative. The 2-yrs OS for all 92 pts from diagnosis was 66% and 5-yrs OS was 26%. From the end of treatment, for those who reached a CR the 5-year OS was 57% vs 9% for those who did not. At multivariate analysis, only site of metastases and number of lung nodules were confirmed as significant for OS. Conclusions: Compared to our previous report from 20 yrs ago, 2-years and 5 yrs OS of MOS has improved but it remain unsatisfactory.

### Primary metastatic osteosarcoma: presentation and outcome of patients treated on neoadjuvant cooperative osteosarcoma study group protocols… [^116QTLck]. ASCO (2003). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose: To determine demographic data and define prognostic factors for long-term outcome in patients presenting with high-grade osteosarcoma of bone with clinically detectable metastases at initial presentation. Patients and Methods: Of 1, 765 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated high-grade osteosarcomas of bone registered in the neoadjuvant Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group studies before 1999, 202 patients had proven metastases at diagnosis and therefore were enrolled onto an analysis of demographic-, tumor-, and treatment-related variables, response, and survival. The intended therapeutic strategy included pre- and postoperative multiagent chemotherapy as well as aggressive surgery of all resectable lesions. Results: With a median follow-up of 1. 9 years, 60 patients were alive, 37 of whom were in continuously complete surgical remission.

Actuarial overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 29% and 24%, respectively. In univariate analysis, survival was significantly correlated with patient age, site of the primary tumor, number and location of metastases, number of involved organ systems, histologic response of the primary tumor to preoperative chemotherapy, and completeness and time point of surgical resection of all tumor sites. However, after multivariate Cox regression analysis, only multiple metastases at diagnosis and macroscopically incomplete surgical resection remained significantly associated with inferior outcomes. Conclusion: The number of metastases at diagnosis and the completeness of surgical resection of all clinically detected tumor sites are of independent prognostic value in patients with proven primary metastatic osteosarcoma.

### Osteosarcoma and UPS of bone treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^116T2hPo]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteosarcoma and Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma of Bone Treatment –Health Professional Version. A meta-analysis concluded that systemic adjuvant chemotherapy improves the prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma of the head and neck, while small series have not shown such a benefit. Another large meta-analysis detected no benefit of chemotherapy for patients with osteosarcoma of the head and neck, but suggested that incorporating chemotherapy into the treatment plan for patients with high-grade tumors may improve survival. A retrospective analysis identified a trend toward better survival in patients with high-grade osteosarcoma of the mandible and maxilla who received adjuvant chemotherapy. Presence of clinically detectable metastatic disease Patients with localized disease have a much better prognosis than patients with overt metastatic disease.

As many as 20% of patients have radiographically detectable metastases at diagnosis, with the lung being the most common site. The prognosis for patients with metastatic disease appears to be determined largely by site of metastases, number of metastases, and surgical resectability of the metastatic disease. 34] Number of metastases: Patients with skip metastases have been reported to have inferior prognoses. However, an analysis of the German Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group suggests that skip lesions in the same bone do not confer an inferior prognosis if they are included in planned surgical resection. Skip metastasis in a bone other than the primary bone should be considered systemic metastasis.

Surgical resectability of metastases: Patients who have complete surgical ablation of the primary and metastatic tumor after chemotherapy may attain long-term survival, although overall event-free survival rates remain about 20% to 30% for patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis. Patients with metastatic osteosarcoma were eligible for the European and American Osteosarcoma Study only if they had disease that was potentially resectable. Although the patients with metastatic disease had an overall 5-year EFS rate of only 28%, those who achieved a complete surgical remission at all sites had a 5-year EFS rate of 64% and an OS rate of 79%.

### Osteosarcoma and UPS of bone treatment-NCI… [^112mhR5G]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

- Localized osteosarcoma or UPS has not spread out of the bone where the cancer started. There may be one or more areas of cancer in the bone that can be removed during surgery.
- Metastatic osteosarcoma or UPS has spread from the bone in which the cancer began to other parts of the body. The cancer most often spreads to the lungs. It may also spread to other bones. Treatment of Localized Osteosarcoma and Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma of Bone Treatment of newly diagnosed localized osteosarcoma and UPS of bone may include:

- surgery to remove the tumor
- chemotherapy before or after surgery to remove the tumor
- radiation therapy if surgery cannot be done or if the tumor was not completely removed by surgery. Treatment of Metastatic Osteosarcoma and Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma of Bone Lung Metastasis When osteosarcoma or UPS spreads, it usually spreads to the lung.

Treatment of newly diagnosed osteosarcoma and UPS that has spread to the lung may include chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the primary cancer and more chemotherapy. Then, the doctor will remove the cancer in the lung and give additional chemotherapy.
- Chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the primary cancer. More chemotherapy is given after surgery. This may be followed by surgery to remove cancer that has spread to other areas of the body.
- Surgery to remove the primary cancer, followed by chemotherapy. Then the doctor will remove the cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and give combination chemotherapy. Treatment of Recurrent Osteosarcoma and Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma of Bone Treatment depends on where the cancer recurred and whether it has recurred more than once.
- surgery to remove the tumor
- chemotherapy
- radiation therapy
- samarium with or without stem cells, as palliative treatment to relieve pain and improve quality of life
- **For tumors that have recurred twice, treatment may include**:

- surgery to remove the cancer and chemotherapy
- chemotherapy alone Learn more about these treatments in the Treatment Option Overview. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.
