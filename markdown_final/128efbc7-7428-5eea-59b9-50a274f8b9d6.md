## Question

How to read spirometry result?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to read and interpret spirometry results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying test quality and acceptability. Then, I should compare key indices to appropriate reference values and decide on abnormality using the lower limit of normal. Next, I will classify the ventilatory pattern as obstructive, restrictive, mixed, or normal. After that, I should assess severity and, if obstruction is present, evaluate bronchodilator responsiveness. Finally, I will integrate clinical context, consider longitudinal change, and note special populations and limitations, making sure I double-check areas prone to misclassification and misinterpretation.

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals: spirometry measures forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second, and interpretation hinges on three pillars — test quality, comparison to valid reference equations, and a stepwise interpretive algorithm — so I need to ensure each of these is addressed before drawing conclusions [^a5a9b5b5] [^f90761ea].

> Wait, let me verify the quality of the test session before anything else, because poor maneuvers can mimic disease or mask it. I should check that at least three acceptable efforts were obtained, that the two largest FVC and FEV1 values are within 150 mL of each other, and that the end-of-test criteria are met; I also need to review the flow–volume and volume–time curves for artifacts like cough, hesitation, or early termination, and I should assign or acknowledge the ATS/ERS quality grade, recognizing that grades A–C are generally usable while D–F warrant caution or repetition [^d69eca23] [^798d4e3e] [^6eff81f9].

> Hold on, I should verify the reference framework next. I need to ensure the correct reference equations were used for the patient's age, sex, height, and ancestry, and I should prefer z-scores over percent predicted because z-scores account for variability and allow consistent interpretation across ages and sizes; importantly, I must remember that the lower limit of normal is typically the fifth percentile, corresponding to a z-score of about −1.645, and I should avoid fixed cutoffs like 80% predicted or FEV1/FVC less than 0.70 except when following specific diagnostic algorithms such as GOLD for COPD, which I will reconcile shortly [^c20ddea7] [^681fd2f9] [^64462d9d].

> I will now examine the core indices. Let me think about FEV1, FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio, and I should double-check that the best FEV1 and best FVC are used to compute the ratio even if they come from different maneuvers. I need to ensure I report the absolute values, percent predicted, and z-scores, and I should confirm that the FEV1/FVC ratio is reported as a decimal rather than a percentage of predicted to avoid miscommunication [^e98c921b] [^f7d7cfa0].

> Next, I should review whether the results are abnormal. Let me reconsider the principle: abnormality is defined by values below the fifth percentile of a healthy, non-smoking population, so I should flag FEV1, FVC, or FEV1/FVC as abnormal when the z-score is less than −1.645, keeping in mind that values near the LLN carry uncertainty and may warrant repeat testing or correlation with symptoms and risk factors [^681fd2f9] [^64462d9d].

> Now, I will classify the ventilatory pattern. Obstruction is present when the FEV1/FVC ratio is below the LLN, restriction when the FVC is below the LLN with a normal or high FEV1/FVC, and mixed when both the ratio and FVC are low. But wait, what if I used a fixed FEV1/FVC less than 0.70 to define obstruction? I should confirm that this fixed ratio can overcall obstruction in older adults and undercall it in younger adults, so using the LLN is preferred when the clinical question is not specifically COPD staging, though GOLD still uses post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than 0.70 to diagnose COPD, which I will reconcile case-by-case [^f90761ea] [^a5416095] [^623c2680].

> Let me think about severity. I should confirm that severity for obstruction is typically graded by the percent predicted FEV1, with common thresholds of 70%, 60%, 50%, and 35% defining mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively, while remembering these cut points are convention-based rather than outcome-derived. For restriction, severity is often inferred from the degree of FVC reduction, though I should acknowledge that formal severity grading for restriction is less standardized than for obstruction [^f90761ea] [^9a3749fc].

> If obstruction is present, I need to check for reversibility. I should confirm that bronchodilator testing was performed after appropriate withholding of short-acting bronchodilators, and I will define a significant response as an increase in FEV1 or FVC of at least 12% and 200 mL in adults, or more than 12% in children, noting that a robust response supports asthma, whereas a minimal or absent response is more consistent with COPD, though reversibility alone is neither sensitive nor specific for asthma and must be interpreted in context [^f90761ea] [^750da4d9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should integrate the spirometry with the clinical picture, including symptoms, exposures, smoking history, comorbidities, and prior spirometry. I need to ensure that discordant results are not due to poor effort, suboptimal technique, or equipment issues, and I should consider alternative explanations such as upper airway obstruction or cardiac disease when the pattern does not fit standard obstructive or restrictive physiology [^f90761ea] [^a19327ee].

> Next, I should review longitudinal change, especially in occupational or surveillance settings. I need to check for excessive FEV1 decline using accepted methods such as a 15% fall from baseline, the limit of longitudinal decline, or linear regression of FEV1 slope, and I should confirm that the same reference equations and testing conditions are used over time to avoid artifactual change. If baseline values were above 100% predicted, even small absolute declines can represent clinically meaningful losses, so I should interpret relative changes carefully [^aa75b9bf] [^78f8b440].

> I should double-check special populations and contexts. In children, I need to ensure pediatric reference equations and appropriate reversibility thresholds are used, and I should remember that normal spirometry does not exclude asthma, so bronchoprovocation or FeNO may be needed when suspicion remains high. In older adults, I must be cautious with fixed FEV1/FVC cutoffs and consider the LLN to avoid overdiagnosis. In occupational health, I should confirm that results are interpreted against both population norms and the worker's personal baseline, and I need to be aware of race-neutral reference equations and their potential to reclassify a subset of individuals near diagnostic thresholds, which argues for careful, context-aware interpretation and, when possible, longitudinal comparison [^f90761ea] [^7eba1cc6] [^f5695942] [^2346a785].

> But wait, what if the report lacks key elements or uses outdated conventions? I need to ensure the report includes pre- and post-bronchodilator values, z-scores, quality grades, and a clear statement of pattern and severity, and I should verify that the laboratory adheres to contemporary ATS/ERS standards for equipment, calibration, and operator training, because these factors materially affect interpretability and patient care decisions [^f7d7cfa0] [^d69eca23] [^8bd7a68b].

> In summary, I should confirm a disciplined sequence: verify quality, compare to appropriate references using z-scores, classify the pattern using LLN-based criteria while acknowledging exceptions like GOLD, assess severity and reversibility when relevant, integrate clinical context, and consider longitudinal change and special populations. If I find myself relying on a fixed cutoff out of habit, I should pause and reconsider whether the LLN would better answer the clinical question at hand, and if results are borderline or discordant, I should repeat testing or pursue adjunctive evaluations rather than forcing a premature diagnosis [^f90761ea] [^a5416095] [^64462d9d].

To read a spirometry result, follow a **stepwise approach**: confirm test quality, compare key metrics to reference values, classify the pattern, and assess severity and reversibility [^f90761ea]. The core indices are **FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC** [^a5a9b5b5]; obstruction is defined by a reduced FEV1/FVC below the lower limit of normal, restriction by a reduced FVC with a normal or high FEV1/FVC, and mixed by both reduced FEV1/FVC and FVC [^f90761ea]. Severity is graded by FEV1 percent predicted, and bronchodilator responsiveness is defined by a ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL increase in FEV1 or FVC [^f90761ea]. Always interpret results in clinical context and consider repeat testing if quality is suboptimal or results are borderline [^64462d9d].

---

## Step 1: verify test quality

Before interpreting results, **confirm test quality** using ATS/ERS criteria [^d69eca23]:

- **Acceptability**: good starts, no cough, no glottis closure, no leak, no obstruction, and adequate effort [^notfound].
- **Repeatability**: largest FVC and FEV1 within 150 mL of each other; at least three acceptable maneuvers [^6eff81f9].
- **End of test**: plateau on the volume-time curve or forced expiratory time ≥ 6 seconds [^notfound].

If quality is poor, **repeat testing** or interpret with caution [^8831fffb].

---

## Step 2: identify key spirometric indices

The primary indices are:

| **Index** | **Definition** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| FEV1 | Forced expiratory volume in 1 second | - Airflow limitation <br/> - Severity grading |
| FVC | Forced vital capacity | - Restrictive defects <br/> - Mixed defects |
| FEV1/FVC | Ratio of FEV1 to FVC | - Obstructive defects <br/> - Diagnostic for COPD |

---

## Step 3: compare results to reference values

Use **age-, sex-, height-, and race-specific reference equations** (e.g. GLI-2012 or NHANES III) [^2f5b3095] and express results as percent predicted and z-scores [^c20ddea7]. Abnormality is typically defined by values below the **lower limit of normal (LLN)** (z-score < −1.645) [^681fd2f9].

---

## Step 4: classify the ventilatory pattern

Classify the pattern using **FEV1/FVC and FVC**:

- **Normal**: FEV1/FVC ≥ LLN and FVC ≥ LLN [^cd1affcc].
- **Obstructive**: FEV1/FVC < LLN (indicates airflow limitation) [^f90761ea].
- **Restrictive**: FVC < LLN with normal or high FEV1/FVC (suggests reduced lung volumes) [^f90761ea].
- **Mixed**: Both FEV1/FVC and FVC < LLN (combined obstruction and restriction) [^f90761ea].

---

## Step 5: assess severity

Severity is graded by **FEV1 percent predicted** [^f90761ea]:

| **Severity** | **Fev1% predicted** |
|-|-|
| Mild | ≥ 70% |
| Moderate | 60–69% |
| Severe | 50–59% |
| Very severe | < 50% |

---

## Step 6: evaluate bronchodilator responsiveness

Administer a short-acting bronchodilator and repeat spirometry. A significant response is a **≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL increase** in FEV1 or FVC, indicating reversible airflow limitation (suggestive of asthma) [^f90761ea].

---

## Step 7: interpret results in clinical context

Integrate spirometry with **symptoms, history, and risk factors**. Consider alternative diagnoses if results are discordant (e.g. vocal cord dysfunction, heart failure) [^a19327ee].

---

## Common pitfalls and considerations

- **Fixed ratio**: Avoid using a fixed FEV1/FVC < 0.70 in older adults (overdiagnosis) or younger adults (underdiagnosis); use LLN when possible [^64462d9d] [^0a5d7858].
- **Reference equations**: Ensure appropriate reference equations are used for the patient's demographics [^c20ddea7].
- **Longitudinal change**: Evaluate FEV1 decline over time, especially in occupational health settings [^78f8b440].

---

## Example interpretation

A 60-year-old male smoker with dyspnea has **FEV1 65% predicted, FVC 80% predicted, and FEV1/FVC 0.60**. This pattern is obstructive (FEV1/FVC < LLN), severity is moderate (FEV1 60–69%), and post-bronchodilator FEV1 increases by 15% and 250 mL, indicating significant reversibility — most consistent with asthma-COPD overlap [^f90761ea].

---

Reading spirometry requires a **structured approach**: verify quality, compare to references, classify the pattern, assess severity and reversibility, and integrate clinically. This ensures accurate diagnosis and guides management.

### Is there a role for screening spirometry? [^a7476a9f]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

In obstructive lung disease, the characteristic change in spirometry is a reduction in the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)) with respect to the vital capacity. Moreover, the severity of the obstruction can be graded by referencing spirometric measurements to age, sex, and height predicted normal values. Spirometry, however, should be considered a medical test, and not simply a vital sign that anyone can perform. Indeed, both technical issues and tester skills can profoundly affect the results and interpretations. Properly done spirometry can guide therapies and predict outcomes, but using spirometry to screen for obstructive lung disease in asymptomatic populations can be problematic, and the effects of screening spirometry on outcomes have yet to be determined. The value of spirometry is increased when it is of good quality, is interpreted properly, and is used in high-risk populations as a case-finding rather than a screening tool.

### Spirometry [^aea4235b]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Pulmonary function testing is useful for the diagnosis and management of a variety of pulmonary conditions, and the most commonly obtained component is spirometry. Spirometry is most useful in the evaluation of obstructive airway disorders but can be a helpful tool in the management of patients with chest restriction or mixed disease. The utility of spirometry depends on reproducibility, standardization, and quality of testing. Accurate interpretation of test results depends on the availability of reference equations applicable to the subject undergoing testing. This paper reviews basic concepts, testing procedures, and interpretation of a single set of spirometry results as well as results obtained over time and gives an overview of previously published reference equations.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^f71ff972]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society technical statement — standardized pulmonary function reporting presents a reporting format in test-specific units for spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity, updates recommended reference sources for spirometry and diffusing capacity, and presents a grading system to encourage uniformity in test quality assessment. The committee has recognized the need for a standardized reporting format for pulmonary function tests and notes considerable variability in how results are presented to end users. The committee believes that wide adoption of these formats and their underlying principles by equipment manufacturers and pulmonary function laboratories can improve the interpretation, communication, and understanding of test results. This Official Technical Statement was approved October 2017.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^445488df]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The American Thoracic Society committee on Proficiency Standards for Pulmonary Function Laboratories has recognized the need for a standardized reporting format for pulmonary function tests. Although prior documents have offered guidance on the reporting of test data, there is considerable variability in how these results are presented to end users, leading to potential confusion and miscommunication.

Methods

A project task force, consisting of the committee as a whole, was approved to develop a new Technical Standard on reporting pulmonary function test results. Three working groups addressed the presentation format, the reference data supporting interpretation of results, and a system for grading quality of test efforts. Each group reviewed relevant literature and wrote drafts that were merged into the final document.

Results

This document presents a reporting format in test-specific units for spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity that can be assembled into a report appropriate for a laboratory's practice. Recommended reference sources are updated with data for spirometry and diffusing capacity published since prior documents. A grading system is presented to encourage uniformity in the important function of test quality assessment.

Conclusions

The committee believes that wide adoption of these formats and their underlying principles by equipment manufacturers and pulmonary function laboratories can improve the interpretation, communication, and understanding of test results.

### How should the lower limit of the normal range be defined? [^0a5d7858]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Lung function parameters vary considerably with age and body size, so that, unlike many laboratory tests, the normal range of expected values must be individualized. For spirometry, only low values are considered to be abnormal, so the lower limit of normal (LLN) is taken to be equal to the 5th percentile of a healthy, non-smoking population. Simple and commonly used "rules of thumb", such as an FEV(1)/FVC < 0.70 to indicate air-flow obstruction, or assuming values < 80% of predicted to be abnormal, are inaccurate and will cause misclassification, specifically under-diagnosis of abnormalities in younger, taller individuals and over-diagnosis in those older or shorter. A much more accurate LLN for the FEV(1)/FVC ratio, which recognizes the change with age of this measurement, can be easily determined by subtracting 10 (10% or 0.10) from the age specific FEV(1)/FVC predicted for any individual. The analysis and mathematical descriptions of reference data have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years, but the interpretation of values near the LLN continues to carry uncertainty, due to an overlap in values between low normal values and those reflecting early disease. Among patients referred to a pulmonary function laboratory, the pre-test probability of disease may be relatively high, so that even individuals with values above the LLN may be more likely than not to have respiratory disease. A future goal for the pulmonary community would be the development of risk stratified outcome data that would allow an estimation of the probability of disease with progressive decrements in lung function. While interpreting spirometry results near the LLN will continue to be problematic, a more important task for the pulmonary community is to focus on finding the pool of individuals with clear-cut, but undiagnosed, COPD. And for this, good quality spirometry remains the best tool and must be widely available.

### An approach to interpreting spirometry [^a19327ee]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Spirometry is a powerful tool that can be used to detect, follow, and manage patients with lung disorders. Technology advancements have made spirometry much more reliable and relatively simple to incorporate into a routine office visit. However, interpreting spirometry results can be challenging because the quality of the test is largely dependent on patient effort and cooperation, and the interpreter's knowledge of appropriate reference values. A simplified and stepwise method is key to interpreting spirometry. The first step is determining the validity of the test. Next, the determination of an obstructive or restrictive ventilatory patten is made. If a ventilatory pattern is identified, its severity is graded. In some patients, additional tests such as static lung volumes, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, and bronchodilator challenge testing are needed. These tests can further define lung processes but require more sophisticated equipment and expertise available only in a pulmonary function laboratory.

### Pulmonary function testing [^2d410e85]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary function testing is often considered the basis for diagnosis in many categories of pulmonary disease. Although most of the testing methodologies are well established and widely employed, there are still many questions regarding how tests should be performed, how to ensure that reliable data are produced, what reference values and rules should be used, and how pulmonary function tests (PFTs) should be interpreted to best support clinical decision making. This conference was organized around a set of questions aimed at many of these issues. Each presenter was asked to address a specific topic regarding what tests should be done, how those test should be performed to answer a particular clinical question, and to relate test results to an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the patient. These topics included testing of adults and children, with concentration on important disease entities such as COPD, asthma, and unexplained dyspnea. Special emphasis was given to discussing reference values, lower limits of normal, interpretive strategies to optimize disease classification, and those factors directly affecting data quality. Established techniques for spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity, exercise testing, and bronchial challenges were compared and contrasted with new technologies, and with technologies that might be part of pulmonary function laboratories in the near future.

### Spirometry: don't blow it! [^90236ce7]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Spirometry is a useful test of pulmonary function and can be safely performed in a variety of clinical situations. Although the technique for performing the maneuver is straightforward, there are many sources of variability in results. Specific criteria must be met in order for the test to be considered valid. For the best results, proper instruction and coaching is essential, and patient understanding and effort must be maximized. Appropriate interpretation of spirometry requires several steps, including recognition and reporting of technically sound maneuvers, comparison to an appropriate reference population, and finally application of a well-developed interpretation scheme utilized in the context of patient symptoms and findings. Failure at any point along this path from performance to interpretation can yield misleading results that may ultimately poorly impact patient care. A clear understanding by the provider of proper coding and billing for spirometry is necessary to receive appropriate reimbursement from payers.

### Spirometry in occupational health-2020 [^fa068461]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Spirometry in Occupational Health — 2020 guidance statement describes the role and quality considerations for occupational spirometry, stating that spirometry in the occupational health setting plays a critical role in the primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of workplace-related lung disease and that tests are performed in a variety of venues. Physicians and other health care professionals may conduct spirometry tests themselves, supervise others conducting the tests, or be involved only in interpreting test results, and spirometry users need to be aware that spirometry differs from many other medical measurements since it depends on multiple factors for its results to be valid. If subject effort is flawed, equipment is not accurate, or technicians fail to elicit maximal cooperation and effort, results can be falsely elevated or reduced, and if uncorrected, these problems may profoundly impact conclusions that are drawn about a worker's pulmonary function with potentially adverse consequences for workers. The document notes that this 2020 ACOEM guidance statement incorporates these spirometry testing changes into its recommendations to provide current information for all users of spirometry test results. Key topics include Equipment Performance, Conducting Tests, Comparing Results with Reference Values, Longitudinal Interpretation, and Further Evaluation of Spirometric Abnormalities and Recordkeeping.

### How to interpret spirometry in a child with suspected asthma [^7eba1cc6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic disorders of childhood. The typical symptoms are a result of reversible airway obstruction. There is no 'gold-standard' test to diagnose asthma, but the most commonly used investigation to help with a diagnosis is spirometry. This article outlines some of the technical aspects of spirometry together with how the forced expiration manoeuver and bronchodilator responsiveness testing can be performed and interpreted in a child with suspected asthma.

### How frequently should workplace spirometry screening be performed? optimization via analytic models [^5b4640c2]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Our objective was to determine how to select the optimal frequency of workplace spirometry screening using diacetyl-exposed workers as an example.

Methods

A Markov model was constructed to assess the likelihood of progressing from healthy status to early or advanced disease, starting from four different exposure levels, and performing longitudinal or cross-sectional interpretation of spirometry results over time. Projected outcomes at 10 years were evaluated to inform the optimal frequency of workplace spirometry testing.

Results

The optimal screening interval depends on the population risk and is highly sensitive to the real-life impact (utility) associated with false-positive results (eg, related to the availability of alternative work). Screening interval is particularly important for high-risk individuals with rapid transition from early to advanced disease, where the 10-year prevalence of advanced disease would be reduced from 5.3 to 2.5% using a 6-month interval rather than a 12-month interval. Longitudinal test interpretation, based on observing trends within each person over time, is marginally preferable to traditional cross-sectional spirometry interpretation.

Conclusions

There is no single best screening interval. For high-risk populations, annual testing may be too infrequent.

### Spirometry in occupational health-2020 [^df42c059]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Interpretation algorithm — adoption by professional and regulatory bodies: For almost three decades, ATS has recommended applying a stepwise algorithm to interpret spirometry results. ACOEM endorsed this approach in its previous statements and OSHA adopted it in their Guidance document. Because consensus exists on distinguishing normal from abnormal and on patterns identifying obstructive or possible restrictive impairment, these determinations are presented; however, this statement's interpretive algorithm does not grade severity of impairment.

### Interpreting spirometry: the basics [^21cf3811]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The ability to accurately obtain and interpret spirometry is essential for physicians caring for patients with asthma and inflammatory disease of the airway. This article reviews the basic equipment, setting, and personnel needed to obtain quality spirometric data. The fundamental measurements obtained in routine office spirometry and recommendations that are critical to obtaining high-quality reproducible test results are reviewed. The evaluation of flow-volume loops and normative data is discusses as well as criteria that define a quality measurement. Examples of normal spirometric data as well as data from different disease states are reviewed.

### Official American Thoracic Society technical standards: spirometry in the occupational setting [^9a06c9f9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Recommendation — interpretation of occupational spirometry results specifies that spirometry measurements should be evaluated relative to workers' baseline or prior tests in addition to comparing to population normal ranges, which is particularly important when baseline measurements exceed predicted values, and that FEV1 decline over time should be evaluated using one or more of the described approaches and interpreted in the context of worker exposures, symptoms, and other clinical information.

### The physiologic basis of spirometry [^93d2dc4b]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Spirometry is the most useful and commonly available tests of pulmonary function. It is a physiological test that measures individual inhalation and exhalation volumes of air as a function of time. Pulmonologists and general-practice physicians commonly use spirometry in their offices in the assessment and management of lung disease. Spirometric indices are well validated and easily interpreted by comparison with established normal values. The remarkable reproducibility of spirometry results from the presence of compliant intrathoracic airways that act as air flow regulators during forced expiration. Because of this anatomic arrangement, expiratory flow becomes dependent solely on the elasticity of the lungs and airway resistance once a certain degree of expiratory force is exerted. Insight into this aspect of respiratory physiology can help in the interpretation of spirometry.

### Effect of race and ethnicity on pulmonary function testing interpretation: an American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC), American Thoracic Society (ATS), and Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) evidence review and research statement [^dd187ea7]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Key questions — Effect of race and ethnicity on pulmonary function test (PFT) results interpretation is framed by the following: Key Question 1 asks, "What is the current evidence supporting the use of race- and ethnicity-specific reference equations for the interpretation of PFT results?"; Key Question 2 asks, "What are the potential clinical implications of the use or nonuse of race or ethnicity in interpreting PFT results?"; and Key Question 3 asks, "What research gaps and questions must be addressed and answered to understand better the effect of race and ethnicity on PFT results interpretation and potential clinical and occupational health implications?" For the intention of this work, PFTs included spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity (PFT = pulmonary function test).

### Interpretation of spirometry, peak flow, and provocation testing for asthma [^14d64434]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Spirometry plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of asthma. The hallmark spirometry finding of expiratory airflow variability can be demonstrated in several ways including peak airflow and bronchodilator and bronchoprovocation testing. Challenges of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis underscore the need to consider clinical context while interpreting these tests. A meticulous and multifaceted approach prioritizing objective testing is imperative while diagnosing asthma.

### Effectiveness of a motivational intervention based on spirometry results to achieve smoking cessation in primary healthcare patients: randomised, parallel, controlled multicentre study [^6c488d58]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

In this context, we hypothesised that detailed information about interpreting normal spirometry results is an effective motivational tool to encourage smoking cessation. Provide information on evidence of smoking-related health risks or harms could offer a 'teachable moment' that may facilitate a positive behaviour change. It has been documented that concerns about health status could be a circumstance which can lead patients to make an attempt to quit smoking. Thus, the aim of the trial was to compare the effectiveness of the usual counselling recommended in the primary healthcare setting to a combination of that health advice and personalised information on spirometry results. If the effectiveness of this approach is confirmed, spirometry would be an easy, low-cost intervention to implement and could have considerable implications for the prevention of diseases associated with tobacco.

### ARTP statement on pulmonary function testing 2020 [^fcb4cec7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Foreword

The Association for Respiratory Technology & Physiology (ARTP) was at the forefront of producing useable and readable guidelines on how to undertake lung function testing. The emphasis then was on a practical statement that would be a helpful reference for people working in lung function testing. The ARTP have now produced this revised and expanded statement on lung function testing with the emphasis still being that it can be used in lung function laboratories as a means to improve the quality and reliability of the results achieved by patients.

ARTP have provided within this document, where available, the most up-to-date and evidence-based recommendations for the most common lung function assessments performed in laboratories across the UK. These recommendations set out the requirements and considerations that need to be made in terms of environmental and patient factors that may influence both the performance and interpretation of lung function tests. They also incorporate procedures to ensure quality assured diagnostic investigations that include those associated with equipment, the healthcare professional conducting the assessments and the results achieved by the subject. Each section aims to outline the common parameters provided for each investigation, a brief principle behind the measurements (where applicable), and suggested acceptability and reproducibility criteria.

It has been over 10 years since the comprehensive series of joint American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) statements on lung function testing. One of the problems arising from those has been the view that patients either pass or fail the criteria set down in those statements. This was not the intention of the group who prepared those statements. Aspects of this have been addressed in the 2019 update of the spirometry statement. Also an updated standard for single-breath carbon monoxide (CO) uptake transfer factor was published in 2017which, in particular, incorporated changes in gas analyser technology.

We have been clear that the reason for setting out the ARTP view on lung function testing is to help ensure that each individual patient has the greatest chance of achieving their best result on the day of their tests. In no sense should a patient ever pass or fail the test session.

### Race and ethnicity in pulmonary function test interpretation: an official American Thoracic Society statement [^f5695942]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Race and ethnicity in pulmonary function test (PFT) interpretation — clinical application of race‑neutral reference equations is clarified: The recommendation to change to a race‑neutral average reference equation does not imply that reference values represent ideal pulmonary health, and results at or near the lower limit of normal must be interpreted cautiously with additional history, testing, imaging, and other diagnostics. This recommendation also applies to PFTs beyond spirometry, and adjustments for race and ethnicity in the interpretation of lung volumes and DLCO should not be used. Interpretations must recognize potential discordance when using different reference populations for spirometry versus DLCO and lung volumes, and the major equations for DLCO and lung volumes are based on data from White persons, indicating that reference equation data combined from more diverse populations are needed.

### Can spirometric norms be set using pre-or post-bronchodilator test results in older people? [^c5504480]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Using different predictors of normal lung function based on pre- or post- bronchodilator spirometric values provides slightly different results, but these may not be of great clinical significance provided they are used consistently in comparative studies. In a clinical setting spirometry should be used in combination with other information to guide management and these small differences are unlikely to be important when setting criteria for a positive screening test if this is based on a pre-bronchodilator assessment of spirometry. We have provided prediction equations for post-bronchodilator lung function in people over the age of 40 years living in Europe. We have also provided approximate mean differences between pre-and post-bronchodilator values and we have given estimates of the effect of using the different methods on sensitivity and specificity of a test for COPD.

Applying the interpretation algorithm — spirometry interpretations should specify whether lung function is normal or shows obstructive, restrictive, or mixed impairment, and OSHA recommends following the algorithm in Fig. 4 that lists three steps: first, evaluate test validity; second, assess for slowed expiratory airflow (obstructive impairment); and finally, consider whether expired lung volumes might be reduced (restrictive impairment); the algorithm classifies results as obstructive impairment, possible restrictive impairment, possible mixed impairment, or normal spirometry results.

### ARTP statement on pulmonary function testing 2020 [^8831fffb]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

The statements in these guidelines about criteria that should be satisfied when undertaking lung function testing outline goals and drivers that lead to ensuring a patient achieves the best results possible on the day of their test. If a patient does not meet all these criteria, it does not invalidate any of the results obtained. It may just mean that those results may not be a reliable indicator of what the patient might be able to achieve. However, the results produced may still provide sufficient information to support any clinical decision-making with the proviso that a repeat test at another test session might yield a different result.

We hope this document proves to be accessible and sufficiently comprehensive that it will assist pulmonary function laboratories in delivering the best outcomes for their patients.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^f7d7cfa0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society pulmonary function report — core spirometry reporting elements emphasize that a uniform format for the presentation of PFT results in reports to users and in the medical record can reduce potential miscommunication or misunderstanding, and only information with validated clinical application should be included. The normal limit(s) of each test parameter should be displayed, and, consistent with other laboratory values, the measured value should be shown before reference values, ranges, or normal limits. Report and/or display of the displacement of the result from a predicted value in standard deviation units (z-score) can help in understanding abnormality. For spirometry, many parameters can be calculated but most do not add clinical utility and should not be routinely reported; only FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC need be routinely reported. Measurement of slow VC and calculation of FEV1/VC are a useful adjunct in patients with suspected airflow obstruction. Reporting FEV1/FVC (or FEV1/VC) as a decimal fraction, and not reporting it as a percentage of the predicted value for this ratio, will help to minimize miscommunication. The nitrogen washout plot for multibreath tests and the tracings for plethysmograph tests can be shown graphically to aid quality assessment.

### Office spirometry: indications and interpretation [^f90761ea]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

High-quality, office-based spirometry provides diagnostic information as useful and reliable as testing performed in a pulmonary function laboratory. Spirometry may be used to monitor progression of lung disease and response to therapy. A stepwise approach to spirometry allows for ease and reliability of interpretation. Airway obstruction is suspected when there is a decreased forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio, but there is no strong evidence to clearly define what constitutes a significant decrease in this ratio. A low FVC is defined as a value below the 5th percentile in adults or less than 80% of predicted in children and adolescents five to 18 years of age. The FEV1/FVC ratio and FVC are used together to identify obstructive defects and restrictive or mixed patterns. Obstructive defects should be assessed for reversibility, as indicated by an improvement of the FEV1 or FVC by at least 12% and 0.2 L in adults, or by more than 12% in children and adolescents five to 18 years of age after the administration of a short-acting bronchodilator. FEV1 is used to determine the severity of obstructive and restrictive disease, although the values were arbitrarily determined and are not based on evidence from patient outcomes. Bronchoprovocation testing may be used if spirometry results are normal and allergen- or exercise-induced asthma is suspected. For patients with an FEV1 less than 70% of predicted, a therapeutic trial of a short-acting bronchodilator may be tried instead of bronchoprovocation testing.

Reference values

Introduction

Having obtained test results of lung function from a subject, a clinician needs to be able to interpret what these mean in the context of the patient's clinical condition. Any given set of test results may need to be interpreted in isolation, and because lung function is related to the ethnicity, sex, age and height of the subject we need to be able to account for these first before we can decide if the subject's results are in any way unusual. For this one relates the result to relevant reference values. (The 'Standardised residuals (z-scores)' section addresses how best to assess a subject's result against their predicted value.)

If a clinician is following a patient longitudinally, then previously obtained results can be used as a reference to help see what is happening to this subject over time. (The 'Grading severity' section addresses some of the issues around longitudinal change.)

Sometimes it is necessary to decide how abnormal the result is for a subject. This may be to help prognosticate from the test result or to decide if a critical level has been achieved that triggers a change in management. (The 'Grading severity' section addresses how one can best assess the severity of any lung function deficit.)

Basic principles

The predicted value for a particular lung function index is obtained by using reference equations, which are discussed later (see 'Which reference equations?' section). Standardised residuals (SR; also known as z-scores) have long beenand remainthe preferred method for comparing the subject's recorded value with the predicted value. Per cent of predicted is not an accurate method for making a comparison with the reference range (see 'Per cent of predicted' section). The reasoning behind this is explained in the following:

The values for lung function indices within the normal healthy population are known to vary according to age, sex and height of the subject. So in a large population sample there is a scatter of results. Figure 1 shows such a scatter for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) in men against age on the left and against height on the right.

### Does the routine use of spirometry improve clinical outcomes in children? – A systematic review [^6bbf8bb3]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

8 CONCLUSIONS

Our systematic review has shown the paucity of data on the benefits of using spirometry in children in routine clinical practice. With multiple guidelines advocating its use, we recommend this advice should be followed in the absence of any evidence to inform practitioners otherwise. It is likely but remain unknown if better evidence and implementation will enhance its routine use. Thus, there is a critical need for high‐quality RCTs to inform practice on the impact of routine spirometry use in all healthcare settings.

Grading the quality of the test session — The ATS-recommended system "should be used", with Grade "U" added to denote "usable" values, and FEV1 and FVC graded separately; grading applies to the set of prebronchodilator maneuvers as a whole and is determined separately for the set of post-bronchodilator maneuvers. The grading system informs the interpreter about confidence that results reflect the best patient effort at the time and the probability of achieving an equivalent value if repeated. Although results below grade A may still be clinically useful, "the overriding goal of the operator must be to always achieve the best possible testing quality for each patient", and operators should explain that the grade reflects blow consistency rather than lung health.

### Agreement between fixed-ratio and lower limit of normal spirometry interpretation protocols decreases with age: is there a need for a new GOLD standard? [^0a5a0ec3]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess concordance between the fixed 70% ratio cutoff point with the fixed percent predicted values (Fixed-ratio) and the lower limit of normal (LLN) algorithms in interpreting spirometry results in an older population.

Methods

Spirometries were interpreted using Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reference equations for 2319 workers.

Results

The Fixed-ratio algorithm characterized 34.5% (n = 801) results as abnormal, compared with 29.7% (n = 689) by the LLN. There were almost twice as many obstructive and mixed airways spirometries identified under the Fixed-ratio compared to LLN. Rates of restrictive pattern physiology were virtually the same under each algorithm. Overall agreement between the algorithms decreased with age from "almost perfect" for those younger than 60 years to "substantial" for those older than 80 years.

Conclusions

This study found age-related discordance between two algorithms possibly related to the lack of reference equations and standards for individuals older than 80 years.

### Standardization of spirometry 2019 update. An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society technical statement [^f1237ef0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Spirometry is the most common pulmonary function test. It is widely used in the assessment of lung function to provide objective information used in the diagnosis of lung diseases and monitoring lung health. In 2005, the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society jointly adopted technical standards for conducting spirometry. Improvements in instrumentation and computational capabilities, together with new research studies and enhanced quality assurance approaches, have led to the need to update the 2005 technical standards for spirometry to take full advantage of current technical capabilities. Methods: This spirometry technical standards document was developed by an international joint task force, appointed by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society, with expertise in conducting and analyzing pulmonary function tests, laboratory quality assurance, and developing international standards. A comprehensive review of published evidence was performed. A patient survey was developed to capture patients' experiences. Results: Revisions to the 2005 technical standards for spirometry were made, including the addition of factors that were not previously considered. Evidence to support the revisions was cited when applicable. The experience and expertise of task force members were used to develop recommended best practices. Conclusions: Standards and consensus recommendations are presented for manufacturers, clinicians, operators, and researchers with the aims of increasing the accuracy, precision, and quality of spirometric measurements and improving the patient experience. A comprehensive guide to aid in the implementation of these standards was developed as an online supplement.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^6eff81f9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Grading the quality of pulmonary function tests — spirometry — Quality review aims to provide feedback to technicians and indicate limitations to interpretation; systems can be applied manually or in software, assigning a grade (A through F) separately for the quality of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and for younger children, 2–6 years of age, criteria are modified per 2007 ATS/ERS preschool guidance. An ideal test session conforms to ATS/ERS recommendations with at least three acceptable maneuvers and repeatable FVC and FEV1 values, though reviewer judgment remains important. End-of-test assessment uses forced expiratory time (FET) to determine whether expiratory flow has ceased, defined as a volume change less than 0.025 L in 1 second; FET is often less than 6 seconds because software may stop data collection once this low-flow criterion is met.

### Comparison of fixed percentage method and lower confidence limits for defining limits of normality for interpretation of spirometry [^a231403c]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The use of the lower 90% confidence limit of the lower limit of normal (LLN(CI)), rather than a fixed percentage of the predicted value (LLN(%)), appears to be statistically more appropriate for interpretation of spirometry results. There has been no comparative assessment of these 2 definitions of the LLN in routine clinical practice.

Methods

We studied results of spirometry interpretations made with these 2 approaches, and assessed various factors that influence discordant classification of spirometry results. Spirometry records from 18,112 consecutive adult patients referred for spirometry were interpreted as normal, obstructive, or restrictive, based on both LLN(CI) and LLN(%). Discordant results were analyzed using multiple logistic regression techniques to identify variables that significantly affected discordant classification of results.

Results

Overall, 11.7% of the results were discordant between the 2 methods. Agreement between the 2 methods, calculated using the kappa estimate, was poorer with spirometry values from women and from patients at the extremes of height and age. Age, sex, and height independently influenced discordant classification. Limits of agreement between LLN(CI) and LLN(%) were wide for all the spirometric variables studied — more so in women and in shorter and older patients.

Conclusions

LLN(CI) and LLN(%) yielded different interpretations of spirometry data in several instances, and the 2 methods cannot be used interchangeably. When interpreting spirometry data in routine clinical practice, LLN(CI) should be preferred over LLN(%).

### Spirometry can be done in family physicians' offices and alters clinical decisions in management of asthma and COPD [^a07ceb97]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Spirometry is recommended for diagnosis and management of obstructive lung disease. While many patients with asthma and COPD are cared for by primary care practices, limited data are available on the use and results associated with spirometry in primary care.

Object

To assess the technical adequacy, accuracy of interpretation, and impact of office spirometry.

Design

A before-and-after quasiexperimental design.

Setting

Three hundred eighty-two patients from 12 family medicine practices across the United States.

Participants

Patients with asthma and COPD, and staff from the 12 practices.

Measurements

Technical adequacy of spirometry results, concordance between family physician and pulmonary expert interpretations of spirometry test results, and changes in asthma and COPD management following spirometry testing.

Results

Of the 368 tests completed over the 6 months, 71% were technically adequate for interpretation. Family physician and pulmonary expert interpretations were concordant in 76% of completed tests. Spirometry was followed by changes in management in 48% of subjects with completed tests, including 107 medication changes (> 85% concordant with guideline recommendations) and 102 nonpharmacologic changes. Concordance between family physician and expert interpretations of spirometry results was higher in those patients with asthma compared to those with COPD.

Discussion and Conclusions

US family physicians can perform and interpret spirometry for asthma and COPD patients at rates comparable to those published in the literature for international primary care studies, and the spirometry results modify care.

### Postbronchodilator reference values: should they Be the norm? [^5238f01a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

When spirometry is used to identify the presence and severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pre- and postbronchodilator testing is typically performed. In normal populations, there is at most only a small bronchodilator response. As a result, prebronchodilator reference values have been used and compared with postbronchodilator results. The Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) noted that lung function test results can be interpreted using only robust, relevant, and reliable reference values. Using data from nearly 100,000 nonsmokers (55% female subjects) aged 3–95 years from 72 centers and 33 countries, the GLI study showed that the FEV 1 :FVC ratio is essentially independent of ethnic group and serves as a reliable, although imperfect, indicator of lung function. However, 9-year follow-up of another multicenter study, PLATINO (Projeto Latino-Americano de Investigação em Obstrução Pulmonar), which used prebronchodilator reference values, identified a substantial underdiagnosis of COPD. The subjects in that study who did not receive diagnoses of COPD until they returned after 9 years presented with similar clinical characteristics as those who were not diagnosed in the initial phase. For some time, there has been debate as to whether postbronchodilator reference values would be better than prebronchodilator reference values to identify individuals with COPD or at risk for developing COPD. The landmark GLI study did not explore the effect of using postbronchodilator reference values for interpreting spirometry results. Furthermore, there is limited information as to whether the use of postbronchodilator reference values has a significant impact in the clinical interpretation of spirometry results.

Spirometry validity and error patterns — implications for interpretation: Some spirometry errors falsely elevate FVC and/or FEV1, while other errors such as submaximal inhalations and weak expiratory pushes often falsely reduce FVC and/or FEV1; however, even if it leads to reduced FEV1, coughs in the first second of exhalation make the maneuver unusable, and interpretation of falsely elevated or reduced results may indicate incorrectly that impairment exists when a worker is normal, or that a worker is normal when impairment in fact exists.

### ARTP statement on pulmonary function testing 2020 [^0f345bce]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

The Association for Respiratory Technology & Physiology (ARTP) last produced a statement on the performance of lung function testing in 1994. At that time the focus was on a practical statement for people working in lung function laboratories. Since that time there have been many technological advances and alterations to best practice in the measurement and interpretation of lung function assessments. In light of these advances an update was warranted. ARTP, therefore, have provided within this document, where available, the most up-to-date and evidence-based recommendations for the most common lung function assessments performed in laboratories across the UK. These recommendations set out the requirements and considerations that need to be made in terms of environmental and patient factors that may influence both the performance and interpretation of lung function tests. They also incorporate procedures to ensure quality assured diagnostic investigations that include those associated with equipment, the healthcare professional conducting the assessments and the results achieved by the subject. Each section aims to outline the common parameters provided for each investigation, a brief principle behind the measurements (where applicable), and suggested acceptability and reproducibility criteria.

### Official American Thoracic Society technical standards: spirometry in the occupational setting [^4d1e116b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Workplace spirometry — key conclusions and recommendations emphasize program definition, technician training, testing posture, reference values, and longitudinal interpretation. The key components of a workplace spirometry program should be clarified before performing spirometry, including the purpose for testing, lines of communication and responsibility, and interpretation of the results. To optimize the quality of spirometry, technicians should undergo practical training and refresher courses and should also receive on-going feedback about the quality of tests that they perform, and how to correct problems in test performance. Standing or sitting test posture can be used for testing, but the same posture should be used when possible on repeat testing, and should be documented, because posture-related changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), although small, may significantly impact evaluation. Racial or ethnic differences in lung function exist, and when specific reference equations are not available, a correction factor of 0.88 may be applied to white subject reference values for FEV1 and FVC when evaluating Asian populations within North America. Spirometry measurements should be evaluated relative to workers' baseline or prior tests, in addition to comparing to normal ranges, and FEV1 decline over time should be evaluated using one of the approaches described and interpreted in the context of worker exposures, symptoms, and other clinical information. Overall guidance for the performance and evaluation of workplace spirometry, including individual results and group (employer/company) spirometry data is provided.

### Spirometry in occupational health-2020 [^cd1affcc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Normal spirometry results — If FEV1/FVC ≥ LLN and FVC is greater than or equal to LLN, there is no obstructive or restrictive impairment and the worker has normal spirometry results; since the LLN is defined so that 5% of healthy individuals will fall below it, values just above or just below the LLN should be interpreted with caution and the worker should be retested at a later date to confirm the results.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spirometry in primary care [^5122ee6e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

COPD can be estimated with high diagnostic accuracy using spirometry. It is also possible to rule in asthma with spirometry. However, asthma can not be ruled out only using spirometry. This diagnostic uncertainty leads to an overestimation of asthma presence. Patients with inconclusive spirometric results should be referred for NO – measurement and/or bronchial provocation if possible to guarantee accurate diagnosis.

### A stepwise approach to the interpretation of pulmonary function tests [^f0fbe65c]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Office-based pulmonary function testing, also known as spirometry, is a powerful tool for primary care physicians to diagnose and manage respiratory problems. An obstructive defect is indicated by a low forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio, which is defined as less than 70% or below the fifth percentile based on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) in adults, and less than 85% in patients five to 18 years of age. If an obstructive defect is present, the physician should determine if the disease is reversible based on the increase in FEV1 or FVC after bronchodilator treatment (i.e., increase of more than 12% in patients five to 18 years of age, or more than 12% and more than 200 mL in adults). Asthma is typically reversible, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not. A restrictive pattern is indicated by an FVC below the fifth percentile based on NHANES III data in adults, or less than 80% in patients five to 18 years of age. If a restrictive pattern is present, full pulmonary function tests with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide testing should be ordered to confirm restrictive lung disease and form a differential diagnosis. If both the FEV1/FVC ratio and the FVC are low, the patient has a mixed defect. The severity of the abnormality is determined by the FEV1 (percentage of predicted). If pulmonary function test results are normal, but the physician still suspects exercise- or allergen-induced asthma, bronchoprovocation (e.g., methacholine challenge, mannitol inhalation challenge, exercise testing) should be considered.

### Race and ethnicity in pulmonary function test interpretation: an official American Thoracic Society statement [^371c47f8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary function test (PFT) interpretation — symptom–lung function relationships and alternative approaches: In the Sub-Populations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease study, separate univariable linear regressions of patient-reported outcomes (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and COPD Assessment Test) against percent predicted FEV1 showed that the relationships between symptoms and pulmonary function are more consistent with a universally applied single reference equation (GLI Other). Other potential approaches include comparing results with the patient's own baseline when spirometry around the age of maximal lung size is available, the reporting of multiple predicted values to give more choice to clinicians on how to apply the patient's results, and standardizing FEV1 to powers of standing height, which yielded values that perform as well or better than the percentage of predicted.

### Does the routine use of spirometry improve clinical outcomes in children? – A systematic review [^285e5ff0]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

6 RESULTS

6.1 Description of studies

The search identified a total of 3475 potentially relevant articles (PRISMA diagram, Figure 1). After duplicates were removed, 2444 articles were screened for eligibility. Eight articles were selected for further evaluation by full‐text review. Subsequently, seven articles were excluded and only one article was included.

Figure 1
Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (PRISMA) diagram.

Of the seven articles excluded by full‐text review, four were observational studies. The three remaining articles were RCTs but did not fulfill our inclusion criteria. One assessed the influence of spirometry in general practice on the success rate of smoking cessation in adults(excluded as incorrect population). The remaining two studies, assessed the outcome of treatment based on spirometry for children with asthma but used daily home spirometry, an exclusion criterion.

The single included study was derived from two trials (hereafter referred to as the parent trials), which were cluster RCTs of spirometry in general practice, to determine whether it improved asthma outcomes in children and adolescents (Table 1a, b). The authors of the included studydecided to pool data as neither parent‐trial recruited adequate participants to draw a firm conclusion. Details of the included studyand the two parent trials, are shown in Table 2. The trials enrolled children and adolescents aged 7–17 years, who had been diagnosed with asthma and prescribed an inhaled medication in preceding 6 months. They excluded potential participants who were not contactable by telephone, with infrequent episodes of asthma, and with co‐existing complex medical conditions. General practices involved in the trials were randomized to either the intervention group where spirometry was used in addition to regular clinical review or the control group that provided only clinical review. For the first parent trial, the intervention was 3‐monthly spirometry reports interpreted by a respiratory specialist and sent to general practices. For the second parent trial, the intervention was 2–6 hours formal spirometry training for general practice staff, who applied this knowledge with follow‐up support.

Longitudinal interpretation — Since workers can undergo periodic, often annual, spirometry tests, it is important to evaluate measurements not only relative to normal ranges but also relative to the workers' baselines, particularly when lung function values are within the normal range; the primary measurement used to assess longitudinal change should be the FEV1, as it is less affected by technical factors than the FVC.

### Year in review: pulmonary function testing [^5dbe84b4]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary function testing dates back to the 19th century, and the most commonly performed tests pre-date the use of computers. Despite its long and rich history, much is still unknown about how to best perform, interpret, and apply pulmonary function tests. This year-in-review article will discuss recently published papers covering important topics including the performance of lung volume testing, the definition and severity grading of air flow obstruction, the clinical utility of bronchodilator responsiveness, and the use of race-neutral reference equations.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^05df0017]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis — spirometric criteria and thresholds emphasize that diagnosis requires confirmation of an airflow limitation that is not fully reversible via spirometry and the history of a potentially causative exposure, with airflow limitation defined by a low post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio. The threshold FEV1/FVC ratio to confirm airflow limitation is described as uncertain; a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.7 has traditionally been the criterion, which may identify airflow limitation more often in the elderly and less among young adults less than 45 years of age compared with a threshold based on the lower limit of normal of FEV1/FVC. The page notes that advocates for the fixed ratio argue it identifies patients with significant pulmonary pathology not detected by the lower limit of normal, whereas advocates for the lower limit of normal argue the fixed ratio is more likely to yield false-positive results.

### Standardization of spirometry 2019 update. An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society technical statement [^752c221e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ATS/ERS spirometry — relative contraindications and when to stop testing: Performing spirometry can be physically demanding, and the forced expiratory maneuver increases intrathoracic, intraabdominal, and intracranial pressures; caution must be used for patients with medical conditions that could be adversely affected, and although risks are likely minimal for most patients, they should be weighed against benefits. Spirometry should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain during the maneuver. Patients with potential contraindications that would prevent testing in primary care may be tested in a pulmonary function laboratory where operators are more experienced and there may be access to emergency care, and inability or unwillingness to follow directions will usually lead to submaximal results.

### Spirometry in occupational health-2020 [^c981459e]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

LLN defines abnormality — spirometry interpretation in workers should use the fifth percentile lower limit of normal (LLN) rather than fixed cut-points, with ATS/ERS and ACOEM recommending LLN to "differentiate normality from abnormality", and the LLN corresponding to a Z-score of −1.645; fixed values such as 80% of predicted or an FEV1/FVC of 0.70 can misclassify because the FEV1/FVC ratio declines by about 10% from ages 20 to 70 and age-specific LLN examples show 0.70 at about age 40, 0.74 at age 20, and 0.64 at age 70; using the fifth percentile also implies that 5% of healthy people fall below the LLN, so false positives near this boundary are possible, and caution is advised when interpreting values close to the LLN.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^2f5b3095]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society pulmonary function report — reference equations, calibration, and quality grading specify that for diffusing capacity the report is consistent with the 2017 European Respiratory Society (ERS)/ATS Technical Standard for this test and that barometric pressure should be measured and reported and the measured value corrected to the standard pressure of 760 mm Hg. Newer collated reference equations for spirometry and diffusing capacity have been developed since prior ATS documents and warrant wide implementation; the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI)-2012 multiethnic spirometry reference values are recommended for use in North America and elsewhere for the ethnic groups represented, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III reference values remain appropriate where maintaining continuity is important. Regardless of the reference source or lower limit of normal (LLN) chosen, interpreters should be aware of uncertainty when interpreting values near any dichotomous boundary. For lung volumes and diffusing capacity, no prior ATS recommendation has been made because of the wide divergence of available reference values, with a large compilation completed for the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DlCO) and underway for lung volumes, and the resulting reference equations should be widely adopted when published. Pulmonary function tests that fail to meet optimal standards may still provide useful information and a grading system for test quality can allow for this use, while providing an indication of the uncertainty imposed, and is most helpful if widely standardized. For spirometry, FVC and FEV1 are graded separately on an A–F scale either manually or by software, with evidence that grades A–C are clinically useful, grades D and E may have limited value, and grade F should not be used, and the same scale, with different criteria values, is used for children; for diffusing capacity a similar grading scale is presented on the basis of 2017 ERS/ATS standards.

### Measurement of lung volumes [^69eda3cb]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Lung volume measurements always determine total lung capacity (TLC), and most measurement techniques also determine functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV). These measurements are needed less often than spirometry-derived values and require somewhat more difficult methods than required by spirometry. As with spirometry, accurate interpretation relies on appropriate reference values, standardized methodology and technically well-performed testing. A reduction in TLC defines chest restriction. Increases in TLC, FRC and RV are often seen in patients with airway obstruction. Patients with mixed restrictive and obstructive disease may have spirometry results that are difficult to interpret, and it is in these patients that lung volume measurements may be especially helpful.

### Spirometry in occupational health-2020 [^2b2d3276]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Occupational spirometry quality assurance — review processes and grading use: ACOEM, ATS, and OSHA recommend that technicians receive on-going feedback about the quality of the tests they perform and how to correct problems in test performance, and the frequency of such reviews should be at least quarterly, and more often if technicians are inexperienced or if poor technical quality is observed; it is recommended that reviews be conducted by those experienced in recognizing and correcting flawed spirometry tests results. Technicians should be trained not to rely exclusively on spirometer quality-control prompts, since technical errors may occur that are not among those recognized by the software, and while strict application of the grading criteria can be done by computer software, the reviewer's role is to apply judgment by reviewing the individual curves, which may change the scoring and allow interpretation; when used with caution, test quality grades may be helpful in evaluating spirometry test results.

### Spirometry use among pediatric primary care physicians [^d7a858d0]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

This study explores the use of spirometry in primary care settings.

Methods

A 4-page survey was mailed to a national, random sample of office-based family physicians and pediatricians. Survey items addressed knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding spirometry and standardized clinical vignettes. Data were analyzed by using χ2 tests and multivariate logistic regression.

Results

Among the 360 respondents who provided care to children with asthma, 52% used spirometry in clinical practice, whereas 80% used peak flow meters and 10% used no lung function tests. Only 21% routinely used spirometry for all guideline-recommended clinical situations. More family physicians than pediatricians reported using spirometry (75% vs 35%; P < .0001), and family physicians were more comfortable in interpreting spirometric results (50% vs 25%; P < .0001). Only one-half of respondents interpreted correctly the spirometric results in a standardized clinical vignette, and the frequency of underrating asthma severity increased with the inclusion of spirometric results. The most common barriers to the use of spirometry, that is, time and training, were cited more often by physicians who did not use spirometry. Two-thirds of respondents agreed that they would want additional training regarding implementing spirometry in their clinical practices.

Conclusions

The use of spirometry in primary care settings for children with asthma does not conform to national guidelines. Widespread implementation of national asthma guidelines likely would require a major educational initiative to address deficiencies in spirometry interpretation and other barriers.

### Family medicine physician teachers and residents' intentions to prescribe and interpret spirometry: a descriptive cross-sectional study [^2a40d161]. The Journal of Asthma (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Spirometry is the best test to demonstrate airway obstruction, but remains underused in primary care. Objectives: We assessed, among family medicine physician teachers and residents, their intention to prescribe spirometry in patients suspected of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and their intention to interpret the results. This evaluation is based on the theoretical framework proposed by Godin et al. for the study of factors influencing healthcare professionals' behavior. Methods: Participants of this descriptive cross-sectional study were recruited from eight Family medicine units (FMUs) of Laval University's network. They completed a 23-item self-administered questionnaire measuring their intention to prescribe and to interpret spirometry as well as some determinants of this intention (beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, social influence and moral norm). Answers to each of the items were scored on a Likert scale (score 1 to 7) where a higher score indicated a greater agreement with the statement. Results: Of the 284 eligible physicians, 104 were included. The mean score ± standard deviation of physicians' intention to prescribe spirometry (6.6 ± 0.7) was higher than to interpret the results (5.8 ± 1.5). Mean scores for all determinants of intention measured were also higher for prescription than for interpretation of spirometry. Conclusion: The results suggest that participants have a very strong intention to prescribe spirometry. Although the intention to interpret the results is positive, it is weaker than for the prescription of the test. Further studies will be needed to assess the barriers to spirometry interpretation.

### Race and ethnicity in pulmonary function test interpretation: an official American Thoracic Society statement [^f53eff44]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Concerns with Not Using Race in PFT Interpretation

Changing from race-specific equations to GLI Global for PFT interpretation may increase the proportion of persons of color deemed to be unfit for certain occupations, including firefighting or commercial diving, working around coal mine and cotton dust, and serving in the military; it may also increase the proportion of persons of color charged higher premiums for life and health insurance. Given the lower mean values for spirometry in Black persons versus White persons, a Black person may be at disproportionate risk for these consequences in a system that did not consider race in its predicted values. One recommendation that reduces the concern about more persons of color being deemed unfit for employment if race-specific equations are not used is to use other means of assessing risk in individuals with results near a threshold. Another counterpoint to the concern about shifting results of persons of color from above to below the safety threshold is that policies can change to allow employment coupled with increased monitoring and protective measures. It is uncertain whether the lower mean spirometry values in Black persons are associated with more occupational risk. Data are not available to answer these questions. Attention to obtaining baseline preexposure PFTs would avoid potential harm from interpreting subsequent results during employment for those at risk for a decline in lung function caused by occupational hazards.

### Difficulties in the interpretation of lung function tests in the diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^2215b418]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To ascertain differences in the interpretation of spirometry and peak flow measurement between primary care (several practioners and nurses) and specialists in patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Design

A randomized, prospective cohort study of 98 patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma or COPD. Two chest specialists independently interpreted the peak flow and spirometric data and they were also blinded to the primary care results.

Results

There was total agreement in interpretation of the data between general practitioners and specialists in only 20 (20.4%). Levels of diagnostic agreement were highest between the two chest specialists (55%) and lowest between the general practice records and the diagnosis assigned by general practitioners (16%). Disagreement between general practitioners and the two chest specialists was consistent (38%) indicating systematic differences in interpretation.

Conclusions

This study raises concerns about differences in the interpretation of spirometry and peak expiratory flow rates in general and hospital practice and the guidelines on which these interpretations are based.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^64462d9d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Lower limit of normal (LLN) and fixed cutoffs — percent predicted values should not be used to define abnormality because the true LLN is age- and/or height-dependent and varies among individuals; fixed cutoffs such as 80% predicted for forced vital capacity (FVC) or 0.70 for the FEV1/FVC ratio are based on middle-aged adults, can yield erroneous decisions in children and in older or shorter adults, and introduce sex bias. The LLN does not necessarily need to be the fifth percentile and can be adjusted with outcome data; caution is warranted near dichotomous boundaries, especially with results from a single occasion. In clinical testing where disease is suspected, the pretest probability is higher and the false positive rate is much lower than the lowest 5% implied by percentile thresholds.

### Official American Thoracic Society technical standards: spirometry in the occupational setting [^aa75b9bf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society spirometry — approaches to detect excessive decline in FEV1 for medical surveillance include a 15% threshold method, a limit of longitudinal decline (LLD), and linear regression of FEV1 slope. For the percent predicted method, "Calculation of threshold: Baseline (initial) FEV1% predicted minus current FEV1% predicted" and "Interpretation: If ≥ 15%, then observed decline in FEV1 may be excessive". The volume method states "Calculation of threshold: Baseline (initial) predicted FEV1 minus current predicted FEV1, plus (0.15 x baseline FEV1)". Notes add "Use the same set of FEV1 prediction equations for baseline and current predicted values" and "With increasing years of follow-up these methods detect smaller annual % declines in FEV1, for example 15% decline in Year 1 of follow up to 4% annual decline within 5 years of follow up". For LLD, "Calculation of threshold: Calculate LLD using available software*, based on spirometry quality and variability" with "Interpretation: If current FEV1 falls below LLD threshold, then observed decline in FEV1 may be excessive", and programs with quality spirometry can have "3–5% variability", while those "with more variability (about 6%) are quantitatively similar to the 15% approach", and "This method can be used for up to 5–8 years of follow up, although small short-term longitudinal changes (< 5 y) may be difficult to interpret". For linear regression, "Use available linear regression software* to calculate FEV1 slope, (ml/yr) using all available acceptable spirometry results over time", and "Interpretation: Compare observed rate of FEV1 decline, with rates of decline associated with adverse health outcomes (> 60–90 ml/yr)", noting "This method requires a minimum of 5 years of follow up for reliable estimates of FEV1 slope".

Approaches to assure high-quality spirometry in the work setting — equipment, technique, and training — are specified as follows. Equipment considerations include "Use equipment meeting ATS/ERS and ACOEM performance standards" and "Perform calibration checks and save results. Investigate anomalous test results" and "Supplement calibration checks by using standard subjects as biological controls", plus "Use spirometers that can save and export all data and flow-volume and volume-time curves and can display them on real-time graphical displays large enough for inspection of quality by technicians as tests are performed" and "Whenever possible, use the same type of spirometer for serial testing, and document the spirometer used". Testing technique includes "Testing should be performed consistent with existing ATS/ERS guidelines" and "Consider postponing testing if the subject has had recent respiratory infection, abdominal or thoracic surgery, or recent use of a bronchodilator. If test is performed anyway, document these or other factors (e.g., inhaled steroids) that might affect results", as well as "Document test acceptability and repeatability, recognizing that variable results may be due to flawed technique, faulty equipment, and/or underlying disease, and may not preclude interpretation of the results" and "The test subject can be sitting or standing, recognizing that standing may yield slightly increased values. Whenever possible, use the same posture for serial testing of an individual, and document the test subject's posture". Technician training and feedback steps include "Use a combination of interventions to optimize technician performance" and "Provide technicians with initial training and periodic refresher courses, which should include hands-on practical experience" along with "Use spirometers that can assess quality of tests and provide automated real-time feedback to technicians" and "Conduct ongoing review of the quality of spirometry tests that are performed and provide technicians timely, ongoing feedback about the quality of their tests and how to correct problems that are identified".

### Spirometry is not enough to diagnose COPD in epidemiological studies: a follow-up study [^8c847e3e]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Difference between using only one spirometry measure and repeated measures for COPD diagnosis

In epidemiological studies, attention has mainly focused on cross-sectional assessments and the influence of COPD criteria on population prevalence; however, the consistency of COPD diagnosis is no less important for patients than are clear spirometric criteria. There are known and expected variations in spirometric results after repeated testing (due to biological variability and/or measurement errors). The aforementioned variations and systematic changes due to aging may result in changes in the diagnosis of COPD over time. Based on the GOLD criterion, a person with an FEV1/FVC = 0.69 would be diagnosed with COPD; however, if the same person had a ratio of 0.7 obtained during a follow-up exam, he/she would no longer be diagnosed as having COPD. However, the current recommendation for COPD diagnosis only takes into account a single spirometry measurement, and does not take longitudinal inconsistencies into consideration.

The recently published results of baseline and follow-up studies conducted as part of a multicenter prevalence survey of COPD in major Latin American cities (the PLATINO study) have described the rates and correlates of inconsistent interpretations of AO according to its several criteria. The follow-up studies were conducted 5–9 years after the baseline surveys were performed. The following three main findings may be derived from these studies: (1) regardless of which AO criterion was used, inconsistencies in COPD diagnosis were observed (the LLN definition or defined as FEV1/FVC < 0.7 using the GOLD criteria plus FEV1 < 80% of the value predicted for GOLD stages 2–4 or FEV1 < LLN); (2) depending on which AO criterion was used, COPD prevalence would be lower or higher and, therefore, less or more inconsistent upon repeated testing (the FEV1/FVC definition was less concordant when tested twice than was the FEV1/FEV6 definition, while the consistency of COPD diagnosis was highest when using the FEV1/FEV6 < LLN definition and for definitions of airflow obstruction requiring a low FEV1 (GOLD stage 2–4); and (3) the closer the FEV1/FVC, FEV1/FEV6 and FEV1 were to the cut points, the higher the possibility of a change in diagnosis upon repeated testing.

Pulmonary assessment — spirometry thresholds and interpretive accuracy are noted: "an FEV1 < 70% predicted (severe disease < 50% of predicted), FVC < 70%, or an FEV1/ FVC < 70%, is consistent with significant pulmonary disease", but "the numbers in themselves are not highly sensitive/specific for all patients and may under diagnose younger or taller patients and over diagnose older and shorter patients". "Perhaps the most accurate of these measures is the FEV1/FVC ratio of 65% to 70% of predicted".

### Use of spirometry and patterns of prescribing in COPD in primary care [^25eab5a6]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the use and interpretation of spirometry in primary care (PC) in the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to identify the treatment schedules administered.

Methods

An observational study was performed in a randomized sample of 251 PC physicians including 2130 patients with COPD. Data on the performance of spirometry and the results and the treatment administered were collected as were sociodemographic and clinical data.

Results

Spirometric results were obtained in 1243 (58.4%). Most (1118/1243; 89.9%) corresponded to FEV1 (%) values with a mean of 57% (SD = 21.5%). It is of note that only 31.8% of spirometric results provided post-bonchodilator results, and 42.9% and 43.1% of the spirometries presented not plausible FVC or FEV1 values, respectively. Treatment varied greatly, with more than 3 drugs being prescribed in 30.6% of the cases. Long-acting beta-2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids were prescribed in more than 50% of the patients. Tiotropium was administered in 32.4%. According to the GOLD guidelines, 22.8% of the patients in GOLD II, 50% in III and 66.7% in IV were receiving incorrect treatment.

Conclusions

Only 58.4% of the cases included had undergone spirometry. Important deficiencies were observed in the interpretation of the results of spirometry. These difficulties may influence the low implementation of treatment guidelines in COPD in PC.

### Application of global lung function initiative global spirometry reference equations across a large, multicenter pulmonary function lab population [^2346a785]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

GLI Global offers a "race-neutral" approach to the interpretation of lung function measurements, motivated by efforts to eliminate health disparities and structural racism in medicine. The use of self-identified race and ethnicity oversimplifies the interplay between genetics and the myriad socioeconomic, environmental, and other risk factors that impact lung function. The GLI Global authors and others have called for careful examination of the use of these reference equations in real-world populations to better understand the resulting impact in spirometry interpretation.

Our study demonstrated that the application of GLI Global in place of the race- and ethnicity-specific GLI-2012 equations resulted in a different interpretation of nearly 1 of every 13 spirometry tests in our sample. This change would be larger in centers with greater demographic representation of individuals who self-identify as Black or SE Asian and does not include additional changes in the severity of impairment (i.e. mild to moderate obstruction). Changes in interpretation were more likely to occur in patients whose measurements were near the LLN, emphasizing the need for clinicians to recognize the uncertainty around such diagnostic thresholds and the impact of the reference equation that is used.

COPD screening of asymptomatic individuals using spirometry is described as controversial, with evidence that screening detects undiagnosed COPD but no data showing that outcomes improve among individuals identified before developing symptoms, that early treatment provides any benefit in asymptomatic individuals, or that screening is cost effective; we recommend studies that measure the accuracy of tools to detect symptoms using spirometry as the reference standard, compare outcomes for diagnostic definitions based on an FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.70 versus FEV1/FVC below the lower limit of normal, compare outcomes among symptomatic individuals with spirometry-confirmed airflow limitation and exposure history versus alternative diagnostic approaches, evaluate case-finding strategies using questionnaires, mini-spirometers, and office spirometry, examine the impact of ascertainment approach on outcomes, and evaluate the impact of age on the importance of identifying an airflow limitation (e.g., 30-yr-old vs 80-yr-old).

### Interpretation… [^92a51b5f]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The best FEV 1 and FVC results should be used to calculate the FEV 1/FVC ratio, even if they are obtained from separate attempts by the patient. The ATS/ERS guidelines define five quality categories for spirometry based on assessments of maximal lung volume and patient effort. Only the two poorest-quality results as defined by the grading system affect test interpretation, however. 13, 18. Interpretation Once the validity of the spirometry test has been confirmed, the process of interpretation begins. A stepwise approach allows for ease and reliability of interpretation. Using this approach, a patient's pulmonary abnormality should be placed into the most specific category possible. Spirometry usually provides sufficient information to suggest a working diagnosis even in the context of medical conditions that are not easily characterized.

Because lung volumes vary based on age, sex, and ethnicity, the use of a fixed FEV 1/FVC ratio for diagnosis may overestimate the presence of obstruction in older patients and underestimate it in younger patients. 21 However, a 2012 study in a general practice setting reported that using a fixed FEV 1/FVC ratio was better at diagnosing COPD than using the lower limit of normal, and a 2019 study showed that there was no difference between the two in predicting COPD-related hospital admissions or mortality in adults. 22, 23 In the absence of clear evidence, physicians may use either set of spirometry criteria in conjunction with the patient's overall clinical picture to diagnose obstruction. STEP TWO: EVALUATE THE FVC A low FVC is defined as a value less than the lower limit of normal for adults or less than 80% of predicted for children and adolescents five to 18 years of age.

24 Using the FEV 1/FVC ratio and FVC, the spirometry pattern can be characterized as normal, restrictive, obstructive defect, or mixed. Differential Diagnosis After spirometry results have been interpreted, a differential diagnosis may be considered, taking into account the patient's history and physical examination findings. Review of previous spirometry results, if available, can aid in assessing disease progression or response to treatment. It should be noted that FVC and FEV 1 values decrease by 20 to 30 mL per year, and variations in test quality may affect the comparison. 15.

### Impact of the new ATS / ERS pulmonary function test interpretation guidelines [^fea63707]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Rationale

In November 2005, the American Thoracic and European Respiratory Societies jointly published a statement proposing a new interpretation scheme for pulmonary function tests. The practical effect of adoption of these new guidelines has not yet been studied. The purpose of the current study was to address the effects of the new interpretation strategy on the relative distribution of obstructive and restrictive diagnoses in patients evaluated at a single academic medical center laboratory.

Patients/Methods

Pulmonary functions tests from 319 patients were analyzed according to four different interpretation schemes. The number of patients classified according to each as obstructed, restricted, neither, or both were compared, and factors associated with a change in classification using the different approaches were examined.

Results

Although similar proportions of patients were identified as restricted using either the "GOLD" scheme (23%) or new approaches (22%), significantly more (P < 0.005) were defined as obstructed using the newly proposed scheme (44% versus 33%). Additionally, 36% of subjects defined as obstructed using either the traditional or new schemes were classified differently (i.e., either "gained" or "lost" the diagnosis of obstruction) using the new approach. Women were significantly more likely than men to have a change in classification.

Conclusions

The new interpretation scheme leads to a diagnosis of obstruction in a greater proportion of patients undergoing pulmonary function testing. The clinical significance of this finding has not yet been validated, and its economic impact remains to be assessed.

### Calibration myths in the 2019 American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society spirometry technical standards [^52f175ae]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Updated American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) technical standards for spirometry were recently published in the Journal. Some recommendations regarding calibration verification are based on expert opinion, not science. Although these recommendations would not cause any harm, they are unproven directives that clinicians will feel obligated to follow. These recommendations are easy to test, overcoming the need to rely on expert opinion. We tested two directives that we believed were particularly dubious.

### Differences in spirometry interpretation algorithms: influence on decision making among primary-care physicians [^96ee2cf9]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Spirometry is recommended for the diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in international guidelines and may be useful for distinguishing asthma from COPD. Numerous spirometry interpretation algorithms (SIAs) are described in the literature, but no studies highlight how different SIAs may influence the interpretation of the same spirometric data.

Aims

We examined how two different SIAs may influence decision making among primary-care physicians.

Methods

Data for this initiative were gathered from 113 primary-care physicians attending accredited workshops in Canada between 2011 and 2013. Physicians were asked to interpret nine spirograms presented twice in random sequence using two different SIAs and touch pad technology for anonymous data recording.

Results

We observed differences in the interpretation of spirograms using two different SIAs. When the pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC (forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity) ratio was > 0.70, algorithm 1 led to a 'normal' interpretation (78% of physicians), whereas algorithm 2 prompted a bronchodilator challenge revealing changes in FEV1 that were consistent with asthma, an interpretation selected by 94% of physicians. When the FEV1/FVC ratio was < 0.70 after bronchodilator challenge but FEV1 increased > 12% and 200ml, 76% suspected asthma and 10% suspected COPD using algorithm 1, whereas 74% suspected asthma versus COPD using algorithm 2 across five separate cases. The absence of a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC decision node in algorithm 1 did not permit consideration of possible COPD.

Conclusions

This study suggests that differences in SIAs may influence decision making and lead clinicians to interpret the same spirometry data differently.

Spirometry plateau and minimum forced expiratory time (FET) considerations — there is no requirement for a minimum FET, and studies report variable attainability of plateau: an older population health study (mean age, 63 yr) found 53% of spirometry maneuvers failed to reach a plateau; another study reported 90% of patients with severe lung function impairment met the criteria; other adult studies found more than 95% of subjects who expired for longer than 6 seconds achieved a plateau; a large clinical trial found 94% of patients with COPD met the 1994 ATS plateau criteria; and in 1,631 healthy children aged 10–18 years, only 18% met the 2005 minimum FET despite visually acceptable maneuvers. Because the minimum FET requirement has been eliminated, increased vigilance by the operator and interpreter is required to assess whether expiration was complete or there was early termination.

Pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic algorithm for COPD: Measure pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC; if FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7, classify as not COPD, with consideration to measure post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC if a volume responder is suspected (e.g., low FEV1 or high symptoms). If pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7, measure post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC; if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7, interpret as flow response needing follow-up with repeat assessment, and if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7, COPD is confirmed. If the pre-bronchodilator values show obstruction the diagnosis of COPD should be confirmed using post-bronchodilator measurements, and individuals whose pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC shows obstruction but whose post-bronchodilator ratio does not show obstruction have an increased risk of future development of COPD and should be followed closely.

Spirometry reported values — pre- and post-bronchodilator outputs and definitions: "The following measurements are reported separately for the sets of prebronchodilator and post-bronchodilator maneuvers"; "The largest FVC and the largest FEV1, observed from all of the acceptable values are reported… Their ratio is used for FEV1/FVC", and if a bronchodilator is given, both percentage and absolute changes in FEV1 and FVC versus prebronchodilator are reported; reporting change in FEV1 as "a percentage of the predicted FEV1 or as z-scores" avoids sex and height bias; FIVC is the largest inspiratory volume immediately after forced expiration, PEF is the highest flow from a maximum forced expiratory maneuver with the largest value reported from acceptable maneuvers, and FET is "the time in seconds measured from Time 0 to the end of the expiratory plateau or the beginning of inspiration after maximal forced expiration, or the time that the patient comes off the mouthpiece".

### Standardization of spirometry 2019 update. An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society technical statement [^a5a9b5b5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society spirometry standards — scope and terminology: The primary signal measured in spirometry is either volume or flow as a function of time, and the most relevant measurements discussed are the FVC, which is the volume delivered during an expiration made as forcefully and completely as possible starting from full inspiration, and the FEV1, which is the expiratory volume in the first second of an FVC maneuver. These standards also apply to measurements of FEV1 in airway responsiveness testing and exercise testing and address other spirometric variables derived from the FVC maneuver as well as the measurement of VC from a slow maneuver. In this document, the "operator" is the person conducting the test; the term "patient" is used for the person being tested; and "maneuver" is the term used for the inspiratory and expiratory excursions. The term "must" is used to indicate a requirement for meeting the standards, and "should" is used to indicate actions that may not be mandatory but are considered to be best practices. These standards are the minimum criteria that must be met for clinical spirometry, which may not be sufficient for all settings, such as research or occupational surveillance.

Spirometry procedure and interpretation

Spirometry was undertaken to ATS/ERS standardswith at least three technically acceptable and repeatable efforts being recorded. Bronchodilator reversibility was undertaken on all patients, even if pre-bronchodilator lung function was within the normal range. Patients who refused the bronchodilator or had a medical contraindication were not tested. The recordings were interpreted using the Hankinson reference values. In 2014, we adopted the Global Lung Initiative 2012 reference equations. To avoid over-diagnosing elderly patients and under-diagnosing younger patients, interpretation of the recordings used the lower limits of the normal reference range specific to each patient rather than a fixed cut-off value, which does not take into account age, height, gender or ethnicity. The severity of obstruction, if present, was graded using the percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s. To reduce inter-interpreter variability, an agreed reporting structure was established, including standard phrases. The interpretation also included advice on further investigation and management strategies, with links to specialist respiratory medical and laboratory services and a clinical guidance website, HealthPathways.

Quality assurance

The Respiratory Physiology Laboratory and a Community Respiratory Physician were jointly responsible for monitoring the quality of the spirometry tests, and interpretation of the results. Initially, it was planned that each contracted general practice would have their first 100 tests re-read by the respiratory scientists, with further checks made on a periodic basis. However, this was subsequently changed to every test being scrutinised for quality using a web-based quality assurance tool. Four categories of testing quality were assessed, based on the 2005 ATS/ERS spirometry guidelines: acceptability, repeatability, technical comments and interpretation. The quality target for each practitioner was to achieve 90% in all four categories.

A clinical information system (Éclair, Sysmex New Zealand Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) was used to store and make the test results available to referring practices. This allows clinicians to view the test results on an electronic shared care record view (e-SCRV) of the medical record.

Clinical questions

Can the test be used to diagnose asthma? Is FeNO more accurate than spirometry or peak flow diaries?

Asthma is a clinical diagnosis and as a result, there is no single diagnostic test. NICE guidelines recommend that for children under 5 years with suspected asthma, their symptoms should be treated according to clinical judgement and have regular reviews. Once they reach 5 years, symptomatic children should undergo objective testing, including spirometry, bronchodilator reversibility or FeNO testing.

Asthma can be diagnosed if the patient has symptoms suggestive of asthma and a FeNO level of ≥ 35 ppb with positive peak flow variability or obstructive spirometry with positive bronchodilator reversibility (table 2). In children, a FeNO level of ≥ 35 ppb makes asthma (and a response to ICS) very likely.

Table 2
A table to show the positive test thresholds for objective tests used to diagnose asthma in children and young people (aged 5 years and older)

Current guidance advocating serial monitoring (peak flow readings or spirometry) to confirm diagnosis may miss mild asthma as abnormal airway physiology may be undetectable, suggesting these tests used serially have a low sensitivity.

Research has shown that the predictive values for FeNO are higher than that of traditional diagnostic methods. Table 3 below summarises the diagnostic accuracy of FeNO compared with traditional methods.

### Attaining a correct diagnosis of COPD in general practice [^328245a3]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is common. Diagnosis should include objective evidence of airways obstruction and spirometry is recommended in guidelines and the general medical services contract in the UK. We assessed the impact of spirometry in general practice.

Method

We determined by questionnaire the availability, staff training, use and the interpretation results of spirometry in 72% of general practices in Wales. We reviewed the diagnosis of COPD previously made in two general practices without spirometry.

Results

Most practices had a spirometer (82.4%) and used it (85.6%). Confidence in use and interpretation of results varied widely: 58.1% were confident in use and 33.8% confident in interpretation. Spirometry was performed more often if confident in use and interpretation (both P < 0.001) and was related to greater training periods (P < 0.001). Spirometric confirmation of COPD varied widely (0–100%, median 37%). Of the 125 patients previously diagnosed with COPD 61 had spirometric confirmation, while 25 had reversible obstruction (range 210–800 mls), 34 had normal and 5 had restrictive spirometry.

Conclusion

Despite incentives to perform spirometry in general practice, lack of adequate training in use and interpretation suggests use is confounded and the diagnosis of COPD is likely to be made on imprecise clinical grounds.

### Bronchodilator reversibility in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: use and limitations [^750da4d9]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

The change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) after administration of a short-acting bronchodilator has been widely used to identify patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have a potentially different disease course and response to treatment. Despite the apparent simplicity of the test, it is difficult to interpret or rely on. Test performance is affected by the day of testing, the severity of baseline lung-function impairment, and the number of drugs given to test. Recent data suggest that the response to bronchodilators is not enhanced in patients with COPD and does not predict clinical outcomes. In this Review we will discuss the insight that studies of bronchodilator reversibility have provided into the nature of the COPD, and how the abnormal physiology seen in patients with this disorder can be interpreted.

### Discriminative accuracy of simplified spirometry for identifying spirometry-defined COPD in the community [^34eddfa6]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Low spirometry testing rate for screening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is partly attributed to complex procedures, stringent quality control requirements, and long examination times. Simplifying the spirometry protocol may increase the feasibility of COPD screening in community settings.

Research Question

Does the simplified spirometry protocol have high diagnostic accuracy and time efficiency in screening for COPD?

Study Design and Methods

We designed a community-based, cross-sectional diagnostic study. Participants completed spirometry tests using both simplified and routine protocols. Routine spirometry was defined by three maneuvers meeting acceptability and reproducibility criteria according to international standards, while simplified spirometry required only the first acceptable maneuver. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of prebronchodilator simplified spirometry for identifying spirometric COPD (post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity < 0.70) measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Secondary outcomes included positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, specificity, examination time, and consistency of spirometry indicators between the two protocols.

Results

Out of 632 screened participants, 619 were analyzed. The prebronchodilator simplified spirometry demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.972 [95%CI: 0.955–0.983]), with a PPV of 77.4% (95% CI: 72.3–82.5), NPV of 98.1% (95% CI: 96.6–99.5), sensitivity of 96.6% (95%CI: 94.1–99.1%) and specificity of 86.0% (95%CI: 82.6–89.3%) for identifying spirometric COPD. The average examination time was significantly shorter with prebronchodilator simplified spirometry compared with postbronchodilator routine spirometry (2.8 ± 2.2 minutes vs. 32.1 ± 5.4 minutes; difference: 29.3 minutes [95%CI: 28.9–29.7]). A high consistency was observed between the spirometry indicators obtained from the simplified and routine protocols.

Interpretation

Prebronchodilator simplified spirometry demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for spirometric COPD screening in community settings. It significantly reduces examination time compared with routine spirometry, offering a feasible alternative for large-scale COPD screening initiatives.

### Does mild COPD affect prognosis in the elderly? [^172edf03]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive lung disease has as key feature the reduction of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) relative to the vital capacity (VC) or to the forced vital capacity (FVC), and various cut-off of the FEV1/FVC ratio have been proposed to diagnose this disease. According to the British Thoracic Society and the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) a diagnosis of COPD requires both FEV1/FVC < 0.7 and FEV1 < 80% predicted, while the Global initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines proposes a FEV1/FVC < 0.7 as diagnostic standard, classifying as GOLD class II those also having a FEV1 < 80% predicted. The 2004 European Respiratory Society (ERS)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines also use a fixed cut-off of 0.7 for the FEV1/VC ratio, but a statement on interpretation of spirometry issued in 2005 strongly suggests to use the lower limit of normal (LLN) to make a diagnosis of bronchial obstruction. In the same guidelines, severity classification is based on FEV1% predicted, with a cut-off for the first (mild) class set at 70%.

### Reply to townsend: the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society 2019 spirometry statement and occupational spirometry testing in the United States [^7e3debf9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

Townsend raises important points regarding the implementation of the 2019 update of the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Technical Statement spirometry standards. These standards were developed to apply to spirometry in any facility in which spirometry is conducted by an operator. As noted in the standards, there may be additional requirements for spirometry in occupational surveillance. Specialized pulmonary function laboratories that have operators with higher levels of training and/or higher-grade equipment may well have internal policies for accuracy and precision exceeding the requirements of these standards.

The need for operator training, such as that provided by recognized spirometry training programs in several countries, was added to these standards to emphasize its importance in quality assurance. Although some changes in maneuver acceptability criteria place more of an onus on the operator, the standards also introduce improvements in the spirometry software to aid the operator in conducting acceptable maneuvers, particularly regarding achieving an acceptable end of forced expiration.

The final inspiration, which is listed in the 2005 standards as an alternative protocol, is widely used and can aid in the interpretation of spirometry. The spirometry examples in Figures 5–10 of the 2005 standards show a full flow–volume loop that includes inspiration, but using this inspiratory component for quality control was not addressed. The task force felt that the addition of a maximal inspiration after maximal expiration provides another quality control indicator that the maneuver began at TLC. However, the standards state that if the final maximal inspiration is not performed, or is submaximal, it does not affect the acceptability of the maneuver.

The standards provide two procedures for spirometry maneuvers: one for expiration and inspiration and the other for expiration only. We agree with Townsend that it would have been preferable to label the latter as an "expiration-only protocol", rather than "expiration-only devices". Although the expiration–inspiration protocol is the preferred option, it was not our intent to suggest that devices capable of measuring both inspiration and expiration could not be used for the expiration-only protocol.

Identifying individuals with abnormal spirometry — lower limit of normal (LLN) use is recommended over fixed cutoffs, with ATS/ERS and ACOEM recommending using the fifth percentile LLN rather than 80% of predicted for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), or a fixed FEV1/FVC of 0.70; because the FEV1/FVC ratio declines with age, fixed 0.70 yields false-negative results in younger workers (age 25–45 yr) and false-positive results in older workers (men > 45 yr, women > 55 yr). Values below the fifth percentile LLN are considered abnormal, but by definition 5% of a healthy population will also fall below this threshold.

### Spirometry in occupational health-2020 [^e78c70b9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

NIOSH- and OSHA-related spirometry technician training — agency roles, certification interval, and required qualifications are specified. NIOSH was designated as the agency responsible for reviewing and approving occupational spirometry training courses, and NIOSH approves both initial Spirometry courses and Spirometry Refresher courses, which must be taken every 5 years (in addition to allowing for a 7 month additional grace period) to maintain a certificate of completion from a NIOSH-approved course; NIOSH conducts on-site course audits and periodic reviews. ATS/ERS has endorsed NIOSH-approved courses and stated that "Technicians should undergo initial practical training and refresher courses to maintain their skills", and also that "Operator training and attainment and maintenance of competence may be integrated in any spirometry testing service". Since 2016, both OSHA's Respirable Crystalline Silica Standards for Construction, General Industry, and Maritime and NIOSH's CWHSP have required that spirometry tests under these regulations must be conducted by individuals who have a current certificate from a NIOSH-approved course; an OSHA Letter of Interpretation stated that under the silica standard, OSHA views all medical personnel who administer spirometry testing as technicians. In 2013, OSHA's Guidance also recommended certification by completing a NIOSH-approved course, and that "Supervisors and/or interpreters of test results also complete a NIOSH-approved spirometry course or equivalent training that emphasizes recognition and troubleshooting of technical errors and the interpretation of spirometry results".

### Diagnostic accuracy of FEV1 / forced vital capacity ratio z scores in asthmatic patients [^1ad036bf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio is used as a criterion for airflow obstruction; however, the test characteristics of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma are not well established. The accuracy of a test depends on the pretest probability of disease.

Objective

We wanted to estimate the FEV1/FVC ratio z score threshold with optimal accuracy for the diagnosis of asthma for different pretest probabilities.

Methods

Asthmatic patients enrolled in 4 trials from the Asthma Clinical Research Centers were included in this analysis. Measured and predicted FEV1/FVC ratios were obtained, with calculation of z scores for each participant. Across a range of asthma prevalences and z score thresholds, the overall diagnostic accuracy was calculated.

Results

One thousand six hundred eight participants were included (mean age, 39 years; 71% female; 61% white). The mean FEV1 percent predicted value was 83% (SD, 15%). In a symptomatic population with 50% pretest probability of asthma, optimal accuracy (68%) is achieved with a z score threshold of -1.0 (16th percentile), corresponding to a 6 percentage point reduction from the predicted ratio. However, in a screening population with a 5% pretest probability of asthma, the optimum z score is -2.0 (second percentile), corresponding to a 12 percentage point reduction from the predicted ratio. These findings were not altered by markers of disease control.

Conclusion

Reduction of the FEV1/FVC ratio can support the diagnosis of asthma; however, the ratio is neither sensitive nor specific enough for diagnostic accuracy. When interpreting spirometric results, consideration of the pretest probability is an important consideration in the diagnosis of asthma based on airflow limitation.

### Standardization of spirometry 2019 update. An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society technical statement [^3abc1625]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Standardization of spirometry — device quality assurance outlines minimum laboratory requirements and when to repeat checks. Attention to equipment quality assurance and calibration is an important part of good laboratory practice. The minimum requirements are maintenance of a log of calibration results, documentation of repairs or other alterations that return the equipment to acceptable operation, recording dates of computer software and hardware updates or changes, and recording the dates equipment is changed or relocated. Calibration verifications and quality control procedures must be repeated after any such changes before further testing begins.
