## Question

Elevated ferritin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage elevated serum ferritin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and immediate clinical context. Then, I should verify the key differentials for hyperferritinemia and how transferrin saturation (TSAT) stratifies them. Next, I will examine iron overload pathways, followed by inflammatory and metabolic causes. After that, I should review special syndromes and malignancy. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic algorithm, thresholds for biopsy or advanced imaging, and management principles, while double-checking pitfalls and exceptions at each step.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and anchor the clinical context, because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and can be spuriously elevated. I need to check for hemolysis, recent transfusions, and repeat the ferritin after addressing modifiable factors, while simultaneously reviewing symptoms, alcohol use, medications, family history, and comorbidities such as liver disease, CKD, diabetes, and inflammatory conditions, since these shape pretest probabilities and test interpretation [^116kXCsb] [^114fuicn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. The single most informative next test is TSAT, so I should calculate it from serum iron and transferrin or TIBC and interpret it alongside ferritin to separate iron overload from inflammation or metabolic drivers, recognizing that TSAT > 45% strongly suggests primary iron overload, whereas normal TSAT with high ferritin points toward secondary causes or dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia [^114SLmej] [^112KTP8q].

> If TSAT is elevated, I will now examine hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE-related) as the leading cause in patients of Northern European ancestry. I should order HFE genotyping for C282Y and H63D, and if C282Y homozygous or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous, I need to assess fibrosis risk using ferritin and liver enzymes, where ferritin > 1000 µg/L or elevated ALT/AST increases the likelihood of advanced fibrosis and may warrant liver biopsy or elastography, while ferritin < 1000 µg/L with normal enzymes makes cirrhosis unlikely and supports proceeding to therapeutic phlebotomy without biopsy in most cases [^113GfgzE] [^113CCKLs] [^1114iczj].

> Wait, let me verify a common pitfall: normal ferritin does not exclude hemochromatosis, especially early in disease when TSAT rises before ferritin. I should double-check for cases with high TSAT and normal ferritin and still pursue HFE testing if clinical suspicion is present, as illustrated by case reports and guideline algorithms [^115oKwcQ] [^113GfgzE].

> Next, I should review non-HFE iron overload disorders if HFE testing is negative or the phenotype is atypical. Ferroportin disease and other rare entities can produce hepatic iron loading with distinctive MRI patterns (spleen and spine involvement in ferroportin disease), and MRI-based hepatic iron quantification (T2✱ or R2*) is preferred to quantify iron and guide genetic testing or biopsy decisions when needed [^112ZNbPm] [^114gWxQZ].

> If TSAT is normal, I need to ensure I consider inflammatory anemia of chronic disease and systemic inflammation. Ferritin is often normal or elevated despite iron deficiency in this setting, so I should check CRP/ESR, review for autoimmune disease, infection, or malignancy, and remember that in inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic inflammatory states, ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency are higher (often < 100 µg/L) and TSAT < 20% supports functional iron deficiency even when ferritin is not low [^117Bn4Sx] [^115tZ6D9] [^111o9XK7].

> But wait, what if the ferritin is markedly elevated, say above 10,000 µg/L? I should consider hyperferritinemic syndromes such as HLH/MAS or AOSD, yet I must not over-attribute, because in adults extreme hyperferritinemia is nonspecific and more often due to transfusional iron, liver disease, infection, or malignancy. Still, ferritin > 10,000 µg/L in pediatrics is highly suggestive of HLH, and combining ferritin with sIL-2R and clinical criteria improves diagnostic accuracy, so I should promptly evaluate cytopenias, triglycerides, fibrinogen, and soluble IL-2 receptor while initiating urgent specialty input if HLH/MAS is suspected [^115uUrMs] [^113FLwbk] [^117TA9qX].

> I will now examine dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia when TSAT is normal and metabolic risk factors are present. Obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and MASLD commonly raise ferritin without iron overload, and consensus recommends grading severity by ferritin tiers and, in higher grades or with risk factors, using MRI to assess hepatic iron and fibrosis, while emphasizing lifestyle modification and treating the metabolic syndrome before labeling iron overload [^112Duo42] [^113UwyPT] [^113rkLJK].

> Let me consider special syndromes I must not miss: hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome from FTL IRE mutations presents with isolated high ferritin and early-onset cataracts, and the ferritin elevation is not due to iron overload. If suspected, I should confirm with ophthalmic exam and consider targeted genetic testing to avoid unnecessary liver biopsy or phlebotomy [^115BpUcW] [^117WtSEW].

> I should also keep malignancy in the differential for unexplained hyperferritinemia, particularly hematologic cancers and solid tumors, and correlate with clinical findings, CBC, LDH, and organ-specific imaging. In pediatric oncology contexts such as neuroblastoma, markedly elevated ferritin can carry prognostic significance and should be interpreted in that disease-specific framework [^114fuicn] [^113gqzSf].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm: confirm the ferritin elevation, calculate TSAT, and branch to HFE testing if TSAT is high. If TSAT is normal, assess inflammation and metabolic risk, and consider MRI for hepatic iron quantification when ferritin is severely elevated or when the etiology remains unclear. Liver biopsy is reserved for cases with ferritin > 1000 µg/L and elevated transaminases to stage fibrosis or when alternative liver diseases are suspected, acknowledging that noninvasive elastography can reduce unnecessary biopsies [^113GfgzE] [^114gWxQZ] [^115KBqx1].

> For management, if hereditary hemochromatosis is confirmed, I should initiate therapeutic phlebotomy targeting ferritin around 20–30 µg/L and TSAT < 50%, monitor CBC and ferritin during induction, and screen for hepatocellular carcinoma once cirrhosis is established. If dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia is diagnosed, I should prioritize weight loss, glycemic and lipid control, alcohol reduction, and reassess ferritin after about 3 months before considering iron removal strategies. If HLH/MAS is suspected, I need urgent hematology/rheumatology input for immunomodulatory therapy and etiologic treatment [^115nKPSB] [^11289Ddb] [^117TA9qX].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances: extreme hyperferritinemia in children is more specific for HLH than in adults, and institutional ferritin alert systems can expedite early recognition and biomarker sampling, though I must still integrate clinical criteria and avoid anchoring bias when ferritin is only modestly elevated [^115uUrMs] [^113A1V6i].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate key caveats: ferritin is both a marker of iron stores and an acute-phase reactant, so normal or high ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency in inflammatory states. In such cases, TSAT, CRP, and soluble transferrin receptor can help, and guideline-concordant ferritin cutoffs for iron deficiency vary by context, with AGA recommending 45 ng/mL in adults with anemia and ECCO suggesting < 100 µg/L in active IBD, underscoring the need to interpret ferritin within the clinical picture and the tested population [^112knLuE] [^115Cu3E3] [^1157g8j4].

Elevated ferritin reflects **increased iron stores** [^1157g8j4] or **inflammation** [^1124kgh5], not iron overload alone. The most common causes are **iron overload** (hereditary hemochromatosis, transfusions) [^113GfgzE], **inflammation** (infection, autoimmune disease, malignancy) [^114fuicn], liver disease (NAFLD, alcoholic liver disease) [^112PDk3f], and metabolic syndrome [^112Duo42]. Initial evaluation should include **transferrin saturation** [^113GfgzE], **CBC**, **LFTs**, **CRP/ESR**, and **HFE testing** if TS ≥ 45% [^112dgQXJ]. Management targets the underlying cause: phlebotomy for iron overload [^115nKPSB], disease-specific therapy for inflammation [^117Bn4Sx], and lifestyle changes for metabolic syndrome [^11289Ddb]. Ferritin > 1,000 ng/mL warrants urgent evaluation for hemochromatosis, liver disease, or malignancy [^1114iczj].

---

## Physiological role of ferritin

Ferritin is the **intracellular iron-storage protein** [^112KTP8q] that sequesters iron and prevents oxidative stress; serum ferritin reflects iron stores but also rises with inflammation, liver injury, and metabolic dysregulation [^1124kgh5].

---

## Common causes of elevated ferritin

| **Category** | **Specific conditions** |
|-|-|
| Iron overload | - Hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE-related) [^113GfgzE] <br/> - Repeated transfusions [^1125sqjN] <br/> - Excessive iron supplementation [^1125sqjN] |
| Inflammation | - Infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) [^114fuicn] <br/> - Autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, SLE) [^notfound] <br/> - Malignancies (lymphoma, leukemia, solid tumors) [^114FZow6] |
| Liver disease | - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [^1148Nv4C] <br/> - Alcoholic liver disease [^112PDk3f] <br/> - Chronic hepatitis B/C [^notfound] |
| Metabolic syndrome | - Obesity [^112ejQcu] <br/> - Diabetes mellitus [^112ejQcu] <br/> - Dyslipidemia <br/> - Hypertension [^112ejQcu] |
| Other causes | - Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome [^117WtSEW] <br/> - Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [^117TA9qX] <br/> - Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) [^114pC5PW] |

## Clinical significance of elevated ferritin

Elevated ferritin is **nonspecific** [^112KTP8q] and requires clinical correlation and further testing to distinguish iron overload from inflammatory or metabolic causes [^114fuicn]. Very high levels (> 1,000 ng/mL) are concerning for significant iron overload, liver disease, or malignancy and warrant urgent evaluation [^1114iczj].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Recommended **initial tests** include:

- **Transferrin saturation (TS)**: TS ≥ 45% suggests iron overload [^113GfgzE]; normal TS with elevated ferritin suggests inflammation or metabolic causes [^112KTP8q].
- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for anemia, macrocytosis, or cytopenias [^114A3ihE].
- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Assess hepatic injury or disease [^1175qH98].
- **C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)**: Screen for inflammation [^114G1cVV].
- **HFE gene testing**: If TS ≥ 45%, test for HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D) [^113GfgzE].

Additional tests may include **MRI for hepatic iron quantification** [^114gWxQZ] and, when indicated, **liver biopsy** for fibrosis staging or alternative diagnoses [^115KBqx1].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Iron overload (hereditary hemochromatosis)**: Therapeutic phlebotomy to reduce iron stores; target ferritin ~50 ng/mL [^notfound].
- **Inflammation-related hyperferritinemia**: Treat the underlying inflammatory condition [^117Bn4Sx]; ferritin serves as a marker of disease activity [^114PBkKs].
- **Metabolic syndrome**: Lifestyle modifications (weight loss, dietary changes, exercise) [^11289Ddb]; consider ferritin-lowering agents if indicated [^notfound].
- **Malignancy**: Oncological evaluation and treatment [^117TA9qX].

---

## Prognostic implications

Elevated ferritin is associated with worse outcomes in chronic liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy [^notfound]. Persistent elevation increases risks of **liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma** [^1114iczj].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Elevated ferritin is common in childhood inflammatory conditions (e.g. HLH, MAS) [^115uUrMs] and requires careful evaluation [^113A1V6i].
- **Pregnancy**: Ferritin naturally rises in pregnancy; interpret with caution [^notfound].
- **Ethnicity**: HFE-related hemochromatosis is more common in individuals of Northern European descent [^1169ycLm].

---

Elevated ferritin is a nonspecific marker of **iron overload, inflammation, liver disease, or metabolic dysfunction** [^114fuicn]. Accurate diagnosis and management require clinical correlation, appropriate laboratory testing, and targeted therapy for the underlying cause [^116kXCsb].

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Extreme hyperferritinemia: causes and impact on diagnostic reasoning [^114FZow6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hyperferritinemia can be a result of inflammation, infection, chronic iron overload, or other uncommon pathologies including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). There is a historical association between extreme hyperferritinemia and HLH, but in reality HLH is associated with a minority of hyperferritinemic states.

Methods

We identified conditions most associated with hyperferritinemia by identifying 65,536 serum ferritin levels at the University of Minnesota Hospital over a five-year period, with 86 values higher than 10,000ng/mL. Pediatric patients comprised 22% of this population, and adults, 78%.

Results

The majority of cases in both populations with hyperferritinemia were due to chronic transfusion (35%), followed by liver disease (27%), and hematologic malignancy (16%). Solid malignancies, infection, macrophage activation syndrome, and primary and secondary HLH comprised the remaining (22%).

Conclusions

Although this supports the relationship between extreme hyperferritinemia and HLH, it maintains that the positive predictive value of hyperferritinemia for HLH is quite low, and one should consider more common explanations before suspecting HLH.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^113GfgzE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — diagnosis and treatment algorithm: In patients with suspected hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) based on symptoms, elevated liver enzymes, or family history, the suggested initial screening tests should be transferrin-iron saturation (TS) and serum ferritin (SF) level; if TS is < 45% and SF is normal, further evaluation is not necessary, whereas if TS is ≥ 45% and/or SF is elevated, HFE gene testing should be performed. All patients who are C282Y homozygotes should proceed to phlebotomy; if SF is > 1,000 μg/L, liver biopsy is suggested for fibrosis staging, and patients with cirrhosis should undergo screening for hepatocellular carcinoma; a liver biopsy can also be considered before initiating phlebotomy in C282Y homozygotes with elevated liver enzymes to rule out additional causes of liver disease. For patients who are not C282Y homozygotes, evaluation for other causes of elevated iron indices should be performed, including liver and hematologic disorders; if other causes of iron overload have been ruled out, hepatic iron concentration (HIC) should be assessed by liver biopsy or MRI, and patients with elevated HIC and SF of > 1,000 μg/mL should proceed to therapeutic phlebotomy.

### MRI-based iron phenotyping and patient selection for next-generation sequencing of non-homeostatic iron regulator hemochromatosis genes [^1125sqjN]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The concentration of serum ferritin is a surrogate of body iron. Hypoferritinemia is sensitive and specific for iron deficiency. In contrast, hyperferritinemia can be caused by a range of disorders, including iron overload, inflammation, metabolic syndrome, increased alcohol consumption, and malignancies. The diagnostic approach in patients with elevated serum ferritin includes clinical, biochemical, and genetic investigations as well as imaging studies. The sequence of investigations and interpretation of test results is determined by the specific clinical context. Given that the liver is the primary organ for excess iron storage, quantification of hepatic iron is a key step in assessing the cause of hyperferritinemia.

The differential diagnosis of confirmed hepatic iron overload includes repeated transfusions, intravenous or oral iron therapy, homeostatic iron regulator (HFE) hemochromatosis, and other inherited disorders of iron metabolism. The commonest cause of hepatic iron overload is hemochromatosis, which is genetically heterogeneous and its penetrance modified by environmental factors. In Whites, homozygosity for p. Cys282Tyr in HFE accounts for hemochromatosis in 80%‐90% of patients with the clinical diagnosis. Although the frequency of compound heterozygosity for p. Cys282Tyr/p. His63Asp is higher in hemochromatosis patients than in the general population, this genotype alone is not considered sufficient to cause hepatic iron overload. In patients with early disease onset and severe clinical manifestations, recessive mutations in hepcidin (HAMP), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2), and hemojuvelin (HJV) have been identified. In contrast, dominant mutations in solute carrier family 40 member 1 (SLC40A1) are associated with iron overload in patients with ferroportin disease or hemochromatosis type 4.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis: rapid evidence review [^1169ycLm]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts iron homeostasis, resulting in systemic iron overload. It is the most common inherited disorder among people of northern European ancestry. Despite the high prevalence of the gene mutation, there is a low and variable clinical penetrance. The deposition of excess iron into parenchymal cells leads to cellular dysfunction and the clinical manifestations of the disease. The liver, pancreas, joints, heart, skin, and pituitary gland are the most commonly involved organs. Hereditary hemochromatosis is usually diagnosed in the 40s or 50s. Women are often diagnosed later than men, likely because of menstrual blood loss. There is no typical presentation or pathognomonic signs and symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis. Because of increased awareness and earlier diagnosis, the end-organ damage secondary to iron overload is not often seen in clinical practice. A common initial presentation is an asymptomatic patient with mildly elevated liver enzymes who is subsequently found to have elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Ferritin levels greater than 300 ng per mL for men and 200 ng per mL for women and transferrin saturations greater than 45% are highly suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment and can help improve heart function, reduce abnormal skin pigmentation, and lessen the risk of liver complications. Liver transplantation may be considered in select patients. Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal and breast cancers. Genetic testing for the hereditary hemochromatosis genes should be offered after 18 years of age to first-degree relatives of patients with the condition.

### Consensus statement on the definition and classification of metabolic hyperferritinaemia [^113UwyPT]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia, more specifically with respect to MRI, MHF-CG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a noninvasive estimation of iron concentration in the liver by MRI in the context of a clinical trial, given the initial evidence that serum levels of ferritin might be associated with iron accumulation in tissue in patients with stable metabolic hyperferritinemia. Consider obtaining it in patients with high serum levels of ferritin (grade 2, but in particular, grade 3) and/or additional clinical risk factors for iron overload. Prefer iron concentration in tissues over serum ferritin levels, when available, for grading metabolic hyperferritinemia.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^1135e9FE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this nationally representative survey study of internal medicine PCPs, we found substantial variation in the management of anemia. Specifically, we found self-reported evidence of both overuse of screening CBCs (76.9% of respondents) and underuse of bidirectional endoscopy in patients with IDA. Certain knowledge gaps also existed in the interpretation of discordant laboratory test results, which may contribute to diagnostic errors. Specifically, 26.5% of respondents misdiagnosed a scenario of IDA as anemia with an alternate cause despite a low transferrin saturation (2%) and a borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL). Several subtle but important nuances in interpretation of these studies may contribute to errors, including the high specificity of a low ferritin level (98% specific for iron deficiency with a ferritin level ≤ 12 ng/mL), the potential for the ferritin level to be normal or elevated in inflammatory states when a patient is iron deficient, and the importance of measuring serum iron level in a fasting state to avoid potential confounders of dietary or supplemental iron. Given the relatively high baseline prevalence of anemia of 5.6% in the US, incorrect interpretation of these laboratory results may lead to a substantial number of missed or delayed diagnoses of IDA and, by extension, potential delays in diagnosis of GI tract malignant neoplasm.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — diagnosis and epidemiologic presentation notes that "The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels", and that in older series women "typically presented approximately 10 years later than men, and there were approximately 10 times as many men presenting as women", while "the proportion of C282Y homozygous women with definite disease manifestations… is… lower than men (1% versus 25%, respectively)". It also states serologic markers are "widely available", with most patients now identified "while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis", and that "It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function have iron studies done at some point in their evaluation".

### Serum ferritin is derived primarily from macrophages through a nonclassical secretory pathway [^1124kgh5]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

The serum ferritin concentration is a clinical parameter measured widely for the differential diagnosis of anemia. Its levels increase with elevations of tissue iron stores and with inflammation, but studies on cellular sources of serum ferritin as well as its subunit composition, degree of iron loading and glycosylation have given rise to conflicting results. To gain further understanding of serum ferritin, we have used traditional and modern methodologies to characterize mouse serum ferritin. We find that both splenic macrophages and proximal tubule cells of the kidney are possible cellular sources for serum ferritin and that serum ferritin is secreted by cells rather than being the product of a cytosolic leak from damaged cells. Mouse serum ferritin is composed mostly of L-subunits, whereas it contains few H-subunits and iron content is low. L-subunits of serum ferritin are frequently truncated at the C-terminus, giving rise to a characteristic 17-kD band that has been previously observed in lysosomal ferritin. Taken together with the fact that mouse serum ferritin is not detectably glycosylated, we propose that mouse serum ferritin is secreted through the nonclassical lysosomal secretory pathway.

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1148Nv4C]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Initial evaluation of suspected NAFLD — diagnostic requirements and laboratory considerations specify that the diagnosis of NAFLD requires that there is HS by imaging or histology, no significant alcohol consumption, no competing etiologies for HS, and no coexisting causes of CLD; if serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are elevated, genetic hemochromatosis should be excluded, and although the data are somewhat conflicting, serum ferritin > 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) was associated with more advanced fibrosis in a retrospective cohort of 628 adults; mutations in the HFE gene occur with variable frequency and the clinical significance is unclear; liver biopsy should be considered in the setting of high ferritin and a high iron saturation; low‑titer autoantibodies are common and often prompt biopsy to exclude autoimmune disease, and in a study of 864 NAFLD subjects, significant autoantibody elevations (antinuclear antibodies > 1:160 or antismooth muscle antibodies > 1:40) were present in 21% and were not associated with more advanced disease or atypical histological features.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113PRqko]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — serum ferritin interpretation and predictive thresholds include the following: in a study of individuals < 35 years of age, serum ferritin in the normal range in combination with a TS < 45% had a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload; in a California primary care population, a serum ferritin > 250 μg/L in men and > 200 μg/L in women was positive in 77% and 56% of C282Y homozygotes; and in the HEIRS screening study of 99,711 North American participants, serum ferritin levels were elevated (> 300 μg/L in men, > 200 μg/L in women) in 57% of female and 88% of male C282Y homozygotes. Ferritin can be elevated in the absence of increased iron stores, and in the general population, iron overload is not the most common cause of an elevated ferritin level; in most circumstances, serum ferritin provides additional confirmation of the significance of an elevated TS in C282Y homozygotes, and an elevated ferritin with a normal TS may occur particularly in non–HFE-related iron overload or in a C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote.

### Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis – a diagnostic dilemma: two cases and review [^1172zz6P]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe inflammatory disorder characterized by activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and histiocytes with cytokine release and uncontrolled hemophagocytosis, especially late in the course of the disease. Clinical features include relapsing fevers, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, lymphadenopathy, and coagulopathy. The diagnosis can be challenging, as the early signs and symptoms are nonspecific and no specific laboratory tests exist. This syndrome is frequently not recognized and has a significant mortality rate. Typical scenarios in which HLH should be considered include mononucleosis (fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy) in an infant or young child, aseptic meningitis associated with cytopenias, or a viral syndrome-like illness with cytopenias and lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, for example. Our approach includes measuring a ferritin level as a screening tool early in the course of such an illness. Two cases of HLH are reviewed, illustrating the frequent complexity of these cases and potential pitfalls to making a prompt diagnosis.

T-Cell lymphomas — Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) supportive care describes HLH as a "Syndrome of extreme immune activation resulting in life-threatening inflammation" and lists clinical signs including cytopenias affecting 2 of 3 lineages with thresholds "Hemoglobin < 9 g/dL", "Platelets < 100 × 10³/mL", and "Neutrophils < 1 × 10³/mL", hypertriglyceridemia/hypofibrinogenemia with "Fasting triglycerides > 3.0 mmol/L (ie, > 265 mg/dL)" and "Fibrinogen < 1.5 g/L", and other features such as "Ferritin > 500 ng/mL" and "sIL-2R (also known as soluble CD25 [sCD25]) > 2400 U/mL". Diagnostic evaluation includes "Labs including CBC with differential, triglycerides, fibrinogen, ferritin, sCD25, liver function tests (LFTs), LDH, and D-dimer", bone marrow biopsy with "Consider repeat bone marrow biopsy if strong suspicion of HLH", and "Consider liver biopsy". Management states "Recommend expert consultation" and prioritizes "Treatment of the underlying T-cell lymphoma with preference for etoposide- and steroid-containing regimens", with the instruction to "Start with HLH-directed therapy if cytopenias preclude standard anti-lymphoma therapy, and then initiate standard anti-lymphoma therapy when cytopenias improve", and notes "Antiviral therapy - See Monoclonal Antibody Therapy and Viral Reactivation (TCLYM-B 3 of 4)". HLH in adults "is often associated with an underlying T-cell lymphoma" and diagnostic workup with prompt initiation of lymphoma treatment "is often required". For diagnosis, "Consider optimized HLH inflammatory (OHI) index [combined elevation of sCD25 (> 3900 U/mL) and ferritin (> 1000 ng/mL)] to simplify the diagnosis of HLH in patients with hematologic malignancies". All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^113Sa7RP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How is the choice of guideline-recommended cutoffs for ferritin associated with the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses in primary care?

Findings

In this cohort study of 255 351 adult primary care patients, ferritin cutoffs of 15, 30, and 45 ng/mL were associated with incidences of iron deficiency diagnoses of 10.9, 29.9, and 48.3 cases per 1000 patient-years, respectively.

Meaning

The results of this study provide useful components for the evaluation of ferritin testing in high-resource primary care settings and call for harmonization of guidelines for iron deficiency.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relationship to other clinical parameters including the patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine, and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117Bn4Sx]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Neuroblastoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113gqzSf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Neuroblastoma — additional workup recommends that all patients undergo an H&P, with special attention given to the abdominal exam to evaluate for masses and organomegaly, as well as a thorough neurologic exam, and any family history of neuroblastoma or other childhood cancers should be noted. Essential laboratory tests include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel, and urine catecholamine levels — homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) — which are elevated in the majority of patients; analysis of urine HVA and VMA levels is required for diagnosis only if bone marrow is the only diagnostic tissue obtained. In selected cases, clinicians may consider obtaining the prothrombin (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) if the liver is involved or there is a concern for bleeding; pregnancy tests should be done for all patients of childbearing potential, and a referral to fertility specialists should be made for patients with high-risk disease to discuss possible options and timing for fertility preservation. Analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin levels can be considered in select cases, and high levels of LDH and ferritin in patients with neuroblastoma have been associated with worse prognosis.

### A case of incomplete Kawasaki disease with extremely high serum ferritin and interleukin-18 levels [^111rJJ6n]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical features and laboratory parameters of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) occasionally overlap. Therefore, serum levels of cytokine and ferritin are used as markers to distinguish between KD and sJIA. KD patients have a high level of interleukin (IL)-6, low level of IL-18, and no elevation of the level of serum ferritin. Conversely, sJIA patients have a low level of IL-6 and high levels of IL-18 and ferritin in the serum. However, to the best of our knowledge, no case report of KD with a low serum level of IL-6 and extremely high levels of IL-18 and ferritin is found.

Case presentation

A 6-year-old boy presented with a history of fever for 9 days and a rash that appeared 7 days from the onset. He was diagnosed with incomplete KD because of fever, skin rash, oral cavity erythematous changes, and erythema and edema of the hands with laboratory findings of serum albumin level < 3.0 g/dL, elevated alanine aminotransferase level and leukocyturia. Intravenous immunoglobulin and prednisolone and oral aspirin were introduced on the 10th day. Fever subsided 1 day after initiating the treatment, but arthritis of both knees appeared in addition to hepatosplenomegaly. We suspected sJIA, as the serum level of ferritin was 19,740 ng/mL, IL-6 was < 3 pg/mL, and IL-18 was 132,000 pg/mL. Skin desquamation of the fingertips was observed 18 days from the onset; thus, he was finally diagnosed with incomplete KD with arthritis. At 32 days from the onset, we stopped the prednisolone therapy and no symptoms of relapse were observed afterwards. In the follow-up at 16 months from the onset, he had neither signs of active joint or skin involvement, nor cardiac involvement.

Conclusions

Although patients with sJIA generally have high serum levels of IL-18 and ferritin, this was a case of incomplete KD with extremely high serum levels of IL-18 and ferritin. Serum cytokine and ferritin are often used for the differential diagnosis of KD and sJIA. We need to recognize the existence of KD with high serum levels of IL-18 and ferritin.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^115PFf6Y]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

### Interpretation of ferritin concentrations in the dermatology clinic [^116Gd8nd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ferritin measurement is a common laboratory test in dermatology. Ferritin is a marker of iron storage in the human body but can also be -elevated in inflammatory states. Therefore, changes in ferritin are nonspecific, and correlation of specific clinical findings and risk factors with ferritin concentration and other biomarkers, e.g. iron studies or C-reactive protein tests, is recommended. This article discusses iron metabolism and the indications for ferritin measurement in dermatology and how to interpret the laboratory results.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis [^1157Rj5X]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts the body's regulation of iron. It is the most common genetic disease in whites. Men have a 24-fold increased rate of iron-overload disease compared with women. Persons who are homozygous for the HFE gene mutation C282Y comprise 85 to 90 percent of phenotypically affected persons. End-organ damage or clinical manifestations of hereditary hemochromatosis occur in approximately 10 percent of persons homozygous for C282Y. Symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis are nonspecific and typically absent in the early stages. If present, symptoms may include weakness, lethargy, arthralgias, and impotence. Later manifestations include arthralgias, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism. Diagnosis requires confirmation of increased serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation, with or without symptoms. Subtyping is based on genotypic expression. Serum ferritin measurement is the most useful prognostic indicator of disease severity. Liver biopsy is performed to stage the degree of fibrosis with severe ferritin elevation or transaminitis, or to diagnose nonclassical hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with other genetic defects. Treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis requires phlebotomy, and the frequency is guided by serial measurements of serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation. Iron avidity can result from overtreatment. If iron avidity is not suspected, it may mimic undertreatment with persistently elevated transferrin saturation. Dietary modification is generally unnecessary. Universal screening for hereditary hemochromatosis is not recommended, but testing should be performed in first-degree relatives of patients with classical HFE-related hemochromatosis, those with evidence of active liver disease, and patients with abnormal iron study results. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is reserved for those with hereditary hemochromatosis and cirrhosis.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^1157g8j4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores; low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test of iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases (10 June 2020): DARE (Cochrane Library) Issue 2 of 4 2015, HTA (Cochrane Library) Issue 4 of 4 2016, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) Issue 6 of 12 2020, MEDLINE (OVID) 1946 to 9 June 2020, Embase (OVID) 1947 to week 23 2020, CINAHL (Ebsco) 1982 to June 2020, Web of Science (ISI) SCI, SSCI, CPCI-exp & CPCI-SSH to June 2020, POPLINE 16/8/18, Open Grey (10/6/20), TRoPHI (10/6/20), Bibliomap (10/6/20), IBECS (10/6/20), SCIELO (10/6/20), Global Index Medicus (10/6/20) AIM, IMSEAR, WPRIM, IMEMR, LILACS (10/6/20), PAHO (10/6/20), WHOLIS 10/6/20, IndMED (16/8/18) and Native Health Research Database (10/6/20). We also searched two trials registers and contacted relevant organisations for unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all study designs seeking to evaluate serum or plasma ferritin concentrations measured by any current or previously available quantitative assay as an index of iron status in individuals of any age, sex, clinical and physiological status from any country.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We designed the data extraction form to record results for ferritin concentration as the index test, and bone marrow iron content for iron deficiency and liver iron content for iron overload as the reference standards. Two other authors further extracted and validated the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative cases, and extracted or derived the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for each threshold presented for iron deficiency and iron overload in included studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. We used GRADE assessment to enable the quality of evidence and hence strength of evidence for our conclusions.

Main Results

Our search was conducted initially in 2014 and updated in 2017, 2018 and 2020 (10 June). We identified 21,217 records and screened 14,244 records after duplicates were removed. We assessed 316 records in full text. We excluded 190 studies (193 records) with reasons and included 108 studies (111 records) in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. There were 11 studies (12 records) that we screened from the last search update and appeared eligible for a future analysis. We decided to enter these as awaiting classification. We stratified the analysis first by participant clinical status: apparently healthy and non-healthy populations. We then stratified by age and pregnancy status as: infants and children, adolescents, pregnant women, and adults. Iron deficiency We included 72 studies (75 records) involving 6059 participants. Apparently healthy populations Five studies screened for iron deficiency in people without apparent illness. In the general adult population, three studies reported sensitivities of 63% to 100% at the optimum cutoff for ferritin, with corresponding specificities of 92% to 98%, but the ferritin cutoffs varied between studies. One study in healthy children reported a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 77%. One study in pregnant women reported a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%. Overall confidence in these estimates was very low because of potential bias, indirectness, and sparse and heterogenous evidence. No studies screened for iron overload in apparently healthy people. People presenting for medical care There were 63 studies among adults presenting for medical care (5042 participants). For a sample of 1000 subjects with a 35% prevalence of iron deficiency (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 85% specificity, there would be 315 iron-deficient subjects correctly classified as having iron deficiency and 35 iron-deficient subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron deficiency, leading to a 90% sensitivity. Thresholds proposed by the authors of the included studies ranged between 12 to 200 µg/L. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 50. Among non-healthy adults using a fixed threshold of 30 μg/L (nine studies, 512 participants, low-certainty evidence), the pooled estimate for sensitivity was 79% with a 95% confidence interval of (58%, 91%) and specificity of 98%, with a 95% confidence interval of (91%, 100%). The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 140, a relatively highly informative test. Iron overload We included 36 studies (36 records) involving 1927 participants. All studies concerned non-healthy populations. There were no studies targeting either infants, children, or pregnant women. Among all populations (one threshold for males and females; 36 studies, 1927 participants, very low-certainty evidence): for a sample of 1000 subjects with a 42% prevalence of iron overload (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 65% specificity, there would be 332 iron-overloaded subjects correctly classified as having iron overload and 85 iron-overloaded subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron overload, leading to a 80% sensitivity. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 8.

Authors' Conclusions

At a threshold of 30 micrograms/L, there is low-certainty evidence that blood ferritin concentration is reasonably sensitive and a very specific test for iron deficiency in people presenting for medical care. There is very low certainty that high concentrations of ferritin provide a sensitive test for iron overload in people where this condition is suspected. There is insufficient evidence to know whether ferritin concentration performs similarly when screening asymptomatic people for iron deficiency or overload.

### Avoid using hemoglobin to evaluate patients for iron… [^11238wtk]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron depletion is a progressive process with anemia as the final phase. Thus, screening for iron deficiency using hemoglobin will only identify the most severe cases. Moreover, hemoglobin is not specific for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. Prevalence of iron deficiency in U. S. women ages 12 to 49 years rose from 11% in 2003 to 14. 8% in
2010. Pregnant women and young children are also high-risk groups and must be evaluated. Iron deficiency in U. S. toddlers, without anemia, is estimated at 6. 6% to
15. 2%. Serum ferritin is a measure of iron stores and is the most sensitive biomarker to test for early stages of iron deficiency as well as iron deficiency anemia. Sensitivity of ferritin test is 89% for diagnosis of iron depletion compared with hemoglobin, which is only 26%.

Moreover, a ferritin cut off of ≤ 30 ng/mL provides 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity for iron deficiency anemia and is the best screening test for this disorder. Evaluating patients for iron deficiency with ferritin will identify early stage iron deficiency and will potentially result in iron therapy, preventing iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia has been long associated with psychomotor and cognitive abnormalities but even iron deficiency without anemia has been related to negative neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant, and occasionally in inflammatory conditions, ferritin levels may be normal or elevated even in the presence of iron deficiency.

Additional laboratory tests accompanying clinical correlation are also helpful to determine iron deficiency.

### Ferroportin disease: pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^112ZNbPm]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis mainly includes the classic (HFE) and nonclassic (TfR2, HAMP, HJV and FPN1) forms of HH, all characterized by early and progressive increase of TS followed by elevation of serum ferritin as iron accumulation increases in parenchymal cells of the liver, pancreas, heart and other organs (Table 2). As discussed, unlike HH, in FD clinical expressivity is milder.

Abdominal MRI is a useful non-invasive tool to categorize and diagnose the disorder, as it can differentiate patients with FD, characterized by the SSL triad (spleen, spine, liver) iron retention (Figure 5B), from all other forms of HH, including FPN1-HC, associated with liver iron overload but normal spleen and bone marrow iron content (Figure 5D).

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114afHPN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of anemia in IBD patients

In humans, multiple factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, pregnancy, environment and nutrition, influence Hb levels. In general, the WHO defines anemia as a decline in blood Hb according to the reference levels given in Table 1. These cutoff levels apply equally to IBD patients, as the definitions do not vary according to comorbidities. Considering the high prevalence of anemia in chronic inflammatory diseases, the recently published European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) guideline on anemia recommends regular screening, according to disease severity and activity. More specifically, anemia assessment in outpatients with active inflammation (high elevated inflammatory biomarkers or significant endoscopic proof of disease activity) should be performed at least every three months, whereas screening intervals in outpatients who show few signs of systemic inflammation or are in remission can be extended to every six to twelve months. Special attention should be paid to children and adolescents. Common diagnostic markers for anemia assessment may be applied to patients without clinical, endoscopic or biochemical evidence of active disease. In contrast, in IBD patients who have active disease, are receiving ongoing therapy, or have undergone extensive small bowel resection, important parameters for the assessment of anemia, such as erythrocyte indices, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TfS), do not always afford sufficient accuracy. It should be remembered that ferritin is an acute-phase protein that is increased in the context of ongoing systemic inflammation. Furthermore, differentiation between the two most frequent types of anemia in IBD patients, ID and ACD, remains challenging, especially since both conditions frequently coexist.

Introduction: Hyperferritinemia is a key biomarker in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of life-threatening cytokine storms, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and hyperinflammatory conditions, as Still's disease (SD). However, marked ferritin elevation may also be caused by a wide variety of other complex pediatric conditions, which differential is essential in clinical care.

Objectives: To investigate the underlying etiology of markedly elevated ferritin levels in a tertiary-level pediatric center

Methods: Data of patients evaluated in our center from 2020 to 2024 with at least 1 value greater than 1000 ng/ml were retrospectively reviewed. For each episode of hyperferritinemia, the highest value of serum ferritin available was selected and concomitant other laboratory parameters were collected, together with demographic data, diagnosis and outcomes.

### Determination of an appropriate cut-off value for ferritin in the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^115S7Bie]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperferritinemia is a hallmark of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). In the HLH-2004 criteria, a ferritin value > 500 µg/L is considered positive. However, this level was not determined based on evidence. We compared 123 patients with HLH and 320 patients with other hyperferritinemic conditions, calculated a receiver-operating characteristic, and determined sensitivity and specificity for different values. At 2,000 µg/L a trade-off is reached with sensitivity at 70% and specificity at 68%. If familial HLH and virus-associated acquired HLH are analyzed separately, sensitivity and specificity are similar for this level. The results may guide a potential modification of the current HLH criteria.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1175qH98]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE) — Screening should be considered in all patients with abnormal AST/ALT levels and include an iron panel to determine transferrin saturation and serum ferritin; if the transferrin saturation is 45% or higher, or the serum ferritin is elevated, consideration should be given for HFE gene mutation analysis. Because ferritin is an acute phase reactant, an elevated ferritin in acute hepatitis likely does not indicate iron overload. The presence of a homozygous C282Y mutation confirms HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis, whereas compound C282Y/H63D heterozygotes rarely manifest chronic liver disease from iron overload. In patients with homozygous C282Y or compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D mutations who have elevated AST/ALT levels or ferritin > 1,000 μg/l, or in non-HFE hemochromatosis, liver biopsy should be considered to stage liver fibrosis and quantify hepatic iron overload to guide therapy.

### The unique aspects of presentation and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in adults [^111JJk46]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was initially described as an inflammatory condition affecting young children but is increasingly diagnosed in adults. Presenting features such as fever, cytopenias, phagocytosis, elevated ferritin, and increased levels of soluble IL-2 receptor are common in both age groups, but the prevalence of several clinical and biochemical criteria differ between pediatric and adult patients. Specifically, an elevated ferritin level does not have the same specificity for HLH in adults, and many other inflammatory conditions need to be considered in the differential. In contrast to the high incidence of infectious triggers seen in pediatric HLH, HLH in adults is often precipitated by a hematologic malignancy. Malignancy-associated HLH has unique manifestations and a uniformly very poor prognosis. Given these differences, diagnostic scoring systems unique to adult HLH have been proposed, and additional prognostic clinical and immunologic parameters are being explored. Although a genetic predisposition is increasingly found to underlie cases of adult-onset HLH, the mutations are less likely to be bi-allelic and differ slightly from those seen in pediatric cases of familial HLH. The facilitating genetic and environmental factors governing presentation of HLH in adults remain elusive. Understanding the clinical aspects and pathophysiology specific to adults with HLH is necessary to tailor therapies derived in pediatric disease to this under-recognized population.

### Hereditary haemochromatosis discovered after COVID-19 hospitalisation [^114PBkKs]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

COVID-19 infection and hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) have something in common; the disease course can be monitored with ferritin levels. Throughout the pandemic, physicians have looked for markers to help predict disease severity. Ferritin levels are commonly used to predict and monitor disease severity in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. While ferritin is elevated as part of the acute-phase reaction in response to infection, it can also be elevated due to iron overload. We report a case of undiagnosed, asymptomatic HH that was unveiled after COVID-19 infection via monitoring for resolution of ferritin levels that were found to be extremely elevated during a moderate COVID-19 infection. This diagnosis allowed the patient to initiate phlebotomy treatment before symptoms of HH arose.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates a substantial increase in the rate of iron deficiency diagnoses when ferritin cutoffs of 30 and 45 ng/mL, respectively, are chosen over 15 ng/mL. Our results provide an information base for health system–level evaluations of ferritin testing in primary care.

Diagnosis

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, which reflects an increase in hepatic iron content. HH can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers (TS, ferritin) are widely available, and the majority of patients with HH are now identified while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. There are certain high-risk groups that should be targeted for evaluation, such as those with a family history of HH, those with suspected organ involvement, and those with chance detection of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of the possibility of iron overload. It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function have iron studies done at some point in their evaluation. The algorithm outlined in Fig. 3 can provide some further direction regarding testing and is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

An algorithm can provide some further direction regarding testing and treatment for HH. The algorithm is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

The initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin (Table 7). TS is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to total iron-binding capacity. In some laboratories, the total iron-binding capacity is calculated from the sum of the serum iron and the unsaturated iron-binding capacity, whereas in others, it is calculated indirectly from the transferrin concentration in the serum. A recent study, using fasting samples, has shown no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes. Accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Over the years, different studies have used a variety of cutoff values for TS to identify patients eligible for further testing. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values. Thus, using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, and these cases will require further evaluation.

### Diagnostic challenges in pediatric hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^115eYoHP]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of severe immune dysregulation that encompasses a broad range of underlying genetic diseases and infectious triggers. Monogenic conditions, autoimmune diseases, and infections can all drive the phenotype of HLH and associated immune hyperactivation with hypercytokinemia. A diagnosis of HLH usually requires a combination of clinical and laboratory findings; there is no single sensitive and specific diagnostic test, which often leads to "diagnostic dilemmas" and delays in treatment initiation. Ferritin levels, one of the most commonly used screening tests, were collected across a large tertiary care pediatric hospital to identify the positive predictive value for HLH. Herein, we present several cases that illustrate the clinical challenges of confirming an HLH diagnosis. Additionally, we report on the utility of establishing a formal multi-disciplinary group to aid the prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with HLH-like pathophysiologies.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. Whilst low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be due to multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. The investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not dealt with however and is the subject of a separate guideline.

### Hyperferritinemia screening to aid identification and differentiation of patients with hyperinflammatory disorders [^115cEzzf]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

The ferritin alert system also facilitated longitudinal assessment of patients with chronic hyperferritinemia, enabling an anecdotal assessment of the utility of biomarker trends. We found that intermittent assessment of IL-18 over a patient's clinical course was a useful residual disease activity marker, with elevation showing active or imminent flares and improvement/normalization predicting durable response (or lack thereof) to treatment (Figure S1). Thus, IL-18 may be useful both diagnostically and in assessing minimal residual disease activity in Stills disease.

In this study, IHF detection did not trigger any specific clinical intervention and members of the IHF screen review team did intervene with screened patients (other than to seek informed consent) based on alerts. Preliminary evidence suggests earlier involvement of HLH/cytokine storm specialists may improve patient outcomes. This aligns with our anecdotal clinical experience and recent international consensus guidance efforts in highlighting the likely utility of ferritin in sepsis order sets and institutional HLH/MAS response teams/pathways.

Multi-analyte panels typically use the same sample dilution for all analytes measured, rendering both antibody- and aptamer-based platforms susceptible to hidden hook effects, particularly at analyte levels above what assay developers might encounter in healthy and common disease controls. In a 96-plex "immuno-oncology" assay of 80 curated serum samples, our "positive control" analyte (IL-18) failed to distinguish Stills patients. Given prior experience, we suspected and subsequently identified a strong hook effect at high total IL-18 concentrations. We found similar hook effects for very high total IL-18 and CXCL9 levels in separate cohorts containing Stills and HLH patients. Though we did not observe a "hook effect" for CXCL9 or IL-18BP in an aptamer-based assay, the scarcity of very high CXCL9 or IL-18BP levels in that cohort precludes making any generalizations. These observations suggest that "proteomic" multi-analyte panels carry significant Type II error, and investigators should be cautious making any "failure to detect" conclusions from such data without proper controls.

### Hyperferritinemia screening to aid identification and differentiation of patients with hyperinflammatory disorders [^112Ds4Sa]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis constituted a high proportion of alerts from the main study in Pittsburgh, whereas sepsis was the cause of IHF in only one patient from the CCHMC study. This likely represents local ordering practices, as there is long-standing institutional interest in hyperferritinemic sepsis in Pittsburgh, and ferritin is only ordered when requested or as part of a clinical pathway at CCHMC. By contrast, the CCHMC screen identified IHF in a high proportion of MIS-C patients, where ferritin was part of an order set. Though the Pittsburgh and CCHMC screen occurred at different time points, ferritin ordering practice bias remains a large contributor to the patients and subsequently diseases identified in the screens. Ferritin > 1000 was observed in ~ 10% of pediatric sepsis patients at early timepoints in the PHENOtyping sepsis‐induced Multiple organ failure Study (PHENOMS) study, and we suspect institutional ferritin ordering practices explain the different rates of IHF in sepsis between institutions. Thus, institutional ferritin ordering practices will influence the patients identified and ultimately any samples collected.

Overall, our findings reinforce the reality that the readily-available components of the HLH/MAS classification criteria lack specificity for underlying/driving diagnoses. Rheumatologic (Stills) patients had slightly higher mean ferritin values and trends toward less coagulopathy (higher platelet and fibrinogen levels) than the other two subgroups, consistent with prior literature, but these findings appeared too non-specific to be of significant clinical utility in distinguishing causes of IHF and suffer from type 2 error given differences in ordering. Patients with "immune dysregulation" had lower maximum CRP levels, possibly reflecting differences in underlying inflammatory processes. As such, we measured total IL-18, IL-18BP, and CXCL9, grouped together because their degree of elevation in these diseases requires a high dilution. Consistent with prior retrospective data, and growing clinical experience, significantly elevated total IL-18 and a high IL-18/CXCL9 ratio distinguished hyperferritinemic Stills patients from the other two IHF subgroups. As CXCL9 did not significantly differ between groups, the utility of this ratio is largely driven by IL-18 levels. We observed slightly lower IL-18BP levels in Stills versus "immune dysregulation". IL-18BP and CXCL9 are both biomarkers of Interferon (IFN, particularly IFN-γ) and, this finding corroborates previous findings of relatively lower CXCL9 and sIL-2Ra in Stills/MAS patients when compared to primary HLH patients.

### Causes of ferritin elevation… [^114fuicn]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

In Reply Dr Lippi raises the important point that an elevated serum ferritin level may also be associated with underlying malignancy; it is true that ferritin may be elevated in a broad variety of other disease processes, as we noted in our JAMA Diagnostic Test Interpretation article. Elevated serum ferritin levels are commonly encountered in general practice and many elevations may be due to non–iron overload conditions. The patient described was a relatively healthy middle-aged man who was unexpectedly noted to have a markedly elevated ferritin level. The cited investigation by Moore et al1 retrospectively studied the underlying etiology of markedly elevated serum ferritin levels in a large group of patients at a tertiary care medical center, including patients with a range of cancers, infections, inflammatory conditions, and renal diseases. 1 This study population is distinctly different from the relatively healthy patient described in our article.

### Perturbed iron biology in the prefrontal cortex of people with schizophrenia [^111V82AR]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

To probe if differential patterns of iron-dependent ferritin accumulation affected disease risk, we performed a series of logistic regression analyses using sequential iron cutoffs, each examining the OR of a schizophrenia diagnosis attributed to a 1 SD increase in covariate-adjusted ferritin (Figure S12b, Table S38). As the OR was farthest from 1 when the analysis included only individuals with iron levels below the control group's mean (Fig. 3b), this value was selected as a cutoff for generating low-iron and high-iron subcohorts. While in the low-iron cohort the probability of having been diagnosed with schizophrenia markedly decreased as PFC ferritin rose (OR = 0.284 [95%CI 0.139 to 0.578]), in the high-iron subcohort ferritin did not predict an individual's disease status (Fig. 3c, Table S39). Mirroring the prediction models, the difference in covariate-adjusted ferritin between cases and controls was large in the low-iron subcohort (−0.96 [95%CI −1.46 to −0.47] SDs), yet minimal (-0.17 [95%CI ‒0.67 to 0.33] SDs) in the high-iron subcohort (Fig. 3d, Table S40). Extending our previous findings indicating that elevated iron in young adulthood predicted disease status, these data reveal that even in the context of low prefrontal iron, a deficiency in iron's protective storage protein markedly increased the risk for a schizophrenia diagnosis.

### Elevated serum ferritin level with cataract of spectacular morphology: hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome [^115BpUcW]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome, characterized by high serum ferritin concentration and cataracts in early life, remains a less-known rare disease, with fewer than 100 families reported worldwide. Though benign, high ferritin levels frequently result in misdiagnosis with iron storage disease, and patients can be exposed to unnecessary, even invasive, evaluation and treatment procedures. The presence of cataract together with isolated serum ferritin elevation should alert clinicians to consider this syndrome. We herein present a new family with hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome to increase clinical awareness.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^112PDk3f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — hereditary hemochromatosis diagnostic evaluation and management emphasize that the increasing use of noninvasive tests such as MRI T2✱ has made quantification of hepatic iron deposition easier and eliminated the need for liver biopsy in most patients, and that serum ferritin of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis remains an important diagnostic test to identify patients with a low risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and should be used routinely as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Genetic testing for other types of HH is available but is expensive and generally not useful in most clinical settings. Serum ferritin may be elevated among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in those with alcoholic liver disease, and these diagnoses are more common than HH among patients with elevated serum ferritin who are not C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes, so a secondary cause for liver disease should be excluded among patients with suspected iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy, although emerging novel therapies such as new chelating agents may have a role for selected patients.

The current clinical scenario

Unlike in the past, fully expressed and potentially lethal HC (with liver cirrhosis, diabetes, endocrine dysfunction, and heart failure) is seen rarely in current clinical practice. This can be ascribed to increased awareness of the disease and, mostly, to the routine assessment of iron biomarkers, particularly serum ferritin. Unfortunately, this is counterbalanced by an increased diagnostic challenge for nonexperts in the iron field, primarily due to the lack of specificity of ferritin.

Ferritin is an essentially intracellular protein that serves to store iron safely. It is also present at very low concentrations (micrograms per liter) in serum, likely through secretion by macrophages. Normal values usually range from 30 to 200 µg/L or 300 µg/L in females and males, respectively. The function of secreted extracellular ferritin remains largely unknown. Several common conditions lead to increased serum ferritin levels, including virtually all inflammatory disorders, hepatic cytolysis (eg, during acute or chronic liver disease), or metabolic syndrome. This translates into a huge number of consultations, overuse of the "first-level" genetic test looking for the presence of the common variants in the HFE gene, and even misdiagnosis due to incorrect interpretation of the results.

The glycoprotein transferrin is the extracellular carrier of iron that is detectable at high concentrations in blood (grams per liter; the third most abundant protein after albumin). Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is calculated as the ratio between serum iron and transferrin (multiplied by the correction factor 1.42) or, less reliably, between serum iron and total iron-binding capacity and expressed as a percentage. TSAT is much less requested in clinical practice but is much more informative about a possible diagnosis of HC. Normal TSAT varies between 20% and 45%. It has been estimated that hyperferritinemia with normal TSAT is associated with increased iron stores in less than 10% of cases. Importantly, TSAT elevation is the hallmark of HC. In HC patients, high TSAT reflects the increased pool of circulating iron due to insufficient hepcidin production and typically precedes the rise of serum ferritin by several years.TSAT tends to remain elevated even in subjects effectively iron-depleted by phlebotomies. Occasional reports of normal TSAT in p. Cys282Tyr homozygotes with hyperferritinemia should always prompt the search for additional cofactors that raise ferritin, such as metabolic syndrome or alcohol intake.

### Raised serum ferritin concentration in hereditary hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome is not a marker for iron overload [^117WtSEW]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

There are other causes of hyperferritinemia without evidence of iron overload, including alcohol abuse, obesity, inflammation, and occult malignancy. In those without these causes who are not homozygous for HFE p.(C282Y), a strong case can be made for ophthalmological investigation and screening for mutations in SLC40A1 and the IRE of FTL. Clearly, an awareness of the existence of HHCS is essential but, until consensus guidelines covering this scenario are developed, screening as outlined above will avoid misdiagnosis of the syndrome and so prevent unnecessary liver biopsy and the consequences of unwarranted treatment.

### Highly elevated ferritin levels and the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^115uUrMs]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially lethal condition characterized by a pathologic inflammation. The diagnostic criteria for HLH include fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, abnormal natural killer cell (NK cell) functional assay, elevated soluble IL-2Ralpha level, and elevated ferritin level (> 500 microg/L). Institution of timely therapy in these critically ill patients may be delayed by difficulties establishing the diagnosis. NK cell functional assay and soluble IL-2Ralpha level may require send-out to a specialized lab. However, ferritin level is available on a same-day basis at most institutions. In this study, we examined the utility of quantitative ferritin levels in diagnosing HLH.

Procedure

All patients with ferritin values > 500 microg/L obtained at Texas Children's Hospital between January 10, 2003 and January 10, 2005 were identified. Patient charts were reviewed for ferritin levels and hospital course.

Results

During the study interval, 330 patients had ferritin levels > 500 microg/L. Ten of the 330 patients were diagnosed with HLH. A ferritin level over 10,000 microg/L was 90% sensitive and 96% specific for HLH. Another diagnostic category with significantly elevated ferritin level was illness of unknown cause (n = 10), and only two of these patients were fully evaluated for HLH.

Conclusions

Ferritin levels above 10,000 microg/L appear to be specific and sensitive for HLH. In patients without a significant medical history and a new onset of febrile illness with highly elevated ferritin levels, the diagnosis of HLH should be evaluated.

### Ferritin, fever, and frequent visits: hyperferritinemic syndromes in the emergency department [^114pC5PW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as persistent fevers without an identifiable cause despite extensive medical workup. Emergency physicians caring for patients reporting a persistent, nonspecific, febrile illness should carefully consider potentially serious non-infectious causes of FUO. We present a case of a 35-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) three times over a 10-day period for persistent febrile illness and was ultimately diagnosed with Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD) after a serum ferritin level was found to be over 42,000 μg/L. AOSD, along with macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock comprise the four hyperferritinemic syndromes. These are potentially life-threatening febrile illnesses that characteristically present with elevated ferritin levels. In this article, we highlight the value of a serum ferritin level in the workup of a patient with prolonged febrile illness and its utility in facilitating early diagnosis and prompt treatment of hyperferritinemic syndromes in the ED.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^111PUHMg]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods: The dominant clinical and laboratory finding is hyperinflammation (expressed by the elevation of CRP, serum amyloid A, ferritin…), which after excluding infectious, metabolic and paraneoplastic causes, leads to the indication of genetic testing focused on autoinflammatory diseases with confirmation of the IFIH1 gene mutation: NM_022168.4 c.1806A > Tp.E602D. Mutation in this gene is typical for Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome type 7 (AGS7).

Results: Based on the international EULAR/ACR recommendations for the treatment of diseases from the type I interferonopathy spectrum, the patient was treated with a non-selective Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) – baricitinib (dose 4 mg/kg/per day), with a significant effect especially on the neurological condition and thus improving the patient's quality of life.

Conclusion: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) belongs to the spectrum of rare primary immunodeficiencies. In the context of differential diagnosis, it is important to exclude other causes of hyperinflammation. Genetic testing is essential for the final diagnosis.

Despite the severity of the disease, early confirmation of the diagnosis and targeted treatment leads to an improvement in neurological symptomatology and the management of often fatal hyperinflammation. Consent to published had been obtained.

### The role of liver biopsy in the workup of liver dysfunction late after SCT: is the role of iron overload underestimated? [^116aX6oL]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in liver function tests are common in hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) recipients. We retrospectively investigated the role of liver biopsy in determining the cause of elevated liver enzymes and its impact on the management of patients in the post-HSCT setting. A total of 24 consecutive liver biopsies were obtained from 20 patients from September 2003 to December 2007. A definite histopathologic diagnosis was obtained in 91.7% of the biopsies. Iron overload (IO) was found in 75% and GVHD in 54.2% of the patients. The initial clinical diagnosis of GVHD was confirmed in 56.5% and refuted in 43.5% of the allogeneic HSCT recipients. The median number of post transplant transfusions, percent transferrin saturation and ferritin levels were found to be higher in patients who had histologically proven hepatic IO (p1 = 0.007, p2 = 0.003 and p3 = 0.009, respectively). Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between serum ferritin levels and histological grade of iron in the hepatocytes. Our data suggest that hepatic IO is a frequent finding in the post-HSCT setting, which contributes to hepatic dysfunction and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis, particularly in patients with high serum ferritin levels.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116NsNUx]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA iron deficiency anemia diagnosis — In patients with anemia, the AGA recommends using a cutoff of 45 ng/mL over 15 ng/mL when using ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency, and in patients with inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, other laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein, transferrin saturation, or soluble transferrin saturation, may be needed in conjunction with ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111CX2fR]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using a transferrin saturation < 20% and a normal or elevated ferritin level to define functional iron deficiency in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD or maintained on peritoneal dialysis and in those receiving hemodialysis. Recognize that normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

### A case of incomplete Kawasaki disease with extremely high serum ferritin and interleukin-18 levels [^114MFgdL]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, patients with sJIA generally have high serum IL-18 and ferritin levels. This was a case of incomplete KD with extremely high serum levels of IL-18 and ferritin, although KD patients with coronary artery lesions have been reported to have mild IL-18 elevations. Serum cytokines and ferritin are often used for the differential diagnosis of KD and sJIA. However, we should need to recognize the existence of KD in patients with high serum IL-18 and ferritin levels. Further studies are needed about the novel biomarkers to clearly distinguish sJIA from KD at an early phase of the disease progression.

### Clinical manifestations but not cytokine profiles differentiate adult-onset Still's disease and sepsis [^112rUooH]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze clinical manifestations, serum ferritin, and serum cytokine levels in patients with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) or bacterial sepsis and to evaluate their potential use for differential diagnosis.

Methods

Twenty-two consecutive patients with the first flare of AOSD and 6 patients with an established diagnosis of AOSD under immunosuppressive therapy were compared with 14 patients with bacterial sepsis. Clinical manifestations were scored in a Pouchot AOSD activity score including elevated serum ferritin levels to obtain a modified Pouchot score. Serum cytokine profiles were analyzed from each patient.

Results

The scores of clinical manifestations using a modified Pouchot activity score were significantly higher in patients with active untreated AOSD (mean 5.60 ± 1.93) compared with patients with chronic AOSD (mean 1.16 ± 0.98; p < 0.001) and patients with sepsis (mean 2.38 ± 1.19; p < 0.001). A modified Pouchot score ≥ 4 shows a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 93% for active AOSD. Serum cytokine levels of interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and calprotectin were elevated in acute AOSD and sepsis. Significant differences were detected only in patients with sepsis who had higher levels of IL-6 and IL-8. The overlap of the 2 groups limits the use of cytokines for differential diagnosis in individual patients.

Conclusion

A modified Pouchot AOSD activity score including elevated serum ferritin levels was more useful to confirm the diagnosis of AOSD compared to patients with sepsis. Elevated serum cytokines correlate with inflammation but are of limited use to differentiate between active AOSD and bacterial sepsis.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^114G1cVV]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1114iczj]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — liver biopsy indications and ferritin-based risk in C282Y homozygotes: Serum ferritin helps triage biopsy; "Several studies have demonstrated that C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin > 1000 μg/L are at an increased risk of cirrhosis, with a prevalence of 20%-45%". In contrast, "fewer than 2% of C282Y homozygotes with a ferritin level < 1000 μg/L at the time of diagnosis has cirrhosis or bridging fibrosis". A study of "more than 670 asymptomatic C282Y homozygotes" performed biopsy "in 350 subjects" (cutoff "500 μg/L"), with cirrhosis "in 5.6% of all males and 1.9% of all females", and "All subjects with cirrhosis had a hepatic iron concentration (HIC) > 200 μmol/g of weight". Diagnostic performance showed "A serum ferritin level > 1000 μg/L had 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity for identification of cirrhosis", and "No subject with a serum ferritin level < 1000 μg/L had cirrhosis". Accordingly, "liver biopsy does not need to be performed when ferritin is < 1000 μg/L, in the absence of excess alcohol consumption and elevated serum liver enzymes". For non-C282Y homozygotes, "Patients with elevated serum iron studies, but who lack C282Y homozygosity, should be considered for liver biopsy if they have elevated liver enzymes or other clinical evidence of liver disease".

### Early detection of type 1 haemochromatosis: a case of normal ferritin levels with elevated transferrin saturation [^115oKwcQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Haemochromatosis is marked by excessive iron accumulation leading to damage to various organs. Although haemochromatosis dates to 1865, diagnosing the condition remains challenging due to its non-specific symptoms and due to its quiescent course, it often leads to significant delay in recognition. A woman in her 50s who presented with arthralgia was found to have raised transferrin saturation with normal ferritin. She underwent human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE) genetic screening test which showed H63D type 1 haemochromatosis. This report aims to draw attention to the pitfalls in diagnosing haemochromatosis as normal ferritin does not exclude hereditary haemochromatosis.

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^1145jGej]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The other biomarkers studied by the authors demonstrated inferior diagnostic performance compared to ferritin except for transferrin in females. Multivariate logistic regression models including these biomarkers did not improve the prediction of low or absent bone marrow iron stores over ferritin alone.

The clinical implications of the current study are important. The high specificity of ferritin at the 30 μg/L cutoff suggests that it can be a reliable marker for ruling in low or absent iron stores in patients with a high pretest probability of the condition. However, the low sensitivity indicates that clinicians should be cautious in ruling out low or absent iron stores based solely on ferritin levels, particularly in patients with conditions that can elevate ferritin, such as inflammation or liver disease. In such cases, additional diagnostic tests or clinical judgment may be necessary to accurately diagnose low or absent iron stores. We cannot emphasize too strongly that bone marrow aspirate with iron staining is often necessary, as the finding of absent iron necessitates an evaluation that may uncover a gastrointestinal or genitourinary malignance at an early, curable stage.

The reliability of the bone marrow iron determination depends on the adequacy of the specimen including the presence of spicules in the aspirate, and it would have been good to have specific comments about these factors in this study. In addition, it would have been good to provide their analysis based on the classical definition of iron deficiency, which is absence of stainable iron in an adequate bone marrow aspirate. The retrospective design and single institution character of the study are offset by the very impressive sample size.

In conclusion, this study reinforces the importance of ferritin as the primary biomarker for diagnosing iron deficiency, while also highlighting its limitations in terms of sensitivity. Clinicians should consider these findings when interpreting laboratory measures of iron status, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions. Importantly, the presence of a normal or elevated serum ferritin does not negate the potential need for a bone marrow aspirate to assess potential metabolic or malignant conditions that may present with iron deficiency.

### Natural history of recessive inheritance of DMT1 mutations [^117TR7QE]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

DMT1 deficiency causes microcytic hypochromic anemia due to decreased erythroid iron utilization. Anemia is present from birth. Transferrin saturation is high and serum ferritin is mildly elevated, despite liver iron overload. DMT1 deficiency must be considered in the differential diagnosis of microcytic hypochromic anemia observed in the newborn period.

### Consensus statement on the definition and classification of metabolic hyperferritinaemia [^112Duo42]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, MHF-CG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider defining the condition of hyperferritinemia related to metabolic dysfunction as metabolic hyperferritinemia. Consider grading the severity of metabolic hyperferritinemia according to serum levels of ferritin thresholds (grades 1–3).

### Diagnosis and therapy of genetic haemochromatosis (review and 2017 update) [^114WENZT]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for hereditary hemochromatosis, more specifically with respect to liver biopsy, BSH 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing a liver biopsy in patients with HFE hemochromatosis, serum ferritin > 1,000 mcg/L and/or elevated transaminases to assess the severity of fibrosis. Consider using transient elastography to select which patients from this group require a liver biopsy.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111nsCNv]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis (HH) — genetic prevalence and clinical penetrance are characterized by C282Y homozygosity seen in approximately one in 250 Caucasians, with fully expressed disease with end-organ manifestations in fewer than 10% of these individuals, and full clinical manifestations seen approximately one in 2500. The heterozygote genotype (C282Y/wild type) is found in approximately one in 10 individuals and may be associated with elevated serum iron markers, but without associated tissue iron overload or damage. Approximately 75% did not have symptoms and did not exhibit any of the end-stage manifestations of the disease when identified in this way, and in large population screening studies only approximately 70% of C282Y homozygotes are found to have an elevated ferritin level; more men than women have increased ferritin levels.

### Marked hyperferritinemia does not predict for HLH in the adult population [^113FLwbk]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare syndrome of uncontrolled immune activation that has gained increasing attention during the last decade. The diagnosis of HLH is based on a constellation of clinical and laboratory abnormalities, including elevated serum ferritin levels. In the pediatric population, marked hyperferritinemia is specific for HLH. To determine what conditions are associated with profoundly elevated ferritin in the adult population, we performed a retrospective analysis in a large academic health care system. We identified 113 patients with serum ferritin levels higher than 50,000 µg/L. The most frequently observed conditions included renal failure, hepatocellular injury, infections, and hematologic malignancies. Our results suggest that marked hyperferritinemia can be seen in a variety of conditions and is not specific for HLH in adults.
