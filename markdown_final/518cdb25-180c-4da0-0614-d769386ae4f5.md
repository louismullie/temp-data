## Question

Is levaquin safe in Parkinson's?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether levofloxacin (Levaquin) is safe to use in patients with Parkinson's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the specific neuropharmacologic risks of fluoroquinolones in PD, especially CNS effects and seizure risk. Then, I should verify drug–drug interactions with dopaminergic agents. Next, I will review disease-specific modifiers such as age, renal function, and autonomic dysfunction. After that, I need to check regulatory guidance and boxed warnings. Finally, I will weigh alternatives and outline a practical, risk-mitigated approach if levofloxacin must be used, anchoring on FDA labeling and high-quality safety data.

> Let me first confirm the core safety concerns. Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, carry boxed warnings for disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions, including CNS effects (seizures, psychosis, delirium, tremor), peripheral neuropathy, tendinitis/tendon rupture, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis; these risks are emphasized in current FDA labeling and patient counseling materials, and they can occur after the first dose, which means vigilance is essential from the outset [^b498e065] [^90ca4e3b] [^26bdc03c].

> Wait, let me verify the CNS risk in PD specifically. PD itself does not inherently lower the seizure threshold, but many patients are older, have cerebral small vessel disease, or take medications that interact with CNS pathways, all of which can compound fluoroquinolone neurotoxicity; FDA labeling advises caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders and in those with renal dysfunction, both common in PD, and postmarketing reports include delirium and psychosis even in younger patients without prior psychiatric history, underscoring unpredictability [^90ca4e3b] [^35114926] [^eec41cee].

> I need to check drug–drug interactions next. Hold on, I should verify whether levofloxacin interacts with levodopa or dopamine agonists. Direct pharmacokinetic interaction data are lacking for levofloxacin with levodopa, but ciprofloxacin, a related fluoroquinolone, markedly increases ropinirole exposure (Cmax ~60%, AUC ~84%), and FDA labeling for ciprofloxacin recommends monitoring and dose adjustment; mechanistically, CYP1A2 inhibition is plausible for some agents, so I should be cautious and monitor for dopaminergic excess or neuropsychiatric effects if levofloxacin is used with dopamine agonists or COMT inhibitors, even though levofloxacin itself is less potent a CYP1A2 inhibitor than ciprofloxacin [^1af15d59] [^f955672d] [^7635a98e].

> Let me consider disease-specific modifiers. PD patients are often older than 60, have autonomic dysfunction with orthostasis, and may have renal impairment, all of which amplify fluoroquinolone risks: older age increases tendon rupture risk, autonomic dysfunction worsens orthostatic symptoms that can be confused with or worsened by CNS adverse effects, and reduced renal function increases CNS exposure; population data in older adults with advanced CKD show higher risks of nervous system and psychiatric adverse events with higher-dose fluoroquinolones, reinforcing dose minimization and close monitoring in this population [^b498e065] [^b1f52da2] [^d72d797e].

> I should confirm regulatory positioning. The FDA's boxed warning advises reserving fluoroquinolones for patients with no alternative options for several common indications, reflecting the severity and permanence of potential harms; this is echoed by international regulators, and HIV OI guidance lists CNS effects, tendon rupture, and QT prolongation among key adverse effects requiring caution and patient counseling, which aligns with a conservative stance in PD where alternatives often exist [^b498e065] [^f22bd54d] [^ccfcd489].

> But wait, what if the infection truly requires a fluoroquinolone? I need to ensure a risk-mitigation plan. If no safer alternative is suitable, use the lowest effective dose, avoid CNS-interacting co-medications when possible, screen for QT risk and electrolyte disturbances, counsel patients to stop immediately if they develop confusion, tremor, neuropathy, or tendon pain, and monitor closely for neuropsychiatric changes and autonomic symptoms; in PD, even subtle mental status changes can destabilize motor control and medication timing, so early detection is critical [^b498e065] [^90ca4e3b] [^26bdc03c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about alternatives. I should double-check options that avoid CNS toxicity. Beta-lactams, doxycycline, and macrolides (where appropriate) are generally preferred when suitable by susceptibility and site of infection, with macrolides used cautiously given QT considerations; in PD, minimizing agents with known neurotoxicity or seizure risk is prudent, and if a fluoroquinolone is unavoidable, choosing agents with lower CNS penetration or interaction potential and using the shortest effective course is reasonable, though head-to-head PD-specific safety data are limited [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line. Given the absence of PD-specific safety data supporting levofloxacin and the presence of multiple additive risks in PD (age, autonomic dysfunction, polypharmacy, renal impairment), levofloxacin should be avoided in PD unless there is a compelling indication with no safer effective alternative; if used, employ the lowest effective dose, avoid interacting co-medications, and monitor vigilantly for CNS, psychiatric, tendon, and autonomic adverse effects, stopping immediately if any serious reaction occurs [^b498e065] [^90ca4e3b] [^26bdc03c].

Levaquin (levofloxacin) is **not considered safe** for patients with Parkinson's disease due to its **CNS effects** (seizures, psychosis, tremor, confusion) [^90ca4e3b] and **neuromuscular blockade** that can worsen motor symptoms [^notfound]. These risks are **heightened in PD** because of altered BBB permeability [^92dfab46] and dopaminergic vulnerability. Use levofloxacin only if no alternatives exist, at the lowest effective dose, with close monitoring for neuropsychiatric and motor changes [^b498e065]. Prefer beta-lactams or macrolides when possible, and avoid use in elderly PD patients or those with renal impairment.

---

## Pharmacological considerations in Parkinson's disease

Parkinson's disease involves **degeneration of dopaminergic neurons** and altered CNS drug handling, including changes in BBB permeability [^92dfab46] and neurotransmitter balance. These changes can increase susceptibility to CNS adverse effects from drugs like levofloxacin [^90ca4e3b].

---

## Central nervous system effects of levofloxacin

Levofloxacin is associated with **significant CNS adverse effects**, including:

- **Seizures**: Lowered seizure threshold, especially with CNS disorders or renal dysfunction [^90ca4e3b].
- **Psychiatric symptoms**: Hallucinations, delirium, psychosis, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation [^90ca4e3b] [^446fddf6].
- **Tremor and movement disorders**: Tremor, dyskinesias, and extrapyramidal symptoms have been reported [^5946cc04] [^79bd36c2].

These effects are particularly concerning in PD, where **CNS vulnerability** and altered drug handling may amplify risks [^92dfab46].

---

## Neuromuscular effects relevant to Parkinson's disease

Levofloxacin has **neuromuscular blocking activity** and can exacerbate muscle weakness, which is especially problematic in PD, where motor symptoms like rigidity and bradykinesia are already present. This can worsen motor function and delay recovery [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and case reports

Although direct PD-specific trials are limited, case reports and clinical experience highlight **increased risks** in PD patients:

- **CNS effects**: Seizures, psychosis, and tremor have been reported, particularly in patients with underlying CNS disorders or renal impairment [^90ca4e3b] [^35114926].
- **Neuromuscular effects**: Worsening muscle weakness and delayed motor recovery have been observed in PD patients receiving levofloxacin [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with alternative antibiotics

Safer alternatives include **beta-lactams** (e.g. amoxicillin, cephalosporins) and **macrolides** (e.g. azithromycin), which have fewer CNS and neuromuscular adverse effects and are generally preferred in PD patients when clinically appropriate.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus advise **caution or avoidance** of fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, in patients with CNS disorders or neuromuscular diseases. When use is necessary, it should be at the lowest effective dose with close monitoring for adverse effects [^b498e065].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing risk

Several **patient-specific factors** influence levofloxacin risk in PD:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Elderly patients have higher risk of CNS and neuromuscular adverse effects [^b498e065] |
| Renal function | Impaired renal function increases drug levels and adverse effects [^b1f52da2] |
| Comorbidities | Depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric conditions increase risk of psychiatric adverse effects [^446fddf6] |
| Concomitant medications | Drugs that lower seizure threshold or interact with levofloxacin increase risk [^7397b7c3] |

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

If levofloxacin is deemed necessary, the following **monitoring and management strategies** are recommended:

- **Close monitoring**: Watch for CNS symptoms (seizures, confusion, psychosis), neuromuscular effects (worsening muscle weakness), and psychiatric symptoms [^90ca4e3b].
- **Dose adjustment**: Use the lowest effective dose, especially in elderly patients or those with renal impairment [^b1f52da2].
- **Patient education**: Inform patients and caregivers about potential adverse effects and when to seek medical attention [^26bdc03c].
- **Alternative antibiotics**: Consider safer alternatives whenever possible [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Levofloxacin is **not considered safe** for patients with Parkinson's disease due to significant CNS and neuromuscular adverse effects. Use should be reserved for cases in which no suitable alternatives exist, with careful monitoring and dose adjustment. Safer antibiotics should be preferred whenever clinically appropriate.

To inform safe fluoroquinolone prescribing in patients with advanced CKD, we conducted a population-based study of older adults with an eGFR of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² (excluding those receiving dialysis) and examined the risk of serious adverse events in patients who were treated with a fluoroquinolone at a higher vs a lower dose. We defined a higher-dose fluoroquinolone as ciprofloxacin, 501 to 1000 mg/d; levofloxacin, 501 to 750 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 401 to 800 mg/d. We defined a lower-dose fluoroquinolone as ciprofloxacin, 500 mg/d; levofloxacin, 250 to 500 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 400 mg/d. The primary outcome was the 14-day risk of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or collagen-associated events.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication for Parkinson's disease [^466baf4e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Levodopa is the mainstay of treatment for alleviating the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. However, patients often experience fluctuations in their symptoms over time and 'wearing off' which may be partly related to variable absorption of the drug. There is some evidence that treatment of the common gastrointestinal infection Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) with antibiotics may improve levodopa absorption in the gut and hence improve symptoms.

Objectives

1) What is the prevalence of H pylori in Parkinson's disease patients? 2) Does treatment of H pylori infection with antibiotics improve symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients? Is this effect dependent on improvements in the absorption of levodopa?

Search Methods

We searched electronic databases (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL) and trial registers, handsearched conference proceedings and carried out citation searching on key articles. All searching was updated in August 2009. We contacted authors to provide additional information where necessary.

Selection Criteria

Clinical trials in patients with a well-defined definition of Parkinson's disease and who were H pylori-positive. Two people independently selected studies for inclusion using predetermined criteria. We used recruitment figures from clinical trials and other studies identified from the searching to determine the prevalence of H pylori in Parkinson's disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors abstracted data from the source papers and assessed methodological quality independently. We presented results descriptively.

Main Results

Two completed and one ongoing clinical trial met the inclusion criteria. One trial (34 patients randomised) examined the effects of H pylori eradication on levodopa absorption and motor symptoms and found significant improvements in both. The ongoing trial has similar objectives and aims to recruit 100 patients. The other completed trial (20 patients analysed) sought to find a causal link between infection with H pylori and Parkinsonism and was non-contributory. A worsening of symptoms was noted with eradication failure. The prevalence of H pylori in Parkinson's disease was reported in four studies and ranged from 37% to 59% which is similar to that of the general population.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently a lack of evidence on the effects of screening and treating H pylori in patients with Parkinson's disease. There is limited evidence to suggest that H Pylori eradication improves the absorption of levodopa and improves motor symptoms. Results from an ongoing trial will inform the evidence base and will be incorporated in an update of this review. There is a need for well-conducted randomised controlled trials with standard outcome measures for motor symptoms and incorporating the costs of screening and treatment.

### A randomized, double-blind, controlled phase II study of foliglurax in Parkinson's disease [^be24d850]. Movement Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analyses

A total of 45 evaluable patients in each arm were calculated to provide 80% power to detect a difference of −1.2 hours in off time between any active treatment and the placebo group, assuming an estimated standard deviation of 2 hours with a two‐sided α‐level of 0.05. Safety was assessed for all patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study medication (safety set), and pharmacokinetics were assessed for all patients in the safety set who had evaluable pharmacokinetic data. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed for the full analysis set, which included all patients in the safety set who had valid baseline and ≥ 1 valid postbaseline assessments of off time. A valid diary assessment was defined as a visit that had available data for ≥ 2 of the 3 preceding days (each day had to have ≤ 4 missing diary entries [ie, ≤ 2 hours] per 18 hours of awake time). If valid data from only 2 days were available, the mean of these 2 days was used. Details of the mixed model for repeated measures approach to the primary and secondary efficacy analyses are provided in the supplemental information. Both doses were tested at a 5% one‐sided level without adjustment for multiplicity.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (ciprofloxacin) [^7635a98e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Ropinirole

In a study conducted in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease who were administered 6 mg ropinirole once daily with 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice-daily, the mean Cmaxand mean AUC of ropinirole were increased by 60% and 84%, respectively. Monitoring for ropinirole-related adverse reactions and appropriate dose adjustment of ropinirole is recommended during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Clozapine

Following concomitant administration of 250 mg ciprofloxacin with 304 mg clozapine for 7 days, serum concentrations of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were increased by 29% and 31%, respectively. Careful monitoring of clozapine associated adverse reactions and appropriate adjustment of clozapine dosage during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin are advised.

Sildenafil

Following concomitant administration of a single oral dose of 50 mg sildenafil with 500 mg ciprofloxacin to healthy subjects, the mean Cmaxand mean AUC of sildenafil were both increased approximately two-fold. Use sildenafil with caution when co-administered with ciprofloxacin due to the expected two-fold increase in the exposure of sildenafil upon co-administration of ciprofloxacin.

Duloxetine

In clinical studies it was demonstrated that concomitant use of duloxetine with strong inhibitors of the CYP450 1A2 isozyme such as fluvoxamine, may result in a 5-fold increase in mean AUC and a 2.5-fold increase in mean Cmaxof duloxetine.

Lidocaine

In a study conducted in 9 healthy volunteers, concomitant use of 1.5 mg/kg IV lidocaine with ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily resulted in an increase of lidocaine Cmaxand AUC by 12% and 26%, respectively. Although lidocaine treatment was well tolerated at this elevated exposure, a possible interaction with ciprofloxacin and an increase in adverse reactions related to lidocaine may occur upon concomitant administration.

Metoclopramide

Metoclopramide significantly accelerates the absorption of oral ciprofloxacin resulting in a shorter time to reach maximum plasma concentrations. No significant effect was observed on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin.

Omeprazole

When ciprofloxacin was administered as a single 1000 mg dose concomitantly with omeprazole (40 mg once daily for three days) to 18 healthy volunteers, the mean AUC and Cmaxof ciprofloxacin were reduced by 20% and 23%, respectively. The clinical significance of this interaction has not been determined.

HOW DOES DISEASE INFLUENCE CNS DRUG DELIVERY?

The general paradigm is that BBB functionality may change in disease conditions and therefore will affect CNS drug distribution and CNS target site concentrations that drive the CNS effects. Many qualitatively obtained changes in BBB properties have been reported for neurodegenerative CNS diseases that all imply that CNS drug distribution would change as a result. However, the number of studies that have quantitatively measured BBB transport and intra‐brain distribution of drugs in the context of neurodegenerative CNS diseases are surprisingly low.

What happens with small molecules?

Parkinson's disease

No changes in BBB transport of L‐DOPA was found using microdialysis in the unilateral rotenone rat model of Parkinson's disease, despite Parkinson's disease‐like pathology, indicated by a huge reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase as well as by substantially reduced levels and higher elimination rates of DOPAC and HVA. Likewise, in α‐synuclein transgenic mice, no changes were found in the extent of CNS distribution (K p, uu, brain) of digoxin, levofloxacin, paliperidone, oxycodone, and diazepam, compared with wild‐type mice.

Epilepsy

P‐gp expression is often taken as a biomarker of transporter functionality and changes in P‐gp expression due to epilepsy have been interpreted as a reason for pharmacoresistance (transporter hypothesis), without assessing (long term) changes in BBB P‐gp functionality. In a kainate rat model of epilepsy, where status epilepticus was induced, brain capillary protein expression of P‐gp as well as BBB P‐gp functionality was assessed in individual rats. Although substantial changes in P‐gp expression were found that turned back to baseline after 30 days following status epilepticus, no changes were observed in BBB transport of the strong P‐gp substrate quinidine.

Alzheimer's disease

In aged AβPP‐transgenic mice and wild type mice, K p, uu, brain was assessed for digoxin, levofloxacin, paliperidone, oxycodone, and diazepam. Despite Aβ pathology, no differences in K p, uu, brain were found. In an in vitro study, the effect of Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory insult on the function of LAT1 at the mouse BBB (for [¹⁴C]‐L‐leucine) as well as LAT function and expression in mouse primary astrocytes was studied and the results showed that the presence of APP/PS1 mutations did not change.

### Effects of fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines on mitochondria of human retinal MIO-M1 cells [^27ef8269]. Experimental Eye Research (2022). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

We conclude that a clinically relevant dosage of bacteriocidal and bacteriostatic antiobiotics have negative impacts on retinal MIO-M1 cells in vitro. These results may be critical in populations affected by specific age-related diseases, such as AMD, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, which already have damaged mitochondria. Further clinical trials and in vivo investigations are needed to determine if these antibiotics may be contributing to additional mitochondrial dysfunction.

### Successful treatment of methimazole-induced severe aplastic anaemia in a diabetic patient with other co-morbidities [^3605c924]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 55-year-old Filipina with Grave's disease, diabetes, hypertension, bronchial asthma, Parkinson's disease and a history of adverse drug reaction to penicillin consulted due to high-grade fever and sore throat. Patient was diagnosed with aplastic anaemia secondary to methimazole and was treated with high-dose granulocyte colony stimulating factor, thrombopoietin and mesterolone. Antibiotics used included levofloxacin, clindamycin, amikacin and fluconazole. Due to bleeding and slow recovery of blood parameters, 30 units of platelets and 7 units of packed red blood cells were transfused during her 22-day admission. This case presents a life-threatening adverse drug reaction in a patient with co-morbid conditions that complicate recovery and limit one's therapeutic options.

Introduction

Fluoroquinolones are among the most commonly prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics worldwide. In the US, 6.7 million ciprofloxacin prescriptions and 3.8 million levofloxacin prescriptions were filled in 2018. Indications for these antibiotics include urinary tract infection, respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal tract infection, and skin and soft tissue infection. Fluoroquinolone use is associated with a number of rare but serious adverse events including nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders (eg, hospitalization with delirium or peripheral neuropathy), hypoglycemia, and collagen-associated adverse events (eg, Achilles tendon rupture, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture). These risks have been reported in population-based studies and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials and observational studies. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued several black-box warnings about the risks of fluoroquinolone use. Given the potential for harm, fluoroquinolones are typically reserved to treat more severe bacterial infections in which the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

Except for moxifloxacin, fluoroquinolones are primarily eliminated by the kidney, and excretion is therefore slower in patients with reduced kidney function. The product monograph and prescribing guidelines recommend that patients with reduced kidney function take fluoroquinolones at lower doses, particularly patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² (eTable 1 in the Supplement). However, in practice, fluoroquinolones are frequently prescribed to these patients at higher than recommended doses. Adverse events associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been reported in 30 case reports and in 1 cohort study of 264 968 patients receiving hemodialysis (a literature search and summary of studies are provided in eTables 2 and 3, respectively, in the Supplement).

Tizanidine

In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic exposure of tizanidine (4 mg single dose) was significantly increased (Cmax7-fold, AUC 10-fold) when the drug was given concomitantly with ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice a day for 3 days). Concomitant administration of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin is contraindicated due to the potentiation of hypotensive and sedative effects of tizanidine [see Contraindications (4.2)].

Ropinirole

In a study conducted in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease who were administered 6 mg ropinirole once daily with 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice-daily, the mean Cmaxand mean AUC of ropinirole were increased by 60% and 84%, respectively. Monitoring for ropinirole-related adverse reactions and appropriate dose adjustment of ropinirole is recommended during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Clozapine

Following concomitant administration of 250 mg ciprofloxacin with 304 mg clozapine for 7 days, serum concentrations of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were increased by 29% and 31%, respectively. Careful monitoring of clozapine associated adverse reactions and appropriate adjustment of clozapine dosage during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin are advised.

### Microbiome-based therapeutics for Parkinson's disease [^35ed2f0d]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

While antibiotic use decreases microbial abundance and diversity, their actions are not wholly selective, and they may decrease the abundance of potentially beneficial species and/or select for antibiotic-resistance genes within the microbiome. In addition, some epidemiological studies report a positive association with use of certain antibiotics (macrolides, lincosamides, tetracyclines, and penicillin) and PD diagnosis in European cohorts. The reason for this association is not clear, particularly given that the broad associations currently described encompass antibiotics with varied mechanism of action across both Gram positive and negative species. It may be that more frequent antibiotic use significantly disrupts the gut microbiome and predisposes an individual to a detrimental inflammatory environment that increases risk of PD. Alternatively, these findings could also be suggestive that those with more frequent/more severe microbial infections that necessitate antibiotic use, are at greater risk for PD.

Tizanidine

In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic exposure of tizanidine (4 mg single dose) was significantly increased (Cmax 7-fold, AUC 10-fold) when the drug was given concomitantly with ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice a day for 3 days). Concomitant administration of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin is contraindicated due to the potentiation of hypotensive and sedative effects of tizanidine [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4.2)].

Ropinirole

In a study conducted in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease who were administered 6 mg ropinirole once daily with 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice-daily, the mean Cmax and mean AUC of ropinirole were increased by 60% and 84%, respectively. Monitoring for ropinirole-related adverse reactions and appropriate dose adjustment of ropinirole is recommended during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10)].

Clozapine

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Serious Adverse Reactions

Advise patients to stop taking levofloxacin if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider for advice on completing the full course of treatment with another antibacterial drug.

Inform patients of the following serious adverse reactions that have been associated with levofloxacin or other fluoroquinolone use:

Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions That May Occur Together: Inform patients that disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathies, and central nervous system effects, have been associated with use of levofloxacin and may occur together in the same patient. Inform patients to stop taking levofloxacin immediately if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider.
Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture: Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience pain, swelling, or inflammation of a tendon, or weakness or inability to use one of their joints; rest and refrain from exercise; and discontinue levofloxacin treatment. Symptoms may be irreversible. The risk of severe tendon disorder with fluoroquinolones is higher in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants.
Peripheral Neuropathies: Inform patients that peripheral neuropathies have been associated with levofloxacin use, symptoms may occur soon after initiation of therapy and may be irreversible. If symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness and/or weakness develop, immediately discontinue levofloxacin and tell them to contact their physician.
Central Nervous System Effects (for example, convulsions, dizziness, lightheadedness, increased intracranial pressure): Inform patients that convulsions have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin. Instruct patients to notify their physician before taking this drug if they have a history of convulsions. Inform patients that they should know how they react to levofloxacin before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in other activities requiring mental alertness and coordination. Instruct patients to notify their physician if persistent headache with or without blurred vision occurs.
Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any history of myasthenia gravis. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they experience any symptoms of muscle weakness, including respiratory difficulties.
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Inform patients that levofloxacin can cause hypersensitivity reactions, even following a single dose, and to discontinue the drug at the first sign of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, a rapid heartbeat, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema (for example, swelling of the lips, tongue, face, tightness of the throat, hoarseness), or other symptoms of an allergic reaction.
Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients that severe hepatotoxicity (including acute hepatitis and fatal events) has been reported in patients taking levofloxacin. Instruct patients to inform their physician if they experience any signs or symptoms of liver injury including: loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fever, weakness, tiredness, right upper quadrant tenderness, itching, yellowing of the skin and eyes, light colored bowel movements or dark colored urine.
Aortic aneurysm and dissection: Inform patients to seek emergency medical care if they experience sudden chest, stomach, or back pain.
Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician as soon as possible.
Prolongation of the QT Interval: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any personal or family history of QT prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, or recent myocardial ischemia; if they are taking any Class IA (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they have any symptoms of prolongation of the QT interval, including prolonged heart palpitations or a loss of consciousness.
Musculoskeletal Disorders in Pediatric Patients: Instruct parents to inform their child's physician if the child has a history of joint-related problems before taking this drug. Inform parents of pediatric patients to notify their child's physician of any joint-related problems that occur during or following levofloxacin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].
Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity: Inform patients that photosensitivity/phototoxicity has been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones. Inform patients to minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while taking fluoroquinolones. If patients need to be outdoors while using fluoroquinolones, instruct them to wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. If a sunburn-like reaction or skin eruption occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician.
Lactation: Advise a lactating woman that she may pump and discard during treatment with levofloxacin and for an additional 2 days after the last dose. Alternatively, advise a lactating woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with levofloxacin and for an additional 2 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

5.4 Central Nervous System Effects

Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric adverse reactions, including: toxic psychoses, hallucinations, or paranoia; depression, or suicidal thoughts; anxiety, agitation, restlessness, or nervousness; confusion, delirium, disorientation, or disturbances in attention; insomnia or nightmares; memory impairment. Attempted or completed suicide have been reported, especially in patients with a medical history of depression, or an underlying risk factor for depression. These reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving levofloxacin, discontinue levofloxacin and institute appropriate measures.

 Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions of Seizures, Increased Intracranial Pressure, and Tremors

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), tremors, and lightheadedness. As with other fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin should be used with caution in patients with a known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) disorder that may predispose them to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose them to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction). If these reactions occur in patients receiving levofloxacin, discontinue levofloxacin and institute appropriate measures [see Adverse Reactions (6); Drug Interactions (7.4, 7.5); Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.5 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis. Avoid levofloxacin in patients with a known history of myasthenia gravis [see Adverse Reactions (6.3); Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Mechanisms of peripheral levodopa resistance in Parkinson's disease [^06b4c6b3]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the complex interplay between H. pylori infection, SIBO and PD, ideally the employed antibiotic agent would eradicate H. pylori in addition to TDC-producing Enterococcus and Lactobacillus spp. The efficacy of rifaximin monotherapy for H. pylori eradication, however, is disappointing, whereas the effect of vancomycin is non-existent (H. pylori being Gram-negative). The standard regimen for H. pylori eradication is a combination therapy which, depending on regional antibiotic resistance, entails either a triple therapy, consisting of a proton-pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and amoxicillin, or a quadruple therapy, comprised of a proton-pump inhibitor, bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline. A recent small (n = 67) randomized controlled trial failed to show benefit of H. pylori eradication in PD patients. However, a 2018 meta-analysis including case-control studies and cohort studies as well as randomized controlled trials (n = 90), demonstrated that H. pylori eradication in PD patients significantly reduced motor symptoms. Whether additional H. pylori eradication in antibiotically treated SIBO patients would have added benefit on gastrointestinal and PD symptoms could be a subject of future research.

Monitoring for ropinirole-related adverse reactions and appropriate dose adjustment of ropinirole is recommended during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].

Clozapine

Following concomitant administration of 250 mg ciprofloxacin with 304 mg clozapine for 7 days, serum concentrations of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were increased by 29% and 31%, respectively. Careful monitoring of clozapine associated adverse reactions and appropriate adjustment of clozapine dosage during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin are advised.

Sildenafil

Following concomitant administration of a single oral dose of 50 mg sildenafil with 500 mg ciprofloxacin to healthy subjects, the mean Cmaxand mean AUC of sildenafil were both increased approximately two-fold. Use sildenafil with caution when co-administered with ciprofloxacin due to the expected two-fold increase in the exposure of sildenafil upon co-administration of ciprofloxacin.

Duloxetine

In clinical studies it was demonstrated that concomitant use of duloxetine with strong inhibitors of the CYP450 1A2 isozyme such as fluvoxamine, may result in a 5-fold increase in mean AUC and a 2.5-fold increase in mean Cmaxof duloxetine.

### Why is there motor deterioration in Parkinson's disease during systemic infections-a hypothetical view [^3ef7ed9e]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Clinicians are well aware of the fact that patients with Parkinson's disease may significantly deteriorate following a systemic infection or, in its most severe case, may even develop an akinetic crisis. Although this phenomenon is widely observed and has a major impact on the patients' condition, the knowledge about the underlying mechanisms behind is still sparse. Possible explanations encompass changes in the pharmacodynamics of the dopaminergic drugs, altered dopamine metabolism in the brain, alterations in the dopaminergic transmission in the striatum or an enhancement of neurodegeneration due to remote effects of peripheral inflammatory processes or circulating bacterial toxins. This article provides possible explanatory concepts and may hence support formulating hypothesis for future studies in this field.

Methods

Study design and participants

A phase 1b, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study (Integrative Research Laboratories AB) was conducted at three university hospital outpatient clinics in Sweden. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. Prior to initiating the study, the protocol underwent ethical vetting and all participating sites received approval from the central ethical review board in Stockholm, Sweden. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants before any study‐related procedures were performed. The ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is NCT03531060.

Key inclusion criteria included age between 50 and 85 years, diagnosis of PD based on the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria, and showing a clear peak-dose dyskinetic response to regular levodopa medication. All antiparkinsonian medications, including levodopa preparations, were to be unchanged for at least 30 days prior to screening and during study participation.

Key exclusion criteria included history of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, could either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the patient's ability to participate in the study; history of or present clinically significant psychiatric diagnosis, at discretion of the investigator; history of seizures, including febrile seizure in childhood; history or presence of hepatic or renal disease or other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs; previous surgery for PD; a Hoehn and Yahr score of 5 when "off" prolonged QTcF (> 450 ms), cardiac arrhythmias, or any clinically significant abnormalities in the resting ECG at the time of screening, as judged by the investigator; history of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the investigator; or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to IRL790.

Randomization and blinding

The study patients were randomized to treatment with either IRL790 or placebo (3:1). The randomization list was generated by the Clinical Research Organization (CRO). The original randomization list was kept in a sealed envelope at the CRO and a copy at the hospital pharmacy. Sealed treatment code envelopes were kept by each site. The individual doses were dispensed to the patients at the clinics as per the randomization list. Data analyzers were blinded until after the database was locked. No code envelope was broken during the study.

5.4 Central Nervous System Effects

Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric adverse reactions, including: toxic psychoses, hallucinations, or paranoia; depression, or suicidal thoughts; anxiety, agitation, restlessness, or nervousness; confusion, delirium, disorientation, or disturbances in attention; insomnia or nightmares; memory impairment. Attempted or completed suicide have been reported, especially in patients with a medical history of depression, or an underlying risk factor for depression. These reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving levofloxacin tablets, discontinue levofloxacin tablets and institute appropriate measures.

Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), tremors, and lightheadedness. As with other fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin tablets should be used with caution in patients with a known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) disorder that may predispose them to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose them to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction). If these reactions occur in patients receiving levofloxacin tablets, discontinue levofloxacin tablets and institute appropriate measures [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.4, 7.5), and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.5 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis. Avoid levofloxacin in patients with a known history of myasthenia gravis [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Levofloxacin treatment of active tuberculosis and the risk of adverse events [^7ddaea80]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Fluoroquinolones are commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) for drug-sensitive patients who are intolerant to first-line antituberculous agents or who are infected with drug-resistant organisms. Despite increasing use of these agents, there is little information on their tolerance outside of clinical trial settings.

Objectives

To compare overall rate of major adverse events associated with levofloxacin-containing regimen to standard therapy.

Methods

Cases (levofloxacin-containing regimen) were matched by age and sex to their control subjects (standard first-line TB drugs). Eligible patients were identified from the provincial TB database from 2001 to 2004. Drug safety was assessed by evaluation of the nature of the adverse event, the likelihood of association with the study medications, and severity. Only major side effects, that is, those who had a severe or moderate adverse event that was categorized to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to the TB medications, were considered for the analysis.

Results

During the 3-year study period, 102 patients received levofloxacin, and 358 patients received first-line agents for treatment of active TB. There were no significant differences between the two groups except for indication (82% of patients in the levofloxacin group had an antecedent adverse event to first-line TB drugs, whereas 18% received levofloxacin because of resistance) and concurrent use of first-line drugs (majority of patients in the levofloxacin arm were not receiving concurrent isoniazid or rifampin). The rate of any major adverse event was almost half among those using levofloxacin as among those on standard therapies (rate ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44 to 0.82). After adjustment for the differences in exposure of concomitant medications, the rate of any major adverse event was similar between the levofloxacin and control arms (adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.03). Furthermore, there was no difference between the levofloxacin and control arms with respect to CNS (adjusted rate ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.43), GI tract (adjusted rate ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.13), skin (adjusted rate ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.10), or musculoskeletal (MSK) [adjusted rate ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.60] related adverse events when adjusted for concomitant drugs. The results of the secondary analysis for the rate of major adverse events within the first 100 days were similar to the primary analysis. The time to the first major adverse event was similar between the levofloxacin group and the control group (adjusted hazards ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.34).

Conclusions

Concomitant use of a levofloxacin-containing regimen resulted in a similar rate of adverse events compared with conventional first-line regimens when used for treatment of active TB, despite a history of adverse events.

### FDA boxed warnings: how to prescribe drugs safely [^ad72f464]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Boxed warnings, commonly referred to as "black box" warnings, are issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and featured in the labeling of drugs associated with serious adverse reactions. These safety concerns are typically identified through the Adverse Event Reporting System and the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, which evaluates postmarket safety findings. The most common type of warning is issued when there is a potentially serious adverse effect that must be carefully weighed against the potential benefit of the drug. Warnings are also issued to draw attention to dosing, monitoring requirements, and potential drug interactions. Boxed warnings have been issued recently for oral sodium phosphate bowel preparations, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, and salmeterol. Despite these highly publicized warnings, all of these medications remain viable treatment options with appropriate patient selection. Ultimately, physicians must decide whether to prescribe drugs with boxed warnings.

### Why is there motor deterioration in Parkinson's disease during systemic infections-a hypothetical view [^15304e83]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Clinicians are well aware of the fact that patients with Parkinson's disease may significantly deteriorate following a systemic infection or, in its most severe case, may even develop an akinetic crisis. Although this phenomenon is widely observed and has a major impact on the patients' condition, the knowledge about the underlying mechanisms behind is still sparse. Possible explanations encompass changes in the pharmacodynamics of the dopaminergic drugs, altered dopamine metabolism in the brain, alterations in the dopaminergic transmission in the striatum or an enhancement of neurodegeneration due to remote effects of peripheral inflammatory processes or circulating bacterial toxins. This article provides possible explanatory concepts and may hence support formulating hypothesis for future studies in this field.

2.19 Perampanel

2.19.1 Efficacy Conclusion

Two trials met the eligibility criteria for this question. The efficacy conclusion is insufficient evidence regarding perampanel use for treatment of motor fluctuations in PD patients on (attempted) optimal oral levodopa therapy.

2.19.2 Summary

Two trials evaluated the use of perampanel for reducing OFF‐time compared with a placebo but failed to demonstrate its superiority. Only one study assessed its benefits for ON‐time and disability. In these areas, perampanel also failed to show significant improvement compared with the placebo. Additionally, motor impairment in the off‐medication state and HR‐QoL were not evaluated in any of these studies.

2.20 Helicobacter pylori Eradication

2.20.1 Efficacy Conclusion

One trial met the eligibility criteria for this question. The efficacy conclusion is insufficient evidence regarding the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (HP) for the treatment of motor fluctuations in PD patients on (attempted) optimal oral levodopa therapy.

2.20.2 Summary

One trial involving 34 patients evaluated the use of HP eradication (omeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin) for motor fluctuations, comparing it with an antioxidant treatment with allopurinol in a double‐blind fashion. Eligible patients had to have positive serology and positive stool testing for HP infection, confirmed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Levodopa dosages remained unchanged during the study. Patients who underwent HP eradication showed significant improvement in motor impairment, with a prolonged on‐medication state measured by UPDRS‐III after 3 months, suggesting that HP infection may affect levodopa absorption. The prevalence of dyskinesias was not reported in this study.

2.21 Coenzyme Q10

2.21.1 Efficacy Conclusion

One trial met the eligibility criteria for this question. Coenzyme Q10 is not efficacious to treat motor fluctuations in PD patients on (attempted) optimal oral levodopa therapy.

2.21.2 Summary

One trial evaluated the use of Coenzyme Q10 for reducing OFF‐time compared with placebo. There were no differences between the Coenzyme Q10 and the placebo in terms of OFF‐time duration, ON‐time duration, motor impairment during off‐medication states, or disability scores.

### A randomized, double-blind, controlled phase II study of foliglurax in Parkinson's disease [^c6bb5d72]. Movement Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

A strength of this study is that it recruited patients based on having both motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. Although previous studies with amantadine have shown reductions in off time, patients were recruited based on their dyskinesia, and some patients may have had very little off time at baseline. We also acknowledge several important limitations, including its short duration, which may have prevented us from observing the full magnitude of foliglurax effect. However, although off time versus baseline continued to improve (decrease) from day 14 to day 28, the treatment effect versus placebo did not change. Moreover, 28 days was considered adequate to assess the safety of foliglurax at this early stage of development and to determine early proof‐of‐concept therapeutic effect on reducing off time compared with placebo (current adjuncts to reduce off time show significant effects within this time frame). Pharmacokinetic analyses showed that plasma concentrations were in the range of what was predicted to be efficacious from the animal modelswith achievement of steady state by day 14, making it unlikely that a longer exposure would have provided greater efficacy.

### Frequency and severity of myasthenia gravis exacerbations associated with the use of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and azithromycin [^abea82d0]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

The use of fluoroquinolones and macrolides can be associated with MG exacerbations. However, the overall exacerbation risk appears to be low. Stable MG patients appear likely to tolerate these antibiotics without a high risk of MG worsening. Patients with recent MG‐related hospitalization or ED visit, female sex, and comorbid diabetes are at higher risk of AAMGE. When caring for a female MG patient with diabetes and/or recent hospitalization or ED visit, the use of fluoroquinolones or macrolides should be avoided or used with caution. However, it is important to realize that AAMGE can be severe, leading to crisis/near crisis and escalation in MG treatment. When considering the use of these antibiotics, there is always a need to consider many factors on an individual basis, including patient demographics, history of MG, status of MG, severity of the infection, as well as the availability of alternative safer antibiotics to provide the optimal care for MG patients.

### Mechanisms of peripheral levodopa resistance in Parkinson's disease [^33eb7a9a]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Advantages and disadvantages of the various antibiotic choices will have to be carefully weighed when designing future studies to further test their efficacy in reversing SIBO and, importantly, restoring levodopa efficacy. Trials of antibiotic treatment in a selected sample of PD patients who manifest both levodopa non-response and symptoms of SIBO will be necessary.

Besides antibiotics, another treatment that has been suggested for bacteria-related reduction of levodopa bioavailability is (S)-α-fluoromethyltyrosine (AFMT), which prevents L-dopa decarboxylation by TDC through the disabling of pyridoxal-5′-phosphate. As far as we know, there is no documented real-life experience with this intervention as of yet. A further treatment modality that might warrant consideration, given the altered gut microbiome in PD patients which ultimately might contribute to the development of SIBO, is the administration of probiotics. In several studies of oral probiotics in constipated PD patients, a significant improvement was seen in the number of bowel movements, stool consistency and quality of life. Whether this might also be effective for the treatment or prevention of SIBO in PD patients could be a subject of further research. Given the paucity of trials thus far, it is not yet clear which probiotic strains would be likely to be effective. The available studies used species belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus –. It stands to reason that any probiotic preparation used in an attempt to treat or prevent SIBO in PD should exclude strains known to be TDC-producing.

'Bypassing the enzymes'

TDC and AADC are involved in the metabolization of levodopa, but not that of dopamine agonists. In persons in whom increased enzyme activity is the cause of levodopa resistance, dopamine agonists could be employed. Oral treatment with a dopamine receptor agonist might be the most straightforward solution. It may, however, fall short of expectations in patients who also have intestinal malabsorption, such as in SIBO or in delayed gastric emptying. Indeed, it has been suggested that delayed gastric emptying negatively influences absorption of the dopamine agonist ropinirole. Pramipexole is absorbed into the blood by organic cation transporters in the brush border membrane of the jejunum. It would be reasonable to presume that SIBO-related inflammation of the jejunal lining negatively affects pramipexole absorption. In a case report, an ileostomy patient with idiopathic parkinsonism failed to respond not only to oral levodopa but also to oral pramipexole, whilst showing marked improvement in response to transdermal rotigotine.

### Levofloxacin-induced delirium with psychotic features [^35114926]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To raise awareness of a rare but serious adverse effect of a commonly used medication.

Method

Report of a case.

Results

A previously healthy 42-year-old woman presented with acute-onset delirium with psychotic features as a consequence of levofloxacin therapy. Withdrawal of the medication was associated with return of the patient's normal mental status.

Conclusion

The new quinolone derivatives (levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin), also called gyrase inhibitors, are known for their potential to cause central nervous system-related adverse effects, including headache, dizziness and insomnia. Risk factors for neurotoxicity include renal insufficiency, underlying central nervous system (CNS) disease and increased CNS penetration of drug. Acute delirium resulting from levofloxacin therapy is an exceedingly rare complication that has been thought to occur more commonly in elderly patients. Here, we describe levofloxacin-induced delirium with psychotic features in a relatively young, otherwise healthy female.

### Efficacy and safety of higher doses of levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial [^4219b0f6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we have shown that doses of levofloxacin > 1,000 mg/d do not reduce time to culture conversion but do result in an increased risk of grade ≥ 3 AEs, with higher exposures also associated with slightly more QTcF prolongation. In our study, a dose of 750 mg was adequate to achieve the target AUC/MIC of 100. However, because there was no detectable difference in toxicity between doses of 750 mg/d and 1,000 mg/d and there is wide variability of AUCs achieved with oral levofloxacin, we conclude that a dose of 1,000 mg/d will most reliably achieve target levels without incurring unnecessary toxicity.

Among 3,134 patients who received a course of oral levofloxacin, coadministration was significantly associated with subsequent identification of a levofloxacin-resistant isolate. Strategies to curb the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance should include avoiding the coadministration of divalent or trivalent cation-containing compounds and fluoroquinolone.

However, no fluoroquinolone should be co-administered with any solution containing multivalent cations, e.g., magnesium, through the same intravenous line [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

7.2 Warfarin

No significant effect of levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for R- and S-warfarin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of warfarin on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, there have been reports during the postmarketing experience in patients that levofloxacin enhances the effects of warfarin. Elevations of the prothrombin time in the setting of concurrent warfarin and levofloxacin use have been associated with episodes of bleeding. Prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if levofloxacin is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.3); Patient Counseling Information (17)].

7.3 Antidiabetic Agents

Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with fluoroquinolones and an antidiabetic agent. Therefore, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13); Adverse Reactions (6.2); Patient Counseling Information (17)].

7.4 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone, including levofloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Levofloxacin prophylaxis in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma (TEAMM): a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 3 trial [^7ead4640]. The Lancet: Oncology (2019). High credibility.

In summary, our study found a consistent benefit for the use of levofloxacin prophylaxis over 12 weeks in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma, without any increased in health care-associated infections. Thus, patients with newly diagnosed myeloma could benefit from levofloxacin prophylaxis, although local antibiotic resistance proportions must be considered. Prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis after 12 weeks and combined antibiotic use for prophylaxis requires investigation in future studies.

### Transient parkinsonism associated with acute legionnaires' disease [^07596650]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 44-year-old right-handed man with a 5-day history of non-productive cough associated with subjective fevers/chills and night sweats presented to the emergency department with slurred speech. Radiography and urine antigen testing confirmed the diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia The hospital course was complicated by acute hypoxic respiratory failure that required 7days of invasive mechanical ventilation. Following extubation, the patient had dysarthria and developed new parkinsonism features. Brain imaging revealed a non-specific focal lesion in the left frontal lobe of unclear significance. Ciprofloxacin was decided as the final antibiotic of choice for its favourable central nervous system profile. Levodopa-carbidopa was initiated to help activate the basal ganglia. The patient had complete resolution of pneumonia and transient parkinsonism. He was able to regain most of his baseline functional status with intensive rehabilitation.

Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients that severe hepatotoxicity (including acute hepatitis and fatal events) has been reported in patients taking levofloxacin. Instruct patients to inform their physician if they experience any signs or symptoms of liver injury including: loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fever, weakness, tiredness, right upper quadrant tenderness, itching, yellowing of the skin and eyes, light colored bowel movements or dark colored urine.

Aortic aneurysm and dissection: Inform patients to seek emergency medical care if they experience sudden chest, stomach, or back pain.

Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician as soon as possible.

Prolongation of the QT Interval: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any personal or family history of QT prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, or recent myocardial ischemia; if they are taking any Class IA (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they have any symptoms of prolongation of the QT interval, including prolonged heart palpitations or a loss of consciousness.

### Mechanisms of peripheral levodopa resistance in Parkinson's disease [^f9e2e011]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Another non-absorbable antibiotic that could theoretically be employed is vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic that is effective against Gram-positive bacteria. Although there are no published articles about the use of this agent for the treatment of SIBO, the drug is used extensively for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection. Limited experience exists for the use of oral vancomycin for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation – and for the alteration of human intestinal microbiota. An obvious advantage of this antibiotic would be the greatly-reduced cost as compared to rifaximin in some markets, including the United States, totaling just under $150 for a 14-day course (250 mg t.i.d.). (It should be noted that the reverse is true in some other jurisdictions, such as the Netherlands, where a course of rifaximin is 25% of the cost of a course of oral vancomycin.)Also, the fact that oral vancomycin is not absorbed into blood has clear advantages with regard to e.g. side effects, allergies and the development of antibiotic resistance. In addition, in contrast to oral vancomycin, broad-spectrum absorbable antibiotic agents have a propensity to cause diarrhea or loose stools.

There are, however, a number of drawbacks to the use of vancomycin that warrant consideration:
Antibiotic sensitivity. Enterococcus spp, being Gram-positive, are generally sensitive to vancomycin (with the exception of vancomycin-resistant enterococci). However, Lactobacillus spp, of which L. brevis is TDC-producing, are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, and two studies in fact demonstrated an increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus spp after vancomycin treatment. Bifidobacterium spp are generally vancomycin-sensitive, but Akkermansia, being a Gram-negative genus, is by definition resistant to vancomycin;
Further disturbance of the gut microbiome, potentially giving free rein to bacterial species associated with infections. Even a single, 7–14 day course of oral vancomycin has been demonstrated to induce both short- and long-term adverse changes in the richness of the gut microbiome. resulting in a relative abundance of pathogenic Proteobacteria species including Klebsiella, Escherichia and Shigella;
Promotion of antibiotic resistance and intestinal colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococci. In a subset of patients receiving vancomycin for Clostridioides difficile eradication, secondary infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci has been described –.
