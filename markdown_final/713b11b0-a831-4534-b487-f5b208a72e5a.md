## Question

Ear cleaning prescription

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ear cleaning prescriptions, including when to prescribe ear cleaning, what to prescribe, how to prescribe it, and what safety counseling to provide. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indications for ear cleaning and distinguish cerumen impaction from infectious conditions like acute otitis externa and chronic suppurative otitis media. Then, I should verify the evidence base for different cleaning methods and agents, including cerumenolytics, irrigation, and manual removal. Next, I will review guideline-based recommendations and grading to align choices with best practice. After that, I need to check safety modifiers such as tympanic membrane status, diabetes, and anticoagulation. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing language, follow-up, and patient education, and I will double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical indications for ear cleaning, because I need to ensure we are not over-treating asymptomatic cerumen. Cerumen impaction warrants intervention when it causes symptoms such as hearing loss, fullness, tinnitus, itching, otalgia, or discharge, or when it prevents necessary assessment of the ear canal or tympanic membrane; otherwise, observation is reasonable in asymptomatic cases, and routine removal is not recommended [^7d007dfe] [^d3ff708c] [^61e2e6cc]. Hold on, I should verify the infectious contexts too: in acute otitis externa, aural toilet is often needed to clear debris so topical therapy can penetrate, and in chronic suppurative otitis media, aural toilet is a standard component of care, though high-quality randomized evidence for toilet alone is limited and certainty is very low [^d96cfe34] [^7fe9b328] [^82b275cb].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for cerumen removal methods. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: guidelines endorse three effective options — cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, and manual removal — with no method proven superior, so choice should be individualized based on patient factors, clinician expertise, and shared decision-making [^0f3106c3] [^252ecb65]. I will now examine cerumenolytics: multiple reviews suggest that any cerumenolytic is generally better than no treatment, but there is no consistent superiority among agents, and water or saline may perform as well as commercial products; oil-based drops lubricate, whereas water-based agents hydrate and fragment cerumen, and longer dwell times tend to improve clearance [^f778eff8] [^577ddde2] [^58802961]. Hold on, I should double-check safety: cerumenolytics should be avoided with active otitis externa, nonintact tympanic membrane, or known hypersensitivity, and mild local irritation or transient hearing changes can occur [^539bfc33] [^c59d1222].

> I need to check the role of irrigation. Guidelines support irrigation as an option with Grade B evidence, and pretreatment with cerumenolytic drops improves success; however, irrigation is contraindicated with a nonintact tympanic membrane, active infection, prior ear surgery affecting the canal, or significant canal stenosis, and water temperature should be near body temperature to avoid caloric effects [^66a9381d] [^4a905ad1] [^28f673d7]. Let me reconsider the magnitude of benefit: uncontrolled and controlled studies suggest hearing improvements averaging roughly 5–10 dB after successful irrigation, with some ears showing larger gains, which reinforces the clinical value when indicated [^8132920a].

> Manual removal requires instrumentation such as curettes, forceps, or suction, and I should confirm its indications and risks. Manual removal is appropriate when cerumen is firm, impacted, or when irrigation is contraindicated; risks include canal trauma, bleeding, infection, and rare tympanic membrane injury, so visualization and patient cooperation are key, and referral is appropriate if anatomy or tolerance limits safe removal [^508cd41e] [^58802961] [^e734a243]. But wait, what if the patient is on anticoagulation or has a bleeding disorder? In that case, I should favor nontraumatic methods and consider cerumenolytics with caution, balancing benefit and risk and documenting shared decision-making [^c6dd2586].

> Now, I should review guideline-based recommendations to ensure alignment. The AAO-HNSF update issues a strong recommendation to treat identified cerumen impaction, and offers options including cerumenolytics, irrigation, or manual removal, with shared decision-making and attention to modifying factors such as tympanic membrane status, diabetes, immunocompromise, and anticoagulation [^52218301] [^c6dd2586]. I need to ensure I incorporate the "do not routinely treat asymptomatic cerumen" statement and the recommendation against ear candling, which is ineffective and potentially harmful, into counseling and orders [^d3ff708c] [^3737ac1a].

> Let me think about special populations and safety modifiers. In children, cerumen impaction is common and may require intervention when symptomatic or when it impedes assessment; caregivers should be counseled to avoid cotton swabs and consider home softening or clinician removal as appropriate [^c7828631] [^bc1d0107]. In patients with tympanostomy tubes or known perforations, irrigation is contraindicated and manual removal or cerumenolytics compatible with a nonintact membrane should be selected; caregivers can be taught to use tissue spears to clear drainage before drops and to keep the ear dry during active otorrhea [^b0be57e4] [^28f673d7]. For patients with diabetes or immunocompromise, I should avoid irrigation due to infection risk and favor atraumatic suction under visualization if needed [^7fe9b328].

> I will now examine practical prescribing language for cerumenolytics, and I should double-check dosing. For adults with an intact tympanic membrane and no active infection, carbamide peroxide 6.5% otic solution can be prescribed as 5–10 drops into the affected ear twice daily for 3–5 days, with instructions to lie on the opposite side for several minutes to allow penetration; if irrigation is planned, drops can be used for several days beforehand to soften wax [^58802961] [^c59d1222]. Wait, I initially thought to include olive oil as a cerumenolytic option, but hold on, I should verify guideline positions: while some guidelines list oil-based agents as acceptable, others advise against routine use of olive oil drops for cerumen removal due to limited benefit and potential to exacerbate impaction, so I should individualize and avoid implying endorsement of olive oil as a first-line cerumenolytic in all cases [^c59d1222] [^70fea2da].

> For irrigation, I need to ensure safety instructions are explicit. If prescribing home irrigation, I should confirm tympanic membrane integrity, absence of active infection, and provide a bulb syringe or validated kit with body-temperature water or saline, instructing gentle instillation and avoidance of forceful jets; if there is any pain, drainage, or prior ear surgery, irrigation should not be attempted at home and clinic evaluation is needed [^4a905ad1] [^28f673d7]. Let me verify follow-up: patients should be advised to return if symptoms persist, if pain or bleeding occurs, or if hearing does not improve, and clinicians should reassess the canal at the conclusion of treatment to confirm resolution [^570e4228] [^0f942de1].

> For infectious ear conditions, I should confirm that aural toilet is adjunctive to topical therapy rather than a standalone prescription. In acute otitis externa, clinician-performed aural toilet or wick placement improves topical drug delivery when the canal is edematous or debris-laden, and patients should be counseled to keep the ear dry and avoid self-cleaning during treatment [^d96cfe34] [^a8f07851]. In chronic suppurative otitis media, aural toilet is standard, but high-quality evidence for toilet alone is sparse; combining toilet with topical quinolone antibiotics improves discharge resolution compared with systemic therapy, and toilet should be performed with appropriate infection control and, when possible, under microscopic visualization [^24fe5032] [^82b275cb].

> Patient education is essential, and I need to ensure I cover both prevention and red flags. Patients should avoid inserting cotton swabs or other objects into the ear canal, recognize symptoms of impaction, and understand that cerumen is protective and often self-clearing; those at higher risk of impaction, such as hearing aid users, may benefit from periodic preventive drops or clinician checks, and any ear pain, drainage, or bleeding should prompt urgent evaluation [^55af83e0] [^ac4c66ba] [^c1c870ef]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating the need for routine prevention: most people do not require scheduled ear cleaning, so counseling should be tailored to those with recurrent impaction or specific risk factors [^ac4c66ba].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and referral triggers. If initial management fails or if impaction recurs frequently, referral to otolaryngology for specialized equipment and techniques is recommended; persistent symptoms after apparent clearance should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses such as otitis externa, tympanic membrane pathology, or sensorineural hearing loss [^e734a243] [^570e4228]. I need to ensure documentation includes pre- and post-treatment otoscopy, symptoms, and any modifying factors to support safe, effective care and to guide future management decisions [^0f942de1].

Ear cleaning is not a routine prescription; **only treat when cerumen is impacted** [^52218301] and causing symptoms or blocking assessment [^7d007dfe]. Use **cerumenolytics** (carbamide peroxide, saline, or mineral oil) for 3–5 days [^c59d1222], then consider irrigation or manual removal if needed [^0f3106c3]; avoid irrigation if the tympanic membrane is perforated or there is active infection [^28f673d7]. Educate patients to avoid cotton swabs and ear candling [^55af83e0] [^3737ac1a]; refer to ENT if impaction persists or complications arise [^e734a243].

---

## Indications for ear cleaning

Ear cleaning is indicated only when **cerumen impaction** causes symptoms or prevents necessary examination [^52218301]. Routine cleaning of non-impacted cerumen is not recommended [^d3ff708c].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Ear cleaning should be avoided or approached with caution in the following situations:

- **Perforated tympanic membrane**: Avoid irrigation; use manual removal or cerumenolytics cautiously [^28f673d7].
- **Active ear infection**: Avoid irrigation; treat infection first [^28f673d7].
- **History of ear surgery**: Use caution and consider specialist referral [^28f673d7].
- **Anticoagulant therapy**: Increased risk of bleeding with manual removal [^c6dd2586].

---

## Recommended ear cleaning methods

Several **ear cleaning methods** are recommended, each with specific indications, advantages, and limitations:

| **Method** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cerumenolytic drops (carbamide peroxide, saline, mineral oil) | Impacted cerumen | - Effective in softening wax <br/> - Easy to use <br/> - Minimal risk | - May cause irritation <br/> - Avoid if perforated eardrum or active infection [^c59d1222] [^539bfc33] |
| Irrigation (syringing) | Impacted cerumen after softening | - Effective <br/> - Immediate results | - Risk of perforation <br/> - Infection <br/> - Vertigo <br/> - Avoid if perforated eardrum or active infection [^66a9381d] [^28f673d7] |
| Manual removal (curette, suction) | Impacted cerumen, narrow canals, or failed irrigation | - Precise <br/> - Controlled | - Risk of trauma <br/> - Bleeding <br/> - Infection <br/> - Requires training [^58802961] |

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education is essential to prevent **unnecessary ear cleaning** and reduce complications. Key points include:

- **Avoid cotton swabs**: Can push wax deeper and cause impaction or injury [^55af83e0].
- **Avoid ear candling**: Ineffective and potentially dangerous [^3737ac1a].
- **Recognize symptoms**: Hearing loss, fullness, tinnitus, or pain warrant evaluation [^55af83e0].
- **Home care**: Use cerumenolytics as directed; seek care if symptoms persist [^bc1d0107].

---

## Follow-up and referral

Follow-up should confirm resolution and assess for complications; if initial management fails, **refer to ENT** for specialized care [^e734a243].

---

Ear cleaning is **not routine**; treat only when cerumen is impacted and symptomatic or blocking assessment. Use cerumenolytics first, then irrigation or manual removal as needed, and avoid irrigation with a perforated eardrum or active infection. Educate patients to avoid unsafe practices and refer to ENT if impaction persists or complications occur.

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^82b275cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting describes processes for manually cleaning the ear, including dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope), or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics. This is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM. This is the first update of a Cochrane review published in 2020.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of aural toilet procedures for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The searches were run on 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults or children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency, and for any duration. The main comparisons were aural toileting versus placebo or no intervention, and one aural toileting method versus another aural toileting method. Within each comparison, we separated studies into those in which both groups received other concomitant treatments (e.g. antiseptics or antibiotics) and those without concomitant treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at one week to up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and adverse events (dizziness/vertigo/balance problems, ear bleeding). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update did not find any new studies. We included three studies with 431 participants (465 ears) reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. One study recruited participants from the Solomon Islands, who were considered a 'high-risk' Indigenous group. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life, ear pain, or ear bleeding. 1. Daily aural toileting versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, only one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study, 217 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo, or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these participants were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment, and therefore the certainty of evidence was very low. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group, so it was not possible to determine whether there was a difference between the two groups. 2. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting episode (both in addition to topical ciprofloxacin) One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty evidence). One participant in the group with single aural toileting and self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM when compared to no treatment, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. The evidence was considered very low-certainty as there were concerns over risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, and suspected publication bias. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^9f4bf973]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting is a term describing a number of processes for manually cleaning the ear. Techniques used may include dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope) or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Dry mopping may be effective in removing mucopurulent discharge. Compared to irrigation or microsuction it is less effective in removing epithelial debris or thick pus. Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics.

Objectives

To assess the effects of aural toilet procedures for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving people (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency and for any duration. The comparisons were aural toileting compared with a) placebo or no intervention, and b) any other aural toileting method. We analysed trials in which background treatments were used in both arms (e.g. topical antiseptics or topical antibiotics) separately.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and the adverse events of ear bleeding and dizziness/vertigo/balance problems.

Main Results

We included three studies with a total of 431 participants (465 ears), reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. None of the included studies reported the outcomes of health-related quality of life, ear pain or the adverse event of ear bleeding. Daily aural toileting (dry mopping) versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. Neither study presented results for resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks or between two to four weeks. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study; 217 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. No results were reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group so it is not possible to determine whether there is a difference between the two groups. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting on top of topical ciprofloxacin One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are unsure whether there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study; 80 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. There were no results reported for resolution of ear discharge at between two to four weeks. The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. One patient in the group with single aural toileting and self administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study; 80 participants, very low-certainty). No results were reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether or not treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^2086b726]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

Search Strategy

Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible. We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low. Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial). In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively). One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate. No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning. Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed. Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

### Ear wax [^02c1dd09]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ear wax only becomes a problem if it causes a hearing impairment or other ear-related symptoms. Ear wax is more likely to accumulate and cause a hearing impairment when normal extrusion is prevented; for example, by the use of hearing aids, or by the use of cotton buds to clean the ears. Ear wax can visually obscure the ear drum, and may need to be removed for diagnostic purposes.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of methods to remove ear wax? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ear irrigation (syringing); manual removal (other than ear irrigation); wax softeners prior to irrigation; and wax softeners alone.

### Infections of the ear [^6d6c9f84]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Infections of the ear are a common presentation to an acute care environment. In this article, the authors aim to summarize the most common presentations, and diagnostic and treatment options for typical infections of the ear. This article is geared toward the emergency physician, urgent care provider, and primary care provider who will likely be the initial evaluating and treating provider to assist them in determining what treatment modalities can be managed in a clinic and what needs to be referred for admission or specialty consultation.

### Ear wax [^eeabfadb]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ear wax only becomes a problem if it causes a hearing impairment or other ear-related symptoms. Ear wax is more likely to accumulate and cause a hearing impairment when normal extrusion is prevented — for example, by the use of hearing aids, or by the use of cotton buds to clean the ears. Ear wax can visually obscure the ear drum, and may need to be removed for diagnostic purposes.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of methods to remove ear wax? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to June 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ear syringing, manual removal (other than ear syringing), and wax softeners (alone or prior to syringing).

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^c1c870ef]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 11 — secondary prevention of cerumen impaction provides that clinicians may educate/counsel patients with cerumen impaction or excessive cerumen regarding control measures, classified as an Option based on survey and comparative studies with unclear balance of benefit vs harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C with observational studies, experimental pilot studies, and expert opinion; benefits are prevention of cerumen impaction or recurrent cerumen impaction; risks include time for counseling and potential risk of preventive measures if used; the benefit–harm assessment is balance benefit over harm; and policy level is Option with no differences of opinion. The statement's purpose is to inform clinicians of control measures to prevent recurrence after office removal and to prevent accumulation; measures that may be beneficial include instilling prophylactic topical preparations, irrigating the ear canal, cleaning hearing aids, or routine cleaning of the ear canal by a clinician, and patients can purchase wax-softening drops or home irrigation kits as part of an ear hygiene regimen to help prevent recurrence of cerumen occlusions. Cerumen accumulation and impaction may be exacerbated by the use of hearing aids, so instructions on proper care and routine cleaning of aids are important, and choices regarding topical preparations and devices for irrigating the ears should be shared with the patient.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^2a4ee0e3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Ear hygiene education for cerumen impaction and those at risk — evidence profile and policy: Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C based on preponderance of survey studies and 1 prospective pilot study, with level of confidence in evidence Medium, and the benefit–harm assessment is preponderance of benefit. Benefits include promoting safe and effective self-care behaviors in ear hygiene, preventing self-inflicted harms such as abrasions, cuts, and impaction, and reducing health care utilization, while risks/harms/costs include induced patient anxiety about an asymptomatic condition, time spent in counseling, and potential for increased use of health care resources if self-cleaning with cotton-tipped applicators is abandoned. Policy level is Recommendation, the role of patient preferences is small with the option to decline education, and exceptions are none.

### Ear drops for the removal of ear wax [^f778eff8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ear wax (cerumen) is a normal bodily secretion that can become a problem when it obstructs the ear canal. Symptoms attributed to wax (such as deafness and pain) are among the commonest reasons for patients to present to primary care with ear trouble. Wax is part of the ear's self-cleaning mechanism and is usually naturally expelled from the ear canal without causing problems. When this mechanism fails, wax is retained in the canal and may become impacted; interventions to encourage its removal may then be needed. Application of ear drops is one of these methods. Liquids used to remove and soften wax are of several kinds: oil-based compounds (e.g. olive or almond oil); water-based compounds (e.g. sodium bicarbonate or water itself); a combination of the above or non-water, non-oil-based solutions, such as carbamide peroxide (a hydrogen peroxide-urea compound) and glycerol.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ear drops (or sprays) to remove or aid the removal of ear wax in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Cochrane Register of Studies; PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 23 March 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which a 'cerumenolytic' was compared with no treatment, water or saline, an alternative liquid treatment (oil or almond oil) or another 'cerumenolytic' in adults or children with obstructing or impacted ear wax.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were 1) the proportion of patients (or ears) with complete clearance of ear wax and 2) adverse effects (discomfort, irritation or pain). Secondary outcomes were: extent of wax clearance; proportion of people (or ears) with relief of symptoms due to wax; proportion of people (or ears) requiring further intervention to remove wax; success of mechanical removal of residual wax following treatment; any other adverse effects recorded and cost. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included 10 studies, with 623 participants (900 ears). Interventions included: oil-based treatments (triethanolamine polypeptide, almond oil, benzocaine, chlorobutanol), water-based treatments (docusate sodium, carbamide peroxide, phenazone, choline salicylate, urea peroxide, potassium carbonate), other active comparators (e.g. saline or water alone) and no treatment. Nine of the studies were more than 15 years old. The overall risk of bias across the 10 included studies was low or unclear.

Primary Outcome

proportion of patients (or ears) with complete clearance of ear waxSix studies (360 participants; 491 ears) contributed quantitative data and were included in our meta-analyses. Active treatment versus no treatmentOnly one study addressed this comparison. The proportion of ears with complete clearance of ear wax was higher in the active treatment group (22%) compared with the no treatment group (5%) after five days of treatment (risk ratio (RR) 4.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 16.80); one study; 117 ears; NNTB = 8) (low-quality evidence). Active treatment versus water or salineWe found no evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients (or ears) with complete clearance of ear wax when the active treatment group was compared to the water or saline group (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.75; three studies; 213 participants; 257 ears) (low-quality evidence). Two studies applied drops for five days, but one study only applied the drops for 15 minutes. When we excluded this study in a sensitivity analysis it did not change the result. Water or saline versus no treatmentThis comparison was only addressed in the single study cited above (active versus no treatment) and there was no evidence of a difference in the proportion of ears with complete wax clearance when comparing water or saline with no treatment after five days of treatment (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 17.62; one study; 76 ears) (low-quality evidence). Active treatment A versus active treatment BSeveral single studies evaluated 'head-to-head' comparisons between two active treatments. We found no evidence to show that one was superior to any other. Subgroup analysis of oil-based active treatments versus non-oil based active treatmentsWe found no evidence of a difference in this outcome when oil-based treatments were compared with non-oil-based active treatments.

Primary Outcome

adverse effects: discomfort, irritation or painOnly seven studies planned to measure and did report this outcome. Only two (141 participants;176 ears) provided useable data. There was no evidence of a significant difference in the number of adverse effects between the types of ear drops in these two studies. We summarised the remaining five studies narratively. All events were mild and reported in fewer than 30 participants across the seven studies (low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomesThree studies reported 'other' adverse effects (how many studies planned to report these is unclear). The available information was limited and included occasional reports of dizziness, unpleasant smell, tinnitus and hearing loss. No significant differences between groups were reported. There were no emergencies or serious adverse effects reported in any of the 10 studies. There was very limited or no information available on our remaining secondary outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Although a number of studies aimed to evaluate whether or not one type of cerumenolytic is more effective than another, there is no high-quality evidence to allow a firm conclusion to be drawn and the answer remains uncertain. A single study suggests that applying ear drops for five days may result in a greater likelihood of complete wax clearance than no treatment at all. However, we cannot conclude whether one type of active treatment is more effective than another and there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy between oil-based and water-based active treatments. There is no evidence to show that using saline or water alone is better or worse than commercially produced cerumenolytics. Equally, there is also no evidence to show that using saline or water alone is better than no treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) executive summary [^3513fea2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Earwax (Cerumen Impaction). To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 11 recommendations emphasize proper ear hygiene, diagnosis of cerumen impaction, factors that modify management, evaluating the need for intervention, and proper treatment. An updated guideline is needed due to new evidence (3 guidelines, 5 systematic reviews, and 6 randomized controlled trials) and the need to add statements on managing cerumen impaction that focus on primary prevention, contraindicated intervention, and referral and coordination of care.

### Topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^f587fa91]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antiseptics, a possible treatment for CSOM, inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antiseptics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). However, the effects of topical antiseptics for CSOM remain unclear. This is an update of a review last published in 2020, with one new study added. It is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antiseptics for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The date of the latest search was 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agent of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders, or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antiseptics (a) compared to placebo or no intervention, and (b) compared to another topical antiseptic (e.g. topical antiseptic A versus topical antiseptic B). Within each comparison, we separated studies into (a) those in which both groups of participants had received aural toileting in addition to the topical antiseptics, and those where neither group had received aural toileting, and (b) those in which both groups had received some other concomitant treatment (such as antibiotics) and those with no such concomitant treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We found one new study (32 participants) in this update, for a total of six included studies with 435 participants (over four studies), plus 222 ears that could not be accounted for in participant numbers (in two studies). Four studies compared topical antiseptics with no treatment or placebo, and two studies compared two different topical antiseptics (boric acid versus acetic acid, and boric acid versus hydrogen peroxide). The two core comparisons of interest are reported below; other comparisons are described in the Results section of the review. No study measured health-related quality of life or ear pain. 1. Topical antiseptic versus placebo or no treatment Three studies (297 participants plus 174 ears) compared topical antiseptics with no treatment. Evidence from one study (unclear number of participants, 174 ears) is very uncertain about the effect of a single application of povidone iodine in hydroxypropyl methyl-cellulose (HPMC) on resolution of ear discharge at one week compared to HPMC alone; however, these results were only provided by ear (rather than by participant) and therefore could not be used quantitatively (very low-certainty evidence). One study (254 children; cluster-RCT) found that boric acid in alcohol ear drops with dry mopping may help resolution of ear discharge after four weeks compared with dry mopping alone, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.47; 180 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We made adjustments to the data to account for the intracluster correlation. This study narratively described no clear differences in suspected ototoxicity or hearing outcomes between study arms, but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Evidence from one study (43 children; 58 ears) is very uncertain about the effect of antiseptics on serious complications. The study reported one case of mastoiditis and one of meningitis with focal encephalitis; however, it was unclear whether these were detected pre-randomisation or during/after treatment. 2. Topical antiseptics versus no treatment/placebo, where both study arms received systemic antibiotics One study (32 participants) compared topical povidone iodine with placebo (saline) in conjunction with oral amoxicillin and dry mopping. Topical povidone iodine with oral amoxicillin and dry mopping may increase resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.35 to 7.84; 32 participants; low-certainty evidence). The study narratively reported no ototoxicity in the topical antiseptic arm; however, this was unclear for the placebo group, so we do not know if povidone iodine increases suspected ototoxicity (low-certainty evidence). The study did not assess resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, hearing, or serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain about the effect of topical antiseptics on improving resolution of ear discharge in people with CSOM given the low and very low certainty of the evidence, which was mostly due to risk of bias and imprecision. However, there is some evidence suggesting that boric acid in alcohol ear drops with dry mopping may help resolution of ear discharge compared with dry mopping alone, and that topical povidone iodine may be more effective than placebo (where both arms used systemic beta-lactam antibiotics and dry mopping). There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about harmful effects. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^991f9644]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — key action statements and options specify that clinicians should recommend against ear candling for treating or preventing cerumen impaction, should assess patients at the conclusion of in-office treatment and document resolution of impaction, should use additional treatment if impaction is not resolved, should evaluate for alternative diagnoses if full or partial symptoms persist despite resolution, and should refer patients with persistent cerumen impaction to clinicians with specialized equipment and training to clean and evaluate ear canals and tympanic membranes. The panel offered options stating clinicians may use cerumenolytic agents (including water or saline solution), may use irrigation, may use manual removal requiring instrumentation, and may educate/counsel patients with cerumen impaction or excessive cerumen regarding control measures.

### Topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^4d9857a8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antiseptics, one of the possible treatments for CSOM, inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antiseptics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antiseptics or their application can cause irritation of the skin of the outer ear, manifesting as discomfort, pain or itching. Some antiseptics (such as alcohol) may have the potential to be toxic to the inner ear (ototoxicity), with a possible increased risk of causing sensorineural hearing loss, dizziness or tinnitus.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 4, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agent of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. Two main comparisons were topical antiseptics compared to: a) placebo or no intervention; and b) another topical antiseptic (e.g. topical antiseptic A versus topical antiseptic B). Within each comparison we separated studies where both groups of patients had received topical antiseptics a) alone or with aural toileting and b) on top of antibiotic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

Five studies were included. It was not possible to calculate the total number of participants as two studies only provided the number of ears included in the study. A. Topical antiseptic (boric acid) versus placebo or no treatment (all patients had aural toileting) Three studies compared topical antiseptics with no treatment, with one study reporting results we could use (254 children; cluster-RCT). This compared the instillation of boric acid in alcohol drops versus no ear drops for one month (both arms used daily dry mopping). We made adjustments to the data to account for the intra-cluster correlation. The very low certainty of the evidence means it is uncertain whether or not treatment with an antiseptic leads to an increase in resolution of ear discharge at both four weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 3.16; 174 participants) and at three to four months (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.47; 180 participants). This study narratively described no differences in suspected ototoxicity or hearing outcomes between the arms (very low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported results for health-related quality of life, adverse effects or serious complications. B. Topical antiseptic A versus topical antiseptic B Two studies compared different antiseptics but only one (93 participants), comparing a single instillation of boric acid powder with daily acetic acid ear drops, provided any information for this comparison. The very low certainty of the evidence means that it is uncertain whether more patients had resolution of ear discharge with boric acid powder compared to acetic acid at four weeks (RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.53; 93 participants), or whether there was a difference between the arms with respect to ear discomfort due to the low number of reported events (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.81; 93 participants). Narratively, the study reported no difference in hearing outcomes between the groups. None of the included studies reported any of the other primary or secondary outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to paucity of the evidence and the very low certainty of that which is available the effectiveness and safety profile of antiseptics in the treatment of CSOM is uncertain.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^0bf0e4e1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Ear hygiene practices and risk groups — survey data and clinician guidance indicate that in 2 studies about 90% of respondents believed that ears should be cleaned and reported regular self- or child ear cleaning; those particularly susceptible to cerumen impaction are children, the elderly, and the cognitively impaired, and hearing aid users also have a higher incidence of impaction; consensus opinion from clinicians is that cerumen impaction may be exacerbated by using hearing aids and cotton-tipped swabs; therefore, the clinician should discuss proper care and cleaning of hearing aids with patients and caregivers; one study found that inserting foreign objects into the ears was common in > 90% of health workers, with approximately 9% reporting injuries to the ears as a result of cleaning; and a higher incidence of cerumen has been reported in children whose ears were cleaned with cotton-tipped swabs.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^a8f07851]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — administering ototopical drops and wick care — instructions include lying down with the affected ear upward, putting enough drops in the ear canal to fill it, and remaining in this position for 3 to 5 minutes; gentle to‑and‑fro movement of the ear or pressing on the tragus can aid delivery; keeping the ear dry and avoiding self‑cleaning are advised; if drops do not easily enter, clinician cleaning or wick placement may be needed; if a wick is placed, it may fall out on its own as inflammation clears, and patients are told, "Do not remove the wick yourself unless instructed to do so"; after placing drops, the canal is best left open to dry to avoid trapping moisture and infected debris.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^61e2e6cc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Supporting text — observation without routine treatment is reasonable when cerumen is not causing symptoms or impeding assessment. The guideline states that such cerumen "can safely be left alone" and that "observation over time can be offered as reasonable management". In a randomized controlled study managed with observation alone, "After 5 days, 5% of patients in the control group demonstrated complete cleaning of the ear canal and 26%, moderate cleansing, when managed with observation alone without any intervention". In another cohort managed without intervention "after a year", developmentally delayed individuals with "50% to 80% of their external canal occluded by cerumen" had follow-up where "44% had no cerumen; 53% still had the same amount but no conductive hearing loss; and only 3% progressed to impaction associated with hearing loss". For diagnostic testing, "cerumen does not appear to interfere significantly with temperature measurement based on infrared ear devices", and in a prospective emergency room study "cerumen impaction was found in 73 of 666 ears examined (11% of ears)" among "333 patients", with "Ear temperature measurement increased only 0.2°C after the cerumen removal" and "This difference had no clinically significant effect on decision making". It also notes that "Most cerumen is asymptomatic and does not impair necessary physical examination" and "It is important that patients understand that cerumen does not always need to be removed".

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^7fe9b328]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — aural toilet and adherence to enhance topical delivery — the purpose is "to maximize the efficacy of topical therapy by ensuring that it penetrates the ear canal and reaches the site of infection", and clinicians are told it is important to inform patients how to administer ear drops and that they may need to have the canal cleaned if obstructed by debris; adherence is suboptimal because "Only 40% of patients who self‑medicate do so appropriately during the first 3 days", and adherence increases when someone other than the patient applies the drops; the ear canal should be cleared of inflammatory debris, obstructing cerumen, or any foreign object, and there are no randomized studies of the use of aural toilet in AOE; clinician‑performed aural toilet may use gentle lavage with body‑temperature water, saline solution, or hydrogen peroxide, with alternatives including suction or dry mop; there are no randomized trials addressing safety of aural lavage in diabetic or immunocompromised patients, lavage for cerumen impaction in elderly or diabetic patients has been implicated as a contributing factor in malignant otitis externa, and irrigation with tap water is a potential iatrogenic factor, so high‑risk patients or those with established malignant otitis externa may require atraumatic cleaning with aural suctioning under microscopic guidance; the statement includes "Benefits‑harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm", notes the value judgment that cleaning was appropriate when necessary to improve penetration of the drops, and indicates "Policy level: Recommendation".

### Ear drops for the removal of ear wax [^50df544b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Problems attributed to the accumulation of wax (cerumen) are one of the most common reasons for people to present to their general practitioners with ear trouble (Sharp 1990). Treatment for this condition often involves use of a wax softening agent (cerumenolytic) in order to disperse the cerumen and reduce the need for syringing, or to facilitate syringing should it prove necessary, but there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the wide variety of cerumenolytics in use.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of ear drops (cerumenolytics) for the removal of symptomatic ear wax.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1, 2003), and MEDLINE and EMBASE up to March 2003. Reference lists of all trials were also manually searched.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials (with or without blinding) in which a cerumenolytic was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment, a placebo, or other cerumenolytics in participants with hard or impacted ear wax, and in which the proportion of participants with sufficient clearance of the external canal to make further mechanical clearance unnecessary (primary outcome measure) was stated or calculable. The full text articles of all the retrieved trials of possible relevance were reviewed by the two reviewers and the inclusion criteria applied independently. Any differences in opinion about which studies to include in the review were resolved by discussion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were graded for methodological quality using the Cochrane approach. Data extraction was performed in a standardised manner by one reviewer and rechecked by the other reviewer, and where necessary investigators were contacted to obtain missing information. Meta-analysis was neither possible nor considered appropriate because of the heterogeneity of the treatments, treatment amounts and durations, trial procedures, and scoring systems. A narrative overview of the results is therefore presented.

Main Results

Eight trials satisfied the inclusion criteria, the majority of which were of poor quality. In all, 587 participants received one of nine different cerumenolytics. One trial compared active treatments with no treatment, two trials compared active treatments with water or a saline 'placebo', and all eight trials placed two or more active treatments in head-to-head comparisons. Seven trials included syringing as a secondary treatment where necessary. Overall, results were inconclusive. One trial found a significant difference between one of three active agents (Cerumol) in comparison to no treatment, but no statistically significant difference was found between these three agents (sodium bicarbonate ear drops; Cerumol; sterile water). In two trials no statistical difference was found between the effectiveness of either sodium bicarbonate ear drops, Cerumol, Cerumenex or Colace versus a sterile water or saline 'placebo'. Three trials (from the same source) found statistically significant differences in favour of the same active agent (Exterol) in comparison to glycerol and Cerumol. Three trials found no statistically significant difference between two or more cerumenolytics (Otocerol versus Cerumol; Audax versus Earex; sodium bicarbonate ear drops versus Cerumol). Two trials comparing the same two cerumenolytics (Cerumenex versus Colace) also failed to show any significant benefit of one over the other. No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Trials to date have been heterogeneous and of poor quality, making it difficult to offer any definitive recommendations on the effectiveness of cerumenolytics for the removal of symptomatic ear wax. Future trials should be of high methodological quality, have large sample sizes, and compare both oil-based and water-based solvents with placebo and/or no treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^c3885432]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Ear tubes — indications and water guidance emphasize benefits and simple precautions. Ear tubes are recommended for "frequent ear infections or prolonged fluid in the ears" to "Help decrease the number of ear infections", allow treatment with "antibiotic ear drops instead of antibiotics that are taken by mouth", "Help prevent fluid from backing up" into the middle ear, and "Improve hearing" reduced by fluid. For water activities, "Your child will not usually need ear plugs", and "Head bands or other special efforts… are also unnecessary, but may be helpful" when there is "Pain or discomfort when water enters the ear canal", "Current fluid or drainage", "Swimming in lakes or non-chlorinated pools that are not clean", or "Dunking head in the bathtub". The guide cautions, "NEVER use Play-Doh or Silly Putty as an ear plug — these materials can become trapped in the ear canal and even require surgical removal".

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^ced97147]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — interventions not recommended include home use of oral jet irrigators and cotton‑tipped swabs; research demonstrating effectiveness of these home options is lacking and expert opinion favors clinician‑administered methods as the most safe and effective. Expert opinion recommends against cotton‑tipped swabs, product labeling warns not to place them into the ear canal, a case report describes fatal otogenic meningitis and brain abscess due to retained cotton swabs, and in a prospective study Thirty‑six percent of the patients cleaned their ears by introducing a foreign object into the ear.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^c7828631]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — epidemiology and healthcare burden is characterized by high prevalence and service use, with excessive or impacted cerumen present in 1 in 10 children, 1 in 20 adults, and more than one-third of the geriatric and developmentally delayed populations, and accumulation due to failure of the self-cleaning mechanism being one of the most common reasons patients seek ear-related care. In the United States, about 12 million people annually seek medical care for problematic cerumen, resulting in nearly 8 million cerumen removal procedures, with nearly $50 million spent by Medicare in 2012 and cerumen impaction diagnosed in up to 5% of Medicare patients. High-risk groups such as the elderly and developmentally delayed are noted as underdiagnosed and likely undertreated.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in clean and clean-contaminated ear surgery [^e59066d6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Ear surgery may be performed in the treatment of chronic otitis media, ossicular chain disorders, tympanic membrane perforations and otitis media with effusion. Postoperative infection in ear surgery may result in: Wound infections Infection of the middle ear or mastoid resulting in discharge from the ear canal Failure of the tympanic membrane to close Labyrinthitis due to infection in, or adjacent to, the inner ear These complications may be associated with discomfort and inconvenience for the patient, an increase in morbidity and an increase in the costs of medical care.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of local and/or systemic antibiotics for preventing complications such as postoperative discharge, graft failure and labyrinthitis in patients undergoing clean or clean-contaminated ear surgery.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to December 2002), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to December 2002), the Science Citation Index, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library, Issue 4 2002); the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group and Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Group Specialised Registers and proceedings of scientific meetings. The date of the last search was December 2002. We also contacted investigators in the field (Govaerts, Antwerp). Bibliographies of identified articles were screened for further relevant trials. No language restriction was applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials involving:

Participants

patients undergoing clean or clean-contaminated types of ear surgery. Skull base surgery was excluded.

Intervention

any regimen of local and/or systemic antibiotic prophylaxis administered at or around the time of surgery compared to placebo, no antibiotic, or an alternative intervention group.

Outcome Measures

infection, discharge, graft failure, labyrinthitis, adverse effects of prophylaxis.

Data Collection and Analysis

When possible, investigators were contacted for additional information on data and methodological issues. At least two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Eleven studies were included in the review. The methodological quality of the trials was fair to good. However, most studies presented insufficient detail on methodological data. Although definitions of outcome measures were heterogeneous, pooling of results was possible. There were no significant differences between antibiotic prophylaxis groups and control groups in terms of reduction of postoperative infections, graft failures, draining outer ear canals and adverse drug effects.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is no strong evidence that the large scale use of prophylactic of antibiotics in clean and clean-contaminated ear surgery is helpful in reducing postoperative complications such as wound infection, discharge from the outer ear canal, labyrinthitis and graft failure.

### Adherence to antibiotic prescribing guidelines in Dutch primary care: an analysis of national prescription data on ear and respiratory tract symptoms and conditions among 384 general practices [^92bd70cf]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Dutch general practitioners commonly adhere well to antibiotic prescribing guidelines for ear and respiratory tract infections. Nevertheless, for certain ICPC-coded conditions, especially for the respiratory tract, antibiotics are more often prescribed than would be expected based solely on the guidelines. This does not necessarily mean that patients received suboptimal treatment, as valid reasons exist for deviating from guidelines. However, given the considerable variation between general practices, it seems that optimization of antibiotic prescribing is possible for at least the practices with the highest prescribing rates. Given the relatively good antibiotic prescribing practice from an international perspective, Dutch practice could be exemplary in other settings.

Cerumen impaction — precautions for removal and irrigation highlight safety considerations and technique selection. The suspicion of a nonintact tympanic membrane should be assessed by history and/or physical examination prior to selection of a disimpaction technique, and prior tympanic membrane perforation, prior ear surgery, intratympanic injections, tympanostomy tubes, or barotrauma should prompt use of techniques other than irrigation. Current otitis externa should also be identified; if the ear canal is currently infected, irrigation should be avoided. Pain should alert clinicians to possible infection or other pathology, and if present the ear should be assessed before selecting a method of cleaning. In the presence of a perforated tympanic membrane, irrigation could produce caloric effects resulting in vertigo, some agents can be toxic to the middle or inner ear, and mechanical removal is the preferred technique when eardrum perforation is suspected. Safe and effective irrigation is not always possible in patients with narrow or stenotic ear canals, and specialized equipment and procedures may be required to safely remove cerumen in these patients. A perforated tympanic membrane or patent tympanostomy tube likewise limits options available for cerumen removal.

Table 7 — patient education for cerumen (earwax) outlines Do items such as recognizing that earwax is normal and that earwax not causing symptoms or blocking the ear canal should be left alone; understanding symptoms of cerumen impaction (decreased hearing, fullness, tinnitus, and changes to hearing aid function); seeking medical evaluation for hearing loss, ear fullness, or ear pain when the cause is uncertain because other conditions can masquerade as cerumen impaction; asking a provider about safe home treatments; and seeking medical attention for ear pain, drainage, or bleeding. The Don't items include: overclean your ears; put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear; use ear candles because there is no evidence they remove impacted cerumen and they can cause serious damage; ignore symptoms if home remedies are unsuccessful; irrigate or try cerumen-removing/softening drops after ear surgery or with a perforated eardrum unless cleared by an otolaryngologist; and forget to clean hearing aids as recommended by the manufacturer or hearing health professional.

Because there is no demonstrated advantage of one method over another, method choice should depend on available resources, clinician experience, canal clearance ease, and shared decision making; methods can be combined, while irrigation and cerumenolytics should not be used with a nonintact tympanic membrane, and the policy level is a Recommendation. A systematic review identified 24 studies and determined that softening by any agent was more effective than no softening and that removal by a nurse practitioner/professional was better than self‑irrigation.

How often should Ofloxacin Otic Solution be given?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given once daily at about the same time each day (for example, 8 AM or 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

In patients with a Middle Ear Infection, Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given 2 times each day (about 12 hours apart, for example 8 AM and 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise. The best times to use the ear drops are in the morning and at night.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops are not used for as long as the doctor has instructed, the infection may be more likely to return.

What if a dose is missed?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), it is important that you take the drops every day. If you miss a dose which may have been scheduled for earlier in the day, (for example, 8 AM), you should take that day's dose as soon as possible and then go back to your regular daily dosing schedule.

In patients with Middle Ear Infection, if a dose of Ofloxacin Otic Solution is missed, it should be given as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule.

Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the infection is not improved after one week, you should consult your doctor. If you have two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended that you see your doctor for further evaluation.

What activities should be avoided while using Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

It is important that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet. Avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

### Ear drops for the removal of ear wax [^63ef71c8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Problems attributed to the accumulation of wax (cerumen) are among the most common reasons for people to present to their general practitioners with ear trouble. Treatment for this condition often involves use of a wax softening agent (cerumenolytic) to disperse the cerumen, reduce the need for, or facilitate syringing, but there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the variety of cerumenolytics in use.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of ear drops (cerumenolytics) for the removal of symptomatic ear wax.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2008 issue 2); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; ISI Proceedings; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was April 2008.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials in which a cerumenolytic was compared with no treatment, a placebo, or other cerumenolytics in participants with obstructing or impacted ear wax, and in which the proportion of participants with sufficient clearance of the external canal to make further mechanical clearance unnecessary (primary outcome measure) was stated or calculable.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors reviewed all the retrieved trials and applied the inclusion criteria independently.

Main Results

Nine trials satisfied the inclusion criteria. In all, 679 participants received one of 11 different cerumenolytics. One trial compared active treatments with no treatment, three compared active treatments with water or a saline 'placebo', and all nine trials compared two or more active treatments. Eight trials included syringing as a secondary intervention. Overall, results were inconclusive. The majority of comparisons showed no difference between treatments. Meta-analysis of two high quality trials produced a statistical difference in favour of triethanolamine polypeptide over saline in preventing the need for syringing, but no other significant differences between treatments. In three trials of high to moderate quality, no difference was found between the effectiveness of either sodium bicarbonate ear drops, chlorbutanol, triethanolamine polypeptide oleate condensate or docusate sodium liquid versus a sterile water or saline 'placebo'. One trial of moderate methodological quality found all three treatments - sodium bicarbonate ear drops, chlorbutanol and sterile water - to be significantly better than no treatment at preventing the need for syringing. None of the higher quality trials demonstrated superiority of one agent over another in direct comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Trials have been heterogeneous and generally of low or moderate quality, making it difficult to offer any definitive recommendations on the effectiveness of cerumenolytics for the removal of symptomatic ear wax. Using drops of any sort appears to be better than no treatment, but it is uncertain if one type of drop is any better than another. Future trials should be of high methodological quality, have large sample sizes, and compare both oil-based and water-based solvents with placebo, no treatment or both.

Cerumenolytic agents for cerumen impaction — reviews evaluated 15 preparations and found weak evidence that both water- and oil-based eardrops were more effective than no treatment; pooled data suggested that longer treatment results in greater success in clearing of cerumen; weak evidence suggested using a cerumenolytic either alone or prior to irrigation was more beneficial than either no treatment or irrigation alone; another review found no benefit of one cerumenolytic agent over another but that use of a cerumenolytic followed by self-irrigation at home was the most cost-effective protocol compared with cerumenolytic plus professional irrigation or no treatment; overall, any type of cerumenolytic agent tends to be superior to no treatment but no particular agent is superior, and in vitro studies support using a true cerumenolytic rather than an oil-based lubricant, with a longer period of treatment tending to be more efficacious.

Objective

To assess practice patterns regarding antibiotics prophylaxis in otologic surgery in the United States.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting

Tertiary care center.

Subjects

Members of American Neurotology Society (ANS).

Intervention

Nationwide survey.

Main Outcome Measures

Prevalence of antibiotic prescribing among surgeons performing the following six ear surgical procedures: cochlear implantation, tympanoplasty with a clean ear, tympanoplasty with active drainage, cholesteatoma surgery without evidence of infection, cholesteatoma surgery with evidence of infection, and stapedectomy.

Results

Seventy-three surgeons completed the survey (15.21% response rate). Twenty-seven percent had more than 25 years in experience, and 18% had 0 to 5 years of experience. Antibiotic prescribing practices varied by procedure: cochlear implantation (64.4%, median 5 d), tympanoplasty (clean ear: 23.3%, median 5 d; active drainage: 53.4%, median 7 d), cholesteatoma surgery (no infection: 30.1%, median 7 d; with infection: 58.9%, median 7 d), and stapedectomy (34.2%, mean 5 d). Cephalosporins were preferred for noninfected procedures, whereas amoxicillin dominated for active infections.

Conclusions

Prophylactic oral antibiotics varies for ear surgery, with higher usage for procedures with active infection and a preference for cephalosporins in noninfected cases. These findings underscore the need for the development and dissemination of standardized, evidence-based recommendations.

### Chronic external otitis [^ab71cb28]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic external otitis is probably a disease of mixed etiology; infection and hypersensitivity both play an important role. As such, these two components must be recognized and respected. Steroids are the mainstay of medical management. Antibiotics should be used cautiously and probably on an intermittent basis. The disease appears to be exacerbated by any manipulation of the canal, including aggressive cleansing. Medical therapy will slow the development of fibrosis in some cases, but it does not always prevent it. Once stenosis has progressed to the point that conductive hearing loss develops, surgery will restore hearing and prevent restenosis in at least 80% of cases.

Cerumen impaction — posttreatment assessment and additional treatment emphasizes verifying successful removal and symptom resolution; efficacy is variable, with "effectiveness of the various treatments ranging from 65% to 90%", and "nearly 10% of attempts at removal were unsuccessful" with manual removal with microsuction. Posttreatment "reevaluation of the patient is necessary after the impaction has been resolved", and outcome assessment requires both ear examination and patient symptom assessment. Because procedures "have been associated with otitis externa, bleeding, pain, dizziness, syncope, tinnitus, and tympanic membrane perforation", the posttreatment otoscopic and symptom findings "should be documented in the medical record". Impaction is resolved when the ear can be examined or tested "without the interference of cerumen" and symptoms have resolved. If removal is inadequate to resolve symptoms or permit testing, "additional treatment should be prescribed", which may include repeating the initial method or an alternative strategy such as "softening agents before repeating manual removal", and if the provider cannot clear the impaction safely, "he or she should refer the patient to a provider who has the necessary skills or equipment for proper treatment".

Statement 6 — cerumenolytic agents for cerumen impaction: Clinicians may use cerumenolytic agents (including water or saline solution) in the management of cerumen impaction. Option based on limited randomized trials, with a balance of benefit and harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, with individual treatment arms of randomized trials showing beneficial outcomes and 1 RCT suggesting better outcomes over no treatment. Benefits are safe and effective removal of impacted cerumen, while potential risks, harms, and costs include external otitis, allergic reactions, and otalgia, and costs of agents other than water or saline solution or an office procedure. The benefit–harm assessment is a balance of benefit and harm; the role of patient preferences is a large role for shared decision making; and the policy level is Option. Exceptions include persons with a history of allergic reactions to any component, persons with infection of the ear canal or active dermatitis, and persons with a nonintact tympanic membrane. Topical preparations exist in 3 forms: water based, oil based and nonwater, nonoil based, and water and water-based agents have a cerumenolytic effect by inducing hydration and subsequent fragmentation of corneocytes within the cerumen, whereas oil-based preparations lubricate and soften cerumen without disintegrating cerumen.

Cerumen impaction — background and symptoms note that cerumen, or "earwax", is a naturally occurring substance that cleans, protects, and lubricates the external auditory canal and is the primary reason why the ear canal can become obstructed. Blockage of the ear canal by cerumen can cause symptoms including hearing loss, tinnitus, fullness, itching, otalgia, discharge, odor, and cough, and can prevent diagnostic assessment by preventing complete examination of the external auditory canal and/or eardrum (tympanic membrane).

Interventions

Either miconazole/triamcinolone 0.1% crème gauzes or periodic microscopic removal of the keratin plug.

Main Outcome Measures

No evidence of disease during microscopic inspection of the ear canal.

Results

Successful treatment with miconazole/triamcinolone 0.1% gauzes was seen in 4/7 patients (57%) and successful treatment of periodic cleaning of the ear canal was seen in 1/5 patients (20%).

Conclusions

Topical treatment of KO with miconazole/triamcinolone 0.1% crème gauzes in the ear canal could be considered as a treatment option for patients diagnosed with KO.

Cerumen impaction — Table 8 shared decision grid (key action statement [KAS]) outlines options of observation, cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, and manual removal with key precautions and time requirements. For cerumenolytic agents, they are "not recommended for ages < 3 years and in patients with nonintact ear drums", patients "Instill several drops of earwax-softening products once or twice daily for 3 to 5 days", and application takes " < 5 minutes to instill drops". Irrigation "Should not take > 30 minutes (includes preparation time)", offers "Immediate resolution of symptoms caused by the cerumen impaction", but is "Not recommended for patients with pressure equalization tubes, nonintact eardrum, and susceptibility to ear infection (see KAS 2B)". Manual removal provides "Immediate resolution of symptoms caused by the cerumen impaction", and its method is described as "Earwax is removed by the clinician inserting a curette, forceps, or suction tip into the ear, dislodging the wax, and retracting it", with risks including "Trauma to the ear canal skin leading to bleeding or infection; discomfort from the instruments or noise of the suction; and/or rare tinnitus or hearing loss from the noise of the suction". With observation, a "Small amount of cerumen could progress to impaction".

### Ear wax and ear cleanings… [^8fdd1eef]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Naples JG. Understanding Ear Wax and Ear Cleanings. JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2022; 148:

388. doi: 10.1001/jamaoto.2021.4283 Ear wax, also called cerumen, is a natural and normal product in our outer ear. It is made by the glands of the ear canal skin. All people make cerumen, and it is often a yellow or brownish color. Cerumen is healthy for the ear because it helps keep the ear clean and keep infection away. Although cerumen is a normal part of the ear, it can cause problems for some people. If there is excess cerumen, it can block the ear canal. This is called cerumen impaction. Impaction is more common in people who have narrow ear canals or wear hearing aids. Use of cotton swabs in the ears can also create cerumen impaction. If you do experience a cerumen impaction, there are various ways to fix the problem. Over-the-counter ear drops, such as carbamide peroxide, are often available and can help soften the cerumen and relieve some of the obstruction.

Irrigation of the ears by a trained clinician is also an option, but should be avoided if there are concerns about infection, a hole in the eardrum, or problems other than cerumen. Irrigation and OTC drops are generally considered to have similar effectiveness in relief of the impaction. If you seek care from an otolaryngologist, various small instruments can be used to remove the cerumen impaction. Not everyone forms cerumen impactions or needs routine care for their ear wax. Some people build up cerumen more quickly than others and may need more frequent removals. It is generally recommended to avoid use of cotton swabs and other at-home tools to take out cerumen. This may lead to unnecessary damage to the ear. It is best to discuss with your physician whether routine follow-up and/or attempts to prevent cerumen buildup is recommended for cerumen impaction.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^7d007dfe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — definitions and pathophysiology specify that cerumen is defined as a mixture of secretions (sebum with secretions from modified apocrine sweat glands) and sloughed epithelial cells and is a normal substance in the external auditory canal, forming when glandular secretions from the outer two-thirds of the ear canal mix with exfoliated squamous epithelium and normally migrating out via a self-cleaning mechanism assisted by jaw movement. For this guideline, cerumen impaction is an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms or prevents a needed assessment of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, or audiovestibular system or both; although "impaction" usually implies cerumen is lodged, wedged, or firmly packed, the definition does not require a complete obstruction and implies the cerumen is associated with symptoms or prevents a necessary ear examination. The term is defined pragmatically to designate cerumen that requires management, whereas some patients have nonimpacted, "asymptomatic" cerumen that does not cause symptoms or prevent assessment, and asymptomatic cerumen does not require active management. Anatomically, cerumen is formed in the outer two-thirds (cartilaginous portion) of the ear canal, not the inner third (bony portion) that ends at the eardrum, and impacted cerumen can completely obstruct the ear canal.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION

Therapy with this product should be limited to 10 consecutive days.

The external auditory canal should be thoroughly cleansed and dried with a sterile cotton applicator.

For adults, 4 drops of the suspension should be instilled into the affected ear 3 to 4 times daily. For infants and children, 3 drops are suggested because of the smaller capacity of the ear canal.

The patient should lie with the affected ear upward and then the drops should be instilled. This position should be maintained for 5 minutes to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

If preferred, a cotton wick may be inserted into the canal and then the cotton may be saturated with the suspension. This wick should be kept moist by adding further suspension every 4 hours. The wick should be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

SHAKE WELL BEFORE USING.

Cerumen impaction — research needs highlight that there are significant gaps in knowledge and management and call for studies to improve clinical care. Priorities include to Establish a universal definition of cerumen impaction to make comparisons of management strategies more meaningful; Assess the natural history of cerumen impactions by performing observational studies in untreated populations, including the elderly, children, and developmentally delayed patients; Conduct studies assessing the role of preventive measures, such as emollients and ear hygiene, on the development of cerumen impactions; Assess the various methods of cerumen removal, either as single interventions or combined interventions, through well-designed large-scale RCTs; Determine the efficacy of manual removal of cerumen through prospective studies; Assess comparative impact of different cerumenolytic agents through well-designed clinical trials; Evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic topical antibiotics in preventing otitis externa when local trauma occurs during cerumen removal; Conduct a financial analysis comparing the various methods of cerumen management; Determine the relative efficacy of cerumenolytic agents and irrigation for adult, elderly, and pediatric patients and for patients at high risk for complications related to cerumen removal due to underlying conditions (ie, diabetes, coagulopathies); and Evaluate the impact of cerumen removal on the resolution of symptoms, such as itching, hearing loss, pain, fullness, tinnitus, and vertigo, through prospective clinical studies. Additional priorities are to Establish that studies evaluating cerumen removal should document adverse events, Assess variation in outcomes for cerumen removal relative to the type of health care provider managing the patient (ie, nurse, physician assistant, physician, medical assistant), and Conduct financial analyses of the relative costs for cerumen management when performed by different types of health care providers.

Aural irrigation for cerumen impaction — practice and adjuncts are described: Aural irrigation is a widely practiced form of cerumen removal and can be performed with a syringe or electronic irrigator, and manual irrigation with a large syringe is the most commonly employed method in general practice with the water close to body temperature to avoid caloric effects; while there are no randomized controlled clinical trials of aural irrigation versus no treatment, there is general consensus that aural irrigation is effective in removing cerumen; systematic reviews indicate pretreatment (15 minutes before irrigation) with an otic drop improves efficacy and that saline and tap water may be as good as specially formulated products; self‑irrigation may be a cost‑effective alternative with comparable outcomes and satisfaction to provider care and, at 2‑year follow‑up, fewer return visits, although the ability of patients to perform weekly irrigation at home has not been demonstrated and jet irrigators should be avoided for home use due to risk of damage to ear structures; one small study reported that following clearance of impaction, weekly aural irrigation with 70% isopropyl alcohol over a 2‑month period resulted in fewer recurrent impactions.

### Systemic antibiotics versus topical treatments for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^24fe5032]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

Objectives

To compare systemic antibiotics and topical antiseptics or antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with an underlying eardrum perforation (CSOM).

Search Strategy

The Cochrane ENT Disorders Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965) PREMEDLINE, Metadatabase of registers of ongoing trials (mRCT), and article references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials; any systemic versus topical treatment (excluding steroids); participants with CSOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data into RevMan; two authors provided a second assessment of titles and abstracts, and inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.

Main Results

Nine trials (833 randomised participants; 842 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included mastoid cavity infections, other diagnoses, or complications. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than systemic antibiotics at clearing discharge at 1–2 weeks: relative risks (RR) were, 3.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 5.49) using systemic non-quinolone antibiotics (2 trials, N = 116), and 3.18 (1.87 to 5.43) using systemic quinolone (3 trials, N = 175); or 2.75 (1.38 to 5.46) in favour of systemic plus topical quinolone over systemic quinolone alone (2 trials, N = 90). No statistically significant benefit was seen at 2–4 weeks for topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or topical antiseptic over systemic antibiotics (mostly non-quinolones), but numbers were small: one trial tested topical non-quinolones (N = 31); two tested antiseptics (N = 152). No benefit of adding systemic to topical treatment at 1–2 weeks was detected either, although evidence was limited (three trials, N = 204). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak. Adverse events reported were generally mild, although hearing worsened by ototoxicity (damaging auditory hair cells) was seen with chloramphenicol drops (non-quinolone antibiotic).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than systemic antibiotics; topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or antiseptic results are less clear. Evidence regarding safety was weak. Further studies should clarify topical non-quinolones and antiseptic effectiveness, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications), and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether there may be fewer adverse events with topical quinolones than other topical or systemic treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^c6dd2586]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of the 2008 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation cerumen impaction clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing cerumen impaction. Cerumen impaction is defined as an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms, prevents assessment of the ear, or both. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the development group; new evidence (3 guidelines, 5 systematic reviews, and 6 randomized controlled trials); enhanced information on patient education and counseling; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; expanded action statement profiles to explicitly state quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, intentional vagueness, and differences of opinion; an enhanced external review process to include public comment and journal peer review; and 3 new key action statements on managing cerumen impaction that focus on primary prevention, contraindicated intervention, and referral and coordination of care. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to help clinicians identify patients with cerumen impaction who may benefit from intervention and to promote evidence-based management. Another purpose of the guideline is to highlight needs and management options in special populations or in patients who have modifying factors. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction, and it applies to any setting in which cerumen impaction would be identified, monitored, or managed. The guideline does not apply to patients with cerumen impaction associated with the following conditions: dermatologic diseases of the ear canal; recurrent otitis externa; keratosis obturans; prior radiation therapy affecting the ear; previous tympanoplasty/myringoplasty, canal wall down mastoidectomy, or other surgery affecting the ear canal. Key Action Statements The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, cerumen impaction, defined as an accumulation of cerumen that is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should explain proper ear hygiene to prevent cerumen impaction when patients have an accumulation of cerumen. (2) Clinicians should diagnose cerumen impaction when an accumulation of cerumen, as seen on otoscopy, is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. (3) Clinicians should assess the patient with cerumen impaction by history and/or physical examination for factors that modify management, such as ≥ 1 of the following: anticoagulant therapy, immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, prior radiation therapy to the head and neck, ear canal stenosis, exostoses, and nonintact tympanic membrane. (4) Clinicians should not routinely treat cerumen in patients who are asymptomatic and whose ears can be adequately examined. (5) Clinicians should identify patients with obstructing cerumen in the ear canal who may not be able to express symptoms (young children and cognitively impaired children and adults), and they should promptly evaluate the need for intervention. (6) Clinicians should perform otoscopy to detect the presence of cerumen in patients with hearing aids during a health care encounter. (7) Clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, the patient with cerumen impaction with an appropriate intervention, which may include ≥ 1 of the following: cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, or manual removal requiring instrumentation. (8) Clinicians should recommend against ear candling for treating or preventing cerumen impaction. (9) Clinicians should assess patients at the conclusion of in-office treatment of cerumen impaction and document the resolution of impaction. If the impaction is not resolved, the clinician should use additional treatment. If full or partial symptoms persist despite resolution of impaction, the clinician should evaluate the patient for alternative diagnoses. (10) Finally, if initial management is unsuccessful, clinicians should refer patients with persistent cerumen impaction to clinicians who have specialized equipment and training to clean and evaluate ear canals and tympanic membranes. The panel offered the following as options: (1) Clinicians may use cerumenolytic agents (including water or saline solution) in the management of cerumen impaction. (2) Clinicians may use irrigation in the management of cerumen impaction. (3) Clinicians may use manual removal requiring instrumentation in the management of cerumen impaction. (4) Last, clinicians may educate/counsel patients with cerumen impaction or excessive cerumen regarding control measures.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — patient information for topical therapy states that eardrops alone are the most effective treatment, while antibiotics taken by mouth "should be used only when infection spreads beyond the ear canal, eardrops cannot get into the ear, or the immune system is weak"; all approved eardrops are "highly effective, with no consistent advantage" for a specific drug. Most patients "feel better within 48 to 72 hours and have minimal or no symptoms by 7 days", and drops "should be used for at least 7 days" with continuation "for a maximum of 7 additional days" if symptoms persist. "Pain‑relieving (anesthetic) eardrops are not recommended", and keeping the ear dry is important; a "cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly" may be used before showering. Eardrops are generally safe, but tasting the drops suggests a perforation and patients should inform a doctor, and they should also call a doctor if the drops become painful or unexpected symptoms develop.

### In vitro efficacy of a consumer-marketed ear cleaning tool [^08086cf2]. Otology & Neurotology (2014). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

The WaxVac ear cleaning device may be a useful adjunct for patients requiring aural toilet.

Background

Cerumen removal and routine aural toilet is a common complaint that presents to the otolaryngology clinic. We tested this device to make an appropriate recommendation to our patients.

Methods

We conducted in vitro testing of the WaxVac device on an artificial ear canal model and cadaveric temporal bones testing the strength of the suction, noise created by the device, and the ability of the device to remove foreign bodies from the external auditory canal. These foreign bodies included a PE tube, baby powder, a q-tip head, saline, and artificial cerumen.

Results

The WaxVac created very little suction as compared with Frazier tip suctions used in clinic. The device produced very little noise in the canal, which was equivalent to a #3 Frazier tip suction. The WaxVac was unable to remove q-tip heads or artificial cerumen from the ear canal model or the cadaveric temporal bones. Very little of the saline could be removed by the WaxVac, and only 20% to 50% of trials demonstrated removal of a PE tube. However, a large amount of the powder was able to be removed by the device.

Conclusion

Although the concept of this device is good, the actual product does not produce adequate suction to remove cerumen or most common foreign bodies from the external auditory canal. It is unlikely to be useful for aural toilet.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — follow-up and treatment failure notes that follow-up is warranted if symptoms fail to resolve completely by 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Initial treatment failure of diffuse AOE may be caused by an obstructed ear canal, poor adherence to therapy, misdiagnosis, microbiologic factors, host factors, or contact sensitivity to eardrops. If topical antimicrobial therapy was prescribed, the clinician should reassess the patency of the ear canal to ensure that edema or debris are not impeding drug delivery. Any obstruction should be addressed with aural toilet, wick placement, or both, or if the obstruction cannot be relieved, systemic therapy is begun with an oral antibiotic that covers P aeruginosa and S aureus.

### Adherence to antibiotic prescribing guidelines in Dutch primary care: an analysis of national prescription data on ear and respiratory tract symptoms and conditions among 384 general practices [^57339548]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for practice

There can be reasons why not adhering to guidelines is the better choice. A static body of data does not reflect the fluidity of daily general practice in which general practitioners can and sometimes must be flexible in their interpretation of guidelines based on the clinical presentation of patients. This means that for certain diagnoses, contrary to guidelines, prescribing antibiotics might be justified in specific cases. Moreover, guidelines can be ambiguous in their recommendations, especially for patients with more complex clinical characteristics. Therefore, prescription rates are not expected to be 0% for all conditions without antibiotic indication.

Nevertheless, improved antibiotic prescribing guideline adherence has generally improved antibiotic prescription rates and reduced inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Further implementation of guidelines may improve future antibiotic prescribing. Dutch general practitioners should carefully study their individual prescribing practice and look for indications where they prescribe suboptimal compared to their colleagues. Considering the high practice variability for many conditions, effective measures to improve antibiotic prescribing should target general practitioners individually. Further studies could also focus specifically on the indications for which too many patients receive antibiotics contrary to guidelines. Identifying specific patient groups that receive too many antibiotics could help develop more specific and possible effective interventions. Interventions that have been reported as effective are usually multifaceted and may include audit and feedback, educational meetings and outreach visits, and patient-based interventions. Dutch primary care practice may be exemplary for international practice. It would be valuable to assess which aspects of Dutch primary care positively affect antibiotic prescribing to see if these are transferrable to other settings.

### Ofloxacin (ofloxacin otic) [^47c90c22]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

How should Ofloxacin Otic Solution be given?

BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW FOR THE PATIENT'S SPECIFIC EAR INFECTION.

Repeat Steps 2–5 for the other ear if both ears are infected.

How often should Ofloxacin Otic Solution be given?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given once daily at about the same time each day (for example, 8 AM or 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

In patients with a Middle Ear Infection, Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given 2 times each day (about 12 hours apart, for example 8 AM and 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise. The best times to use the ear drops are in the morning and at night.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops are not used for as long as the doctor has instructed, the infection may be more likely to return.

What if a dose is missed?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), it is important that you take the drops every day. If you miss a dose which may have been scheduled for earlier in the day, (for example 8 AM), you should take that day's dose as soon as possible and then go back to your regular daily dosing schedule.

Type of antibiotic prescribed for ear symptoms and conditions

Otitis externa is treated in just over 30% of cases with a macrolide or broad-spectrum antibiotic, regardless of whether there is an uncertain or no indication for an antibiotic. For patients with otitis externa for whom an antibiotic was uncertain and who did receive an antibiotic, this antibiotic was a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in fewer than half of the cases. Acute otitis media was treated with macrolides or broad-spectrum antibiotics in fewer than 10% of the cases. When an antibiotic was prescribed for patients with acute otitis media with an uncertain or certain indication for an antibiotic, prescribers chose a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in over 90% of the cases (Fig. 2, Supplementary Appendix 4).

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^d03dbb21]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Postoperative otorrhea prevention in children with tympanostomy tubes — saline washout versus antibiotic ear drops: The recommendation against prescribing relates to continuing use of antibiotic ear drops that may be prescribed for up to 10 days after surgery. Based on 2 low‑risk randomized controlled trials (RCTs), saline washouts reduced otorrhea incidence from 30% to 16% (relative risk, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27–1.00) with a number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) of 7 children, while a single application of antibiotic‑steroid ear drops reduced otorrhea from 9% to 1% (relative risk, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03–0.57) with an NNTB of 13. In a trial of 291 children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) whose ears (N = 560) were randomized to four interventions — saline washout, oral amoxicillin for 7 days, oral amoxicillin for 7 days plus ciprofloxacin ear drops for 3 days, or observation — no significant differences in postoperative otorrhea were found, with rates ranging from 1.1% to 12.3%, supporting no added benefit from continuing antibiotic ear drops after surgery when compared with saline washout. A more recent RCT showed no benefit of routine prescribing of antibiotic ear drops as compared with saline solution: Children (N = 174) were randomized to intraoperative ciprofloxacin or normal saline ear drops continued for 5 days after surgery; of the remaining 128 children, about 62% had recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), 21% chronic OME, and 48% mucoid effusions, and there were no differences at 4 or 6 weeks in the incidence, duration, and QOL impact of early tympanostomy tube otorrhea or tube patency between groups.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^bc1d0107]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — patient counseling and self-care Patients should be counseled not to insert any foreign objects into the ear canal because such objects can cause injuries or worsen cerumen impaction by pushing cerumen deeper; susceptible patients can use home measures to control accumulation, including cerumenolytic drops and ear irrigations.

### Topical antibiotics without steroids for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^c764224f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

Objectives

Assess topical antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations (CSOM).

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965), PREMEDLINE, metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), and article references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials; any topical antibiotic without steroids, versus no drug treatment, aural toilet, topical antiseptics, or other topical antibiotics excluding steroids; participants with CSOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data onto RevMan; two authors inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.

Main Results

Fourteen trials (1,724 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included otitis externa, mastoid cavity infections and other diagnoses. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up usually short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week: relative risk (RR) was 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.59) (two trials, N = 197). No statistically significant difference was found between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) at weeks one or three: pooled RR were 0.89 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.32) (three trials, N = 402), and 0.97 (0.54 to 1.72) (two trials, N = 77), respectively. A positive trend in favour of quinolones seen at two weeks was largely due to one trial and not significant after accounting for heterogeneity: pooled RR 0.65 (0.46 to 0.92) (four trials, N = 276) using the fixed-effect model, and 0.64 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.17) accounting for heterogeneity with the random-effects model. Topical quinolones were significantly better at curing CSOM than antiseptics: RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.67) at one week (three trials, N = 263), and 0.58 (0.47 to 0.72) at two to four weeks (four trials, N = 519). Meanwhile, non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) compared to antiseptics were more mixed, changing over time (four trials, N = 254). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than no drug treatment or topical antiseptics; non-quinolone antibiotic effects (without steroids) versus no drug or antiseptics are less clear. Studies were also inconclusive regarding any differences between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics, although indirect comparisons suggest a benefit of topical quinolones cannot be ruled out. Further trials should clarify non-quinolone antibiotic effects, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications) and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether quinolones may result in fewer adverse events than other topical treatments.

### Improving aseptic injection standards in aesthetic clinical practice [^f3573e52]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The distance from a patient that respiratory viruses are infective, and the optimum person‐to‐person physical distance is uncertain. For the current foreseeable future, prevention and mitigation of respiratory infection will be a priority in conjunction with aseptic technique for complication prevention. Decreased transmission of viruses at physical distances of 1 m of greater, compared with closer distances, has implication for any profession working near patients' faces. 36 Face mask and eye protection could result in a large reduction in risk of infection.

Prior to any procedure, patients should be advised to attend clinics with a clean face and without cosmetics. Hair should be kept away from treatment areas to reduce contamination risks, with hairbands used for both patient and injecting practitioner, if necessary. Common antiseptics for cutaneous preparation include isopropyl alcohol, povidone‐iodine, and chlorhexidine. 37 The practitioner should note that isopropyl alcohol may cause irritation, is flammable, 37 and can produce severe ocular burns 38; it should not be used near the eye or peri‐ocular area. Povidone‐iodine is rapidly effective but neutralized by contact with blood or sputum, with the added complication of dying hair and clothing. 37 Chlorhexidine provides a sustained antiseptic effect, but poses a risk to the middle ear and has the potential to irreversibly damage the cornea following minimal splash exposure 37, 39; increasingly, chlorhexidine has been associated with reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. 40 Hypochlorous acid has advantages for skin asepsis, including a well‐tolerated non‐alcohol base, efficacious in reducing microbial loads, and with benefits of specific preparations for peri‐oral and peri‐ocular asepsis. 37, 41 Products such as Clinsept+ (CHT Ltd), a high purity hypochlorous solution, are compatible with skin pH. A pH neutral preparation for mucus membranes and another for eye treatment are also available and can be used as a mouth wash prior to peri‐oral treatment and antimicrobial for peri‐ocular treatment, respectively. If a nasal procedure is required, hypochlorous solution or 0.23% povidone‐iodine solution may be used in a dosage of two sprays per nostril before entering the office. 27 Purifeyes by FaceRestoration can be instilled directly onto the conjunctival surface or sprayed over the periocular area for antimicrobial cleansing prior to facial treatments where the eyes cannot be covered. Challenges from PPE include discomfort, fogging of eye protection, high resource use linked with potentially decreased equity, equipment shortages, and less clear communication.

### The bacteriology of children prior to 1st stage autologous ear reconstruction [^bfe4615d]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

In virtually all surgical specialities the use of peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis to minimise wound site infection is routine practice. Antibiotic selection is targeted towards the pathogens most commonly encountered at the surgical site. The surgical management of microtia is by autologous rib cartilage reconstruction, a process that involves at least two surgical stages. The pits and recesses of the microtia ear are difficult to clean and may shelter unusual pathogens not routinely found as skin commensals, requiring modified prophylaxis. This retrospective review of 37 patients undergoing 1st stage ear reconstruction, examines the pre-operative ear site, nose and throat swabs to determine the common pre-operative bacteria encountered in children prior to ear reconstruction, to aid in appropriate antibiotic selection.
