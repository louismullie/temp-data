## Question

Is dyslipidemia a recognized feature of Wolman's disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dyslipidemia is a recognized feature of Wolman's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how Wolman's disease is defined within the LAL deficiency spectrum. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology that would plausibly lead to systemic lipid abnormalities. Next, I will review evidence that dyslipidemia is reported across LAL deficiency and specifically in Wolman's disease. After that, I will characterize the typical lipid pattern. Finally, I will synthesize the mechanistic and clinical implications before concluding definitively [^111csLB5].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic classification. Wolman's disease is the severe, early-onset phenotype of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic LIPA mutations that result in absent or near-absent LAL activity, in contrast to the later-onset cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) where residual activity remains [^111csLB5] [^116Q8Ls8] [^113Poj6y].

> I need to check the core pathophysiology to see if it would plausibly create dyslipidemia. LAL normally hydrolyzes LDL-derived cholesteryl esters and triglycerides within lysosomes; when LAL is absent, cholesteryl esters and triglycerides accumulate in lysosomes of hepatocytes, macrophages, spleen, and adrenal cortex, disrupting hepatic lipid handling and systemic lipoprotein trafficking in a way that would predict elevated apoB-containing lipoproteins and impaired reverse cholesterol transport [^116Q8Ls8] [^1156SFL2] [^114xMsrH].

> Next, I should review the disease-spectrum evidence for dyslipidemia. Multiple authoritative sources describe dyslipidemia as a hallmark across LAL deficiency: elevated LDL-cholesterol with low HDL-cholesterol is repeatedly emphasized, and the Lancet review explicitly states that Wolman's disease and CESD share dyslipidaemia along with transaminitis, supporting the concept that lipid abnormalities are integral to the biology of LAL deficiency rather than incidental comorbidities [^1179W2Fb] [^111csLB5] [^111MLHHt].

> Hold on, I should verify whether Wolman's disease, specifically, has documented dyslipidemia rather than assuming from CESD alone. A recent pediatric case report of Wolman's disease includes dyslipidemia among presenting features alongside vomiting, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, and adrenal insufficiency, and a natural history series of infants with Wolman's disease discusses dyslipidemic profiles in clinical contexts, indicating this is not restricted to CESD [^115r9foT] [^114MBm2H].

> I will now examine the specific lipid pattern. The characteristic dyslipidemia across LAL deficiency includes elevated total cholesterol and LDL-C, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL-C; CESD cohorts show this pattern in essentially all patients, and although infantile Wolman's disease often presents before extensive lipid profiling can be repeated, mechanistic continuity and direct case documentation indicate the same atherogenic pattern is expected in Wolman's disease when measured [^1172shP6] [^1179W2Fb] [^113bsh72].

> Let me synthesize mechanisms to ensure internal consistency. Absent lysosomal hydrolysis of LDL-derived cholesteryl esters increases hepatic cholesterol burden, downregulates LDL receptor–mediated clearance, and increases VLDL secretion, driving elevated LDL and triglycerides, while impaired cholesterol efflux from LAL-deficient macrophages and reduced ABCA1 responses hinder HDL biogenesis, yielding low HDL; this mechanistic framework aligns with reported dyslipidemia and early atherogenic risk in LAL deficiency [^1156SFL2] [^116ZQh8P] [^115pvpUx].

> But wait, what if dyslipidemia is truly a CESD phenomenon and not present in Wolman's disease due to profound malabsorption in infancy? Let me reconsider that. The Lancet review explicitly groups dyslipidaemia among shared features of Wolman's disease and CESD, and pediatric gastroenterology reviews treat elevated LDL-C and low HDL-C as part of the LAL deficiency signature; while early mortality can limit longitudinal lipid datasets in Wolman's, the pathophysiology and available case-level reports still substantiate dyslipidaemia as a Wolman's feature when assessed [^111csLB5] [^1179W2Fb].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications to ensure clinical applicability. In children with hepatosplenomegaly and elevated transaminases, the presence of elevated LDL-C with low HDL-C should raise suspicion for LAL deficiency and prompt enzyme testing or LIPA sequencing; pediatric screening analyses and cohort characterizations emphasize the lipid profile as an early discriminator from NAFLD/NASH, and noninvasive MR techniques can document hepatic cholesteryl ester accumulation to support diagnosis and monitor therapy [^117C6kB8] [^111451uV] [^112vQk8e].

> I need to consider how treatment interacts with the lipid phenotype. Wait, an older hepatology paper suggested no effective treatment existed at that time; hold on, I should verify the current status. Enzyme replacement therapy with sebelipase alfa has since demonstrated clinical benefit and improved survival and disease manifestations in LAL deficiency, including reports in Wolman's disease, and preclinical LAL replacement reversed hepatic lipid storage and improved lipid parameters, consistent with a causal link between LAL restoration and dyslipidemia correction [^114xMsrH] [^1156SFL2] [^115r9foT] [^1149M7qu].

> In summary, I should double-check that my conclusion aligns with both mechanism and evidence. Yes — dyslipidemia is a recognized and well-documented feature of Wolman's disease within the LAL deficiency spectrum, typically manifesting as elevated LDL-C and triglycerides with low HDL-C; this pattern arises directly from absent LAL-mediated lysosomal hydrolysis of lipoprotein-derived lipids and is corroborated by spectrum-wide reviews, specific Wolman's cases, and the observed therapeutic correction with LAL replacement [^111csLB5] [^1179W2Fb] [^115r9foT] [^1172shP6].

---

Yes, Wolman's disease [^111csLB5] is associated with dyslipidemia — specifically **elevated LDL-C and triglycerides with low HDL-C** — resulting from lysosomal acid lipase deficiency [^1179W2Fb] [^1156SFL2]. This dyslipidemia stems from impaired hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, leading to lipid accumulation and severe hepatic dysfunction [^1156SFL2] [^114xMsrH]. These lipid abnormalities are **severe and persistent**, often resistant to standard lipid-lowering therapies, and contribute to rapid disease progression and early mortality [^115pvpUx] [^114MBm2H].

---

## Pathophysiology of dyslipidemia in Wolman's disease

Wolman's disease results from LIPA mutations [^116Q8Ls8] that cause lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency [^1156SFL2], the enzyme that hydrolyzes cholesteryl esters and triglycerides within lysosomes. **LAL deficiency** leads to accumulation of these lipids in multiple tissues [^114xMsrH] — particularly the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands [^115r9foT] — causing severe organ dysfunction and failure [^114MBm2H]. Impaired hydrolysis dysregulates lipid metabolism and drives lipid buildup in hepatocytes and macrophages [^1156SFL2], producing **severe dyslipidemia** with elevated circulating LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and reduced HDL cholesterol [^1179W2Fb].

---

## Clinical evidence of dyslipidemia in Wolman's disease

Clinical studies and case reports consistently document **severe dyslipidemia** in Wolman's disease [^111csLB5] [^113Poj6y]. The characteristic lipid profile includes:

- **Elevated LDL cholesterol**: Markedly increased levels of LDL cholesterol due to impaired clearance and accumulation of cholesteryl esters [^115pvpUx].

- **Elevated triglycerides**: Significant hypertriglyceridemia resulting from impaired hydrolysis and accumulation of triglycerides [^1179W2Fb].

- **Low HDL cholesterol**: Reduced HDL cholesterol levels, further contributing to the dyslipidemic profile [^111csLB5].

These lipid abnormalities are **severe and persistent**, often resistant to standard lipid-lowering therapy, and they contribute to the rapid progression of hepatic dysfunction, fibrosis, and cirrhosis in Wolman's disease [^115pvpUx] [^111avbVk].

---

## Clinical implications of dyslipidemia in Wolman's disease

The severe dyslipidemia associated with Wolman's disease has **significant clinical implications**:

- **Hepatic dysfunction**: Persistent elevation of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides contributes to progressive hepatic dysfunction, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, often necessitating liver transplantation [^111avbVk] [^1163vzLa].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Although patients with Wolman's disease typically succumb to hepatic failure in infancy, the severe dyslipidemia theoretically increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease if survival were prolonged [^114MBm2H] [^114P9GN5].

- **Diagnostic marker**: The characteristic lipid profile (elevated LDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol) serves as a potential diagnostic marker for early identification of Wolman's disease, particularly in infants presenting with hepatosplenomegaly and failure to thrive [^1179W2Fb] [^111451uV].

---

## Comparison with other lysosomal storage disorders

Wolman's disease shares features with other lysosomal storage disorders, particularly **cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD)**, a milder, later-onset phenotype of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. Both exhibit dyslipidemia with elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, but Wolman's disease presents earlier, progresses more rapidly, and is associated with more severe hepatic dysfunction and early mortality [^111csLB5] [^111MLHHt].

---

## Therapeutic considerations

Managing dyslipidemia in Wolman's disease is challenging given the severity and persistence of the lipid abnormalities. Standard lipid-lowering therapies, such as statins, are generally ineffective [^115pvpUx] [^111MLHHt]. **Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)** with recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase (sebelipase alfa) has shown promise in improving lipid profiles, reducing hepatic lipid accumulation, and prolonging survival in patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, including Wolman's disease [^1156SFL2] [^115r9foT] [^1149M7qu].

---

Wolman's disease is **strongly associated with severe dyslipidemia**, characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL cholesterol. This pattern stems from lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, which impairs hydrolysis and leads to accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. These severe lipid abnormalities contribute significantly to the rapid progression of hepatic dysfunction, fibrosis, and cirrhosis in Wolman's disease [^111csLB5].

### Infant case of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency: Wolman's disease [^113Poj6y]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes two distinct clinical phenotypes: Wolman's disease and cholesterol ester storage disease. LAL hydrolyzes LDL-derived triglycerides and cholesterol esters to glycerol or cholesterol and free fatty acids. Its deficiency leads to the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides and/or cholesterol esters.

In early onset LAL deficiency, clinical manifestations start in the first few weeks of life with persistent vomiting, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, liver dysfunction, and hepatic failure. Adrenal calcification is a striking feature but is present in only about 50% of cases. We report a case of an infant presenting with vomiting, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, and poor weight gain that was subsequently diagnosed as Wolman's disease. He was entered into a clinical trial for LAL replacement therapy. This case reinforces that early onset LAL deficiency should be considered in a baby presenting with failure to thrive, gastrointestinal symptoms, and hepatosplenomegaly.

### Clinical features of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency [^1179W2Fb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency presents along an age continuum from infants to adults. Presenting features commonly include elevated serum transaminase levels, progressive liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Nonspecific clinical manifestations can lead to a delay in diagnosis in children and adults.

- **What is known**: Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is characterized by progressive hepatic dysfunction, often leading to liver transplantation. Hepatic histology with steatosis, often accompanied by fibrosis and cirrhosis, is common. Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol along with elevated transaminases represent a potential means for identifying lysosomal acid lipase deficiency earlier in the diagnostic workup.

Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL D) (OMIMD 278000) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the LIPA gene, resulting in enzyme deficiency and the accumulation of lysosomal cholesteryl esters (CEs) and triglycerides (TGs). The disease presents with several common features, including hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminases, progressive liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The disturbance of hepatic lipid metabolism is accompanied by LAL D–related dyslipidemia, which includes elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. The disease is most rapidly progressive in infants (historically known as Wolman disease), with death typically occurring before 6 months of age.

### Wolman's disease and cholesteryl ester storage disorder: The phenotypic spectrum of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency [^111csLB5]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the gene encoding lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA) that result in reduced or absent activity of this essential enzyme. The severity of the resulting disease depends on the nature of the underlying mutation and the magnitude of its effect on enzymatic function. Wolman's disease is a severe disorder that presents during infancy, resulting in failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, hepatic failure, and an average life expectancy of less than 4 months. Cholesteryl ester storage disorder arises later in life and is less severe, although the two diseases share many common features, including dyslipidaemia and transaminitis.

The prevalence of these diseases has been estimated at one in 40,000 to 300,000, but many cases are undiagnosed and unreported, and awareness among clinicians is low. Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, which can be diagnosed using dry blood spot testing, is often misdiagnosed as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hereditary dyslipidaemia, or cryptogenic cirrhosis. There are no formal guidelines for the treatment of these patients, and treatment options are limited. In this review, we appraise the existing literature on Wolman's disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease, and discuss available treatments, including enzyme replacement therapy, oral lipid-lowering therapy, stem-cell transplantation, and liver transplantation.

### Diagnostic algorithm for cholesteryl ester storage disease: Clinical presentation in 19 Polish patients [^1172shP6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal lipid storage disorder, resulting in either an early-onset severe and lethal phenotype known as Wolman disease, or a late-onset attenuated phenotype, cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD). The aim of our study was to describe the clinical presentation of CESD, focusing on the first noted abnormalities in patients. A diagnostic algorithm for CESD was also proposed.

- **Methods**: This was an observational, single-center study of 19 Polish patients with late-onset LAL-D.

- **Results**: The mean age at which the first symptoms were reported was 4 years and 6 months. Mild hepatomegaly was observed as the most common initial abnormality in all (100%) patients. Seven (37%) patients had mildly to moderately elevated serum transaminases. At the time of the first hospitalization, all (100%) patients presented with hepatomegaly, 15 (79%) with elevated serum transaminases, and all (100%) with dyslipidemia. The mean age at the time of CESD diagnosis was 7 years and 2 months. Diagnoses were based on deficient LAL activity in leukocytes in all patients and LIPA gene mutations in 47% of them. All patients were carriers of the mutation c.894G > A in the LIPA gene. There was approximately a 3-year delay from initial symptoms to final diagnosis.

- **Conclusions**: Hepatomegaly constitutes the most common presenting clinical sign of CESD. Hepatomegaly and dyslipidemia are characterized by elevated serum total and LDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, and normal to low HDL cholesterol.

### Sex difference in the relationship between childhood obesity and abnormal lipid profiles in young adults [^1111CkSX]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Abnormal lipid profiles are a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and childhood obesity has been linked to changes in lipid metabolism in adults. However, the relationship between childhood obesity and adult lipid profiles, as well as the potential sex differences, remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between childhood obesity and abnormal lipid metabolism in young adults, specifically focusing on sex differences.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from the Beijing Blood Pressure Cohort Study, which included 1,220 participants aged 28–45 years. Childhood obesity was defined based on body mass index (BMI) and subscapular skinfold thickness (SSFT) measurements. Adult lipid profiles, including triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and total cholesterol (TC), were measured. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between childhood obesity and adult lipid profiles, adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Results**: During the follow-up period, 18 (2.9%) of 617 male subjects with normal weight as children were obese as adults. Of 516 female subjects with normal weight as children, 9 (1.7%) were obese as adults. In males, childhood overweight/obesity was positively associated with high TG in adulthood (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.03–2.85). In females, childhood overweight/obesity was significantly associated with high TC (OR = 5.96, 95% CI 1.42–25.00) and high LDL-c (OR = 6.91, 95% CI 1.17–40.75) in adulthood. The analysis of change in adiposity status from child.

### Lipid profile of Mexican children with Down syndrome [^114ZA9cv]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common human chromosomopathy, with a frequency of 1 in 700 live births. It is associated with congenital deformities, illnesses, and metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia, with several studies reporting abnormal lipid concentrations in this population. Given the increasing life expectancy of people with DS, an unfavorable lipid profile can lead to cardiovascular disease in adulthood. There have been no studies on the subject in Mexico; thus, the study aimed to examine lipid profiles and the frequency of dyslipidemia in Mexican children and adolescents with DS.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^1126Bagu]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Lipid disorders involving derangements in serum cholesterol, triglycerides, or both are commonly encountered in clinical practice and often have implications for cardiovascular risk and overall health. Recent advances in knowledge, recommendations, and treatment options have necessitated an updated approach to these disorders. Older classification schemes have outlived their usefulness, yielding to an approach based on the primary lipid disturbance identified on a routine lipid panel as a practical starting point.

Although monogenic dyslipidemias exist and are important to identify, most individuals with lipid disorders have a polygenic predisposition, often in the context of secondary factors such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. With regard to cardiovascular disease, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is essentially causal, and clinical practice guidelines worldwide have recommended treatment thresholds and targets for this variable. Furthermore, recent studies have established elevated triglycerides as a cardiovascular risk factor, whereas depressed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol now appears less contributory than was previously believed.

An updated approach to diagnosis and risk assessment may include the measurement of secondary lipid variables such as apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein(a), together with the selective use of genetic testing to diagnose rare monogenic dyslipidemias such as familial hypercholesterolemia or familial chylomicronemia syndrome. The ongoing development of new agents — especially antisense RNA and monoclonal antibodies — targeting dyslipidemias continues to advance treatment options.

### Cholesteryl ester storage disease: a rare and possibly treatable cause of premature vascular disease and cirrhosis [^111MLHHt]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a variety of mutations in the LIPA gene. These mutations lead to reduced activity of lysosomal acid lipase, resulting in the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in lysosomes. If enzyme activity is very low or absent, the presentation occurs in infancy with failure to thrive, malabsorption, hepatosplenomegaly, and rapid early death, known as Wolman disease. With higher but still low enzyme activity, the disorder presents later in life with hepatic fibrosis, dyslipidemia, and early atherosclerosis.

Identification of this rare disorder is challenging, as it is essential to assay leukocyte acid phosphatase activity. An assay using specific inhibitors has now been developed that facilitates measurement in dried blood spots. Treatment of CESD has until now been limited to managing the dyslipidemia, but this does not influence the liver effects. A new enzyme replacement therapy, Sebelipase, has been developed that could change treatment options for the future.

### Novel association of metastatic Crohn's disease and Wolman disease [^1177fVNa]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The case report presents a novel association of metastatic Crohn's disease (MCD) in a patient with Wolman disease; to our knowledge, there is no such association in the literature. Wolman disease is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that occurs due to a LIPA gene mutation, which leads to a deficiency in lysosomal acid lipase and causes the accumulation of triglycerides and cholesterol in the viscera. The only skin manifestation reported in Wolman disease is a yellowish tint (jaundice) from liver fibrosis as the disease progresses. Although there were no reports of Crohn's disease in patients with lipid storage disease, previous reports demonstrate notable differences in lipid metabolism-related pathways in Crohn's disease. The most marked differences occur in fatty acids, acylcarnitine metabolites, sphingolipids, and bile acid metabolism. Moreover, growing evidence suggests that lipid metabolism, amino acid deficiency, and the loss of energy homeostasis play important roles in inflammation and may have significant implications for the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The prognosis of Wolman disease is quite poor, with most patients dying within the first months of infancy, especially if not diagnosed and treated early.

### Association of CETP TaqI and APOE polymorphisms with type II diabetes mellitus in North Indians: A case control study [^1125SBcu]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Although our study found an abnormal lipid profile in diabetes patients and its association with complications like diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy, these lipid profile abnormalities did not correlate with CETP TaqI B or APOE HhaI polymorphisms. In T2DM patients with neuropathy, unadjusted values of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were higher than in patients with T2DM only. After adjusting for covariates, results were the opposite, which shows the effect of covariates on lipid variation. The absence of any association of lipid profile with genetic subgroups suggests the involvement of other environmental and genetic factors in the regulation of circulating lipid levels, as well as the complex mechanism of T2DM.

### Atorvastatin and the dyslipidemia of early renal failure [^111xvQSf]. Atherosclerosis (2003). Low credibility.

Information about lipid abnormalities and the effect of lipid-lowering therapy in the early stages of renal disease is limited, while preventive treatment in this stage might be much more beneficial. Lipid profiles and risk factors were assessed in 150 consecutive, non-diabetic patients. Preventive therapy consisted of a cholesterol-reduced diet and atorvastatin 10 mg daily.

Patients were considered at risk for cardiovascular disease if LDL-cholesterol was > 2.6 mmol/l in the case of manifest cardiovascular disease (n = 28), when they had manifest cardiovascular risk factors (n = 105), or if LDL was > 3.5 mmol/l (n = 17). A total of 128 patients (85%) had increased LDL. In men under 60 years and women under 40 years, total cholesterol was higher than in the general population.

Linear regression analysis showed a decreased creatinine clearance to be significantly associated with the lipid profile. For a 10 ml/min decrease in creatinine clearance, a 0.085 increase in the total cholesterol to HDL ratio was observed (P = 0.005). In similar analyses, proteinuria was strongly associated with cholesterol and triglycerides. An increase of 0.28 in the total cholesterol/HDL ratio was observed for each gram per 24-hour proteinuria (P < 0.001).

On atorvastatin 10 mg daily, 30 of 60 treated patients achieved their target LDL value. On average, LDL-cholesterol was reduced by 39% and triglycerides by 18%. No patient had to interrupt their treatment because of adverse side effects.

In conclusion, the majority of patients had elevated LDL and other lipid abnormalities. Short-term therapy with atorvastatin and [end of available text].

### Rare dyslipidaemias, from phenotype to genotype to management: A European Atherosclerosis Society task force consensus statement [^115tAs92]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). Low credibility.

Genome sequencing and gene-based therapies appear poised to advance the management of rare lipoprotein disorders and associated dyslipidaemias. However, in practice, underdiagnosis and undertreatment of these disorders are common, largely due to interindividual variability in the genetic causes and phenotypic presentation of these conditions. To address these challenges, the European Atherosclerosis Society formed a task force to provide practical clinical guidance focusing on patients with extreme concentrations (either low or high) of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The task force also recognizes the scarcity of quality information regarding the prevalence and outcomes of these conditions. Collaborative registries are needed to improve health policy for the care of patients with rare dyslipidaemias.

### Vitamin D concentrations in familial combined hyperlipidemia: Effects of lipid lowering treatment [^1145rEVW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that vitamin D may have an effect on cardiovascular outcomes. Many reports have pointed towards an association of vitamin D deficiency with the occurrence of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events and with several cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Special attention has been paid to the association of vitamin D deficiency with insulin-resistant conditions, such as obesity or the metabolic syndrome.

Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is a complex genetic disorder characterized by variable phenotypic expression and is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. It is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), increased apolipoprotein B (apoB), and predominance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles — features that are also present in conditions of insulin resistance. FCHL is the most common familial form of hyperlipidemia and carries a high risk of cardiovascular disease.

We hypothesized that FCHL could be associated with low concentrations of vitamin D, as occurs with other conditions linked to insulin resistance. To test our hypothesis, we compared vitamin D concentrations in patients with FCHL with those from healthy controls. Moreover, we studied the association of vitamin D concentrations with anthropometric characteristics, lipoprotein parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP), and insulin resistance and analyzed the effects of lipid-lowering treatment.

### Lipid dysregulation in Tangier disease: A case series and metabolic characterization [^111XDZjw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Tangier disease (TD) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder associated with a deficiency in cellular cholesterol export, leading to cholesterol accumulation in peripheral tissues. With approximately 150 described cases, the disease is significantly understudied, and the clinical presentation appears to be heterogeneous.

The objective of this multicenter cohort study was to investigate the phenotype and lipid metabolism in TD. Four patients with TD participated in the study. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based lipidomic and metabolomic analyses were performed on these patients and healthy controls.

Results indicated that while showing similar laboratory patterns with respect to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) depletion, the clinical presentation of the four TD patients was heterogeneous. Two patients, diagnosed at 47 and 72 years, had predominantly gastrointestinal and neurological phenotypes. Two previously undescribed variants (c.2418G > A, c.5055.del) were reported.

Apart from pathognomonic changes in HDL composition, NMR spectroscopy revealed an increased abundance of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) with higher total lipid and cholesterol concentrations. This points toward an impaired clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Increased triglyceride-rich intermediate-density lipoprotein supports impaired hepatic lipase activity, together with a cholesteryl ester transfer protein-mediated increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-triglycerides at a higher abundance of large LDL subtypes and decreased small dense LDL.

### Lysosomal lipase deficiency: Molecular characterization of eleven patients with Wolman or cholesteryl ester storage disease [^116Q8Ls8]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Wolman disease (WD) and cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) represent two distinct phenotypes of the same recessive disorder caused by the complete or partial deficiency of lysosomal acidic lipase (LAL), respectively. LAL, encoded by the LIPA gene, hydrolyzes cholesteryl esters derived from cell internalization of plasma lipoproteins. WD is a rapidly progressive and lethal disease characterized by intestinal malabsorption, hepatic and adrenal failure. CESD is characterized by hepatic fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis. The aim of the study was the identification of LIPA mutations in three WD and eight CESD patients.

The WD patients, all deceased before the first year of age, were homozygous for two novel mutations (c.299+1G > A and c.419G > A) or a mutation (c.796G > T) previously reported as compound heterozygosity in a CESD patient. The two mutations (c.419G > A and c.796G > T) resulting in truncated proteins (p.W140* and p.G266*) and the splicing mutation (c.229+1G > A) were associated with undetectable levels of LIPA mRNA in fibroblasts. All eight CESD patients carried the common mutation c.894G > A, known to result not only in a major non-functional transcript with the skipping of exon 8 (p.S275_Q298del), but also in a minor normally spliced transcript producing 5–10% residual LAL activity. The c.894G > A mutation was found in homozygosity in four patients and, as compound heterozygosity, in association with a known (p.H295Y and p.G342R) or a novel (p.W140*) mutation in four other CESD patients. Segregation analysis was performed in all patients harboring c.895G > A.

### Screening for lysosomal acid lipase deficiency: A retrospective data mining study and evaluation of screening criteria [^111451uV]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is a lysosomal storage disorder. In severe cases, it can cause life-threatening organ failure due to lipid substrates accumulation. However, mild phenotypes of this disorder are increasingly recognized. The aim of this study is to determine the number of missed LAL-D patients in a large pediatric hospital population.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective data mining study, the medical files of children who visited the outpatient clinic at a university hospital between 2000 and 2016, and presented with high plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, were evaluated. Previously developed LAL-D screening criteria, with lipid and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values adjusted for children, were used to analyze which children are suspect for LAL-D. For suspicion of LAL-D, at least 3 out of 5 screening criteria had to be met. Subsequently, data on presentation and follow-up were collected to determine if the clinical picture was compatible with LAL-D.

- **Results**: We identified 2,037 children with high LDL-C levels. Of those, 36 children complied with ≥ 3 screening criteria. Thirty-one of those had an underlying disorder other than LAL-D that explained the abnormalities. In the 5 remaining children, ALT and lipid levels normalized spontaneously, thus excluding LAL-D.

- **Conclusions**: This study shows that retrospective data mining is unlikely to yield a significant number of LAL-D cases in children. The screening algorithm adjusted for children seems useful and accurate in the selection of children for further testing.

### Clinical features of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency [^117C6kB8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

In addition, the information for this study was obtained from medical records with variability in the depth of their descriptions; thus, definitive conclusions regarding the differences between LAL D and other common diseases, such as NAFLD/NASH, cannot be made.

In summary, this is the first detailed characterization of a large number of children and adults with LAL D to provide important insights into a number of aspects of the disease that are difficult to address from published case reports. The majority of living cases are children, and there is a striking underrepresentation of patients over 40 years of age. The high frequency of liver transplantation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis at a young age in patients with LAL D, relative to other more common causes of chronic liver diseases, is important given the low disease awareness and potential for confusion with other more common liver diseases such as NAFLD/NASH. Moreover, although persistent liver injury is present from early in life, the serum transaminase levels alone may not lead to a specialist referral and/or a detailed liver workup. The high LDL-C or low HDL-C levels seen in patients with LAL D, however, provide an opportunity to potentially distinguish these patients earlier during the diagnostic workup. In totality, these study data indicate that LAL D is predominantly a pediatric disease that primarily targets the liver, causing progressive hepatic dysfunction with fibrosis (and commonly cirrhosis), which, combined with the systemic manifestations of dyslipidemia, put these patients at risk for significant morbidity.

### Prevalence of dyslipidemia and its association with other coronary artery disease risk factors among urban population in Southeast of Iran: Results of the Kerman coronary artery disease risk factors study (KERCADRS) [^112oLJBu]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The standardized prevalence of dyslipidemia in different gender and age subcategories is shown. The overall prevalence of undiagnosed dyslipidemia was 68.9% and of diagnosed dyslipidemia was 12.5%. Among subjects with dyslipidemia, the prevalence of undiagnosed cases was 16.8% and diagnosed cases was 13.2%, with both types being more prevalent in women.

The prevalence of undiagnosed dyslipidemia was significantly higher in educated individuals compared to those with lower educational levels. Additionally, smokers showed a higher prevalence of undiagnosed dyslipidemia compared to non-smokers. Similarly, opium users had a higher prevalence of undiagnosed dyslipidemia compared with non-users.

Diagnosed dyslipidemia was more prevalent in individuals experiencing depression and anxiety than in those without these conditions. Overweight and obese individuals had higher undiagnosed and diagnosed dyslipidemia compared to those with normal weight.

Furthermore, the prevalence of diagnosed dyslipidemia was significantly lower among subjects with high physical activity (7.9%: 95% CI, 5.7–10.7%) than those with low physical activity (14%: 95% CI, 12%).

### Clinical features of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency [^111avbVk]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

**Imaging and liver biopsy**: Abnormal imaging findings included hepatomegaly (n = 36; 77%), splenomegaly (n = 30; 64%), and fatty liver/steatosis, including findings of increased liver echogenicity (n = 24; 51%). Adrenal calcification was seen on imaging in three patients, with the first findings observed at ages 8.8, 13.1, 14.8, and 8.8 years. In the substudy, median liver volume was 1.15 MN (range 0.74–2.20), and the median hepatic fat fraction (FF) percentage was 8.0% (range 1.17%–14.83%). The majority of patients with liver MEGE performed had a liver FF > 5%. Median splenic volume was 2.20 MN (range 0.85–4.97). Histology data were available from 45 liver biopsies from 31 (65%) patients. The mean age at the time of the first biopsy was 13 years, with 25 of the 31 patients being < 18 years. Steatosis was reported in 87% (27/31) of patients, and evidence of fibrosis and/or cirrhosis was reported in 64.5% of the biopsied patients. Evidence of cirrhosis and fibrosis was seen on the first biopsy in 5 and 16 patients, respectively. A total of 85% (17/20) of the patients with biopsy evidence of fibrosis and/or cirrhosis were < 18 years.

### Sex difference in the relationship between childhood obesity and abnormal lipid profiles in young adults [^114bwTJd]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Abnormal lipid profiles are a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and childhood obesity has been linked to changes in lipid metabolism in adults. However, the relationship between childhood obesity and adult lipid profiles, as well as the potential sex differences, remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between childhood obesity and abnormal lipid metabolism in young adults, specifically focusing on sex differences.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from the Beijing Blood Pressure Cohort Study, which included 1,220 participants aged 28–45 years. Childhood obesity was defined based on body mass index (BMI) and subscapular skinfold thickness (SSFT) measurements. Adult lipid profiles, including triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and total cholesterol (TC), were measured. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between childhood obesity and adult lipid profiles, adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Results**: During the follow-up period, 18 (2.9%) of 617 male subjects with normal weight as children were obese as adults. Of 516 female subjects with normal weight as children, 9 (1.7%) were obese as adults. In males, childhood overweight/obesity was positively associated with high TG in adulthood (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.03–2.85). In females, childhood overweight/obesity was significantly associated with high TC (OR = 5.96, 95% CI 1.42–25.00) and high LDL-c (OR = 6.91, 95% CI 1.17–40.75) in adulthood. The analysis of change in adiposity status from childhood to adulthood was assessed, revealing notable sex-specific differences in lipid metabolism outcomes.

### Hepatic cholesteryl ester accumulation in lysosomal acid lipase deficiency: Non-invasive identification and treatment monitoring by magnetic resonance [^114xMsrH]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease for which there is currently no effective treatment. The disease results from mutations in the LIPA gene encoding the LAL enzyme, and deficiency of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglycerides (TG) in various tissues.

Although a single disease, LAL deficiency presents as a clinical continuum with two major phenotypes:

- **Early onset phenotype**: Typically referred to as Wolman disease, it presents within the first 6 months of life and is the most rapidly fatal presentation. Growth failure due to malabsorption, massive hepatosplenomegaly, rapidly progressive liver dysfunction, and anemia are the predominant clinical features contributing to early mortality. Survival beyond 1 year of age is highly unusual.

- **Late onset phenotype**: Frequently known as cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), this form is an underappreciated cause of cirrhosis in both children and adults. It is more heterogeneous with respect to age of diagnosis. Important abnormalities include elevated serum transaminases, hepatomegaly, and dyslipidemia (high LDL, high triglycerides, and low HDL). Complications include hepatic fibrosis with progression to cirrhosis and accelerated atherosclerosis.

Diagnosis of late onset LAL deficiency requires a high index of clinical suspicion, given the combination of elevated transaminases, fatty liver, and dyslipidemia.

### Is higher serum cholesterol associated with altered tendon structure or tendon pain? A systematic review [^117NhL2u]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The review comprehensively identified all available data on the potential link that lipid fractions have with tendon pain and structure. The meta-analysis supports an association for total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG). A potential mechanism for this link is the para-inflammation that is present in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Ongoing research is required to determine whether similar processes occur in the presence of less extreme cholesterol elevations associated with lifestyle factors. Notwithstanding this, the work indicates that there is indeed an association between unfavorable changes in lipid parameters and tendinopathy.

- **Summary box**: This review identified 17 studies on the topic of tendon health and lipid profile. Five studies compared lipid profiles between individuals with and without tendon pain or abnormality, and three studies compared tendon health between individuals with and without lipid abnormality. The cross-sectional relationship between tendon health and lipid profile was examined in two studies. Seven studies on familial hypercholesterolemia provided data from their healthy control groups. Meta-analysis of appropriate studies showed significantly higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in individuals with tendon pain or abnormality. Two of the three studies that examined the correlation between tendon thickness and lipid levels found a significant positive relationship. Statin use was associated with Achilles tendon rupture in women but not men.

### Lipid profile and subsequent cardiovascular disease among young adults aged < 50 years [^111XfShr]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Epidemiological evidence on the relationship between lipid profile and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in young adults remains insufficient. Thus, we sought to explore the association of lipid profile with subsequent CVD among young adults. Medical records of 1,451,997 young adults (20 to 49 years old) without prior history of CVD and not taking lipid-lowering medications were extracted from the Japan Medical Data Center, a nationwide epidemiological database.

We conducted multivariable Cox regression analyses to identify the association between lipid profile and the subsequent risk of CVD and used multiple imputation for missing data on body mass index, waist circumference, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking in our database. The mean age was 39.0 ± 7.4 years, and 58.5% were men.

After a mean follow-up of 1,148 ± 893 days, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and heart failure developed in 1,638 (0.1%), 15,887 (1.1%), 5,593 (0.4%), and 14,351 (1.0%) subjects, respectively. Multivariable Cox regression analyses — including covariates after multiple imputation for missing values — demonstrated that LDL-C ≥ 140 mg/dL, HDL-C < 40 mg/dL, and triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL were independently associated with the incidence of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and heart failure. However, they were not associated with the incidence of stroke.

Multivariable Cox regression analyses including the number of abnormal lipid profiles and covariates showed that the incidence of myocardial infarction, angina, and heart failure increased stepwise with the number of abnormal lipid profiles.

### Low-density lipoproteins cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Evidence from genetic, epidemiologic, and clinical studies. A consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel [^114P9GN5]. European Heart Journal (2017). High credibility.

The terms "cholesterol", "LDL", and "LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)" are frequently conflated or used interchangeably, potentially leading to confusion. Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes and a precursor of bile acids and steroid hormones. Importantly, cholesterol from both exogenous and endogenous sources is transported to peripheral cells largely by apoB-containing lipoproteins in plasma. In most individuals, LDL particles constitute approximately 90% of circulating apoB-containing lipoproteins in fasting blood.

However, in clinical practice, the plasma LDL level is generally not measured directly. Instead, it is estimated from its cholesterol concentration — LDL-C — representing the total amount of cholesterol in LDL particles. As a result, calculated plasma LDL-C has become central to assessing cardiovascular risk and evaluating therapeutic benefit in randomized clinical trials.

- **Relative concentration of apolipoprotein B (ApoB)**: This is observed in circulating lipoproteins in normolipidemic individuals. The ApoB content was calculated in nanomoles per liter using 500,000 as the defined molecular mass. For instance:
	- Low-density lipoprotein (LDL): 100 mg/dL or 2000 nmol/L
	- Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL): 5 mg/dL or 100 nmol/L
	- Intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) remnants: 5 mg/dL or 100 nmol/L
	- Lipoprotein(a): 10 nmol/L (Based on the population median).

Under most conditions, LDL-C concentration and LDL particle number are highly correlated; therefore, plasma LDL-C is a reliable surrogate for LDL particle concentration.

### Dyslipidemia is associated with worse asthma clinical outcomes: A prospective cohort study [^115L3oEz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia has been widely documented to be associated with cardiovascular disease, and recent studies have found an association with asthma prevalence. However, longitudinal studies investigating the relationships between dyslipidemia, asthma phenotypes, and future asthma exacerbations (AEs) are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between dyslipidemia, asthma phenotypes, and AEs.

The study used an observational cohort study design with a 12-month follow-up. All subjects underwent serum lipid measurement and were then classified into two groups: the normal-lipidemia group and the dyslipidemia group. Demographic and clinical information, alongside details regarding pulmonary function and asthma phenotypes at baseline, were collected. Patients were followed up regularly to assess AEs. Associations of dyslipidemia with airway obstruction and asthma phenotypes were assessed at baseline, while dyslipidemia and AEs were assessed longitudinally.

A total of 477 patients with asthma were consecutively enrolled in this study. At baseline, the dyslipidemia group (n = 218) had a higher proportion of uncontrolled asthma, defined by the 6-item Asthma Control Questionnaire score (≥ 1.5). Furthermore, dyslipidemia was associated with severe asthma, nonallergic asthma, asthma with fixed airflow limitation, and older adult asthma phenotypes at baseline. In addition, dyslipidemia was associated with increased frequencies of severe AEs and moderate to severe AEs during the 12-month follow-up.

### Lysosomal acid lipase in lipid metabolism and beyond [^1156SFL2]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2019). Low credibility.

Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), encoded by the lipase A (LIPA) gene, hydrolyzes cholesteryl esters and triglycerides to generate free fatty acids and cholesterol in the cell. The essential role of LAL in lipid metabolism has been confirmed in mice and humans with LAL deficiency. In humans, loss-of-function mutations of LIPA cause rare lysosomal disorders, Wolman disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease, in which LAL enzyme-replacement therapy has shown significant benefits in a phase 3 clinical trial.

Recent studies have revealed the regulatory role of lipolytic products of lysosomal lipid hydrolysis in catabolic, anabolic, and signaling pathways. In vivo studies in mice with knockout of LIPA highlight the systemic impact of LIPA deficiency on metabolic homeostasis and immune cell function. Genome-wide association studies and functional genomic studies have identified LIPA as a risk locus for coronary heart disease, but the causal variants and mechanisms remain to be determined. Future studies will continue to focus on the role of LAL in the crosstalk between lipid metabolism and cellular function in health and diseases, including coronary heart disease.

### Rapid progression and mortality of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency presenting in infants [^114MBm2H]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Results

- **Population**: Forty patients who received a clinical diagnosis of "Wolman disease" between 1985 and 2012 were enrolled. Four were ineligible because they lacked a confirmed diagnosis (n = 2) or a second weight measurement (n = 2). In addition, one patient was excluded from this analysis because he was later enrolled in a separate clinical study.

	- There were 35 patients in the overall population, enrolled from 17 centers in 6 countries. Of these patients, 26 were classified as having early GF. Baseline demographic characteristics and clinical/family histories are shown in Table 1. Most patients (70%) who received transplants were from the United States. LALD was diagnosed by enzyme activity testing in 34 patients (97%). Homozygous mutations were reported for 3 of the 12 patients who had LIPA mutation analysis performed. Two siblings (twins) had identical null mutations arising from a premature stop codon (TAT > TAG) at exon 298; all other patients had unique mutations. No patients had a copy of the exon 8 splice junction mutation (c.894G > A).

- **Symptom onset and disease presentation**: Overall, 43% of patients had their first symptom onset before the age of 1 month. Median ages at first symptom onset were similar for the subsets with and without early GF (1.1 month [range: 0.0–3.0 months] and 1.0 month [range: 0.23–6.0 months], respectively). Prominent manifestations included vomiting, diarrhea, and steatorrhea, accompanied by liver biochemical abnormalities. The median time interval between symptom onset and diagnosis was 1.2 months (range: 0.05–17.0 months).

### Sex difference in the relationship between childhood obesity and abnormal lipid profiles in young adults [^111GJL5T]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The association between childhood overweight/obesity and adult lipid profiles is outlined below. The data originally presented in Table 2 highlights the relationship according to sex.

- **Model 1**: Adjusted for none.
- **Model 2**: Adjusted for adult age, smoking status, and alcohol status.

- **In males**: Childhood overweight/obesity was positively associated with high triglycerides in adulthood (OR = 1.72 [1.03, 2.85], Model 2). There was no significant association with dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, high total cholesterol, low HDL-c, and high LDL-c in adulthood.

- **In females**: Childhood overweight/obesity was positively associated with adult high total cholesterol (OR = 5.96 [1.42, 25.00], Model 2) and high LDL-c (OR = 6.91 [1.17, 40.75], Model 2) in adulthood. There was no significant association with dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL-c, and high triglycerides in adulthood.

### Reversal of advanced disease in lysosomal acid lipase deficient mice: A model for lysosomal acid lipase deficiency disease [^1149M7qu]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) is an essential enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides (TG) and cholesteryl esters (CE) in lysosomes. Mutations of the LIPA gene lead to Wolman disease (WD) and cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD). The disease hallmarks include hepatosplenomegaly and extensive storage of CE and/or TG. The effects of intravenous investigational enzyme therapy (ET) on survival and efficacy were evaluated in Lipa knock out, lal-/- mice with advanced disease using recombinant human LAL (rhLAL).

- **Comparative ET study 1**: Conducted with lower doses (weekly, 0.8 and 3.2 mg/kg) beginning at 16 weeks. RhLAL extended the life span of lal-/- mice in a dose-dependent manner by 52 (0.8 mg/kg) or 94 (3.2 mg/kg) days. This was accompanied by partial correction of cholesterol and TG levels in the spleen and liver.

- **Comparative ET study 2**: Conducted with a higher dose (10 mg/kg) in early (8 weeks), middle (16 weeks), and late (24 weeks) disease stages. The high dose resulted in a significant improvement in organ size (liver, spleen, and small intestine) and tissue histology, as well as significant decreases in cholesterol and TG in all three groups.

In the treated livers and spleens, the cholesterol and TG levels were reduced to below treatment initiation levels, indicating a reversal of disease manifestations, even in advanced disease. ET diminished liver fibrosis and macrophage proliferation. These results show that LAL deficiency can be improved biochemically and histopathologically by various dosages of ET, even in advanced disease.

### Clinical features of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency [^1163vzLa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

**Treatments and interventions**: Lipid-lowering medication use, most commonly statin, and dietary interventions were reported for 81% and 68% of the patients, respectively. The mean ages at the first lipid-lowering medication use and the first dietary intervention were 15.8 and 8.7 years, respectively, with 20 patients receiving their first lipid-lowering medication before the age of 18 years. Thirteen percent of patients had undergone liver transplant; 4 underwent transplant during childhood (9–18 years). Only 9 patients aged ≥ 40 years were identified in this study; of these, 2 underwent liver transplant at ages 43.3 and 43.5 years, respectively. Patients who underwent liver transplantation generally had lower or decreasing ALT levels, higher AST/ALT ratios, lower triglyceride and HDL-C levels, a higher incidence of cytopenia, and lower albumin levels than other lysosomal acid lipase deficiency patients in this study.

### Why patients with familial hypercholesterolemia are at high cardiovascular risk? Beyond LDL-C levels [^116ipqHz]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic cause of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) due to defective clearance of circulating LDL particles. All FH patients are at high risk for premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) events due to their genetically determined lifelong exposure to high LDL-C levels. However, different rates of CVD events have been reported in FH patients, even among those with the same genetic mutations and comparable LDL-C levels. Hence, additional CVD risk modifiers, beyond LDL-C, may contribute to increased CVD risk in the FH population.

In this review, we discuss the overall CVD risk burden of the FH population. We also revise the prognostic impact of several traditional and emerging predictors of CVD risk and provide an overview of the role of specific tools to stratify CVD risk in FH patients to ensure them a more personalized treatment approach.

### Hepatic cholesteryl ester accumulation in lysosomal acid lipase deficiency: Non-invasive identification and treatment monitoring by magnetic resonance [^112vQk8e]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Monitoring liver lipid accumulation in patients has traditionally involved the analysis of biopsy samples. This approach is invasive, carries an associated risk to the patient, and samples only a small region of the organ, and thus may be prone to sampling errors. Magnetic resonance techniques can provide an alternative to biopsy, offering a non-invasive, safe, and repeatable method to measure liver lipid content and composition.

- **MRI and spectroscopy methods**: MRI and 1 H magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy methods are widely used in research studies to measure hepatic lipid content. They provide either a measurement from a defined volume in the liver (via PRESS spectroscopy) or an image of lipid distribution (via "Dixon method" imaging). A good correlation has been observed between 1 H MR measures of lipid content and biopsy for steatosis. 13 C MR spectroscopy can also be used and has the advantage of providing more detailed information on the chemical composition of hepatic lipids than obtained in 1 H spectroscopy.

In this study, we employed 1 H spectroscopy to quantify and characterize the hepatic lipid signature associated with a rare genetic defect of lipid metabolism in a cohort of patients with LAL deficiency. We also utilized a biochemical assay and 13 C spectroscopy in the preclinical studies to confirm that the observed changes in 1 H spectra originate from cholesterol/cholesteryl ester accumulation. The previously described rat model of LAL deficiency develops liver abnormalities that closely resemble the changes seen in patients with both early and late onset LAL deficiency, showing CE and T…

### Differential diagnosis of a patient with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency: A case report [^116Nnt6i]. Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

We describe the differential diagnosis of an obese 12-year-old boy of Mexican origin who presented with a 6-year history of abnormal lipid profile and elevated liver transaminase levels.

- **Methods**: The patient underwent routine clinical testing, an abdominal ultrasound, and, ultimately, a liver biopsy. Based on the histologic findings, a serum leukocyte lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) assay and DNA sequencing of the lipase A (LIPA) gene were performed.

- **Results**: Liver biopsy revealed diffuse microvesicular steatosis with clusters of foamy histiocytes in the lobules and portal areas. Our differential diagnosis included nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; medication-induced hepatotoxicity; glycogenic hepatopathy; medium-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase or long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency; and lysosomal storage disorders, including Niemann-Pick disease and lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D). Serum LAL activity was absent, and DNA sequencing confirmed homozygous mutation in LIPA.

- **Conclusions**: Although it occurs rarely, LAL-D should be considered in the differential diagnosis of microvesicular steatosis for a timely diagnosis.

### Consensus clinical recommendations for the management of plasma lipid disorders in the Middle East: 2021 update [^11216YWL]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

Disorders of plasma lipids remain key risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the Middle East and are estimated to increase more dramatically in the next decade than in any other global region except Africa. This statement is an update to the 2016 consensus clinical recommendations for the management of plasma lipid disorders in the Middle East, following the evaluation of newer cholesterol-lowering agents in randomized controlled cardiovascular outcome trials, as well as the publication of revised international guidelines.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel of regional experts was convened to update the consensus clinical recommendations for the management of plasma lipids in the Middle East. The recommendations constructed in 2016 were reviewed against emerging research since publication.

- **Results**: Newly developed Middle East ASCVD risk categories were established using the multiple risk group categories from the recently updated international guidelines and the epidemiological evidence from the Gulf Region. These consensus recommendations support a more intensive reduction of LDL-C across cardiovascular risk categories. Alongside low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we recommend non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a primary treatment target. Lifestyle modifications remain the first-line treatment recommendation for all patients. The first-line pharmacological treatment in patients with dyslipidemia is statin therapy, with a number of second-line agents available.

### Genetic predisposition to dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes risk in two prospective cohorts [^1177SQqS]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia has been associated with type 2 diabetes, and the most common patterns of dyslipidemia in diabetic patients are reduced HDL cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels. Prospective studies have shown that low HDL cholesterol and high triglyceride levels, but not LDL cholesterol levels, are independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes, and the values of HDL cholesterol and/or triglycerides have been used in risk-scoring systems for predicting incident diabetes. However, it remains unclear whether low HDL cholesterol/high triglyceride levels play a causal role in the development of type 2 diabetes.

Information on the associations of genetic predisposition to dyslipidemia with the risk of type 2 diabetes might help clarify the causality. A recent study reported that a genotype score for triglyceride levels was not associated with type 2 diabetes risk. However, the less extensive inclusion of the susceptibility loci (nine loci) might limit the causal inference. Moreover, the study did not address other patterns of dyslipidemia, such as high LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol levels.

Recently, a meta-analysis of 46 lipid genome-wide association studies comprising more than 100,000 individuals of European ancestry established more comprehensive genetic profiles for various blood lipids, including LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. In the study, we calculated three genotype scores on the basis of 31, 41, and 25 well-established single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, respectively.

### Wolman's disease presenting with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: A case report from Saudi Arabia and literature review [^115r9foT]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is critical and should begin as early as possible to prevent irreversible organ damage. Based on the HLH-2004 trial, the conventional treatment of HLH consists of a potent immunosuppressant (dexamethasone), chemotherapy (etoposide), and the standard of care. After achieving remission, the only curative treatment of HLH is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), which has shown improved overall patient survival.

Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive, and fatal disease characterized by reduced or absent LAL enzyme activity due to mutations in the gene encoding lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA). Consequently, the metabolism of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides is impaired. Wolman's disease (WD) is the infantile form of LAL deficiency. WD patients present with vomiting, diarrhea, increased bilirubin concentration, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, dyslipidemia, adrenal insufficiency, and hepatic failure. An abdominal X-ray in patients with WD shows bilateral adrenal calcification, and liver biopsy characteristically reveals cholesteryl ester deposits in Kupffer cells. Measurement of LAL enzyme in leucocytes or molecular testing for LIPA gene mutations confirms the diagnosis of WD. HSCT and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) are among the management approaches for WD. Sebelipase alfa, a recombinant human LAL, has been recently used for WD and has shown significant improvement in survival and disease symptoms.

WD is considered an underlying cause of secondary HLH (sHLH), where both disorders share common manifestations.

### 2019 George Lyman Duff Memorial Lecture: Three decades of examining DNA in patients with dyslipidemia [^1125ShEx]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemias include both rare single-gene disorders and common conditions with a complex underlying basis. In London, Ontario, there is a fortuitous close proximity between the Lipid Genetics Clinic and the London Regional Genomics Centre. For more than 30 years, we have applied DNA sequencing of clinical samples to help answer scientific questions. More than 2,000 patients referred with dyslipidemias have participated in an ongoing translational research program.

In 2013, we transitioned to next-generation sequencing; our targeted panel is designed to concurrently assess both monogenic and polygenic contributions to dyslipidemias. Patient DNA is screened for rare variants underlying 25 Mendelian dyslipidemias, including familial hypercholesterolemia, hepatic lipase deficiency, abetalipoproteinemia, and familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Furthermore, polygenic scores for LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, and triglycerides are calculated for each patient. We thus simultaneously document both rare and common genetic variants, allowing for a broad view of genetic predisposition for both individual patients and cohorts.

For instance, among patients referred with severe hypertriglyceridemia, defined as ≥ 10 mmol/L (≥ 885 mg/dL), there is a three-fold increase over normolipidemic individuals, and approximately 35% have an extreme polygenic score, indicating a greater than three-fold increase over normolipidemic individuals. Other dyslipidemias show different manifestations.

### Prevalence and clinical correlates of abnormal lipid metabolism in first-episode and drug-naïve patients with major depressive disorder: A large-scale cross-sectional study [^1129kaWU]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2023). Low credibility.

Studies have shown an association between abnormal lipid profiles and major depressive disorder (MDD), but there are few studies on the clinical correlates of lipid abnormalities in these patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of abnormal lipid metabolism and its correlates in Chinese first-episode and drug-naïve MDD patients, which has not yet been reported.

A total of 1718 outpatients with first-episode and drug-naïve MDD were included. Demographic data were collected by a standardized questionnaire, and blood lipid levels were measured, including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C). The Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscale, and Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (CGI-S) were assessed for each patient.

The prevalence of abnormal lipid metabolism was 72.73% (1301/1718), and the rates of high TC, high TG, high LDL-C, and low HDL-C were 51.05% (877/1718), 61.18% (1051/1718), 30.09% (517/1718), and 23.40% (402/1718), respectively. Logistic regression showed that the risk factors for abnormal lipid metabolism were severe anxiety, HAMD score, CGI-S score, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age at onset, SBP, HAMD score, HAMA score, PANSS positive subscale score, and CGI-S were independently associated with TC levels. BMI, HAMD score, PANSS positive subscale score, and CGI-S score were independently associated with other lipid parameters.

### Coronary artery disease-associated coding variant rs1051338 reduces lysosomal acid lipase levels and activity in lysosomes [^116ZQh8P]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

We went on to test whether the changes in lysosomal LAL activity had a functional effect on cholesterol homeostasis. In atherosclerosis, modified LDLs are endocytosed in an unregulated process, leading to dramatic increases in intracellular FC concentrations. Excess FC is potentially cytotoxic to cells, so inherent mechanisms limit intracellular FC concentration build-up, including upregulation of cholesterol efflux and re-esterification of FC to form nontoxic, neutral pH lipid droplets. Lipid droplet degradation was thought to be performed exclusively by cytoplasmic neutral CE hydrolases; however, recent evidence indicates a significant role for lysosomal lipid autophagy for modified LDL metabolism in macrophages. A key role for LAL in this process was highlighted in cholesterol-loaded macrophages, when chemical inhibition of LAL reduced cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A1 by over 50%.

We, therefore, investigated whether the rs1051338 genotype affects efflux to apolipoprotein A1 in acetylated LDL-loaded macrophages and found a reduction of approximately 25% in efflux to apolipoprotein A1 (P = 0.187) in macrophages isolated from individuals homozygous for the risk allele. Although not significant, the reduction is in the expected direction; however, interindividual variation means a much larger sample size is required to confirm the functional effects of rs1051338. In LAL deficiency (Wolman disease and CE storage disease), the reduced LAL activity can impair ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 expression in response to LDL loading, leading to reduced cholesterol efflux, an effect that is r

### Clinical features of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency [^115pvpUx]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Although less well studied, patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL D) also demonstrate complications related to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which are likely related to both the dyslipidemia due to abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism and the impairment of cholesterol efflux from lipid-containing LAL-deficient macrophages. Although the young age of the affected patients in this study limits the insights into the risk of ASCVD because complications associated with cumulative LDL-C exposure may not manifest as cardiovascular events until adulthood, complications related to ASCVD were seen in 4.2% of the overall population and in 12.5% (2/16) of patients over the age of 25 years. Both of these patients showed LDL-C levels > 350 mg/dL. The mean LDL-C value of 202.9 mg/dL for the first recorded LDL-C for the enrolled patients was in the very high range (> 190 mg/dL). The LDL-C levels are substantially higher than those seen in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is an important consideration for the differential diagnosis.

Historical LDL-C measurements from case records, in addition to showing for the first time that these abnormalities are present from early in life, also demonstrated that LDL-C elevations are persistent and not substantially impacted by dietary intervention (DI) or lipid-lowering medications (LLMs). These findings are important because insights from other genetic conditions that impact LDL-C levels early in life highlight the importance of the duration of exposure to LDL-C and the absolute level of LDL-C in determining overall ASCVD risk. Because LAL D is an autosomal recessive disease, the absence of a family history of cardiovascular conditions may not provide relevant predictive information.

### Exome sequencing and directed clinical phenotyping diagnose cholesterol ester storage disease presenting as autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia [^113bsh72]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2013). Low credibility.

Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia is a rare inherited disorder characterized by extremely high total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. It has previously been linked to mutations in LDLRAP1. We identified a family with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia not explained by mutations in LDLRAP1 or other genes known to cause monogenic hypercholesterolemia. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular pathogenesis of autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia in this family.

We used exome sequencing to assess all protein-coding regions of the genome in three family members and identified a homozygous exon 8 splice junction mutation (c.894G > A, also known as E8SJM) in LIPA that segregated with the diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia. Because homozygosity for mutations in LIPA is known to cause cholesterol ester storage disease, we performed directed follow-up phenotyping by noninvasively measuring hepatic cholesterol content. We observed abnormal hepatic accumulation of cholesterol in the homozygote individuals, supporting the diagnosis of cholesterol ester storage disease. Given previous suggestions of cardiovascular disease risk in heterozygous LIPA mutation carriers, we genotyped E8SJM in over 27,000 individuals and found no association with plasma lipid levels or risk of myocardial infarction, confirming a true recessive mode of inheritance.

By integrating observations from Mendelian and population genetics along with directed clinical phenotyping, we diagnosed clinically unapparent cholesterol ester storage disease.

### Is it time for a paradigm shift? Inclusion of APOE on genetic dyslipidemia panels [^114Vfbc8]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

APOE codes for apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which plays an important role in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, as well as the homeostasis of tissue lipid content. Several variants in APOE have been associated with inherited dyslipidemias and an increased risk of developing premature coronary artery disease (CAD). These variants and their impact on risk can be considered on a spectrum, with some being more monogenic in nature, while others contribute in a polygenic/multifactorial manner. Despite these known associations, there is often hesitancy around ordering APOE genetic testing due to its association with Alzheimer's disease. This paper aims to catalyze discussion around APOE testing and counseling strategies, highlight the nuances around this topic, and advocate for the inclusion of APOE testing on dyslipidemia panels when an inherited dyslipidemia is suspected.

### Normal weight dyslipidemia: Is it all about the liver [^114i9Yho]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

The liver coordinates lipid metabolism and may play a vital role in the development of dyslipidemia, even in the absence of obesity. Normal weight dyslipidemia (NWD) and patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who do not have obesity constitute a unique subset of individuals characterized by dyslipidemia and metabolic deterioration. This review examined the available literature on the role of the liver in dyslipidemia and the metabolic characteristics of patients with NAFLD who do not have obesity.

- **Methods**: PubMed was searched using the following keywords: nonobese, dyslipidemia, NAFLD, NWD, liver, and metabolically obese/unhealthy normal weight. Additionally, article bibliographies were screened, and relevant citations were retrieved. Studies were excluded if they had not measured relevant biomarkers of dyslipidemia.

- **Results**: NWD and NAFLD without obesity share a similar abnormal metabolic profile. When compared with patients with NAFLD who have obesity, the metabolic abnormalities of NAFLD without obesity are similar or less severe. Furthermore, hepatic lesions develop independent of obesity, and the extent of dyslipidemia seems comparable.

NAFLD may impair hepatic lipid handling, causing faulty lipid homeostasis, and serves as a likely starting point for initiation and propagation of dyslipidemia along with associated comorbidities in patients without obesity.

### Acne patients frequently associated with abnormal plasma lipid profile [^111W6JkF]. The Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

This study was designed to investigate the relationship between plasma lipid profile and acne. Acne patients (n = 181) and healthy volunteers (n = 130), matched in terms of both age and sex, were enrolled. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and lipoprotein (LP)(a) levels were measured. TC, LDL-C, and LP(a) levels in male and female patients with severe acne were significantly higher than in the healthy control group (P < 0.05). TG in male patients with severe and moderate acne was significantly higher than in the healthy control group (P < 0.05). LP(a) in male and female patients with mild, moderate, and severe acne was significantly higher than in the healthy control group (P < 0.05). The constituent ratio of male and female patients with TC, TG, LDL-C, and LP(a) over the normal range was significantly higher than in the healthy control group. In this study, acne patients were frequently associated with abnormal lipid profile, providing a new basis for further exploration of the pathogenesis, as well as new treatments, of acne vulgaris.

### Lipid dysregulation in Tangier disease: A case series and metabolic characterization [^116Lfysw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The increased VLDL cholesterol concentration may be related to the overall higher number of VLDL particles or to the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated exchange of VLDL-triglycerides for LDL-cholesteryl esters (the latter being markedly decreased in our TD patients) during the longer circulation time in the absence of HDL particles. This could also explain the marked enrichment of LDL particles with triglycerides evident in both methods.

Previously, inhibition of CETP by pharmacological therapies (primarily by blocking the exchange of HDL-cholesteryl ester and VLDL-triglycerides or LDL-triglycerides) resulted in a shift from small dense LDL to larger LDL particles, as LDL particles contain more triglycerides and less cholesterol. Intriguingly, this situation might be similar to TD with respect to LDL lipid profiles, in which HDL is not available for a CETP-mediated exchange. This could, in turn, explain the abundance of larger LDL particles (LDL-1/LDL-2) and the depletion of small LDL particles but also the higher abundance of IDL particles.

In TD patients, the marked increase in IDL number and lipid content was surprising and might only partially be explained by the aforementioned reduced availability of CETP-mediated triglyceride exchange against HDL-cholesteryl ester, which would also explain the triglyceride enrichment of VLDL particles as seen in method 2. On the other hand, reduced hepatic lipase activity and/or overload could contribute to this phenomenon. While LPL acts on chylomicrons and VLDLs, IDLs are primarily lipolyzed by hepatic lipase.

### Skin tags and the atherogenic lipid profile [^1152ofzi]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2000). Low credibility.

This report details four patients who had skin tags, primarily on their torso, neck, and axillae, and who also displayed an abnormal lipid profile. All patients exhibited increased serum triglyceride levels (fasting > 1.70 mmol/litre) and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (< 1.1 mmol/litre in women and < 1.0 mmol/litre for men). This lipid profile is known as the atherogenic profile and is associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Two of the patients had impaired glucose tolerance, and one had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, three of the individuals had coronary artery disease. Skin tags might be a useful clinical sign that could alert clinicians to screen individuals for abnormal lipids, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^115samDJ]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The prevalence of dyslipidemia is important to note when defining "hypercholesterolemia", as it depends on the clinical context. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is roughly normally distributed in the population, exhibiting a slight right-skew. The mean values are approximately 2.6, 3.2, and 3.5 mmol/L (100, 124, and 135 mg/dL) for European women aged 20 to 39, 40 to 65, and 66 to 100 years, respectively. For men, these values are approximately 2.9, 3.4, and 3.3 mmol/L (112, 132, and 138 mg/dL). The 95th percentile corresponds roughly to an LDL-C value of 5.0 mmol/L (194 mg/dL).

Recommendations regarding lipid-lowering therapy depend on the baseline risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Lowering cholesterol is associated with a reduction in ASCVD risk, with a 20% relative risk reduction for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C. An LDL-C level above the 95th percentile (i.e. > 5.0 mmol/L [194 mg/dL]) may indicate a primary genetic disorder and is the threshold at which treatment is recommended, regardless of age or other risk factors. Thus, it is reasonable to define hypercholesterolemia as an LDL-C level greater than 5.0 mmol/L (194 mg/dL).

### Combined hyperlipidaemia as a presenting sign of cholesteryl ester storage disease [^113D3PCP]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency results in Wolman disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), a more benign form. CESD is a recessive disorder characterized by hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, low blood HDL, and variable phenotype, while hepatomegaly is usually evident during childhood or adolescence.

An 11-year-old girl was referred to our department for combined hyperlipidaemia (total cholesterol 323, triglycerides 259 mg/dl). All family members had normal lipid profiles and liver function tests.

At 8 years, she was admitted for acute Epstein-Barr virus infection with hepatosplenomegaly and elevation of liver enzymes. Liver-spleen enlargement resolved, but serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were persistently twice the upper limits, with other liver function tests within the normal range. Ultrasonography showed normal liver and spleen size and minimal hepatic steatosis. Infectious, autoimmune, and metabolic causes of elevated liver enzymes were ruled out, including glycogen storage disease. Dysbetalipoproteinemia was also ruled out (ApoE phenotype: E3E3).

In the following two years, the girl was symptom-free, her BMI was at the 50th-75th centile for age, and her lipid profile was unchanged, despite a low-fat diet. At 13 years of age, low acid lipase activity was demonstrated in leukocytes (10 nmol/h/ per mg protein, normal 140–380) and cultured skin fibroblasts (181 nmol/h per mg protein, normal 1100–2400), leading to the diagnosis of CESD. CESD usually progresses to hepatic fibrosis, with a high risk of premature atherosclerosis.

### Dyslipidemia [^111mwmAv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dyslipidemia:

- **Definition**: Dyslipidemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol, decreased HDL cholesterol, and/or increased triglycerides, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis.

- **Pathophysiology**:
	- **Primary dyslipidemia causes**: Genetic abnormalities
	- **Secondary dyslipidemia causes**:
		- **Lifestyle factors**: Obesity, physical inactivity, high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets, smoking, alcohol use
		- **Medical conditions**: Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, renal failure, cholestatic liver disease, nephrotic syndrome
		- **Medications**: Corticosteroids, progestogens, androgenic steroids, thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, oral estrogens, retinoic acid derivatives

- **Epidemiology**:
	- In the US, an estimated 53% of adults have at least one lipid abnormality
	- 27% have elevated LDL cholesterol
	- 23% have decreased HDL cholesterol
	- 30% have increased triglycerides

- **Disease course**: Lipid abnormalities contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, leading to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Treatment with statins is associated with a relative reduction in the risk of major adverse vascular events of 22% in men and 16% in women for every 1.0 mmol/L (38.6 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol.

### Abnormal lipid profiles in nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head: A comparison with osteoarthritis using propensity score matching [^1167XzR3]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2022). Low credibility.

Abnormal lipid metabolism may play an important role in the development of nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ON). By comparing lipid biomarkers in patients with ON and osteoarthritis (OA) after propensity score matching, we sought to reveal common lipid biomarkers that are abnormal in ON regardless of the etiology, and specific lipid biomarkers associated with ON according to the etiology.

- **Methods**: Among 2,268 patients who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), 1,021 patients were eligible for this study. According to the Association Research Circulation Osseous criteria, ON was classified as either idiopathic (n = 230), alcohol-associated (n = 293), or glucocorticoid-associated (n = 132). The most common cause of OA was hip dysplasia in 106 patients (47%). We investigated patient lipid profiles by assessing total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TGs), apolipoprotein (Apo) A1 and B, lipoprotein (a) levels, and the ApoB/A1 ratio. Since age and body mass index affect the lipid profile, we performed propensity score matching to select 304 patients for final analysis and compared lipid profiles between the ON and OA groups. We also compared biomarkers between the ON subgroups and the OA group.

- **Results**: Overall, the ON group showed lower HDL-C (p < 0.001), higher TGs (p = 0.001) levels, and a higher ApoB/A1 ratio (p = 0.003). Idiopathic ON patients demonstrated lower HDL-C (p = 0.032), higher TGs (p = 0.016), ApoB (p = 0.024) levels, and a higher ApoB/A1 ratio (p = 0.008).
