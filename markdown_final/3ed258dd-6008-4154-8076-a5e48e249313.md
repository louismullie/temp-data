## Question

aplastic anemia vs myelofibrosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to compare and differentiate between aplastic anemia and myelofibrosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about core definitions and pathophysiology to anchor the distinction. Then, I should review typical clinical presentations and red flags that push me toward one versus the other. Next, I will examine the diagnostic work-up, especially bone marrow morphology and molecular testing. After that, I need to consider common pitfalls, including prefibrotic myelofibrosis and hypoplastic MDS, and how to avoid misclassification. Finally, I will summarize key decision points and briefly note management implications as they reinforce diagnostic thinking [^112eN47q] [^116Vpbh5].

> Let me first confirm the core biology. Aplastic anemia is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by immune-mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells leading to pancytopenia and a hypocellular marrow, typically without significant fibrosis, which is the fundamental contrast point to myelofibrosis [^112eN47q]. In myelofibrosis, by contrast, the disease is clonal, usually driven by JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations, with megakaryocytic atypia and a pro-fibrotic cytokine milieu culminating in reticulin/collagen fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis, even though early or prefibrotic phases may precede overt fibrosis [^116Vpbh5] [^113pNUtk].

> I should consider epidemiology and trajectory next, but hold on, let me verify what is well established versus tentative. AA is rare, with European incidence around 0.2–0.3 per 100,000 person-years, and can range from indolent to life-threatening at onset, reinforcing the importance of early recognition of severe disease biology [^112eN47q]. Reported PMF incidence estimates vary across studies and methods; pooled analyses suggest rarity as well, though I should note that some incidence estimates and syntheses come from heterogeneous, lower-credibility sources and should be interpreted cautiously [^114BeWrY].

> Now, clinical presentation: I need to ensure I'm not over-attributing systemic symptoms. AA typically presents with manifestations of cytopenias alone — fatigue and pallor from anemia, infections from neutropenia, and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia — without B symptoms unless there is superimposed infection, which helps temper premature attribution of constitutional features to AA [^112eN47q]. MF more commonly brings anemia plus variable leukocyte/platelet counts, splenomegaly from extramedullary hematopoiesis, constitutional symptoms, bone pain, and a leukoerythroblastic smear; these features should raise immediate suspicion of a myeloproliferative neoplasm rather than primary immune marrow failure [^113xnXgG] [^116Vpbh5].

> Wait, let me verify the key bedside discriminators. Palpable splenomegaly or radiologic EMH strongly favors MF, whereas their absence supports AA, and this is often the fastest way to orient the differential before marrow studies return [^111YAjst] [^113xnXgG]. Conversely, profound hypocellularity without fibrosis on marrow biopsy and a clinical syndrome dominated purely by cytopenias is much more consistent with AA rather than MF, which I should confirm histologically and molecularly before concluding [^112eN47q].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workflow with attention to specimen adequacy. For AA, a marrow aspirate and a trephine biopsy of sufficient length (> 1.5 cm) are essential to document global hypocellularity and to exclude other etiologies of pancytopenia with hypocellular marrow, which I must not overlook in borderline cases [^117JZuje] [^1127BjcC]. For MF, a diagnostic marrow is likewise mandatory to assess megakaryocytic atypia and grade reticulin/collagen fibrosis in line with WHO 2016 criteria, alongside assessment for leukoerythroblastosis and clinical correlates that serve as minor criteria, which I should integrate rather than interpret in isolation [^116Vpbh5] [^113pNUtk].

> I will now examine the role of molecular and cytogenetic testing because I need to ensure clonality is established when appropriate. In suspected MF, testing for JAK2, CALR, and MPL is standard; when these are negative yet morphology and clinical features suggest MF, broader myeloid gene panels and cytogenetics/SNP arrays are recommended to identify alternative clonal markers and refine prognosis, which helps avoid labeling reactive fibrosis incorrectly as clonal disease [^113pNUtk] [^112Gm1oo] [^111n1E5p]. In AA, I should not expect MPN driver mutations; instead, I must evaluate for inherited marrow failure when indicated and systematically exclude other causes, with targeted genetic tests such as DEB-induced chromosomal breakage for Fanconi anemia and structured extra-hematopoietic assessments guiding the differentiation between constitutional and acquired disease, which prevents transplant missteps and donor selection errors [^116mBXjE] [^114z47vU] [^114cdZw8] [^112PpYwZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought that fibrosis is strictly required to diagnose MF, but I should correct that. Prefibrotic primary MF is a recognized entity where megakaryocytic proliferation and atypia exist without significant reticulin fibrosis; diagnosis still requires excluding other myeloid neoplasms and demonstrating a clonal marker or equivalent, along with minor clinical criteria, so I need to keep pre-PMF in mind when cytopenias coexist with MPN-type megakaryocytic morphology but low-grade reticulin [^115Wc3Lq] [^116Vpbh5].

> Let me consider peripheral smear and laboratory signals carefully. A leukoerythroblastic picture is a minor WHO criterion that supports MF when seen with compatible marrow morphology and molecular findings, while its absence does not exclude early disease; by contrast, in AA the smear typically reflects the depth of cytopenias without myelophthisic features, which aligns with the underlying marrow aplasia rather than a space-occupying fibrotic process [^116Vpbh5]. I should double-check that I am not mistaking dysplasia-limited findings for MF or AA, as dysplasia prompts a different work-up toward MDS per ESMO guidance, which is particularly important in older patients with cytopenias [^111YSJZf].

> I need to check whether imaging contributes meaningfully. In MF, radiology frequently demonstrates massive splenomegaly and can reveal EMH masses and osteosclerosis, which corroborate a myeloproliferative process and can also explain symptoms like early satiety or compressive complications; these findings are not expected in AA and their presence should make me reconsider an AA label unless there is a second process at play [^111YAjst] [^111ryWpX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without aligning management logic with the biology because therapeutic implications reinforce diagnosis. AA management centers on immunosuppression and/or allogeneic transplantation depending on severity and patient factors, which underscores its immune pathogenesis; in older or non-transplant candidates, immunosuppressive regimens are standard, while transfusion is supportive and typically restrictive in strategy to minimize exposure risks in stable patients [^112sHgpH] [^115iH4H1] [^111zj53d]. MF-associated anemia, in contrast, is managed by correcting deficiencies and hemolysis first, then considering ESAs in appropriate EPO ranges and selected combinations with ruxolitinib, recognizing limited response in transfusion-dependent patients, with transfusions used pragmatically for symptom control once options are exhausted, which aligns with a clonal, cytokine-driven anemia rather than immune aplasia [^115YnJai] [^115izPpT] [^114Jo6ZJ] [^116e7Ren] [^113Dsn8r].

> But wait, what if the marrow is hypocellular and dysplastic — could this still be AA? I should double-check for hypoplastic MDS as a key pitfall, since distinguishing AA from hMDS requires integrated cytohistology and genetic data rather than morphology alone; comprehensive genetic evaluation in hypocellular failure can prevent misclassification that would otherwise misdirect therapy and prognostication [^1127BjcC] [^1134K93C].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic checkpoints and summarize to avoid cognitive drift. Features that support AA include markedly hypocellular marrow without significant fibrosis, absent splenomegaly/EMH, a clinical picture dominated by cytopenias without myeloproliferation, and lack of MPN driver mutations, whereas MF is supported by megakaryocytic atypia with clonal markers, reticulin/collagen fibrosis in overt disease or pre-PMF morphology in early disease, leukoerythroblastosis and splenomegaly, and systemic symptomatology; anchoring on these points minimizes error and speeds appropriate treatment paths [^112eN47q] [^116Vpbh5] [^113pNUtk].

Aplastic anemia (AA) and myelofibrosis (MF) are **distinct marrow failure syndromes** with different pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management. AA features **immune‑mediated stem‑cell failure** leading to pancytopenia and a hypocellular marrow [^112eN47q], whereas MF is a **clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm** [^116Vpbh5] characterized by marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and a high risk of leukemic transformation [^114fibUa]. Accurate diagnosis relies on marrow morphology, cytogenetics, and molecular testing [^112Gm1oo]. Treatment also differs: AA is managed with immunosuppression or transplant [^115iH4H1] [^112PpYwZ], while MF is treated with JAK inhibitors, supportive care, and transplant in select cases [^114fibUa] [^113Dsn8r].

---

## Pathophysiology

Immune-mediated destruction of **hematopoietic stem cells** in aplastic anemia leads to pancytopenia and a hypocellular marrow [^112eN47q]. In myelofibrosis, **clonal proliferation of abnormal megakaryocytes and fibroblasts** drives marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and an increased risk of leukemic transformation [^115KxdcV] [^111iPMD4].

---

## Clinical presentation

| **Feature** | **Aplastic anemia** | **Myelofibrosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Anemia | Common, severe | Common, often severe |
| Thrombocytopenia | Common, severe | Variable, often moderate |
| Neutropenia | Common, severe | Variable, often mild |
| Splenomegaly | Rare [^112eN47q] | Common, often massive [^114fibUa] |
| Constitutional symptoms | Rare | Common (fatigue, weight loss, night sweats) [^111iPMD4] |
| Extramedullary hematopoiesis | Rare | Common [^111YAjst] |
| Leukemic transformation | Rare | Common (10–20%) [^111iPMD4] |

## Treatment strategies

### Aplastic anemia

In aplastic anemia, **immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine** is standard; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative in eligible patients. Supportive care includes transfusions and infection prophylaxis [^115iH4H1] [^112PpYwZ] [^111zj53d] [^113H7dYx].

---

### Myelofibrosis

- **JAK inhibitors**: Ruxolitinib, fedratinib [^114fibUa] [^113HbxNr].

- **HSCT**: Only curative option, limited by age/comorbidities.

- **Supportive care**: Transfusions, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, androgens, immunomodulatory drugs [^115izPpT] [^1124kC6i].

---

## Prognosis

In aplastic anemia, prognosis is variable and can be favorable with immunosuppression or HSCT, though relapse or clonal evolution may occur [^112eN47q]. Myelofibrosis generally has a **poorer prognosis**, with median survival of 2–5 years and a high risk of leukemic transformation [^111iPMD4] [^114fibUa].

---

## Complications

Complications of aplastic anemia include infections, bleeding, and **clonal evolution to MDS/AML** [^112eN47q]. In myelofibrosis, complications include splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis, leukemic transformation, and thromboembolic events [^111ryWpX] [^114fibUa].

---

## Diagnostic challenges

Diagnostic challenges arise from overlapping cytopenias and marrow changes, especially with hypoplastic MDS [^1134K93C]. The approach is to **integrate clinical, morphological, cytogenetic, and molecular data** [^1127BjcC].

---

## Current research and emerging therapies

In aplastic anemia, current research explores novel immunosuppressive agents, targeted therapies, and improved HSCT protocols. In myelofibrosis, efforts include **new JAK inhibitors**, combination therapies, and agents targeting fibrosis and clonal proliferation [^115KxdcV].

---

Aplastic anemia and myelofibrosis are **distinct marrow failure syndromes** with different pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management. Accurate **diagnosis and tailored treatment** are essential for optimal outcomes.

### Aplastic anaemia [^112eN47q]. Lancet (2005). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on aplastic anaemia:

- **Definition**: AA is a rare hematopoietic stem cell disorder that results in pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of AA is largely immune-mediated, with autoreactive lymphocytes mediating the destruction of hematopoietic stem cells. This immune dysregulation leads to bone marrow failure and cessation of new blood cell production.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of AA is estimated at 0.2–0.3 per 100,000 person-years in Europe.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for AA include exposure to specific medications, pesticides, and certain chemicals, as well as genetic predisposition and low socioeconomic status.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients may present with symptoms related to anemia, such as fatigue and pallor, bleeding tendencies due to thrombocytopenia, and increased susceptibility to infections due to neutropenia. A significant complication of AA is the risk of progression to myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of AA can vary widely. Some patients may have mild symptoms that require little or no therapy, while others may present with life-threatening pancytopenia.

### Primary myelofibrosis: 2013 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^111iPMD4]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation, abnormal cytokine expression, bone marrow fibrosis, anemia, splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), constitutional symptoms, cachexia, leukemic progression, and shortened survival.

- **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is based on bone marrow morphology. The presence of fibrosis, JAK2/MPL mutation, or +9/13q- cytogenetic abnormality is supportive but not essential for diagnosis. Prefibrotic PMF mimics essential thrombocythemia in its presentation, and the distinction is prognostically relevant. Differential diagnosis of myelofibrosis should include chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia.

- **Risk stratification**: The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System-plus (DIPSS-plus) prognostic model for PMF can be applied at any point during the disease course and uses eight independent predictors of inferior survival: age > 65 years, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, leukocyte count > 25 × 10⁹/L, circulating blasts ≥ 1%, constitutional symptoms, red cell transfusion dependency, platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L, and unfavorable karyotype. Using this model, patients can be categorized into different risk groups, directly affecting their treatment strategies and anticipated outcomes.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection in aplastic anemia [^116iCibR]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Compared to patients with non-hematologic cancers, patients affected by hematologic disorders have increased mortality and more prolonged viral RNA persistence. Since the early phase of the pandemic, several groups have described thrombocytopenia or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, problems likely due to a cytokine storm and the potential cytotoxicity of the virus.

Aplastic anemia (AA), a rare autoimmune disease with an incidence of two cases per million population, is characterized by cytopenia and bone marrow hypocellularity. It has been proposed that, in acquired AA, an initiating event provokes an aberrant immune response, triggering oligoclonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells that destroy hematopoietic stem cells.

The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in known cases of AA are not clear. Additionally, it is unknown whether this virus can trigger an aberrant immune response leading to depletion of the stem cell compartment and inducing bone marrow failure. Here we describe the features and clinical outcome of a group of patients affected with AA and SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 2020 and January 2021.

A national survey was launched in April 2020 to assess the clinical features and outcome of patients with preexisting AA and new onset AA after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The criteria for diagnosing AA and classifying its severity were described.

### A plasma microRNA signature as a biomarker for acquired aplastic anemia [^113ooMWk]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Aplastic anemia is an acquired bone marrow failure characterized by marrow hypoplasia, a paucity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and pancytopenia of the peripheral blood due to an immune attack on the bone marrow. A major challenge in aplastic anemia is to develop immune biomarkers to monitor the disease. We measured circulating microRNAs in plasma samples of aplastic anemia patients to identify disease-specific microRNAs. A total of 179 microRNAs were analyzed in 35 plasma samples from 13 aplastic anemia patients, 11 myelodysplastic syndrome patients, and 11 healthy controls using the Serum/Plasma Focus microRNA Polymerase Chain Reaction Panel.

Subsequently, 19 microRNAs from the discovery set were investigated in the 108 plasma samples from 41 aplastic anemia patients, 24 myelodysplastic syndrome patients, and 43 healthy controls for validation. This confirmed that 3 microRNAs could be validated as dysregulated (> 1.5-fold change) in aplastic anemia compared to healthy controls. MiR-150–5p, which is involved in the induction of T-cell differentiation, and miR-146b-5p, which plays a role in the feedback regulation of the innate immune response, were elevated in aplastic anemia plasma, whereas miR-1 was decreased in aplastic anemia.

By receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, we developed a logistic model with these 3 microRNAs that enabled us to predict the probability of a diagnosis of aplastic anemia with an area under the curve of 0.86. Dysregulated expression levels of the microRNAs became normal after immunosuppressive therapy at 6 months. Specifically, miR-150–5p expression was found to normalize.

### Myelofibrosis in 2019: Moving beyond JAK2 inhibition [^116xYu5b]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by ineffective clonal hematopoiesis, splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis, and the propensity for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. The discovery of mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL has uncovered activated JAK-STAT signaling as a primary driver of MF, supporting a rationale for JAK inhibition. However, JAK inhibition alone is insufficient for long-term remission and offers modest, if any, disease-modifying effects.

Given this, there is great interest in identifying mechanisms that cooperate with JAK-STAT signaling to predict disease progression and rationally guide the development of novel therapies. This review outlines the latest discoveries in the biology of MF, discusses clinical management of patients with MF, and summarizes the ongoing clinical trials that hope to change the landscape of MF treatment.

### The 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia [^115Wc3Lq]. Blood (2016). High credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for early primary myelofibrosis is a diagnostic tool designed to identify patients with this specific hematological disorder at an early stage. The primary utility of this tool is to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention, potentially improving patient outcomes.

The criteria consist of both major and minor components. The major criteria include megakaryocytic proliferation and atypia without significant reticulin fibrosis, absence of other specific myeloid neoplasms according to WHO criteria, and the presence of specific genetic mutations or other clonal markers. The minor criteria, which must be confirmed in two consecutive determinations, include palpable splenomegaly, anemia not attributable to a comorbid condition, elevated white blood cell count, and increased lactate dehydrogenase levels.

The diagnostic criteria are met if all major criteria (megakaryocytic proliferation and atypia, absence of other myeloid neoplasms, and presence of specific genetic mutations or clonal markers) are present, along with at least one of the minor criteria (palpable splenomegaly, anemia, elevated white blood cell count, or increased lactate dehydrogenase levels). If these conditions are not met, the diagnostic criteria for early primary myelofibrosis according to the WHO are not fulfilled.

### Primary myelofibrosis: Spectrum of imaging features and disease-related complications [^111YAjst]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Primary myelofibrosis is a chronic clonal stem cell disorder that results in a build-up of marrow fibrosis and dysfunction, hypermetabolic states, and myeloid metaplasia. The clinical and radiological consequences can be quite diverse and range from the manifestations of osteosclerosis and extramedullary haematopoiesis to thrombohaemorrhagic complications from haemostatic dysfunction. In addition, there is the challenge of identifying less well-recognized sites of extramedullary haematopoiesis and their site-specific complications. The intent of this article is to illustrate the spectrum of primary myelofibrosis as declared through multimodality imaging, with examples of both common and rarer disease manifestations.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: The classic and the novel [^1115xYym]. Haematologica (2025). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are suspected when there are appropriate clinical and laboratory findings, especially in the elderly. MDS symptoms are non-specific and range from none (asymptomatic) to weakness and fatigue. There may be cardiac complications due to the common anemia, and a decreased neutrophil count might be associated with recurrent infections. Patients may have epistaxis, gingival bleeding, or easy bruising if their platelet count is low or if the platelets do not function normally.

Other causes of anemia or other cytopenias must be ruled out first. This requires taking a careful history to search for these etiologies, which may include nutritional deficiencies (folic acid and vitamin B12, especially in vegetarians), medications, alcohol and tobacco use, or viral infection. The patient's history may reveal prior exposure to radiation or chemotherapy, or a familial predisposition to hematologic disease.

A thorough history can help to rule out conditions such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, aplastic anemia, and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) that may mimic MDS clinically. Physical examination is usually non-specific and with no abnormal findings.

Molecular signatures of tumors are finally being exploited in their diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment approach. In PMF, the WHO system has now formally included driver mutation screening in the diagnostic process. The document illustrates the value of molecular information in the development and utility of genetic-based prognostic systems in PMF. There is also evidence that supports the use of molecular information in the choice of specific treatment agents, although more studies are needed in that regard.

### Quantitative assessment of bone marrow activity using 18 F-FLT PET in aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes [^11337i2x]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Peripheral cytopenia is often encountered in clinical practice and may be associated with a serious disease, requiring further evaluation. In particular, if cytopenia involves two or three hematopoietic cell lineages, it may be associated with a hematological malignancy or bone marrow metastasis of cancers, necessitating immediate diagnosis and treatment. Bone marrow failure syndromes, such as aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), are diseases clinically characterized by cytopenia of one or more blood cell lines (anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia). Although MDS and AA present similar peripheral blood findings, they are distinct in etiology (neoplastic or autoimmune mechanisms), treatment (methylation inhibitors or immunosuppressive agents), and prognosis, which can sometimes be difficult to distinguish.

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are performed to determine the cause of cytopenia, but due to their safety, the collection site is limited to the iliac bone and only reflects hematopoiesis of the iliac bone marrow. However, hematopoiesis at the iliac site is heterogeneous, and these approaches may not adequately reflect the entire hematopoietic status of the whole bone marrow. Evaluation of the bone marrow of the axial skeleton using MRI is one useful approach for diagnosing AA, but no method has been established to evaluate the systemic hematopoiesis of the whole body.

The thymidine analog 3′-deoxy-3′-18 F-fluorothymidine (18 F-FLT) is a radiopharmaceutical for PET that has been shown to be useful for assessing cell proliferation.

### Utility of clinical comprehensive genomic characterization for diagnostic categorization in patients presenting with hypocellular bone marrow failure syndromes [^112NVJP7]. Haematologica (2021). Low credibility.

**Genes involved in bone marrow failure syndromes**: Genes linked to inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS) and those associated with the risk of transformation to hematological malignancy or response to immunosuppression in patients with acquired aplastic anemia (aAA) and hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome (hMDS) were assessed in this study. The study focused on four genes, CSF3R, GATA2, MPL, and RUNX1, which were evaluated in both germline and acquired settings. Genes analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES) only, and not included in the targeted panel, are marked with an asterisk. Note that genes KMT2D and PSTPIP1 are excluded from the figure; variants found in these genes were considered as 'off-target' findings.

### The forgotten myeloproliferative disorder: Myeloid metaplasia [^117RK9Jw]. The Oncologist (2003). Low credibility.

Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia is classified as a chronic myeloproliferative disease, alongside polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. The median age at diagnosis is 60 years, with over 90% of patients diagnosed after age 40. Clinical manifestations include massive splenomegaly, progressive anemia, profound constitutional symptoms, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The diagnosis is confirmed by a bone marrow examination after ruling out other causes of myelofibrosis. The median survival is 5 years, with leukemic transformation being a primary cause of death. Prognosis is adversely affected by anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL), circulating blasts, and hypercatabolic symptoms.

Conventional treatment is palliative and does not improve survival. However, androgen preparations, corticosteroids, and erythropoietin are useful for treating disease-associated anemia. Symptomatic splenomegaly is best managed by cytoreductive therapy or surgical removal. Radiation therapy is most useful in treating non-hepatosplenic extramedullary hematopoiesis. New treatment approaches include using thalidomide alone or in combination with prednisone and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

### Comparison of a restrictive versus liberal red cell transfusion policy for patients with myelodysplasia, aplastic anaemia, and other congenital bone marrow failure disorders [^112M7bvZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Bone marrow failure disorders include a heterogeneous group of conditions, of which myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) forms the largest subgroup. MDS predominantly affects the elderly, who are often managed conservatively with regular allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to treat their anaemia. However, RBC transfusions are not risk-free. Despite the central role of regular transfusions in the treatment of such patients, the optimal RBC transfusion strategy (restrictive versus liberal) remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of a restrictive versus liberal red blood cell transfusion strategy for patients with myelodysplasia, acquired aplastic anaemia, and other inherited bone marrow failure disorders.

- **Search methods**: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946), Ovid EMBASE (from 1974), EBSCO CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases up to 26th May 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs including patients with long-term bone marrow failure disorders that require allogeneic blood transfusion, who are not being actively treated with a haematopoietic stem cell transplant or intensive chemotherapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane review methodology. One author initially screened all references and excluded any that were clearly irrelevant or duplicates. Two authors then independently screened all abstracts of articles.

For the medical management of primary myelofibrosis, particularly concerning the treatment of anemia, the ESMO 2015 guidelines advise the consideration of initiating immunomodulatory agents. These agents are recommended for managing anemia despite frequent early withdrawal due to toxicity. It is important to note that low-dose thalidomide, combined with oral prednisone, provides a 23–29% response rate. Lenalidomide, when combined with a low-dose prednisone taper, yields a 19% response rate. Lenalidomide monotherapy should be initiated as the treatment of choice for patients with a 5q deletion.

### Myelodysplastic syndromes: moving towards personalized management [^114uZGr5]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnostic work-up follows the recommendations in the WHO 2016 classification. Cornerstones are bone marrow morphology and histopathology, and cytogenetic analysis. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping is recommended but not mandatory. It is a necessary tool to exclude certain differential diagnoses, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and large granular lymphocytic leukemia. Molecular genetics, mainly targeted DNA sequencing, is strongly recommended, particularly in patients who are candidates for active treatment. Differential diagnoses of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) encompass a long list of both benign and malignant diagnoses. Since management depends on a correct diagnosis, many national cancer programs mandate that diagnosis and prognosis are established in multi-professional conferences.

### Patterns of ruxolitinib therapy failure and its management in myelofibrosis: Perspectives of the Canadian Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Group [^111ZZd5u]. JCO oncology practice (2020). Low credibility.

Anemia is a known on-target effect of ruxolitinib. In the COMFORT trials, anemia was observed more frequently in the ruxolitinib arms. It is also a major feature of progressive myelofibrosis. Given that there is no biomarker to differentiate between anemia resulting from ruxolitinib and anemia related to underlying myelofibrosis, clinical judgment is required. The timing of anemia and other associated symptoms helps differentiate between drug-induced and disease-related anemia. Development of anemia in the first 12 weeks of ruxolitinib treatment is expected, with a new baseline usually established by week 24. This form of anemia is self-limited and dose-dependent.

However, worsening anemia beyond the first 6 months of treatment may be unrelated to the medication. Anemia resulting from disease progression is often accompanied by an increase in myelofibrosis symptoms or splenomegaly. There was a significant difference of opinion among the Canadian hematologists surveyed regarding the occurrence of anemia as a marker of ruxolitinib failure. There was broader consensus that in a patient who was transfusion independent before beginning ruxolitinib treatment, transfusion-requiring anemia after 24 weeks of therapy, in the absence of bleeding or other causes, should be considered indicative of ruxolitinib failure. Different definitions of transfusion dependence were considered, as reported in the MPN literature. A study from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre showed that transfusion-requiring anemia is associated with poor outcomes.

### Prefibrotic myelofibrosis: Treatment algorithm 2018 [^111vsSvm]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Since 1976, a group of European pathologists have described a subtype of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) characterized by megakaryocytic and granulocytic proliferation, with atypical megakaryocyte morphology but without any significant bone marrow fibrosis. This variant, called prefibrotic myelofibrosis (pre-PMF), was formally introduced in the 2001 and 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classifications of tumors and defined as a distinct clinico-pathologic entity in the recent 2016 revision. Pre-PMF is currently accepted as a separate entity among MPN with unique clinical characteristics and outcomes with respect to both overt PMF and essential thrombocythemia (ET). In this paper, we review concepts in diagnosis and clinical aspects of pre-PMF and provide suggestions for prognostic stratification and treatment decision-making.

### Aplastic anaemia [^112sHgpH]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Aplastic anaemia is a rare haemopoietic stem-cell disorder that causes pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow. Although most cases are acquired, there are unusual inherited forms. The pathophysiology of acquired aplastic anaemia is largely immune-mediated; autoreactive lymphocytes are responsible for the destruction of haemopoietic stem cells. Environmental exposures, such as drugs, viruses, and toxins, are believed to trigger the aberrant immune response in some patients, although most cases are classified as idiopathic.

Similar to other autoimmune diseases, aplastic anaemia has a varied clinical course. Some patients experience mild symptoms requiring little or no therapy, whereas others present with life-threatening pancytopenia, constituting a medical emergency. Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and myelodysplastic syndrome frequently occur in patients with aplastic anaemia, demonstrating a pathophysiological connection between these disorders. Acquired aplastic anaemia can be effectively treated with allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation, immunosuppression (typically antithymocyte globulin and ciclosporin), and high-dose cyclophosphamide.

### Approach to the diagnosis of aplastic anemia [^112hJNAC]. Blood Advances (2021). Low credibility.

Establishing a diagnosis of aplastic anemia (AA) can be challenging, yet it is absolutely critical to appropriate management, especially in differentiating between acquired and inherited forms of the disease. The hematology field requires updated diagnostic guidelines to ensure that appropriate clinical pathways are pursued for patients and their safety. There are increasing clinical options for patients with immunosuppressive therapy and transplant once the diagnosis is made.

In a case-based format, this review emphasizes newer data on molecular (somatic and germline) findings in AA and how they are (or are not) helpful during diagnosis. There are key details on somatic mutation profiles and stated evidence where available for prognostic and treatment indications. Germline details of newer syndromes are also outlined, which make this review modern and reflect areas of uncertainty for clinicians.

### Myeloproliferative disorders [^117QFkbf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Emergency providers typically encounter myeloproliferative disorders (MPNs) in one of two ways: as striking laboratory abnormalities of seemingly unknown consequence or in previously diagnosed patients presenting with complications. The course of patients with MPNs is highly variable, but major complications can arise. Emergent conditions related to hyperviscosity need to be recognized early and treated aggressively. Rapid hydration, transfusion, cytoreduction, and early hematology consultation can be lifesaving. Similarly, although management is not altered, a high index of suspicion for thrombotic complications is required in patients with known MPNs as these are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

Regarding medical management for primary myelofibrosis, especially in managing anemia, the ESMO 2015 guidelines recommend initiating erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) as first-line therapy for anemia. The response is often limited to patients with inadequate erythropoietin (EPO) levels (< 125 mU/mL), and less frequently observed in cases of significant splenomegaly or transfusion dependence. It is advised to discontinue treatment if no response is obtained at three months.

### Dysmegakaryopoiesis and transient mild increase in bone marrow blasts in patients with aplastic anemia treated with eltrombopag may be signs of hematologic improvement and not portend clonal evolution [^112VSLsn]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

None of the patients showed blasts in peripheral blood at screening and after the start of eltrombopag treatment. In contrast, the bone marrow blast count increased after the start of treatment compared with screening values in five patients (E1201: patients 003, 019, and 028; E1202: patients 146 and 147). All patients with increased bone marrow blast counts compared with the time of screening had higher marrow cellularity than at screening. According to the WHO classification, the cutoff value for the bone marrow blast count indicative of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with excess blasts is 5%. In this study, however, the increase in bone marrow blasts was transient in all four patients (019, 028, 146, and 147) who underwent bone marrow examinations at follow-up, with the bone marrow blast count reportedly less than 5%.

- **Increased blast count in bone marrow after the start of eltrombopag treatment**:
	- Study E1201 patient 003 at week 130 (May-Grünwald-Giemsa, ×1,000).
	- Study E1201 patient 019 at week 26 (May-Grünwald-Giemsa, ×1,000).
	- Study E1201 patient 028 at week 52 (May-Grünwald-Giemsa, ×1,000).

	- Study E1202 patient 147 at week 26 (May-Grünwald-Giemsa, ×1,000).

- **Change in bone marrow blast count (patient-level data)**: An increase in bone marrow blasts was defined as a bone marrow blast count more than double that at the time of screening.

### Quantitative assessment of bone marrow activity using 18 F-FLT PET in aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes [^1138m1dS]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Peripheral cytopenias are typically observed in blood test abnormalities associated with various conditions, including aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We prospectively investigated the feasibility of quantitatively analyzing whole-body bone marrow activity using PET with 3′-deoxy-3′-18 F-fluorothymidine (18 F-FLT) in cases of AA and MDS.

Sixty-eight patients with cytopenia underwent an 18 F-FLT PET/MRI scan, alongside simultaneous bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for hematopoiesis evaluation. SUVs were measured in the vertebrae (Th3, 6, and 9, and L3), bilateral iliac crests, and extremities. SUV and bone marrow pathology were compared between AA and MDS and analyzed in relation to the severity of AA and prognosis of MDS.

Among the 68 patients with cytopenia, 12 were diagnosed with AA, 27 with MDS, 12 with bone marrow neoplasia, 2 with myelofibrosis, and 15 with other conditions. Iliac 18 F-FLT SUVs were significantly correlated with bone marrow cell numbers and cell density (r = 0.47, P < 0.001 and ρ = 0.65, P < 0.001, respectively). There was a significant positive correlation between iliac and vertebral SUVs in AA and MDS (r = 0.65, P < 0.05 and r = 0.70, P < 0.001, respectively), and the slope of the regression line was significantly steeper in AA than in MDS (P < 0.05). In AA patients, vertebral 18 F-FLT SUVs significantly decreased with disease progression. In contrast, MDS patients with higher whole-body 18 F-FLT uptake were associated with shorter overall survival (hazards ratio, 3.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–9.47; P = 0.037).

### Comparison of severe aplastic anaemia and lower risk hypoplastic myelodysplastic neoplasms: Critical role of megakaryocyte count in distinguishing aplastic anaemia from myelodysplastic neoplasms [^111QH3bz]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal haematopoietic disorders resulting from abnormalities in bone marrow (BM) stem cells. The presence of genetic mutations, which influence the onset and progression of MDS, leads to diverse clinical manifestations. This prognostic variability necessitates implementing risk‐based treatment strategies to achieve optimal outcomes. Despite the recent shift from morphology‐based to mutation‐based diagnostic approaches, there remain inherent limitations in relying solely on genetic mutations at diagnosis for treatment decisions, as these mutations can undergo dynamic changes during the disease. Currently, the Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System, considered the most promising prognostic model, continues incorporating clinical findings as variables. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of genetic testing in clinical settings encounters challenges, including high costs and complexities in interpretation.

A similar clinical challenge is the difficulty in the differential diagnosis between MDS and aplastic anaemia (AA), which is an important issue in MDS practice. Because both diseases affect the blood cell‐producing system, accurate differentiation is essential for appropriate treatment. This is especially difficult in cases of BM hypoplasia. MDS is characterized by dysplasia, but erythroid dysplasia can occur in patients with AA, as described in the UK guidelines for the diagnosis and management of adult AA. We previously reported that erythroid dysplasia does not affect therapy response or survival.

### Primary myelofibrosis: 2012 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management [^111gVhEY]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation, abnormal cytokine expression, bone marrow fibrosis, anemia, splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), constitutional symptoms, cachexia, leukemic progression, and shortened survival.

- **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is based on bone marrow morphology. The presence of fibrosis, JAK2/MPL mutation, or +9/13q- cytogenetic abnormality is supportive but not essential for diagnosis. Prefibrotic PMF mimics essential thrombocythemia in its presentation and the distinction is prognostically relevant. Differential diagnosis of myelofibrosis should include chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia.

- **Risk stratification**: The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System-plus (DIPSS-plus) prognostic model for PMF can be applied at any point during the disease course and uses eight independent predictors of inferior survival: age > 65 years, hemoglobin 25 × 10⁹ /L, circulating blasts ≥ 1%, constitutional symptoms, red cell transfusion dependency, platelet count 80% two-year mortality is predi.

### Comparison of severe aplastic anaemia and lower risk hypoplastic myelodysplastic neoplasms: Critical role of megakaryocyte count in distinguishing aplastic anaemia from myelodysplastic neoplasms [^116UagmU]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with bone marrow (BM) hypoplasia and a low megakaryocyte count in biopsy or clot specimens were defined as having aplastic anaemia (AA) after excluding non-haematological conditions causing cytopenia. Those for whom it was impossible to exclude myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as outlined in the criteria below, were excluded from AA.

- **Criteria for MDS exclusion**:
	- Patients without a decrease in megakaryocyte count.
	- Patients with ≥ 10% granulocytic dysplasia and/or ≥ 10% megakaryocyte dysplasia.
	- Patients with chromosomal abnormalities categorized as MDS according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.

MDS was defined according to the fourth WHO classification. In this study, we defined hypoplastic MDS as low risk hypoplastic MDS (LR-hMDS), characterized by either the absence or a very low percentage of blasts in the BM (< 5%) and peripheral blood (PB) (< 1%).

- **Review meeting**:
	- At the review meeting, patients with discordance among investigators were discussed. For patients with a low megakaryocyte count where BM hypoplasia could not be clearly confirmed, the final diagnosis was determined during this meeting. Patients more suggestive of MDS than AA, such as those showing abnormal localization of immature progenitor cells in the BM or those with less than 10% dysplasia, but in whom evaluators judged the dysplasia to be evident in multiple haematopoietic lineages, were reviewed.

- **Comparison of responsiveness to immunosuppressive therapy**:
	- Responsiveness to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) was assessed using data from the Prospective Registration, Central Review and Follow-up Study for AA and MDS. Response criteria to IST were assessed based on the criteria proposed by Camitta.

### Clinical approach to marrow failure [^111Hk9aD]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The treatment and medical management of aplastic anemia fundamentally differ between patients with inherited versus acquired marrow failure; however, the diagnosis of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome is frequently obscure. Recent exciting advances in our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes have resulted in a profusion of new tests to aid in diagnosis. This, in turn, has raised questions regarding the appropriate choice of testing for the patient presenting with aplastic anemia. Important clues to the diagnosis of an inherited marrow failure syndrome may be gleaned from careful attention to the clinical history, physical exam, and laboratory workup.

### Distinctive and common features of moderate aplastic anaemia [^115q5PvA]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). High credibility.

The comparative study of clinical, biological, and genomic features of moderate aplastic anaemia (mAA) versus severe aplastic anaemia (sAA) reveals distinctive characteristics in these conditions. While myelosuppression has traditionally been used to classify mAA versus sAA, this study identifies additional clinical and genomic features to differentiate the two.

Among patients diagnosed with mAA, 29 out of 85 (34%) were transfusion-dependent, compared to 201 out of 237 (85%) in the sAA cohort (P = 0.0001). Within the transfusion-dependent mAA group, 3% had unilineage involvement, 28% had bilineage involvement, and 69% pancytopenia. Of these patients, 59% received only platelets, 34% received red blood cells (RBCs), and 7% received both platelets and RBC transfusions. Conversely, in the transfusion-independent mAA cohort, 25% had unilineage involvement, 39% had bilineage involvement, and 36% had pancytopenia.

The cell lines most commonly affected in mAA were platelets (77 out of 85, 91%), erythrocytes (69 out of 85, 81%), and neutrophils (49 out of 85, 58%). In contrast, the sAA cohort displayed pancytopenia in 54% of patients, with two lines involved in 46%.

### The clinical and laboratory evaluation of patients with suspected hypocellular marrow failure [^1134K93C]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Low credibility.

The overlap in clinical presentation and bone marrow features of acquired and inherited causes of hypocellular marrow failure poses a significant diagnostic challenge in real case scenarios, particularly in nonsevere disease. The distinction between acquired aplastic anemia (aAA), hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and inherited bone marrow failure syndromes presenting with marrow hypocellularity is critical to inform appropriate care.

Here, we review the workup of hypocellular marrow failure in adolescents through adults. Given the limitations of relying on clinical stigmata or family history to identify patients with inherited etiologies, we outline a diagnostic approach incorporating comprehensive genetic testing in patients with hypocellular marrow failure. This approach is viable when immediate therapy is not required, allowing time to complete the evaluation.

We also review the clinical utility of marrow array to detect acquired 6p copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity to support a diagnosis of aAA. Additionally, we discuss the complexities of telomere length testing in patients with aAA, short telomere syndromes, and other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. We address the limitations of somatic mutation testing for mutations in myeloid malignancy genes in discriminating between the various diagnostic possibilities.

### The 2016 who classification and diagnostic criteria for myeloproliferative neoplasms: document summary and in-depth discussion [^113YJgpo]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Ongoing controversies with regard to bone marrow morphology in the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasm subtypes have surfaced. It has been argued that performing a bone marrow trephine biopsy in JAK2-mutated patients with sustained absolute erythrocytosis, indicated by hemoglobin concentrations of > 18.5 g/dL in men or > 16.5 g/dL in women, or hematocrit levels > 55.5% in men or > 49.5% in women, might pose some hazards for the patient and is not warranted. Additionally, it has been argued that bone marrow morphology does not provide sufficient diagnostic specificity for differentiating polycythemia vera from other types of myeloproliferative neoplasms, nor does it provide useful prognostic information. Concerns regarding complications related to bone marrow biopsy appear to be unsubstantiated.

A recent blinded review study has demonstrated that characteristic bone marrow features of polycythemia vera are highly reproducible, with an overall interobserver agreement of almost 93%. Interestingly, this series included specimens of masked polycythemia vera, overt polycythemia vera, and JAK2-mutated essential thrombocythemia, as well as other JAK2-mutated patients who did not meet the 2008 WHO threshold for an elevated hemoglobin level but were confirmed as polycythemia vera based on their increased red cell mass. Bone marrow biopsy is also capable of providing prognostic information, especially for the identification of bone marrow fibrosis. Although a variable incidence and severity of bone marrow fibrosis have been reported in the past, it must be emphasized that most older studies involved advanced disease stages consistent with post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis presenting with grades 2 and 3 of reticulin/collagen fibrosis. The clinical impact and prognostic relevance of its presence at disease outset remain significant.

### Myelofibrosis in 2019: Moving beyond JAK2 inhibition [^115KxdcV]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by ineffective clonal hematopoiesis, splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis, and the propensity for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. The discovery of mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL has uncovered activated JAK-STAT signaling as a primary driver of MF, supporting a rationale for JAK inhibition. However, JAK inhibition alone is insufficient for long-term remission and offers modest, if any, disease-modifying effects.

Given this, there is great interest in identifying mechanisms that cooperate with JAK-STAT signaling to predict disease progression and rationally guide the development of novel therapies.

### Detection of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clones in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and related bone marrow diseases, with emphasis on diagnostic pitfalls and caveats [^116h1xk8]. Haematologica (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clones in the setting of aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome has been shown to have prognostic and therapeutic implications. However, the status of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clones in various categories of myelodysplastic syndrome and in other bone marrow disorders is not well-studied.

- **Design and methods**: By using multiparameter flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis with antibodies specific for four glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (CD55, CD59, CD16, CD66b) and performing an aerolysin lysis confirmatory test in representative cases, we assessed the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria-phenotype granulocytes in 110 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, 15 with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease, 5 with idiopathic myelofibrosis, and 6 with acute myeloid leukemia.

- **Results**: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria-phenotype granulocytes were detected in nine patients with low-grade myelodysplastic syndrome who showed clinicopathological features of bone marrow failure, similar to aplastic anemia. All paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria-positive cases demonstrated loss of the four glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, with CD16(-)CD66b(-) clones being larger than those of CD55(-)CD59(-) (p < 0.05). Altered glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein expression secondary to granulocytic hypogranulation, immaturity, and/or immunophenotypic abnormalities was present in a substantial number of cases and diagnostically challenging.

- **Conclusions**: These results show that the detection of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria-phenotype granulocytes in patients may indicate bone marrow disorders.

### How I treat anemia in myelofibrosis [^117ALfLx]. Blood (2025). High credibility.

Anemia is a common consequence of myelofibrosis. The treatment of myelofibrosis-associated anemia is complicated by a multifactorial pathobiology and a lack of therapies that result in the normalization of the bone marrow and complete restoration of its function. Established agents that are used to treat anemia in other bone marrow failure states, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and aplastic anemia, are used for the treatment of myelofibrosis-associated anemia. However, there has been rapid development of new anemia-directed therapies, some of which have garnered regulatory approval.

In addition to adopting therapies from other disease states, a better understanding of the root causes of myelofibrosis-associated anemia has positioned the field to be on the cutting edge of new anemia treatments. This advancement is spearheading the development of agents that work on the hepcidin pathway to improve red cell production.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114fibUa]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

The classic Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) consist of myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia, and are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by an overproduction of blood cells. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for MPN were developed as a result of meetings convened by a multidisciplinary panel with expertise in MPN to provide recommendations for the management of MPN in adults. The guidelines include recommendations for the diagnostic workup, risk stratification, treatment, and supportive care strategies for managing myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia.

Assessment of symptoms at baseline and monitoring of symptom status during the course of treatment is recommended for all patients. This article focuses on the recommendations as outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for the diagnosis of MPN and the risk stratification, management, and supportive care relevant to MF.

### How common are myeloproliferative neoplasms? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114BeWrY]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases, including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary (idiopathic) myelofibrosis (PMF). In this systematic review, we provide a comprehensive report on the incidence and prevalence of MPNs across the globe. Electronic databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science were searched from their inception to August 2012 for articles reporting MPN incidence or prevalence rates. A random effects meta-analysis was undertaken to produce combined incidence rates for PV, ET, and PMF. Both heterogeneity and small study bias were assessed.

Thirty-four studies were included. Reported annual incidence rates ranged from 0.01 to 2.61, 0.21 to 2.27, and 0.22 to 0.99 per 100,000 for PV, ET, and PMF, respectively. The combined annual incidence rates for PV, ET, and PMF were 0.84, 1.03, and 0.47 per 100,000. There was high heterogeneity across disease entities (I² = 97.1–99.8%) and evidence of publication bias for ET and PMF (Egger test, P = 0.007 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively). The pooled incidence reflects the rarity of MPNs. The calculated pooled incidence rates do not reflect MPN incidence across the globe due to the high unexplained heterogeneity. Improved and widespread registration of MPNs would provide better information for global comparison of the incidence and prevalence of MPNs.

### The 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia [^116Vpbh5]. Blood (2016). High credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for overt primary myelofibrosis is a clinical calculator designed to identify patients with this specific myeloproliferative neoplasm. The criteria are intended to differentiate primary myelofibrosis from other similar conditions, such as essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and chronic myeloid leukemia.

The criteria consist of three major components and five minor components.

- **Major components**: These include the presence of megakaryocytic proliferation and atypia, accompanied by either reticulin and/or collagen fibrosis grades 2 or 3; the absence of other myeloid neoplasms as defined by the WHO; and the presence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation or, in the absence of these mutations, the presence of another clonal marker or absence of reactive myelofibrosis.

- **Minor components**: At least one must be present, and they include palpable splenomegaly, anemia not attributed to a comorbid condition, a white blood cell count ≥ 11×10⁹/L, lactate dehydrogenase increased to above the upper normal limit of the institutional reference range, and leukoerythroblastosis.

The diagnostic criteria are met if all three major components and at least one minor component are present. If these conditions are not met, the diagnostic criteria for primary myelofibrosis according to the WHO are not fulfilled. This tool is essential in guiding clinicians in the diagnosis and subsequent management of patients suspected to have primary myelofibrosis.

### Genetic features of myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic anemia in pediatric and young adult patients [^1116qGdm]. Haematologica (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical and histopathological distinctions between inherited versus acquired bone marrow failure and myelodysplastic syndromes are challenging. The identification of inherited bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndromes is critical to inform appropriate clinical management. To investigate whether a subset of pediatric and young adults undergoing transplant for aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome have germline mutations in bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndrome genes, we performed a targeted genetic screen of samples obtained between 1990–2012 from children and young adults with aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome transplanted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Mutations in inherited bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndrome genes were found in 5.1% (5/98) of aplastic anemia patients and 13.6% (15/110) of myelodysplastic syndrome patients. While the majority of mutations were constitutional, a RUNX1 mutation present in the peripheral blood at a 51% variant allele fraction was confirmed to be somatically acquired in one myelodysplastic syndrome patient. This highlights the importance of distinguishing germline versus somatic mutations by sequencing DNA from a second tissue or from parents.

Pathological mutations were present in DKC1, MPL, and TP53 among the aplastic anemia cohort, and in FANCA, GATA2, MPL, RTEL1, RUNX1, SBDS, TERT, TINF2, and TP53 among the myelodysplastic syndrome cohort. Family history or physical examination failed to reliably predict the presence of germline mutations. This study shows that while any single spec

- **Dose modifications based on insufficient response for patients with myelofibrosis and starting platelet count of 50 × 10⁹/L to less than 100 × 10⁹/L**: Do not increase doses during the first 4 weeks of therapy, and do not increase the dose more frequently than every 2 weeks. If the response is insufficient as defined in Section 2.2 (see Dose Modification Based on Insufficient Response with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with a platelet count of 100 × 10⁹/L or greater), doses may be increased by increments of 5 mg daily to a maximum of 10 mg twice daily if the following conditions are met: the platelet count has remained at least 40 × 10⁹/L, the platelet count has not fallen by more than 20% in the prior 4 weeks, the ANC is more than 1 × 10⁹/L, and the dose has not been reduced or interrupted for an adverse event or hematological toxicity in the prior 4 weeks.

- **Continuation and discontinuation criteria**: Continuation of treatment for more than 6 months should be limited to patients in whom the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Discontinue Jakafi if there is no spleen size reduction or symptom improvement after 6 months of therapy.

- **Dose modification for bleeding**: Interrupt treatment for bleeding requiring intervention regardless of platelet count. Once the bleeding event has resolved, consider resuming treatment at the prior dose if the underlying cause of bleeding has been controlled. If the bleeding event has resolved but the underlying cause persists, consider resuming treatment with Jakafi at a lower dose.

- **Recommended dosage for polycythemia vera**: The recommended starting dose of Jakafi is 10 mg twice daily.

### Primary myelofibrosis and the myeloproliferative neoplasms: The role of individual variation [^114Tr8Tr]. JAMA (2010). Low credibility.

The classic myeloproliferative neoplasms — essential thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis — are acquired, clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by an overproduction of mature blood cells, bone marrow hypercellularity, extramedullary hematopoiesis, a tendency for thrombosis, and, rarely, leukemic transformation. Despite being classified as neoplastic diseases, the myeloproliferative neoplasms are often characterized by longevity, with survival measured in decades, even in the absence of treatment. Primary myelofibrosis is the rarest of the myeloproliferative neoplasms, is the most obscure with regard to its pathophysiology, and carries the least favorable, although highly variable, natural history. The identification of molecular lesions specific to the myeloproliferative neoplasms, in particular JAK2 V617F, has broadened understanding of the common features within these disorders and has advanced diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools. This article highlights the challenges inherent in the management of primary myelofibrosis and presents an opportunity to address the basis of individual variation within a rare and complex disorder.

### The challenging world of cytopenias: Distinguishing myelodysplastic syndromes from other disorders of marrow failure [^114v8z4p]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, our understanding of bone marrow failure has advanced considerably. Marrow failure encompasses multiple overlapping diseases, and there is an increasing availability of diagnostic tools to distinguish among the subtypes. Identification of genetic alterations that underlie marrow failure has also greatly expanded, especially for myelodysplastic syndromes. Molecular markers are increasingly used to guide the management of myelodysplasia and may distinguish this diagnosis from other marrow failure disorders. This review summarizes the state of distinguishing among causes of marrow failure and discusses the potential uses of multiple diagnostic and prognostic indicators in the management of myelodysplastic syndromes and other bone marrow failure disorders.

### European bone marrow Working Group trial on reproducibility of World Health Organization criteria to discriminate essential thrombocythemia from prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis [^116tfRMj]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms discriminates between essential thrombocythemia and the prefibrotic phase of primary myelofibrosis. This discrimination is clinically relevant because essential thrombocythemia is associated with a favorable prognosis, whereas patients with primary myelofibrosis have a higher risk of progression to myelofibrosis or blast crisis.

- **Design and methods**: To assess the reproducibility of the classification, six hematopathologists from five European countries re-classified 102 non-fibrotic bone marrow trephines, obtained because of sustained thrombocytosis.

- **Results**: Consensus on histological classification, defined as at least four identical diagnoses, occurred for 63% of the samples. Inter-observer agreement showed low to moderate kappa values (0.28 to 0.57, average 0.41). The percentage of unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasms rose from 2% to 23% when minor criteria for primary myelofibrosis were taken into account. In contrast, the frequency of primary myelofibrosis dropped from 23% to 7%, indicating that the majority of patients with a histological diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis did not fulfill the complete criteria for this disease. Thus, over 50% of cases in this series either could not be reproducibly classified or fell into the category of unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasms.

- **Conclusions**: World Health Organization criteria for discrimination of essential thrombocythemia from prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis are poorly to only moderately reproducible and lead to a high.

In specific circumstances regarding aplastic anemia, particularly in elderly patients, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend immunosuppressive therapy as the treatment of choice. They advise offering antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporin for a more rapid recovery of blood counts. Consider offering cyclosporin alone, eltrombopag, or anabolic steroids (such as oxymetholone or danazol) as alternative options.

### Comparison of severe aplastic anaemia and lower risk hypoplastic myelodysplastic neoplasms: Critical role of megakaryocyte count in distinguishing aplastic anaemia from myelodysplastic neoplasms [^113jAJoV]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

We had previously confirmed in a central diagnostic system cohort of patients with AA and MDS that erythroid dysplasia does not affect the prognosis of AA. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether there is a difference between AA and MDS that cannot be distinguished based solely on erythroid dysplasia. In particular, we must investigate whether differences exist between SAA and LR-hMDS, both being diseases in which treatment decisions significantly impact outcomes, and develop a method to distinguish between them. Comparing the clinical features of AA and MDS further validates our diagnostic approach.

As central reviewers, we were particularly interested in the significantly poorer prognosis for LR-hMDS compared to that for SAA. The incidence of MDS generally increases with age, and the higher average age of the LR-hMDS patient population compared to that of those with SAA aligns with typical MDS characteristics. Additionally, MDS usually has a poor prognosis. Thus, our findings demonstrate that LR-hMDS has a poorer OS and LFS compared to SAA, which aligns with MDS characteristics. In this study, although there was a significant difference in the proportion of patients with PNH clones between SAA and LR-hMDS, there was no difference in response to IST between the two groups. A recent retrospective study examining prognostic differences between MDS and AA, with and without PNH clones detected by high-sensitivity cytometry, indicated that PNH positivity favourably impacts prognosis following IST in patients with MDS and AA, irrespective of clone size.

### Automated screening for myelodysplastic syndromes through analysis of complete blood count and cell population data parameters [^1138ju29]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) requires a high clinical index of suspicion to prompt bone marrow studies, as well as subjective assessment of dysplastic morphology. We sought to determine if data collected by automated hematology analyzers during complete blood count (CBC) analysis might help to identify MDS in a routine clinical setting. We collected CBC parameters — including those for research use only and cell population data — and demographic information in a large (> 5,000), unselected sequential cohort of outpatients.

The cohort was divided into independent training and test groups to develop and validate a random forest classifier that identifies MDS. The classifier effectively identified MDS and had a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.942. Platelet distribution width and the standard deviation of red blood cell distribution width were the most discriminating variables within the classifier. Additionally, a similar classifier was validated with an additional, independent set of over 200 patients from a second institution, with an AUC of 0.93.

This retrospective study demonstrates the feasibility of identifying MDS in an unselected outpatient population using data routinely collected during CBC analysis with a classifier that has been validated using two independent data sets from different institutions.
