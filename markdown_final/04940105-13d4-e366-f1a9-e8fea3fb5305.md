## Question

Management of HOCM

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and defining obstruction. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic therapy and dosing principles. Next, I will review second-line options and when to escalate. After that, I need to check indications and selection for septal reduction therapy, including special populations. I will then consider emerging therapies and monitoring. Finally, I should confirm acute management, lifestyle and comorbidity care, and follow-up with risk stratification and shared decision-making, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and define obstruction, because management hinges on accurate hemodynamic classification. HOCM is best understood as obstructive HCM with a dynamic left ventricular outflow tract gradient of at least 30 mmHg at rest or with provocation, with thresholds of 50 mmHg typically used to consider advanced therapies when symptoms persist, and I should double-check that provocation includes Valsalva, standing, or exercise rather than dobutamine, which lacks specificity [^115LKE5b] [^115dhKka].

> Wait, let me verify the initial evaluation elements before jumping to treatment. I need to ensure we assess symptoms, functional class, and objective exercise capacity, and I should confirm obstruction with echocardiography using provocative maneuvers; if noninvasive testing is discordant, invasive hemodynamics can clarify the gradient and guide therapy, and I should also screen for atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias given their prognostic implications [^115LKE5b] [^111c7vLs] [^114TU5Bk].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic therapy. Nonvasodilating beta-blockers are recommended as initial therapy to reduce heart rate, contractility, and LVOT gradient, with titration to effect or maximally tolerated dose; I need to ensure we document physiologic beta-blockade by showing resting heart rate suppression before declaring failure, and I should remember that most of the evidence base is older and heterogeneous, though meta-analytic data show consistent reductions in LVOT gradient and symptom improvement, which still supports their primacy [^114NreBj] [^114ZER2y] [^1125qq3o] [^115kFDy5].

> Hold on, I should verify agent selection and dosing pragmatics. Cardioselective beta-1 blockers such as metoprolol, bisoprolol, or atenolol are generally preferred for tolerability, while nonselective agents with alpha-blockade like labetalol are avoided due to potential worsening of LVOTO; propranolol remains historically validated but contemporary practice favors selective agents, and I should titrate to a resting heart rate around 60 bpm when feasible while monitoring for bradycardia, fatigue, and bronchospasm [^114QKyjJ] [^115kFDy5].

> If beta-blockers are ineffective or not tolerated, I need to check the next step. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or diltiazem are reasonable alternatives, but I should confirm we avoid them in patients with severe resting dyspnea, hypotension, very high resting gradients, or in neonates under 6 weeks due to potential harm; in those scenarios, I should reconsider the choice or proceed to alternative therapies rather than forcing a CCB trial [^112PdgTZ] [^117XQbvy] [^111j5h1a].

> I will now examine second-line options for persistent symptoms despite optimized first-line therapy. Disopyramide, a negative inotrope with vagolytic effects, can be added with an AV nodal blocking agent to mitigate rapid AF conduction; mavacamten, a cardiac myosin inhibitor, is FDA-approved for adults with symptomatic obstructive HCM and reduces LVOT gradient and improves functional capacity, but I should confirm LVEF is at least 50% before initiation and monitor for drops in ejection fraction during titration with periodic echocardiography [^1168Q2BR] [^116VsGjg] [^111g43EY] [^115kFDy5].

> But wait, what if symptoms remain severe or the gradient is very high despite maximal medical therapy. Septal reduction therapy (SRT) should be considered at experienced HCM centers, with surgical myectomy favored when concomitant structural abnormalities exist or when durable relief is prioritized, and alcohol septal ablation as an alternative when surgery is high risk or anatomy is favorable; I should confirm that contemporary outcomes in high-volume centers show very low mortality and high success, supporting earlier referral when indicated [^111RA3NT] [^113aA8Cg] [^111nKAp4].

> Let me consider special populations and procedural nuances. In children and young adults, myectomy remains preferred, though carefully selected patients may undergo alcohol septal ablation in exceptional circumstances after heart-team review; for older adults with high surgical risk, alcohol septal ablation is reasonable, and I should also remember that radiofrequency septal ablation is an emerging option with promising early results but still investigational and not yet standard of care, so I should frame it within research or select-center contexts [^114bPE29] [^111RA3NT] [^115y9Bi4] [^1123ed4d].

> I should double-check the role of emerging therapies and monitoring. Mavacamten requires a REMS program and serial echocardiography to detect LVEF decline, and ECG-based LVH indices may eventually help monitor response, though this remains investigational; likewise, myosin inhibitors are being studied in nonobstructive HCM, but current approval and strongest evidence remain in obstructive disease, so I need to avoid extrapolating beyond labeled indications [^115kFDy5] [^111TPvyq] [^116APHR7].

> Next, I should review acute management of hypotension or decompensation, because this is a different beast. In obstructive HCM with shock, I need to maximize preload and afterload while avoiding increases in contractility and heart rate; phenylephrine is recommended, and beta-blockade can be layered if not already in place, while I should avoid pure vasodilators, high-dose diuretics, and positive inotropes that can worsen LVOTO; if congestion is present, only cautious low-dose diuretics should be used alongside guideline-directed therapy [^114QZZ5U] [^114NreBj] [^117T4gz4].

> I need to ensure I address lifestyle and comorbidities that modulate risk and symptoms. Sleep-disordered breathing is highly prevalent and should be screened and treated, atrial fibrillation warrants rhythm control and anticoagulation given embolic risk, and exercise prescription should be individualized with shared decision-making rather than blanket restriction; I should also remember that contemporary HCM-related mortality can be as low as 0.5% per year with modern risk stratification and therapies, which supports proactive, guideline-concordant care [^114uPmip] [^114TU5Bk] [^1179Sm8D].

> Let me verify follow-up cadence and risk stratification. Annual clinical review with echocardiography is reasonable in stable patients, with closer intervals during medication changes or new symptoms; I should reassess SCD risk using validated factors and guideline algorithms, consider ICD placement when indicated, and maintain surveillance for AF and heart failure progression, adjusting therapy accordingly [^114TU5Bk].

> Hold on, I should verify that shared decision-making is emphasized throughout, especially for invasive options. Patients should be counseled on expected benefits, risks, and center-specific outcomes for SRT, and referrals to comprehensive HCM centers are encouraged when local expertise is limited; this is particularly important as earlier SRT may be reasonable in select patients with severe obstruction and progressive sequelae despite optimal medical therapy [^113aA8Cg] [^111RA3NT].

> In summary, I need to ensure a stepwise, evidence-aligned approach: confirm obstructive physiology and symptoms, start with a nonvasodilating beta-blocker titrated to effect, escalate to a CCB if needed and safe, add disopyramide or mavacamten for persistent symptoms, and refer for septal reduction at experienced centers when medical therapy fails or when severe obstruction with adverse features is present; throughout, I should monitor for adverse effects, avoid agents that worsen LVOTO, and tailor care to patient preferences and comorbidities, recognizing that modern outcomes are excellent when this protocol is followed [^114NreBj] [^114TU5Bk].

The management of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) centers on **first-line beta-blockers** [^115eCQaP] to reduce heart rate, contractility, and LVOT gradient, with **second-line verapamil or diltiazem** [^112PdgTZ] if beta-blockers are ineffective or not tolerated [^111DvzAA]. For refractory symptoms, add **disopyramide** [^1168Q2BR] or a **myosin inhibitor** (mavacamten) [^111g43EY] [^113dbKMX]; consider septal reduction therapy (myectomy or alcohol ablation) [^111RA3NT] at experienced centers if symptoms persist despite maximal medical therapy [^113aA8Cg]. Avoid vasodilators, high-dose diuretics, and positive inotropes [^114QZZ5U]; manage acute hypotension with phenylephrine and beta-blockade [^114NreBj]. Address arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation, with rate control, rhythm control, and anticoagulation [^114CvxZJ] [^114TU5Bk]. Monitor with periodic echocardiography, ECG, and exercise testing [^111c7vLs], and refer to HCM centers for complex cases [^111tKHit].

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line therapy

Beta-blockers are **first-line** [^115eCQaP] to reduce heart rate, contractility, and LVOT gradient; titrate to the maximally tolerated dose [^114ZER2y]. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) are **alternatives** [^112PdgTZ] when beta-blockers are ineffective or not tolerated [^111DvzAA]; use cautiously in severe obstruction or hypotension [^117XQbvy].

---

### Second-line therapy

Disopyramide, a negative inotrope, is added to beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers for **persistent symptoms** [^1168Q2BR]. Mavacamten, a cardiac myosin inhibitor, is indicated for **adults with persistent symptoms** despite first-line therapy; monitor LVEF and drug interactions [^111g43EY] [^115kFDy5].

---

### Medications to avoid

Avoid **vasodilators** (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) [^117T4gz4], high-dose diuretics, and positive inotropes (e.g. digoxin) because they can worsen LVOTO [^114QZZ5U].

---

## Invasive interventions

### Septal reduction therapy (SRT)

SRT is indicated for **persistent symptoms** despite maximal medical therapy [^111RA3NT]. Surgical myectomy is the **gold standard** [^115co8De] for durable relief of obstruction and symptom improvement; alcohol septal ablation is a less invasive alternative for selected patients [^113aA8Cg].

---

### Emerging therapies

Percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (PIMSRA) is an investigational option for **drug-refractory HOCM** [^115y9Bi4].

---

## Acute management of complications

### Acute hypotension

Use **intravenous fluids** to increase preload and phenylephrine to increase afterload; avoid vasodilators and positive inotropes [^114QZZ5U]. Beta-blockers reduce contractility and heart rate, thereby improving hemodynamics [^114NreBj].

---

### Arrhythmias

Atrial fibrillation requires **rate control, rhythm control, and anticoagulation** given the high thromboembolic risk [^114CvxZJ] [^114TU5Bk]. Ventricular arrhythmias are managed with ICDs for primary or secondary prevention based on risk stratification [^1179Sm8D].

---

## Lifestyle modifications and patient education

- **Exercise**: Encourage moderate-intensity aerobic exercise; avoid strenuous activities until symptoms are controlled [^116Bj9uQ].
- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate hydration to avoid preload reduction [^114QZZ5U].
- **Alcohol**: Limit intake to reduce arrhythmia risk [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Plan pregnancies with cardiology and obstetrics input; beta-blockers are generally safe [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **echocardiography** tracks LVOT gradient, septal thickness, and LV function [^115LKE5b]. Electrocardiography monitors for arrhythmias and conduction disease, and exercise testing assesses functional capacity and provocable obstruction [^111c7vLs]. Genetic counseling is offered to patients and relatives given the hereditary nature of HCM [^116Bj9uQ].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

Management at **experienced HCM centers** improves outcomes through coordinated pharmacologic, interventional, and surgical care [^111tKHit]. Shared decision-making engages patients in choosing among medical therapy, septal reduction, and emerging options [^113aA8Cg].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Beta-blockers | First-line therapy |
| 2 | Verapamil/diltiazem | Alternative or adjunctive |
| 3 | Disopyramide or mavacamten | Refractory symptoms |
| 4 | Septal reduction therapy | Persistent symptoms despite medical therapy |
| 5 | Acute hypotension | Phenylephrine, fluids, beta-blockers |
| 6 | Arrhythmias | Rate/rhythm control, anticoagulation, ICD |

---

Effective HOCM management requires a **stepwise approach**: start with beta-blockers, escalate to calcium channel blockers or disopyramide/mavacamten as needed, and consider septal reduction at experienced centers for refractory cases, all while avoiding agents that worsen obstruction and integrating lifestyle measures and close follow-up.

Background

Since the 1960s, beta blockers have been used to treat hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), a genetic disorder causing abnormal heart muscle thickening. This systematic review evaluates their efficacy across clinical outcomes.

Methods

Registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022344255), searches were performed in June 2022 and updated in September 2025 across MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PubMed. Two reviewers independently screened studies. Meta-analysis was undertaken when ≥ 3 comparable datasets were available; otherwise, narrative synthesis was used.

Results

21 studies including 775 adults met inclusion criteria. Beta blockers significantly reduced left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient (Standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.57; 95%CI -2.07 to -1.07) and heart rate (SMD -1.19; 95%CI -2.24 to -0.14). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the LVOT effect, while heart rate effects remained heterogeneous. Improvements in New York Heart Association class, exercise tolerance and symptom burden were consistently reported, although data were subjective and small in scale. Mortality evidence was limited to two retrospective cohorts with divergent findings.

Conclusions

Beta blockers provide consistent haemodynamic and symptomatic benefits in HOCM, but most evidence derives from small, older studies with high risk of bias and limited survival data. Contemporary, adequately powered randomised controlled trials are required to define optimal agent selection, dosing and long-term outcomes.

### Beta blockers and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111fzYSr]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review shows that beta blockers provide consistent clinical benefits in HOCM, reducing LVOT gradients, relieving symptoms and improving exercise tolerance. Although many studies are small and dated, more recent data support these findings.

Uncertainty remains regarding optimal agent selection, dosing and the effect on long-term survival, as mortality evidence is limited to two retrospective cohorts with divergent results. Future trials should integrate haemodynamic, symptomatic and survival endpoints within the same populations to determine whether physiological improvements translate into meaningful long-term benefit.

As new pharmaco-structural therapies emerge, beta blockers may eventually be superseded. Nonetheless, ongoing evaluation of current practice remains essential to guide future strategies and improve outcomes for patients with HOCM.

Introduction

Since their introduction in 1964 for angina, beta blockers have become a cornerstone of cardiovascular pharmacology. Propranolol, the first licensed agent, remains widely used, including for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

HOCM is an autosomal dominant disorder causing myocardial and septal thickening, impairing cardiac function. It affects~0.2% of the population and is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Management is complex, as preload-reducing therapies can worsen obstruction. Treatment mainly relies on beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, though newer myosin inhibitors and gene therapies show promise.

Beta blockers act on β₁ and β₂ adrenergic receptors. In HOCM, they improve diastolic filling by lowering heart rate (HR), reduce contractility and left ventricular (LV) outflow gradients and decrease oxygen demand. Their antiarrhythmic effects arise from limiting arrhythmias linked to fibrosis, ischaemia and sympathetic overactivity. Long-term use may delay remodelling and fibrosis, improving symptoms and quality of life.

Early randomised controlled trials (RCTs) confirmed these benefits, but reviews in 2002 and 2014 gave little emphasis to beta blockers. A 2021 RCT showed significant improvements in symptoms, function and haemodynamics versus placebo, and later reviews incorporated these findings into evolving treatment approaches.

This systematic review evaluates six decades of evidence on beta blockers in HOCM, analysing qualitative and quantitative data to define their therapeutic role.

Strengths and limitations

A substantial body of evidence supports beta blockers in HOCM, with consistent improvements in HR, LVOT gradient and symptom burden allowing evidence-based conclusions.

However, important limitations remain. Few large RCTs exist; Dybro et al is one of the few high-quality examples, limiting pooled analyses. Most included studies were small, underpowered and heterogeneous in design, dosing and outcomes. Only two retrospective cohorts contributed meaningful mortality data, leaving the survival effect uncertain. Older studies often omitted SDs and lacked detail on randomisation, blinding and confounding. Risk of bias was generally high. Sensitivity analyses confirmed LVOT findings were robust but highlighted heterogeneity in HR and symptom outcomes.

Many recent HOCM trials have focused on novel agents, where beta blockers were background therapy; therefore, data could not be isolated. Despite these weaknesses, consistent improvements across settings suggest beta blockers provide symptomatic and haemodynamic benefit, supporting their continued role and the need for contemporary, adequately powered RCTs.

Certainty of data

Certainty of evidence was appraised using ROB-1 for RCTs, ROBINS-I for cohorts and OCEBM levels (table 6). LVOT gradient reduction was rated moderate certainty. HR, NYHA, BP, symptoms and metabolism were based on small, heterogeneous or older studies, giving low certainty. Mortality, limited to two confounded cohorts with conflicting findings, was rated very low certainty.

### Contemporary clinical characteristics and management patterns in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: insights from baseline enrolment data in a nationwide prospective Japanese registry [^113HW8aa]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

The Japanese Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Registry Study was designed to provide comprehensive, real-world insights into the clinical characteristics and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in Japan.

Methods

This multicentre, prospective study enrolled consecutive patients with HCM from 24 referral hospitals across Japan starting in 2016. The baseline characteristics of 1485 patients enrolled by December 2019 are presented in this analysis.

Results

The median ages at registration and diagnosis were 69 and 60 years, respectively, with men accounting for 54% of the cohort. Familial HCM was confirmed in 18% of cases. Of the cohort, 36% had hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), while 8% had mid-ventricular obstruction, 14% had apical HCM and 4% were in the end-stage phase. Atrial fibrillation was observed in 27% of patients, though the majority were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms at registration. Adverse outcomes included prior sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (6%), heart failure requiring hospitalisation (11%) and embolic events (5%). Defibrillator implantation was performed in 11% of patients. Differences in the defibrillator indications for primary prevention in the current three guidelines and status of defibrillator deployment at registration were clarified: the percentages of class IIa recommendation in the whole cohort and of patients with defibrillator implantation in class IIa were 22% and 19% in the Japanese guidelines, 4% and 39% in the European guidelines and 28% and 22% in the American guidelines, respectively. Beta blockers were prescribed to 90% of patients with HOCM, while 51% received cibenzoline. Septal reduction therapies were performed in 22% of patients with HOCM, with 6% undergoing surgical myectomy.

Conclusions

As the first large-scale, prospective HCM registry in Japan, this study provides valuable baseline data on the clinical characteristics and management of HCM. These findings will help address gaps between current practice and guideline recommendations, improving the care of patients with HCM.

Symptom burden

Four studies evaluated symptom burden in HOCM, all reporting overall improvement. While NYHA class provides a broad measure, examining individual symptoms such as dyspnoea, palpitations and angina may better guide treatment. Most studies noted reductions in these symptoms, though one reported persistent dyspnoea despite therapy.

Three studies were cohorts and one (Tendera et al) a double-blind crossover trial, giving a combined sample of 66 patients — too small for firm conclusions and underscoring the need for larger trials. Outcomes were subjective and unblinded, raising risk of bias. Sensitivity across study type and quality showed a consistent direction of benefit, though magnitude varied. Standardised, blinded measures are needed to reduce bias and improve reliability.

Pharmacology

Guidelines for beta-blocker selection in HOCM are limited. Cardio-selective agents (bisoprolol, metoprolol, atenolol) are generally preferred, while non-selective agents with α-blocking properties such as labetalol are avoided as they may worsen LVOT gradients. Propranolol is the most studied, reflecting early use, though recent data focus more on bisoprolol and metoprolol.

Both selective and non-selective β-blockers reduced HR, LVOT gradient and improved NYHA class, but dosing varied widely, complicating attribution to individual drugs and underscoring the need for adequately powered RCTs of contemporary agents. Despite stratification by drug and dose, no β-blocker showed clear superiority; benefits appear class-wide, with cardio-selective β₁-blockers preferred for tolerability and safety. Adverse effects were broadly consistent, with most discontinuations due to bradycardia or intolerance, but incomplete reporting — especially in older cohorts — limits reliable safety comparisons.

Effect on stage of disease

Beta blockers reduce LVOT gradients across obstruction types but are most effective in latent and labile cases. Propranolol's prevention of stress-induced obstruction suggests early use may slow hypertrophy progression. In resting obstruction, outcomes were mixed — some patients improved, others worsened or died — indicating limited benefit in advanced disease. This contrasts with haemodynamic data showing consistent gradient reduction, likely reflecting differences in severity and study design. Adelman et al lacked a placebo group, and variable enrolment stages further limit inference. Stenson et al noted acute benefit during stress but questioned long-term disease modification. Sensitivity analyses showed a consistent directional effect, but small, unblinded cohorts and inconsistent stratification raise risk of bias. Overall, beta blockers are effective in latent and labile obstruction, while benefits in resting obstruction remain uncertain.

### ECG markers of left ventricular hypertrophy indicate response to mavacamten in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^111TPvyq]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common genetic heart disease characterised by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), often associated with myocardial disarray and fibrosis. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is characterised by dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) leading to an LVOT gradient of ≥ 30 mm Hg at rest or during Valsalva.HOCM presents with a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic cases to progressive heart failure. Common symptoms include dyspnoea, chest pain, syncope and palpitations. Atrial fibrillation is frequent, occurring in roughly 25% of cases, with an associated increased risk of thromboembolic events.HOCM is also a leading cause of sudden cardiac death.

HOCM management follows a stepwise approach, beginning with negative inotropic therapy, beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Mavacamten, a selective cardiac myosin inhibitor, represents a novel treatment option targeting hypercontractility by binding to cardiac myosin ATPase enzyme and stabilising its inhibited state. This reduces the interaction between myosin and actin in the heart muscle, leading to a decrease in excessive contractile force enhancing myocardial function and reducing LVOTO in patients with HOCM. Clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing LVOTO, improving symptoms and reducing the need for invasive septum reduction therapies.

Mavacamten therapy requires regular monitoring to ensure effective dosing. During dose titration, cardiac function is assessed at weeks 4, 8 and 12, followed by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at least every 3–6 months once a stable dose is achieved. The monitoring regimen places a considerable logistical and resource burden on both patients and healthcare providers. As a result, mavacamten treatment is currently limited to specialised centres with the infrastructure and expertise to manage such intensive follow-ups. Given that HOCM is often associated with signs of LVH in ECG, growing evidence suggests that changes in ECG including LVH indices occur during mavacamten treatment. The dynamics and potential diagnostic value of these ECG changes during mavacamten therapy are currently unknown.

This study aims to evaluate whether established ECG LVH indices can serve as a time-efficient tool to monitor treatment response and detect therapy failure. Using ECG-based monitoring could reduce the need for frequent and resource-intensive follow-ups.

### Beta blockers and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116GJ9p5]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This project aimed to evaluate the evidence for beta blockers in HOCM by analysing outcomes including NYHA score, symptom burden, cardiac metabolism, exercise tolerance, mortality and side effects.

Haemodynamics

Haemodynamic effects are the most studied outcome in beta-blocker treatment for HOCM. 15 studies, including 2 RCTs, reported haemodynamic data. Meta-analysis showed significant reductions in HR and LVOT gradient, consistent across RCTs and cohorts. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the effect on LVOT gradient was robust across models and after excluding high risk-of-bias studies, while the HR effect was directionally consistent but heterogeneous (I² = 84%).

BP generally decreased, though clinical relevance remains uncertain. LVEF fell in three studies, reflecting the negative inotropic action of beta blockers, but interpretation is limited since HOCM often presents with preserved ejection fraction heart failure. Stroke volume results were inconsistent.

Many studies were small, dated or incompletely reported, often lacking blinding or adjustment for confounders, which increases risk of bias and reduces confidence in pooled estimates.

New York Heart Association

Nine studies evaluated beta blockers using NYHA class, consistently reporting symptomatic improvement. Detailed data on class transitions were often lacking, so whether patients improved gradually or abruptly remains unclear. No study included class IV patients, limiting conclusions in the most severe disease.

Patients starting in NYHA II–III generally improved, though responsiveness varied, indicating heterogeneity in treatment effect. This likely reflects differences in study design, small samples and unblinded assessment. As NYHA scoring is subjective and reliant on physician judgement, the risk of measurement and reporting bias is high.

Sensitivity analyses across study type and era showed a consistent direction of benefit: both older cohorts and recent RCTs demonstrated downgrades. However, the magnitude varied, and many studies were small, unblinded or incompletely reported, increasing risk of bias and reducing certainty.

Cardiac metabolism

Four studies examined cardiac metabolism. Two used metabolic markersand showed improved efficiency with beta blockers, while Cohen et al and Tendera et al assessed angina onset as a surrogate for myocardial oxygen demand, both reporting improved exercise endurance. These findings support beta blockers' role in reducing oxygen demand and enhancing exercise tolerance, with potential quality-of-life benefits.

Sensitivity across study design and era showed consistent directional benefit, but all studies were small, mostly decades old, limiting certainty and applicability to modern practice.

### Efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jt7nY]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) could lead to symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope due to left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Population‐based studies estimated that the prevalence of HOCM was 0.02% to 0.23% in adults. 1 The morbidity and mortality were higher in a population with LVOT obstruction than in that without. 2, 3, 4

An increased LVOT gradient, which is defined as a peak gradient ≥ 30 mmHg, was present in 20% to 30% and 70% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients at rest and with exercise provocation, respectively. The key causes of an increased LVOT gradient were septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. 1, 5 For decades, myectomy has been the golden standard therapy for symptomatic drug‐resistant HOCM because of its excellent outcome. 6 Moreover, alcohol septal ablation (ASA) has been an appealing alternative approach in the treatment of HOCM because it effectively reduced symptoms with less trauma and shorter hospital stay than myectomy. Nevertheless, the use of ASA is limited by coronary anatomy, which means that 5% to15% of patients are unsuitable to undergo ASA. 7, 8

Radiofrequency catheter ablation has been a well‐accepted treatment of cardiac arrhythmia for many decades. This technique has been also used to relieve LVOT obstruction without restriction of the coronary anatomy. 9 However, the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency septal ablation have not been clear, as only small studies on this topic were conducted. Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the short‐term efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation for HOCM.

### Efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161cL2a]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although radiofrequency ablation is widely used in the treatment of arrhythmias, its role in septal reduction therapy of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency septal ablation for HOCM.

Hypothesis

Radiofrequency septal ablation is effective and safe for relieving obstruction and improving exercise capacity in patients with HOCM.

Methods

A systematic review of eligible studies that reported outcomes of patients with HOCM who underwent radiofrequency septal ablation was performed using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, ProQuest, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science database. Pooled estimates were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Publication bias and sensitivity analyses were also performed.

Results

Eight studies with 91 patients (mean follow-up 11.6months) were included. The left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient at rest decreased significantly after radiofrequency septal ablation (pooled reduction: -58.8mmHg; 95% confidence interval [CI] -64.3 to -53.5). A reduction was also found in the provoked LVOT gradient with a pooled reduction of -97.6mmHg (95% CI: -124.4 to -87.1). An improvement of the New York Heart Association classification (mean: -1.4; 95% CI: -1.6 to -1.2) was found during follow-up. The change in septal thickness was minimal and not statistically significant. Two procedure-related deaths were documented, and complete heart block occurred in eight patients.

Conclusions

Radiofrequency septal ablation is effective and safe for relieving LVOT obstruction and improving exercise capacity in patients with HOCM.

### Management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: JACC state-of-the-art review [^116HQTSF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a relatively common, globally distributed, and often inherited primary cardiac disease, has now transformed into a contemporary highly treatable condition with effective options that alter natural history along specific personalized adverse pathways at all ages. HCM patients with disease-related complications benefit from: matured risk stratification in which major markers reliably select patients for prophylactic defibrillators and prevention of arrhythmic sudden death; low risk to high benefit surgical myectomy (with percutaneous alcohol ablation a selective alternative) that reverses progressive heart failure caused by outflow obstruction; anticoagulation prophylaxis that prevents atrial fibrillation-related embolic stroke and ablation techniques that decrease the frequency of paroxysmal episodes; and occasionally, heart transplant for end-stage nonobstructive patients. Those innovations have substantially improved outcomes by significantly reducing morbidity and HCM-related mortality to 0.5%/y. Palliative pharmacological strategies with currently available negative inotropic drugs can control symptoms over the short-term in some patients, but generally do not alter long-term clinical course. Notably, a substantial proportion of HCM patients (largely those identified without outflow obstruction) experience a stable/benign course without major interventions. The expert panel has critically appraised all available data and presented management insights and recommendations with concise principles for clinical decision-making.

Improving care for nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — managing symptomatic nonobstructive HCM remains a major clinical challenge; unlike obstructive HCM where obstructive physiology can be effectively targeted and treated with medical and surgical approaches, the driving pathophysiology of nonobstructive HCM remains somewhat elusive, with diastolic abnormalities, restrictive physiology, and myocardial energetics thought to be important but currently not well addressed; priorities include clinical trials of cardiac myosin inhibitors, investigation of whether benefits seen with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction apply to nonobstructive HCM, trials of lifestyle interventions to reduce symptom burden, and adding HCM to reimbursable diagnoses to extend cardiopulmonary rehabilitation benefits.

### Indications for surgery in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112EUDSu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Will the advent of new pharmacologic agents decrease the number of surgeries performed for obstructive HCM? We are skeptical about that here. Rather, we expect an increased diagnostic recognition of HCM because of its higher profile in the medical community and better imaging. HCM is no longer a poor‐prognosis disease because of modern application of lifesaving therapy with the implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator, and because of quality‐of‐life improving therapies. 20 We expect increased referrals to HCM centers, and that a "rising tide will lift all boats" with robust referrals for both medical care and appropriate surgical referral in a stepped manner. Regardless how the mix of therapies pans out, the future is bright for patients with obstructive HCM.

Obstructive HCM invasive therapy — invasive septal reduction therapies (surgical septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation) performed by experienced HCM teams at dedicated centers can provide safe and effective symptomatic relief for drug-refractory or severe outflow tract obstruction, and given improved outcomes at comprehensive HCM centers, these decisions are an optimal opportunity for referral.

### Radiofrequency septal reduction in symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^116FBF7d]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol septal ablation remains the only approved nonsurgical therapeutic alternative for patients with drug-resistant hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Radiofrequency (RF) ablation offers another option for treating HOCM.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether irrigated RF ablation can reduce symptomatic outflow tract obstruction in adults with HOCM.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic HOCM and an outflow gradient of > 50 mm Hg despite medication were offered RF ablation. In 11 patients, the hypertrophied interventricular septum was localized on a 3-dimensional mapping system and ablated via a transmitral or retrograde aortic approach.

Results

Ten of 11(91%) patients had a significant and persistent reduction in resting and provocable left ventricular outflow tract gradients. Mean resting gradients at 12 months postprocedure were reduced by 85% (66.7 mm Hg at baseline to 10.0 mm Hg at 12 months); mean provocable gradients were reduced by 85% from baseline (136.2 mm Hg at baseline to 20.0 mm Hg at 12 months). Functional New York Heart Association heart classification improved from class 3.0 ± 0.0 in all patients to class mean of 1.8 ± 0.8.

Conclusion

RF septal ablation for the treatment of HOCM is a safe therapeutic option that allows for significant reduction in left ventricular outflow tract gradients, improvement in symptoms, and increase in efficacy rates comparable to reported rates for alcohol septal ablation.

### Real-world candidacy to mavacamten in a contemporary hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy population [^1118CFKT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

In the EXPLORER-HCM trial, mavacamten reduced left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) and improved functional capacity of symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) patients. We sought to define the potential use of mavacamten by comparing real-world HOCM patients with those enrolled in EXPLORER-HCM and assessing their eligibility to treatment.

Methods and Results

We collected information on HOCM patients followed up at 25 Italian HCM outpatient clinics and with significant LVOTO (i.e.g.radient ≥ 30mmHg at rest or ≥ 50mmHg after Valsalva manoeuvre or exercise) despite pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapy. Pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapy resolved LVOTO in 1044 (61.2%) of the 1706 HOCM patients under active follow-up, whereas 662 patients (38.8%) had persistent LVOTO. Compared to the EXPLORER-HCM trial population, these real-world HOCM patients were older (62.1 ± 14.3 vs. 58.5 ± 12.2years, p = 0.02), had a lower body mass index (26.8 ± 5.3 vs. 29.7 ± 4.9kg/m², p < 0.0001) and a more frequent history of atrial fibrillation (21.5% vs. 9.8%, p = 0.027). At echocardiography, they had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, 66 ± 7% vs. 74 ± 6%, p < 0.0001), higher left ventricular outflow tract gradients at rest (60 ± 27 vs. 52 ± 29mmHg, p = 0.003), and larger left atrial volume index (49 ± 16 vs. 40 ± 12ml/m², p < 0.0001). Overall, 324 (48.9%) would have been eligible for enrolment in the EXPLORER-HCM trial and 339 (51.2%) for treatment with mavacamten according to European guidelines.

Conclusions

Real-world HOCM patients differ from the EXPLORER-HCM population for their older age, lower LVEF and larger atrial volume, potentially reflecting a more advanced stage of the disease. About half of real-world HOCM patients were found eligible to mavacamten.

### Contemporary clinical characteristics and management patterns in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: insights from baseline enrolment data in a nationwide prospective Japanese registry [^115wtFtB]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical evaluation

Evaluation of patients included medical history, clinical examination, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography and ambulatory 24-hour Holter ECG analysis (details of the clinical evaluation method are shown in online supplemental file 2).

Based on morphological and haemodynamic assessments by echocardiography, we divided the patients into the following five groups: (1) hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), (2) mid-ventricular obstruction (MVO), (3) end-stage HCM, (4) apical HCM and (5) hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy (see online supplemental file 2 for details of the five groups definition).

In the current analysis of baseline characteristics, first, we compared the clinical features of patients with HCM with and without prior sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF). Then, we evaluated indications of ICD and status of defibrillator deployment at registration. Indication of ICD implantation follows guidelines: 2018 Japanese Circulation Society (JCS)/Japanese Heart Failure Society (JHFS) guidelines,2023 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelinesand 2024 AHA/ACC/AMSSM/HRS/PACES/SCMR guidelines (as American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines). In the current study, data for late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and abnormal blood pressure response during exercise could not be sufficiently collected and analysed, and they were therefore not used in the risk assessment. Finally, we focused on the clinical features of patients with HOCM and situations regarding treatment.

Data analysis

All data are expressed as mean ± SD, median (IQR) or frequency (percentage). To compare differences between groups, Student's t-test (if normally distributed) or the Mann-Whitney U test (non-normally distributed variables) for continuous variables and the χ² test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables were used. There were several missing data, including echocardiographic subtype information not available for 12 patients. A probability value of < 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS V.21 (IBM).

### Update on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a guide to the guidelines [^117YTLxw]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiovascular disorder, affecting 1 in 500 individuals worldwide. Existing epidemiological studies might have underestimated the prevalence of HCM, however, owing to limited inclusion of individuals with early, incomplete phenotypic expression. Clinical manifestations of HCM include diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, ischaemia, atrial fibrillation, abnormal vascular responses and, in 5% of patients, progression to a 'burnt-out' phase characterized by systolic impairment. Disease-related mortality is most often attributable to sudden cardiac death, heart failure, and embolic stroke. The majority of individuals with HCM, however, have normal or near-normal life expectancy, owing in part to contemporary management strategies including family screening, risk stratification, thromboembolic prophylaxis, and implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators. The clinical guidelines for HCM issued by the ACC Foundation/AHA and the ESC facilitate evaluation and management of the disease. In this Review, we aim to assist clinicians in navigating the guidelines by highlighting important updates, current gaps in knowledge, differences in the recommendations, and challenges in implementing them, including aids and pitfalls in clinical and pathological evaluation. We also discuss the advances in genetics, imaging, and molecular research that will underpin future developments in diagnosis and therapy for HCM.

Because of marked heterogeneity in clinical expression, natural history, and prognosis, 11–20 HCM often represents a dilemma to primary care clinicians and cardiovascular specialists, even to those for whom this disease is a focus of their investigative careers. Controversy abounds with regard to diagnostic criteria, clinical. course, and management for which difficult questions often arise, particularly among practitioners infrequently engaged in the evaluation of HCM patients. Consequently, it is timely to place in perspective and clarify many of these relevant clinical issues and profile the rapidly evolving concepts regarding HCM.

### Percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation in patients with drug-refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^115y9Bi4]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and drug-refractory symptoms and outflow gradients have limited nonsurgical treatment options. The feasibility of percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (PIMSRA) has been reported previously; however, procedural and medium-term outcomes are unknown.

Objective

To describe the safety and medium-term outcomes of PIMSRA in a large patient cohort with drug-refractory HOCM.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a single-arm, open-label study of PIMSRA in patients with drug-refractory HOCM. Patients presenting to the Xijing Hospital in Xi'an, China, between October 2016 to June 2020 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Of 1314 patients presenting with HOCM, 244 fulfilled inclusion criteria of severe resting/provoked outflow gradients of 50 mm Hg or higher, and symptoms of New York Heart Association functional class of II or higher refractory to maximum tolerated medications. After discussion among the heart team, 40 patients underwent surgical or alcohol septal reduction therapy and 4 required treatment of significant coronary artery disease.

Interventions

PIMSRA performed in patients.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 30-day major adverse clinical events: death, emergency surgery, severe effusion requiring intervention, procedure-related stroke, bleeding, and stroke. Secondary outcomes included 30-day technical success and 90-day improvement in outflow obstruction.

Results

The mean (SD) age of 200 patients was 46.9(14.0) years, and 125 (62.5%) were men. Resting or provoked left ventricular outflow tract gradients were 50 mm Hg or higher. The median (IQR) follow-up for all patients was 19 (6–50) months. Thirty-day major adverse clinical events rate was 10.5% (n = 21): there were 2 in-hospital/30-day deaths (1.0%), 7 patients (3.5%) with pericardial effusion requiring mini-thoracotomy, 12 patients (6%) with pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis, and no bleeding or strokes. Other periprocedural complications included permanent right bundle branch block in 5 patients (2.5%), resuscitated ventricular fibrillation in 2 (1.0%), and septal branch aneurysm in 2 (1.0%). There were no permanent pacemaker implantations. At follow-up, maximum septal thickness was reduced from a mean (SD) of 24.0(5.1) mm to 17.3(4.4) mm (P < .001), and left ventricular outflow tract gradient was decreased from a mean (SD) of 79.0(53.0) mm Hg to 14.0(24.0) mm Hg (P < .001). Overall, 190 patients (96%) with HOCM were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II at last follow-up.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that PIMSRA in patients with drug-refractory HOCM may be an effective procedure for relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and symptoms with acceptable complication rates. These results are encouraging and support the design of a randomized clinical trial against well-established septal reduction therapies.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^111FJPLj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Despite low annual mortality rates, patients with nonobstructive HCM have high rates of adverse clinical events, almost equivalent to those with obstructive HCM. Patients with nonobstructive HCM warrant thorough vetting, with a focus on the need for defibrillator therapy. Patients with obstructive HCM have the worst symptoms and high rates of adverse events. They merit aggressive treatment. Patients with labile HCM have the best prognosis and may need less aggressive management, with the recognition that all patients with HCM should be objectively risk stratified. Further large‐scale studies with longer follow‐up are needed to support our results.

### Anesthesia management of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^116djPFw]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy presents a challenge to the anesthesiologist. Because the condition is relatively prevalent, it is important for anesthesiologist to be aware of the pathophysiology. In this review, we draw upon case reports and studies of the anesthesia management of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy to enhance medical decision making. The scope of this article ranges from the preoperative period, when the severity of the obstruction needs to be assessed; the intraoperative period, with monitoring, as well as general management guidelines; and finally, the postoperative period, when it is important to minimize the sympathetic response. Furthermore, we address the management of the obstetric patient, with particular focus on neuraxial anesthesia, and extrapolate how this type of anesthesia may be applied to the management of patients undergoing nonlaboring, noncardiac surgery.

### Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy after nonsurgical septal reduction therapy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^111NgoFc]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the absence of increased external load. Recently, nonsurgical septal reduction therapy (NSRT) with intracoronary ethanol has been introduced to treat severely symptomatic patients with outflow tract obstruction. Its long-term effects on LV mass, however, are unknown.

Methods and Results

The LV size, function, and outflow tract gradient of 26 HOCM patients (53 ± 15 years old) who underwent NSRT were assessed by echocardiography at baseline and 1 and 2 years after the procedure. LVH was evaluated by wall thickness of individual myocardial segments, planimetered myocardial area, and mass. The outflow gradient decreased from 36 ± 6 mm Hg before NSRT to 0 ± 3 mm Hg at 2 years (P < 0.001), with patients experiencing symptomatic improvement (P < 0.05). LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions increased significantly at both 1 and 2 years (P < 0.001). All parameters of LVH showed evidence of regression. LV mass decreased (301 ± 78 g at baseline, 223 ± 5 g at 1 year, and 190 ± 58 g at 2 years; P < 0.01), with the 2-year reduction in mass related to infarct size and the acute reduction in outflow tract gradient (r = 0.48, P < 0.05 and r = 0.63, P < 0.01, respectively).

Conclusions

NSRT results in LV remodeling that is characterized by an increase in LV size and a decrease in the extent of LVH.

### Current management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114TU5Bk]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common yet under-recognized genetic structural heart condition characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients may present with obstructive disease characterized by an elevated left ventricular outflow tract gradient or non-obstructive disease. Long established medical and surgical treatment options for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and refractory symptoms can be effective in eliminating outflow tract gradients and improving symptoms. Cardiac myosin inhibitors have emerged as a new class of evidence based medical therapy for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and an alternative to septal reduction therapies. However, effective treatments for patients with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy remain limited, with several clinical trials ongoing. Variants in cardiac sarcomeric genes are the primary genetic cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and are being investigated as targets for gene based therapies. Stratification of the risk of sudden death is an important component of caring for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Recommendations for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation are based on well validated risk factors in combination with shared decision making. Atrial fibrillation is common in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and anticoagulation is strongly recommended for stroke prevention. Rhythm control is essential for patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Historically, vigorous exercise has been restricted; however, newer data suggest that the arrhythmic risk is less than previously thought and emphasize an individualized approach. Advanced heart failure is an uncommon but important cause of morbidity and mortality. Early identification is key to improving outcomes with advanced therapies including cardiac transplantation. The management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is rapidly evolving toward a more personalized approach, based on genotype and phenotype, to alter disease progression and improve patients' outcomes.

Nomenclature and differential diagnosis — Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy terminology: Because left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) is not invariably present, the writing committee recommends the term HCM (with or without outflow tract obstruction), and using HCM to describe increased LV wall thickness due to systemic disorders or secondary causes of LV hypertrophy (LVH) can lead to confusion.

### Medical therapies to improve left Ventricular outflow obstruction and Diastolic function in hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy [^114zNmTm]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) and nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (nHCM) are usually inherited cardiomyopathies due to gene mutations of the sarcomere leading to abnormal thickening of the myocardium, myocyte disarray, and hyperdynamic contractility. The definition of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is usually a maximal left ventricular (LV) wall thickness ≥ 15 mm (or ≥ 13 mm in individuals with pathogenic HCM gene mutations or a family history of HCM) in the absence of identifiable causes of hypertrophy (eg, LV pressure overload, infiltrative cardiomyopathies). The hemodynamic consequences of these myocardial abnormalities are left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) or intracavitary obstruction (in oHCM, defined as a resting or provocable gradient ≥ 30 mm Hg) and diastolic dysfunction (both oHCM and nHCM), all of which are putative mechanisms for the typical clinical symptoms. While medical therapies addressing underlying pathomechanisms are currently limited, some therapies have been shown to improve hemodynamic abnormalities and symptoms and potentially disease trajectory in patients with HCM. While invasive therapies are available and effective in resolving outflow obstruction, they may not completely normalize underlying structural and functional derangements and associated symptoms.

Medical therapy is currently the mainstay for symptom management for patients with HCM, as it can resolve or improve symptoms sufficiently in the majority of patients. Recent guidelines recommend nonvasodilating beta-blockers (BBs) as first-line and nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) followed by disopyramide as second- and third-line medical therapies for symptomatic oHCM (Central Illustration). These recommendations are based on small studies — most of them are nonrandomized and underpowered (Table 1) — and expert opinion. To give practitioners who treat patients with HCM a more complete picture of the available evidence and point out crucial knowledge gaps, this review will summarize the available data on the effectiveness of recommended and commonly prescribed pharmacotherapies.

Pharmacological management of symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — In patients with obstructive HCM and symptoms attributable to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO), nonvasodilating beta blockers titrated to effectiveness or maximally tolerated doses are recommended. If beta blockers are ineffective or not tolerated, substitution with nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) is recommended. For persistent symptoms attributable to LVOTO despite beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, adding a myosin inhibitor (adult patients only), disopyramide (in combination with an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent), or SRT performed at experienced centers is recommended. For acute hypotension unresponsive to fluid administration in obstructive HCM, intravenous phenylephrine (or other vasoconstrictors without inotropic activity), alone or with beta‑blocking drugs, is recommended. For persistent dyspnea with clinical evidence of volume overload and high left‑sided filling pressures despite other HCM guideline‑directed medical therapy, cautious use of low‑dose oral diuretics may be considered.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a long-term follow-up study based on the euro-alcohol septal ablation registry [^115CKcin]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The fact that current treatment guidelines on HCM generally recommend watchful waiting until development of severe symptoms before invasive treatment parallels established practice in patients with severe aortic stenosis. 6, 7 However, a growing body of evidence suggests that long‐term outcome in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis managed conservatively is dismal, and that earlier invasive treatment could lead to improved outcomes. 23, 24, 25 Along this line, it appears possible that mildly symptomatic HOCM patients with severe LVOTO could benefit from early invasive treatment aimed at LVOTO reduction. However, decision making for early septal reduction therapy in mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM is complex, and these patients may represent a diverse group. Furthermore, septal reduction therapy (myectomy or ASA) should only be performed in dedicated centers that can achieve a procedure‐related mortality rate less than 1%. 26

Notably, the European Society of cardiology HCM risk calculator used to estimate the risk for SCD considers some mildly symptomatic patients with LVOTO to be eligible for ICD implantation. 27 Although patients after septal reduction therapy should not be subject to SCD risk evaluation with this calculator, one can speculate that diminishing LVOTO by invasive treatment could lower the risk of SCD in some of these patients. 16 This may not only improve survival, but might also reduce the need for ICD implantation. Such a clinical scenario is not uncommon, but an adequate therapeutic strategy has not yet been determined in these patients. 6, 7 Randomized trials would be ultimately required to determine whether the primary therapeutic goal in such patients should be invasive reduction of LVOTO and/or ICD implantation, but, in the meantime, more retrospective data, such as those presented in the current study, are needed on outcomes in mildly symptomatic HOCM patients, especially those with severe LVOTO.

### Medical, surgical, and interventional management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^116hs5bw]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common but underrecognized cardiac disorder characterized by a heterogenous phenotype that includes increased left ventricular thickness, outflow obstruction, diastolic dysfunction, and arrhythmia. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is often heritable and associated with pathogenic variants in sarcomeric genes. While not curable, an integrated approach involving medical, interventional, and surgical care can have a considerable impact on disease burden, quality of life, and mortality. This review provides a practical overview of important topics in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, including evaluation of differential diagnosis, imaging, provocation of left ventricular outflow obstruction, treatment of obstructive and nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with negative inotropic therapy and myosin inhibition, as well as surgical and interventional approaches to septal reduction and mitral valve intervention.

### Significant reduction of left atrial volume concomitant with clinical improvement after percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation for drug-refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and its precise detection with multidetector CT [^114241R9]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

In patients with HOCM, both systolic anterior motion-related mitral insufficiency and elevated LV end-diastolic pressure due to LV hypertrophy cause LA enlargement. The 2014 European Society of Cardiology guidelines indicated that the size of the left atrium provides important prognostic information on patients with HCM. Our study showed significant LA volume reduction in drug-refractory patients with HOCM after PTSMA. This point is consistent with previous studies showing that patients undergoing PTSMA, performed by experienced operators, experienced favourable outcomes without an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. In addition, PTSMA could aid in maintaining normal sinus rhythm by preventing LA enlargement and may improve the quality of life in drug-refractory patients with HOCM, especially aged patients.

Previous studies revealed that PTSMA improved short-term and long-term outcomes in drug-refractory patients with HOCM even if drug therapy did not comply with accepted guidelines. In our study, all patients received β-blocker therapy, which means that our patients were truly 'drug refractory'. Our strategy for drug-refractory patients faithfully followed guidelines on the diagnosis and management of HCM. All patients referred to our hospital were observed for at least a couple of months, and we treated all patients with non-vasodilating β blockers that were titrated to maximum tolerated dose during the observational period.

Study limitation

Our study population was of limited size. A relatively few patients, however, are truly drug-refractory HOCM.

Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — pharmacological management when symptoms persist despite first-line therapy: For patients with obstructive HCM who have persistent symptoms attributable to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) despite beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, adding a myosin inhibitor (adult patient only), or disopyramide in combination with an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent, or septal reduction therapy (SRT) performed at experienced centers, is recommended.

Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — invasive treatment of symptomatic patients: For those who remain symptomatic despite guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), septal reduction therapy (SRT) in eligible patients, performed at experienced HCM centers, is recommended for relieving LVOTO (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In symptomatic patients with obstructive HCM who have associated cardiac disease requiring surgical treatment (for example, associated anomalous papillary muscle, markedly elongated anterior mitral leaflet, intrinsic mitral valve disease, multivessel CAD, valvular aortic stenosis), surgical myectomy performed at experienced HCM centers is recommended (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In adult patients who remain severely symptomatic despite GDMT and in whom surgery is contraindicated or the risk is considered unacceptable because of serious comorbidities or advanced age, alcohol septal ablation in eligible patients, performed at experienced HCM centers, is recommended (COR 1, LOE C-LD). Earlier (NYHA class II) surgical myectomy performed at comprehensive HCM centers may be reasonable in the presence of additional clinical factors, including severe and progressive pulmonary hypertension thought to be attributable to LVOTO or associated MR, left atrial enlargement with ≥ 1 episodes of symptomatic AF, poor functional capacity attributable to LVOTO as documented on treadmill exercise testing, and children and young adults with very high resting LVOT gradients (> 100 mm Hg) (COR 2b, LOE B-NR). For symptomatic patients with obstructive HCM, SRT in eligible patients, performed at experienced HCM centers, may be considered as an alternative to escalation of medical therapy after shared decision-making including risks and benefits of all treatment options (COR 2b, LOE C-LD).

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) thresholds and provocative testing: Obstruction is considered present if peak LVOT gradient is ≥ 30 mm Hg, and resting or provoked gradients ≥ 50 mm Hg are generally considered capable of causing symptoms and are the threshold for contemplating advanced pharmacological or invasive therapies if symptoms are refractory to standard management. Provocative maneuvers are recommended if minimal gradients (ie, < 30 mm Hg) are observed at rest; maneuvers include standing, Valsalva strain, or exercise with simultaneous auscultation or echocardiography. Using dobutamine to identify latent LVOTO and eligibility for advanced therapies is not advised due to lack of specificity. The site and characteristics of obstruction should be identified, and if clinical and echocardiographic findings are discordant, invasive assessment for LVOTO may be helpful.

### Analysis of risk factors for complications in echocardiography-guided percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation [^111zYY6u]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is a genetic cardiovascular disorder characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, resulting in left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). HOCM can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, arrhythmias, and in some cases, cardiac death. Currently, HOCM can be treated through septal reduction procedures, implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators, and other methods to improve clinical symptoms, relief LVOTO, and prevent sudden cardiac death. For HOCM patients resistant to drug therapy, invasive interventions play a crucial role in treatment. Septal reduction therapies, such as surgical septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation (ASA), have demonstrated ongoing improvements in safety and efficacy. Recently, percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (PIMSRA) has emerged as a novel and clinically feasible procedure for treating HOCM. The technique utilizes radiofrequency energy to ablate a small area of heart muscle causing obstruction. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential occurrence of complications associated with PIMSRA. Common complications during PIMSRA procedures include pericardial effusion, premature ventricular contraction, and myocardial perforation etc.

In this study, our objective is to analyze the risk factors associated with complications during PIMSRA. By exploring these aspects, we intend to provide valuable insights that not only enhance the safety profile of PIMSRA but also refine its application in the context of HOCM management.

Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — surgical myectomy, septal reduction therapy (SRT), and mitral procedures — Earlier surgery in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should be limited to comprehensive centers with documented high success and low complication rates, specified as "durable success is > 90% with an expected mortality rate < 1%". Some patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe symptoms might choose SRT after shared decision-making; historically "a procedural mortality rate was 5% to 10%", and this high rate "has been observed in the recent era in HCM centers with less experience with the operation", whereas "in comprehensive HCM centers, procedural complication rates are very low", allowing septal reduction without waiting for "traditional NYHA functional class III and class IV". The guideline states "no definitive data have been published to suggest benefit for SRT in adult patients with HCM who are asymptomatic" or whose symptoms are easily minimized on optimal medical therapy. For concomitant mitral intervention, "the addition of mitral valve replacement with or without myectomy increases the hospital mortality rate (> 10-fold) and length of hospitalization" compared with isolated septal myectomy, and when valve intervention is needed "every effort should be made to repair the valve because early and long-term mortality is worse" with prosthetic replacement.

### Surgical management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 2007: what is new? [^116NhXjB]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has a variable clinical presentation and penetrance. Many patients will have a benign course, but others will become symptomatic and develop left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Echocardiograph remains the standard for diagnosis and assessment of obstruction, but gains are being made in the our understanding of the genetic basis of this condition. Pharmacologic therapy remains the first-line therapy in the majority of patients, but alcohol septal ablation and surgical septal myectomy may be considered in many patients. Patients should assess both the benefits and risks of each procedure based on the best available current evidence. This paper summarizes important recent developments in HCM diagnosis and therapy.

### Current effectiveness and risks of isolated septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^115co8De]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Septal myectomy is the gold-standard therapy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). However, it is being challenged by a less-invasive alternative: alcohol septal ablation. This study examined the clinical effectiveness and risks of isolated septal myectomy for HOCM.

Methods

From January 1994 to January 2005, 323 patients underwent isolated septal myectomy (mean age 50 ± 14 years, 53% male). Preoperative septal thickness was 2.3 ± 0.46 cm and peak left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient 68 ± 43 mm Hg. Effectiveness of myectomy was assessed by echocardiography, sudden death, and functional limitation, early risks by intraoperative and postoperative complications, and late risks by follow-up for HOMC-related reoperation, heart block, and all-cause mortality (mean 3.6 ± 2.8 years, 1,152 patient-years, 10% followed ≥ 8 years).

Results

Myectomy was effective, resulting in sustained decrease in septal thickness and LVOT gradient, absence of sudden death, and improved functional status. Early in-hospital morbidity was low, with no hospital deaths; two iatrogenic ventricular septal defects were repaired uneventfully, and 22 pacemakers were required for heart block. In the intermediate term, 10 patients required HOCM-related reoperations (4 redo myectomies, 6 mitral valve procedures), with 92% freedom from reoperation at eight years. Seventy-nine percent were free of pacemakers by 8 years, and survival was 90%, equivalent to that of the general population.

Conclusions

Isolated septal myectomy is effective in eliminating LVOT obstruction and sudden death and in improving functional status, with low operative morbidity and mortality. Few reoperations are required late and outcomes are excellent. It should be considered the treatment of choice for HOCM.

### Management of the mitral valve in thoracoscopic trans-mitral myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^113XKftG]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study reports a novel surgical approach for HOCM and early- and mid-term results corresponding to 3 concomitant MV management strategies. The primary finding of our study is that TTM is a safe and reliable procedure for reducing septal thickness and eliminating left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and that all 3 concomitant MV strategies are feasible for significantly improving MR.

The transmitral approach has unique strengths compared with the transaortic approach in the classical myectomy procedure. It combines the advantages of thoracoscopy to provide a larger and clearer surgical view and a more controlled operating space for the surgeon. Interventions for left midventricular obstruction, MV, and the subvalvular apparatus have become easier and more convenient. Such a minimally invasive approach also overcomes surgical contraindications, such as advanced age and high risk for HOCM. TTM successfully achieved surgical objectives by significantly decreasing the septal wall thickness and LVOTG while improving MR in this cohort (P < .001), demonstrating safety and efficacy similar to other studies on the transmitral approach for HOCM. With the detailed imaging evaluation of selected patients, TTM is worth promoting in centers with experience in thoracoscopic valve surgery; however, the transmitral approach has its own limitations. As in other studies of the transmitral approach, here the mitral leaflet was sacrificed at the beginning of the operation, leading to a time-consuming procedure for MV after myectomy. Except in cases of MV anomalies and a large extent of hypertrophic myocardium, patients should be selected carefully to balance the prolonged surgical time and the convenience of radical myectomy. The management strategy of MV is a more important issue, given that reinitiation of CPB further increases the operation time and the risk of adverse events.

### Is there a role for alcohol septal ablation in young patients with medically refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy? [^114bPE29]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgical myectomy is recommended for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) after optimal pharmacological therapy. Percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA) is reserved for high-risk adults. Symptomatic patients below 25 years underwent either surgery or PTSMA after heart-team discussion and informed consent. Echocardiography assessed gradients in surgical group. PTSMA group underwent invasive transseptal hemodynamic assessment, selective coronary angiography and super-selective cannulation of septal perforators using microcatheters. Contrast echocardiography through the microcatheter identified the myocardial target for PTSMA. Hemodynamic and electrocardiographic monitoring guided alcohol injection. Both groups were continued on beta-blockers. Symptoms, echocardiographic gradients and Brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) measurements were assessed on follow-up. Twelve patients aged 5–23 years (11–98 kg) formed the study group. Indications for PTSMA in 8 patients included abnormal mitral valve anatomy warranting replacement (n = 3), Jehovah's witness (n = 2), severe neurodevelopmental and growth retardation (n = 1) and refusal of surgery (n = 2). PTSMA targeted first perforator (n = 5), second perforator (n = 2) and anomalous septal artery from left main trunk (n = 1). Outflow gradient reduced from 92.5 ± 19.7 to 33.1 ± 13.5 mmHg. At a median follow-up of 38 months (range 3–120 weeks), the peak instantaneous echocardiographic gradient was 32 ± 16.5 mmHg. Gradient reduced in four surgical patients from 86.5 ± 16.3 mmHg to 42 ± 14.7 mm Hg. All patients were in NYHA class I/II on follow-up. The mean NTproBNP in PTSMA group reduced from 6084 ± 3628 pg/ml to 3081 ± 2019 pg/ml; it was 1396 and 1795 pg/ml in surgery. PTSMA may be considered in medically refractory high-risk young patients. It relieves symptoms and reduces gradient. Though surgery is preferred in young patients, PTSMA may have a role in selected patients.

### Two-year results of percutaneous endocardial septal radiofrequency ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^117MsgXR]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by unevenly increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness (> 15 mm) in the absence of hypertension or significant valvular disease. Approximately 70% of HCM patients experience left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) at rest or upon exercise provocation, leading to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Conventionally, HOCM is defined by an instantaneous Doppler‐measured left ventricular outflow tract gradient (LVOTG) of ≥ 30 mmHg, and invasive treatment is considered at a threshold of 50 mmHg or higher. HOCM patients with elevated LVOTG are at increased risk of developing progressive heart failure (HF) symptoms and HF‐related mortality. Although current guidelines advocate for the use of medication therapy — including β‐blockers and non‐dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as class I indications — these treatments often fail to manage symptoms in most patients adequately. For HOCM patients who present with symptoms despite receiving β‐blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, a myosin inhibitor, disopyramide, or septal reduction therapy [surgical myectomy (SM) or alcohol septal ablation (ASA)] is recommended to alleviate severe LVOTO. Nonetheless, SM involves significant risks, including an increased risk of atrioventricular block and extended patient recovery periods. Furthermore, the applicability of the ASA is limited by the septal coronary anatomy.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been widely used to treat cardiac arrhythmias for several decades. Percutaneous endocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (PESA) represents an innovative approach that uses high‐temperature energy to create necrotic areas in the ventricular septum for a reduction in systolic excursion of the myocardium and septum, and its clinical application for HOCM has increased in recent years. In this study, we present the outcomes following PESA for HOCM.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a comparison with medical therapy [^115zwW2M]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

This registry suggests that mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM treated with ASA have comparable survival to that of medically treated patients. Furthermore, ASA has advantages on the improvement of NYHA class and the reduction of LVOT gradient, with a lower occurrence of new‐onset AF. Therefore, ASA could be considered as an alternative therapy for mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM intolerant to medication.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction: expecting the unexpected [^111yxAmX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized clinical disease that carries perioperative risk. Patients may or may not carry a preoperative diagnosis, but provocable left ventricular outflow tract gradients place them at risk for hemodynamic compromise under surgical conditions. Early recognition of obstructive patterns and rapid management alterations in the face of instability are imperative for the treatment of these patients. This review focuses on the diagnostic criteria, risk factors, and management strategies for the perioperative hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patient. Finally, novel diagnostic modalities are discussed.

### Efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111THxPQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Septal reduction therapy is essential when optimal medication therapy cannot relieve patients' symptoms. Although the benefits of radiofrequency ablation have been widely accepted in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, it is still a novel technique in patients with HOCM. Lawrenz et al 21 first reported the use of radiofrequency ablation in a 45‐year‐old patient with severe HOCM. They also used a right‐sided approach in another studies that did not indicate any difference between the right‐sided and left‐sided approaches. 15 Several case reports of radiofrequency septal ablation have been documented since then, with a promising result in reducing the LVOT gradient. 22, 23, 24 Eight studies with 91 participants were included in the current meta‐analysis. Since all the included studies were assessed by scales and sensitivity analyses during the quality assessment process, we concluded that the results on the basis of current evidence were relatively convincing.

### Diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy… [^116Bj9uQ]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- HCM is evaluated and monitored with regular ECG, echocardiography, and prolonged cardiac monitoring.
- ECG results are abnormal in up to 95% of patients with HCM.
- Implantable cardiac defibrillators can reduce sudden cardiac death in patients with risk factors.
- Moderate intensity exercise is safe for patients with stable HCM. Evaluation of Suspected HCM Workup for HCM should be considered in children and adults with a family history of HCM, and patients with heart murmur or abnormal electrocardiography results. Initial workup includes a three-generation family history, dynamic cardiac examination, ECG, echocardiography, and prolonged cardiac monitoring. HCM can also present with symptoms associated with exertion, including chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, or syncope. HCM is often incidentally detected after finding a heart murmur or abnormal results on ECG.

Evaluation is aimed at detecting the abnormalities associated with HCM including dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, mitral regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and autonomic dysfunction. LVOTO is present in three-fourths of patients with HCM. Because LVOTO worsens with increased contractility, decreased preload, and decreased afterload, it is more likely to be detected with exertion or provocative maneuvers. In a dynamic cardiac examination, Valsalva or squat-to-stand maneuvers are used to increase LVOTO and the likelihood of detecting a murmur. ECG is essential because up to 95% of patients with HCM will have abnormalities on a 12-lead electrocardiogram. Prolonged cardiac monitoring is recommended because more than one-half of patients with HCM have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Management All patients with HCM should be managed in conjunction with a center specializing in HCM; such centers have better outcomes.

When patients are asymptomatic, management is limited to routine monitoring of symptoms and imaging. In children, repeat ECG, echocardiography, and continuous cardiac monitoring should be completed every one to two years. In adults, this monitoring is recommended every three to five years. All first-degree family members of patients with HCM require the same assessment. Those whose relatives were diagnosed in childhood are evaluated every one to three years and those diagnosed as adults every three to five years.

Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — medical management cautions and acute hypotension care: Acute hypotension is a medical urgency, and management should maximize preload and afterload while avoiding increases in contractility or heart rate; intravenous vasoconstrictors such as phenylephrine can reverse hypotension, and beta-blockade can be useful in combination. When congestion is present, cautious use of low-dose diuretics may provide symptom relief, whereas aggressive diuresis can augment left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). When treating coexisting conditions, some medications can cause or worsen LVOTO; in symptomatic obstructive HCM, positive inotropic agents, pure vasodilators, and high-dose diuretics can be considered relatively contraindicated. Although verapamil and diltiazem can relieve symptoms attributable to LVOTO, a vasodilatory effect can be particularly dangerous in patients with very high resting gradients (> 80–100 mm Hg) and signs of congestive HF, and life-threatening bradycardia and hypotension have been reported in newborns of < 6 weeks of age after intravenous verapamil; however, verapamil has been efficacious and well tolerated in older infants and children with HCM in controlled conditions.

If nonobstructive, the systolic function pathway includes an arm defined by LVEF < 50% with GDMT per Heart Failure Guideline (1), Evaluate for other causes of reduced EF (1), and Interrupt or discontinue myosin inhibitor (1); the figure footnote adds Cardiac myosin inhibitor should be discontinued if LVEF < 50% and can be restarted at a lower dose if the LVEF recovers. The alternate arm lists Discontinue negative inotropic agents (verapamil, diltiazem, disopyramide) (2a) and ICD, and cross-refers to the Section on symptomatic nonobstructive HCM. The pathway then calls for Reevaluation after GDMT.

### Invasive therapies for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112d8eTE]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic condition with multiple different genetic and clinical phenotypes. As awareness for HCM increases, it is important to also be familiar with potential treatment options for the disease. Treatment of HCM can be divided into two different categories, medical and interventional. Typically for obstructive forms of the disease, in which increased septal hypertrophy, abnormally placed papillary muscles, abnormalities in mitral valve or subvalvular apparatus, lead to dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, treatment is targeted at decreasing obstructive gradients and therefore symptoms. Medications like beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, disopyramide can often accomplish this. However, in patients with severe obstruction or symptoms refractory to medical therapy, either surgical correction of the LVOT obstruction or percutaneous via alcohol septal ablation, are treatment options. In this review, we will focus on the invasive treatment of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy septal reduction therapy — patient selection and procedural considerations: Generally, SRT performed by experienced operators in comprehensive centers is contemplated when patients continue to have severe symptoms despite optimal medical therapy or intolerant adverse effects, and SRT with either surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation is rarely indicated for the asymptomatic patient. Survival of patients with LVOTO is reduced compared with those without obstruction, and relief of obstruction may mitigate this incremental risk, yet currently insufficient evidence is available to recommend SRT to improve patient survival as the only indication; highly symptomatic patients should participate in discussion of success rates, benefits, and risks, and if either procedure is unavailable at their primary cardiology practice, referral to more comprehensive HCM centers is encouraged because the literature demonstrates a volume-outcome relationship. In symptomatic obstructive HCM with associated cardiac disease requiring surgical treatment, surgical myectomy by experienced operators provides the opportunity to correct structural and anatomic issues with a single procedure, and for paroxysmal AF, intraoperative pulmonary vein isolation or maze can be added; transaortic septal myectomy adds little to the risk of other cardiac procedures, and relief of LVOTO will minimize the risk of hemodynamic instability early postoperatively. In adult patients for whom surgery is contraindicated or the risk is unacceptably high due to serious comorbidities or advanced age, alcohol septal ablation when feasible and performed in experienced HCM centers becomes the preferred invasive strategy for relief of LVOTO.

### Contemporary clinical characteristics and management patterns in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: insights from baseline enrolment data in a nationwide prospective Japanese registry [^115rqSU7]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the management for LVOT obstruction, larger percentages of patients with HOCM were symptomatic and had prescriptions for medications such as beta blockers, cibenzoline and disopyramide than patients with other types of HCM. It is characterised by the fact that cibenzoline, a drug that is expected to have effects similar to those of disopyramide and milder anticholinergic side effects, was much more frequently used than disopyramide in Japan. Another characteristic of the treatment in our cohort was that PTSMA was performed more frequently than myectomy. On the other hand, the responses to treatments including medication with beta blockers or cibenzoline and septal reduction therapies with PTSMA or myectomy seemed to be consistent with the data from Western countries. Through the 5-year follow-up period until the end of 2024, it will be interesting to know the prognosis depending on whether the pressure gradient of the LV outflow tract remains or not. Under these circumstances, we have entered an exciting era in which we can use a new therapeutic drug mavacamten, a first-in-class myosin inhibitor, to target the hypercontractile phenotype of HCM. This drug has been used in Western countries, and it is expected to be available for HOCM treatment in Japan. When verifying the mid-term to long-term effects of mavacamten in the future, we believe that our prospective registry study will be important to examine the natural history of Japanese patients with HOCM with current treatment without the use of mavacamten.

Regarding medical management for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to management of obstructive symptoms, myosin inhibitors, ACC/AHA/AMSSM/HRS/PACES/SCMR 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate a myosin inhibitor (adult patients only) or disopyramide (in combination with an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent), or offer septal reduction therapy at experienced centers in patients with persistent symptoms attributable to LVOTO despite β-blockers or nondihydropyridine CCBs.

4 Discussion

This study describe the clinical and echocardiographic outcomes observed after PESA for HOCM, and the results of the study indicate that (1) the PESA could reduce the LVOTG at rest or following the Valsalva maneuver and improve cardiac function; (2) while medication can alleviate clinical symptoms such as chest tightness and dyspnea, its efficacy is limited in patients with severe obstruction; and (3) the PESA shows no acute ventricular arrhythmia or risk of heart block.

The 2024 AHA/ACC/AMSSM/HRS/PACES/SCMR guidelines for diagnosing and treating patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy β‐blockers and calcium channel blockers are standard class I indications. For patients with significant symptoms and severe obstruction who respond poorly to β‐blockers and calcium channel blockers, myosin inhibitors or disopyramide may be added to reduce LVOTG and improve symptoms. Mavacamten is a selective cardiac‐myosin inhibitor that produces clinically meaningful benefits in symptomatic HOCM; 37% of treated patients achieved a composite response, whereas 17% achieved a placebo, with mean Valsalva LVOT gradients falling by 36 mmHg. The subsequent VALOR‐HCM study showed that adding mavacamten to maximally tolerated therapy lowered the proportion of patients proceeding to septal reduction therapy by 82% and further improved the NYHA class, exercise capacity, and NT‐proBNP over 16–56 weeks.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114Q9XS3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common inherited cardiac diseases, characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, myofiber disarray, and fibrosis. 1, 2, 3 Clinical manifestations include exercise intolerance, heart failure (HF), and cardiac arrhythmias, including sudden death. 4 Approximately two thirds of patients with HCM demonstrate a dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient at rest or with provocation. This obstruction is thought to be the primary driver of symptoms. 5, 6 A resting LVOT gradient ≥ 30 mm Hg is a strong independent predictor for progression of HF and death. 7, 8 Conversely, nonobstructive HCM (rest/stress gradient < 30 mm Hg) is generally managed conservatively. These concepts were reiterated in recent guidelines and expert reviews, which summarized that a "majority of non‐obstructive HCM patients experience a relatively stable clinical course without significant symptoms, high‐risk profile, or the necessity of major treatment options (p. 94)". 4

Novel imaging methods have documented that, in addition to LVOT gradients, HCM is associated with myocardial fibrosis, 2 microvascular ischemia, 3, 9 and abnormal cardiac mechanics, 10 which may be important contributors to clinical adverse events. 2, 11 We recently demonstrated that more patients with nonobstructive HCM had a large scar burden (on magnetic resonance imaging) and higher rates of microvascular ischemia (by positron emission tomography). 12 Thus, there are lines of evidence suggesting that nonobstructive HCM may not be pathophysiologically benign. The wider question that has not yet been well addressed is whether the current hemodynamics‐based 3 HCM classification (nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive) confers any distinctive clinical risk.

In this study, we examined the long‐term outcomes in patients with HCM, stratified by rest/stress outflow tract hemodynamics, in a relatively large, well‐characterized, single‐center cohort.

### Management strategy in 249 consecutive patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy referred to a dedicated program [^1179o4Mu]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The likelihood of success of conservative management of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) and the predictors of failure of conservative therapy are not known. We therefore evaluated the efficacy of an algorithm for the management of symptoms and predictors of failed conservative therapy in 249 consecutive symptomatic patients with obstructive HC referred to a dedicated HC program for management in general or for septal reduction therapy (SRT) in particular. There was considerable practice variation in the extent to which conservative therapy was optimized before referral for SRT. Over 3.7 ± 2.9-year follow-up, symptoms resolved with addition of or increase in dosage of a β blocker, calcium channel blocker, or disopyramide in 16%, 10%, and 10% of patients, respectively. Pacing with short atrioventricular delay controlled symptoms in 4 of 9 patients. In 63% of patients, conservative measures failed to control symptoms. Multivariate predictors of failure of conservative therapy were presence of New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 2.9, p = 0.001) and greater septal wall thickness (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.10, p = 0.003) at presentation. At time of presentation, 93 patients (37%) were already on optimal therapy and were referred for SRT. Of the remaining 156 patients who did not require immediate SRT, 93 (60%) were free from a recommendation for SRT at the end of the follow-up period. In conclusion, in symptomatic patients with obstructive HC, conservative therapy is successful in > 1/3 of referred patients at 3.7-year follow-up, obviating SRT in these patients. Clinicians in programs offering SRT should optimize conservative therapy before recommending SRT.

### Short time effects of two radiofrequency ablation methods on hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^112EJx5C]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined as having left ventricular hypertrophy without any additional potential cardiac, systemic, syndromic, or metabolic disease that could be considered causal. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is a subtype of HCM that has an obstruction in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), which is present in around 70% of HCM patients.

The main objective in the treatment of HOCM is to decrease the amount of hypertrophy in the basal septum and to alleviate the systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve (MV) leaflet. Patients with drug‐refractory HOCM and have a resting or provoked LVOT gradient of 50 mmHg or higher, as well as being in functional class III or IV according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA), are primarily treated with septal reduction therapy (SRT). The traditional methods for SRT include surgical myectomy (SM) or alcohol septal ablation (ASA). SM effectively reduces LVOT obstruction and carries a low risk of mortality. However, it may not be accessible in all medical centers. ASA is an alternative option for patients who are not suitable candidates for SM, but the success of ASA heavily relies on the patient's specific coronary anatomy needed for the ablation procedure, and around 15% of patients do not have a suitable septal vessel. Additionally, nearly 17% of patients require a permanent pacemaker implantation following ASA.

The radiofrequency ablation method can also be used to implement SAT in HOCM patients, which includes two methods: endocardial radiofrequency septal ablation (ERSA) and percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (PIMSRA). ERSA built a three‐dimensional model of LVOT and SAM region under the guidance of Carto, the ablation creates a localized myocardial scar at the SAM‐septum contact point, which can disrupts the feedback mechanism and soon reduces the LVOT gradient. Liu et al.change the HOCM radiofrequency ablation road to ablate the inner layer of interventricular septum (IVS) myocardium through the apical approach, this modification aims to avoid damage to the conduction system and reduce the dependency on the coronary septal branches. The objective of this study is to compare the short‐term effectiveness of the two different radiofrequency ablation method on HOCM patients.

Mitral valvuloplasty in thoracoscopic transmitral myectomy.

Central Message

Thoracoscopic transmitral myectomy performed by the experienced hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and thoracoscopic valve surgery team can safely and effectively relieve left ventricular outflow tract gradient with mitral regurgitation improvement.

Perspective

Minimal invasive surgery for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy requires accurate preoperative assessment of the mitral valve, subvalvular apparatus, and extent of resection. Patients with intrinsic mitral valve disease will benefit from concomitant mitral valve management; otherwise, direct reattachment of the mitral leaflet is preferred after precise septal myectomy.

Extended septal myectomy is the preferred invasive treatment for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and is most commonly performed via a transaortic approach. However, this has a restricted field of view via midline sternotomy and is susceptible to such complications as valve injury and vascular events by aortotomy. Therefore, it is recommended that surgical myectomy be performed in experienced centers. Total thoracoscopic transmitral myectomy (TTM), a novel surgical approach that overcomes the disadvantages of the classical transaortic myectomy procedure, has been reported less frequently. Whether concomitant mitral valve (MV) interventions are necessary to address both systolic anterior motion (SAM) and mitral regurgitation (MR) remains controversial. One view, espoused by Hong and colleagues, is to avoid MV interventions, as sufficient myectomy is able to eliminate MR in most cases. Other centers also have reported good outcomes with concomitant MV interventions for HOCM. For TTM, the MV is detached from the annulus to expose the hypertrophic myocardium, and subsequent processing is required.

Which MV strategy is better remains unclear. In the present study, we compared the clinical outcomes of different MV management methods in TTM, with the aim of guiding surgeons' decision making for HOCM.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — pharmacologic management and escalation: In general, nonvasodilating beta blockers are considered first-line therapy, and the calcium channel blockers — verapamil or diltiazem — are reasonable alternatives to beta-blocker therapy. For patients who do not respond to trials of ≥ 1 of these drugs, advanced therapies with disopyramide, mavacamten, or septal reduction are often the next step. Medications should be titrated to a dose where symptom benefit is observed, but failure of beta-blockade should not be declared until demonstrated physiologic evidence of beta-blockade (ie, suppression of resting heart rate) is reported. The use of calcium channel blockers in combination with beta blockers, as therapy directed at HCM, is unsupported by evidence; however, these may have a role in management of concomitant hypertension. Patients with HCM who do not respond to first-line therapy are candidates for escalation of therapy, including cardiac myosin inhibitors (eg, mavacamten) (in adult patients only), disopyramide, and SRT. Mavacamten is a cardiac myosin inhibitor and has been shown to improve left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients, symptoms, and functional capacity in 30% to 60% of patients with obstructive HCM. In the United States, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is required due to the observed decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% in 5.7% of patients attributable solely to the drug, but as high as 7% to 10% of patients when other extenuating clinical conditions are considered that nevertheless may also result in temporary discontinuation. One key management step is to eliminate medications that may promote outflow tract obstruction, such as pure vasodilators and high-dose diuretics, while low-dose diuretics, when added to other first-line medications, are sometimes useful for persistent dyspnea or congestive symptoms. Because disopyramide can enhance conduction through the atrioventricular node, which could lead to rapid conduction with the onset of atrial fibrillation (AF), it should be used in combination with another medication that has atrioventricular nodal blocking properties.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 HCM is a common contemporary treatable genetic disorder that can be compatible with normal longevity

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart disease, with an estimated clinical prevalence that approaches 1:200 in the general population and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in patients of all ages. It is a heterogeneous disease with diverse disease‐causing mutations, clinical presentation, and outcomes. Patients with HCM are commonly asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic, which explains why the disease is often underdiagnosed. However, for many, HCM has the potential to cause progressive dyspnea, angina, heart failure (HF) with or without left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation (AF), and sudden cardiac death (SCD), the latter being the most feared complication.HCM was first defined over 60 years ago. With the advantage of contemporary treatments that are personalized to target disease complications, including implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators, annual disease‐related mortality has substantially dropped.

Today, in addition to SCD prevention, clinical management of HCM focuses mainly on symptom relief. Medications with negative inotropic properties (i.e. beta‐blockers [BB] and non‐dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [CCB]) are first‐line therapy in all HCM subtypes, while disopyramide is used as a second‐line agent in those with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). For patients with obstructive HCM (oHCM) and drug‐refractory symptoms, lowering outflow tract gradients through interventions for septal reduction can provide symptomatic relief.

### Contemporary clinical characteristics and management patterns in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: insights from baseline enrolment data in a nationwide prospective Japanese registry [^113F43gH]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics of patients with HOCM and situations regarding treatment

The clinical characteristics at registration of patients with HOCM in comparison with the clinical characteristics of other patients are shown in table 3. The percentage of men was lower in the HOCM group. Patients with HOCM were older and included a higher percentage of symptomatic patients (NYHA ≥ II and syncope) and a lower percentage of patients with AF or NSVT. Echocardiographic data showed that LV end-diastolic diameter was smaller and LV ejection fraction was higher in the HOCM group. Both sustained VT/VF and embolic events occurred less frequently in patients with HOCM than in other patients, although there was no difference in prior heart failure events.

Table 3
Baseline clinical characteristics of patients with HCM at registration according to subtypes (HOCM vs others)

For treatment at registration, beta blockers, cibenzoline and disopyramide were more frequently prescribed in patients with HOCM (table 3). On the other hand, amiodarone, diuretics, anticoagulants and a defibrillator were used less in the HOCM group. In 530 patients with HOCM, 386 (73%) had oral medications only. Regarding septal reduction therapies, 114 patients (22%) received PTSMA and 33 patients (6%) received myectomy (including three patients who received both PTSMA and myectomy). Table 4 shows the status of LVOT obstruction at registration after oral medication and septal reduction therapies. In the whole HOCM population, 59% of the patients still showed a significant pressure gradient. On the other hand, 21% of the patients who received PTSMA had LVOT obstruction after PTSMA, and only 12% of the patients who received myectomy showed residual obstruction.

Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — vasodilators and digoxin: For patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), discontinuation of vasodilators (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) or digoxin may be reasonable because these agents can worsen symptoms caused by dynamic outflow tract obstruction.

### How hypertrophic cardiomyopathy became a treatable genetic disease… [^1179Sm8D]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Nevertheless, for those patients with HCM who are at risk for disease-related complications, a constellation of comprehensive nonpharmacologic management strategies have evolved over the last 15 years, altering the natural history and disease course for many, including implantable defibrillators, heart transplant, external defibrillation/therapeutic hypothermia, advances in surgical myectomy, and alcohol ablation. In particular, expanded contemporary risk stratification strategies have led to a more reliable selection of patients likely to achieve primary prevention of sudden death with implantable defibrillators. Most recently, large cohort studies using current management strategies and therapeutic measures have shown that it is now possible to achieve significantly improved survival with a low HCM-related mortality of 0. 5% per year across all ages, and including children and young adults characteristically with the most aggressive disease course.

Over the last several years, the effectiveness of major innovative nonpharmacologic cardiovascular management strategies for HCM have been studied in selected high-risk subsets of patients. With drug therapy ineffective against sudden death, 29 the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was formally introduced to patients with HCM 15 years ago, the results of which were published as a retrospective multicenter study30 showing the power of device therapy in preventing sudden death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias and establishing the ICD era for HCM and other genetic heart diseases. The patients with HCM-related mortality averted by these treatment interventions outnumbered the patients with HCM-related deaths by a ratio of almost 2: 1, most striking in the age group of 29 years of age or younger.

Similarly, appropriate ICD interventions interrupting ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation and out-of-hospital defibrillation greatly exceeded sudden deaths by 3. 7:

1. However, unmet needs remain in the management of patients with HCM, including a more specific risk stratification algorithm with reduction in excess device implants, targeted pharmacologic therapy to control symptoms, improved strategies for reversing or controlling advanced heart failure unrelated to obstruction, and, for genetics, refining the classification of pathogenic sarcomere mutations and its relation to outcome. Nevertheless, the clinical initiatives and low mortality rates reported here represent what can now be achieved when contemporary management options and decision making are used in the care of patients with HCM.

Conclusions

Carefully selected, mildly symptomatic HOCM patients with severe LVOTO treated with ASA in dedicated centers have long‐term prognosis comparable to that of the age‐ and sex‐matched general population. These patients are at minimal risk for developing severe heart failure and most of them achieve long‐term functional class NYHA I and LVOT gradient ≤ 30 mm Hg.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a long-term follow-up study based on the euro-alcohol septal ablation registry [^1137Dzjx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

There remains a significant knowledge gap in the therapeutic strategy for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with severe LVOTO. Not surprisingly, the current therapeutic approach with septal reduction therapy (ASA or myectomy) is based on evidence obtained exclusively from highly symptomatic patients; a multicenter North American registry (n = 874; 55 ± 16 years; rest gradient, 70 ± 38 mm Hg; 78% in NYHA class III/IV) demonstrated a 5‐year survival rate of 86%, 21 and previously reported European experience (n = 1275; 58 ± 14 years; rest gradient, 67 ± 36 mm Hg; NYHA class 2.9 ± 0.5) showed a 5‐year survival rate of 89%. 4 A 5‐year survival rate reported in this study is 94%. This difference was expectable, given that NYHA class pre‐ASA was recently identified as an independent predictor of all‐cause mortality (HR, 1.5). 4

However, scarce data and experience from clinical practice suggest that severe LVOTO may be harmful irrespective of the severity of symptoms. 1, 2, 3, 5 This notion was supported by a study (n = 544; 59 ± 16 years) from the Mayo Clinic reporting on the long‐term outcome of patients with HOCM who were free of severe symptoms at baseline. 1 Patients with LVOT gradient > 64 mm Hg at baseline had a 10‐year survival of only 53%, and severe LVOTO was an independent predictor of adverse clinical outcome. Furthermore, death or severe symptoms occurred in 68% of these patients within 10 years after the first evaluation. 1 This finding is important, especially in the light of recent studies showing a ≤ 1% ASA‐related mortality, with an enduring effect on LVOTO and associated symptoms following the procedure. 4, 13, 22 Thus, on one hand, LVOTO is considered a risk factor of long‐term outcome in HOCM patients irrespective of their symptoms, and on the other hand, ASA performed in dedicated centers seems to be safe and effective in diminishing LVOTO. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22 The results of the present study should be weighed against this background, and although our study has limitations as discussed below, the results clearly challenge the established clinical standard of treating only highly symptomatic HOCM patients with ASA.

Nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — first-line pharmacologic therapy and pediatric considerations: For chest discomfort and dyspnea without obstructive CAD, beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are first-line agents; verapamil or diltiazem are effective at reducing chest pain and improving exercise capacity, and medication doses should be titrated with monitoring for bradycardia or atrioventricular conduction block, especially if these classes are combined. In pediatrics, beta blockers should be the primary medical therapy, and limited data suggest verapamil (in patients > 6 months of age) can be used safely as an alternative to beta blockers.

Surgical septal myectomy via a right infra-axillary incision.

Central Message

This innovative approach provides surgeons with a better surgical field for septal myectomy and results in a safe outcome.

Perspective

This study is currently the largest clinical report on minimally invasive treatment for HOCM and confirms the safety and effectiveness of minimally invasive approach. This innovative approach is beneficial for both surgeons and patients, as it provides surgeons with a better surgical field for septal myectomy and also results in a more aesthetically pleasing outcome and ensuring a swift recovery.

See Discussion on page 59.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 0.2% to 0.5% of the global population, with more than one half of these cases resulting in left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO), a condition known as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). For patients with symptomatic HOCM who do not respond to maximal drug therapy, septal reduction therapy is recommended to relieve LVOTO. The 2 predominant septal reduction therapy interventions are surgical septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation (ASA). Both procedures improve functional status and have comparable procedural mortality rates. However, ASA is associated with a greater incidence of residual obstruction and may necessitate more frequent reinterventions. Surgical septal myectomy, particularly the modified Morrow procedure, remains the gold standard for HOCM treatment as the result of its superior clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, ASA and newer interventions like percutaneous septal radiofrequency ablation and minimally invasive transapical beating-heart septal myectomy are increasingly popular because of their minimally invasive nature. As surgical techniques advance, the treatment paradigm for HOCM is shifting toward these minimally invasive procedures. Building on the traditional Morrow procedure, we have innovated a minimally invasive approach via the right infra-axillary, which has achieved promising clinical results.

### Echocardiography-guided interventions [^11142qua]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Medium credibility.

Alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) — TEE is the conventional approach for intraprocedural echocardiographic monitoring of transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy for HOCM, some laboratories prefer TEE because it provides more precise imaging of the subaortic anatomy of the left ventricle than TTE, and ICE is a third imaging alternative for use during this procedure. Perhaps the most important modification has been the use of myocardial contrast echocardiography to delineate the vascular distribution of the individual septal perforator branches of the left anterior descending artery, and the use of contrast echocardiography is paramount to the success of this procedure. To determine correct target vessel selection, intraprocedural myocardial contrast echocardiography should be performed, and after verification of correct balloon position and the hemodynamic effect of balloon occlusion, 1 to 2 mL of diluted echocardiographic contrast agent followed by a 1-mL to 2-mL saline flush is injected. A radiographic contrast agent may be used to demonstrate the perfusion territory supplied by the chosen septal perforator as an alternative to the use of an ultrasound contrast agent.

### Pathological effects of alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^116Xk91H]. Heart (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The pathological effects and the mechanisms of action of intracoronary administration of ethanol for alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for the management of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) are unknown.

Methods

We examined surgical specimens and, in one case, autopsy specimens from four patients who underwent surgical septal myectomy 2 days to 14 months after unsuccessful ASA.

Results

Pathological examination early after ASA showed coagulative necrosis of both the myocardium and the septal perforator arteries. Affected arteries were distended and occluded by necrotic intraluminal debris, without platelet-fibrin thrombi. Late after unsuccessful ASA, excised septal tissue was heterogeneous, containing a region of dense scar, and adjacent tissue containing viable myocytes and interspersed scar.

Conclusions

Intracoronary administration of ethanol in patients with HOCM causes acute myocardial infarction with vascular necrosis. The coagulative necrosis of the arteries, their distension by necrotic debris and the absence of platelet-fibrin thrombi distinguish ethanol-induced infarction from that caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The direct vascular toxicity of ethanol may be an important aspect of the mechanism of successful ASA.

### Future role of new negative inotropic agents in the era of established surgical myectomy for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115jpUVm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

For 60 years hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has periodically been encumbered by controversy and uncertainty about its management strategies, due largely to heterogeneous clinical presentation and relatively low prevalence in cardiovascular practice. Nevertheless, HCM has now achieved recognition as a contemporary and treatable disease, a stature unanticipated in earlier eras.

Indeed, initially, HCM was a disease for which management was based largely on pharmacotherapy (eg, beta‐blockers; verapamil), as well as infrequent high‐risk surgical procedures. However, predominantly non‐pharmacologic innovations over the last 20 to 25 years have dramatically adjusted patient expectations for longevity and good quality of life, including reversibility of heart failure with surgical myectomy (and its selective alternative alcohol septal ablation).

In the present commentary we discuss the effective treatment modalities currently available for HCM‐related heart failure due to left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction, anticipating the emergence of new medications for symptomatic patients, and the role such therapies may have with respect particularly to time‐honored surgical myectomy.

Sleep-disordered breathing in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — sleep-disordered breathing is highly prevalent and affects 55% to 70% of patients; obstructive sleep apnea is linked to older age, more hypertension, greater symptom burden, reduced exercise capacity, and a greater prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and diagnosis and treatment could reduce symptoms and arrhythmic complications but has not been systematically tested.

### Surgical myectomy versus alcohol septal ablation for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. will there ever be a randomized trial? [^111xVGeh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is an important pathophysiologic feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and a predictor of clinical deterioration and cardiovascular mortality. Patients with marked obstruction and severe limiting symptoms refractory to maximum medical management are considered candidates for invasive septal reduction therapy, which includes surgical myectomy and alcohol septal ablation (ASA). Availability of both surgical myectomy and ASA has polarized the cardiovascular community concerning the most appropriate implementation of these two interventions. The ensuing controversy of whether myectomy and ASA are truly equivalent options has resulted in calls for a prospective randomized trial. However, upon analysis, such a myectomy versus ASA trial, adequately powered to compare the key issue of long-term outcome, poses a myriad of practical problems that seem virtually insurmountable. Therefore, it is appropriate to revisit this evolving debate at this time, identify the unique obstacles to a randomized study design, and achieve some clarity concerning the most realistic clinical strategies for symptomatic patients with HCM and outflow obstruction.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Systematic review and study characteristics

The database search identified 2501 records. After removing duplicates, 1624 studies remained. Eight studies 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 published between 2005 and 2019 (including a conference abstract) were included in this analysis according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 1). Ninety‐one patients underwent radiofrequency septal ablation for HOCM with a mean follow‐up of 11.6 months (range, 1.3‐48 months). Patients' mean age was 44.2 years, and this result includes two studies that treated children (Table 1). All studies measured the LVOT gradient at rest (mean 77.8 mmHg). Each patient enrolled in these studies was diagnosed as having typical HOCM with an LVOT gradient ≥ 50 mmHg at rest or after provocation (Table 2). Four studies measured the provoked LVOT gradient before and after the procedure. Five studies reported septal thickness measured by echocardiography before the procedure, and four of them reported septal thickness post‐procedure. The NYHA class was reported in six studies that assessed the resolution of symptoms after radiofrequency septal ablation. All studies except one used a left‐sided approach (Table 3). Unlike other studies, Liu et al 20 conducted percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation in which the radiofrequency needle was inserted through the left ventricular apex.

### How symptomatic should a hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy patient Be to consider alcohol septal ablation? [^117XwNk9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1
Methods for Evaluating Intermediately Symptomatic Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Obstruction

Thus, in considering treatments for patients with HCM, we advocate for a comprehensive approach to symptom evaluation using both subjective and objective tools (Figure). Patients with seemingly intermediate symptoms should be evaluated by additional methods including cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 6‐Minute Walk Testing, measurement of natriuretic peptide, and/or completion of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. When these tests reveal limitations that are out of proportion to patient's self‐reported symptoms, consideration could be made to more aggressive medical management and possibly referral for septal reduction techniques. Careful tailoring of the procedural approach for such patients requires extensive expertise with these techniques, and a heart team approach involving the input of cardiac surgeons, interventional cardiologists, cardiac anesthesiologists, and cardiovascular imaging specialists is paramount to appropriate patient selection. Furthermore, the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association valve guidelines advocate for establishment of Heart Valve Centers of Excellence for treating complex patients, a recommendation that would certainly be relevant to the management of complex patients with HCM. 14 In addition to demonstrating adequate procedural volume, low procedural complication rates, and high rates of procedural success, centers of excellence would have a mandate for active participation in data registry reporting and quality improvement processes, which are increasingly important as procedures become applied to lower‐risk populations. Just as utilization of a more comprehensive approach to preablative monitoring and determining candidacy for septal reduction therapies is warranted, it is important to follow patients after ASA or myectomy with similarly objective measures, including the use of standardized provocation techniques for measuring LVOT gradients, rather than relying on NYHA Class alone to demonstrate success.

### The triglyceride-glucose index as a potential protective factor for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy without diabetes: evidence from a two-center study [^115dhKka]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of HOCM

The diagnosis of HOCM was based on: 1, wall thickness ≥ 15 mm in one or more LV myocardial segments, as measured by any imaging technique (echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography); 2, wall thickness (13–14 mm) with family history, non-cardiac symptoms and signs, electrocardiogram(ECG) abnormalities, laboratory tests, and muti-modality cardiac imaging; 3, patients with LV outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) were based on: dynamic LVOT obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, with an LVOT gradient ≥ 30 mmHg at rest or during physiological provocation such as Valsalva maneuver, standing, and exercise. Significant dynamic LVOT obstruction was documented by 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography or, in those cases where echocardiography was insufficient, by invasive hemodynamic catheterization with provocation.

Criteria for receiving invasive treatment

Invasive treatment to reduce LVOTO should be considered in patients with an LVOTO gradient ≥ 50 mmHg at rest or with provocation, moderate-to-severe symptoms (NYHA III-IV), and/or recurrent exertional syncope despite maximally tolerated drug therapy. The choice of alcohol septal ablation or surgical myectomy was made through a shared decision-making process after a discussion of the risks of benefits of each alternative.

Surgical myectomy is considered as the gold standard therapy for HOCM. Excision of protruding septal muscle results in enlargement of the left ventricular outflow tract with a decrease in the severity or complete elimination of the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Transcatheter alcohol septal ablation is another preferred alternative treatment. Alcohol is injected directly into a septal branch of the anterior descending artery supplying the basal part of the septum through an interventional catheter to induce local myocardial necrosis, lead to scar formation and reduce left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

### Changing demographics in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and implications for management: clinical research [^112QzSCd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to determine whether clinicians are encountering a phenotype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that is evolving from the disease recognized several years ago.

Methods

A total of 3161 consecutive patients with established hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were encountered (2003–2020) and studied clinically with imaging.

Results

Patients were identified as progressively older now (average 56 ± 15 years) compared with previously (44 ± 17 years; P < .001), and with an increasing frequency of outflow obstruction (from 46% to 61% of patients; P < .001), albeit without more advanced heart failure symptoms. Notably, maximum left ventricular wall thickness (usually ventricular septum) decreased progressively over the same period (20.4 ± 5.7 to 17.5 ± 3.4 mm).

Conclusions

These novel observations are counter-intuitive to practitioners (expecting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to be associated with particularly substantial hypertrophy), and potentially impact disease recognition, while also highlighting emergence of symptomatic obstructive patients with mild septal thickness < 15 mm, requiring modification of the traditional myectomy operation. While a primary change in the phenotypic expression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cannot be excluded by our data, these observations most likely reflect evolving referral practice patterns including greater diagnostic suspicion for the disease in the community particularly at advanced ages, and/or with less substantial left ventricular hypertrophy.

Regarding medical management for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to management of obstructive symptoms, disopyramide, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating disopyramide, titrated to maximum tolerated dose, as monotherapy to improve symptoms in patients with resting or provoked LVOTO intolerant or having contraindications to β-blockers and verapamil/diltiazem.
