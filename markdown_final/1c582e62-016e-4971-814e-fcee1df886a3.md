## Question

Increased urination with sglt2 inhibitor

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why SGLT2 inhibitors increase urination, how significant and persistent that effect is, and what this means for patient counseling and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the renal physiology of SGLT2 and the mechanism of action. Then, I should quantify the magnitude and time course of the diuretic effect. Next, I will examine compensatory mechanisms that limit long-term fluid loss. After that, I need to consider patient-specific modifiers and clinical implications, including volume depletion, blood pressure effects, and urinary symptoms. Finally, I will synthesize practical counseling points and monitoring recommendations, making sure I verify each claim against the best available evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. SGLT2 is the high-capacity transporter in the early proximal tubule responsible for reabsorbing the majority of filtered glucose. When SGLT2 is inhibited, that glucose remains in the tubular lumen, creating an osmotic gradient that obligates water retention in the lumen and increases urine volume, i.e., osmotic diuresis, with a smaller natriuretic component as sodium is co-transported with glucose and then not reclaimed as efficiently in the early proximal segments [^1139Z5Zy] [^113noHHh] [^1162K5BB].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of the diuretic effect. Multiple sources converge on a modest increase in urine volume of roughly 200–400 mL/day with chronic therapy, reflecting the osmotic drag from sustained glucosuria. Clinically, this translates to more frequent voids rather than frank polyuria, and importantly, the diuretic effect is transient at initiation, with an early increase that attenuates over days to weeks as adaptive mechanisms engage [^1153y7pr] [^1151yXrN].

> I should double-check the time course. In Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin increased 24-hour urine volume by about 0.8–1.1 L on day 1 versus placebo, but by day 27–28 urine volume had returned to near-baseline despite continued glucosuria, indicating rapid renal adaptation. Similar transient early diuresis has been observed with other SGLT2 inhibitors, with equilibrium typically reached within 1–4 weeks of initiation [^1151yXrN] [^114orVxL] [^115VYxmv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sustained fluid loss. The kidney activates compensatory mechanisms that blunt ongoing diuresis, including tubuloglomerular feedback adjustments, neurohormonal responses, and increased fluid intake, so long-term overall fluid balance is generally preserved. Mechanistic reviews also note that while SGLT2 inhibitors cause early osmotic diuresis, the natriuretic component is modest and transient, further limiting sustained volume depletion [^1139Z5Zy] [^112bnU1u] [^115MBKSQ].

> I need to check patient-specific modifiers that amplify risk. Older adults, those on loop diuretics, patients with autonomic dysfunction or labile blood pressure, and individuals with reduced eGFR may be more susceptible to volume-related symptoms. Guidelines for older adults recommend using lower canagliflozin doses due to higher rates of volume depletion events, and reviews advise considering diuretic dose reduction when starting SGLT2 inhibitors in patients at risk of hypotension or dehydration [^115kAGDZ] [^115MBKSQ].

> Let me consider the clinical implications beyond "more bathroom trips". The early osmotic diuresis contributes to modest reductions in systolic blood pressure and plasma volume, which can be beneficial in heart failure but may precipitate orthostatic symptoms in vulnerable patients; in heart failure populations on loop diuretics, empagliflozin increased urine volume without a commensurate natriuretic surge, suggesting preferential removal of interstitial fluid and potential synergy with loop agents, though careful monitoring is warranted [^115hxLPR] [^113bsaKm] [^116LgPYj].

> But wait, what about urinary symptoms like frequency and urgency — are they just from volume? I should confirm whether glucosuria itself irritates the urothelium. Urology guidance notes that glucosuria can irritate the bladder lining and contribute to lower urinary tract symptoms, and experimental work suggests glucosuria may increase urothelial ATP/NO signaling and afferent stimulation, so counseling should address both hydration and symptom expectations rather than attributing everything to diuresis alone [^111a7aKE] [^116PkHJJ].

> Next, I should review safety signals tied to the mechanism. Increased genital mycotic infections are consistently observed due to glycosuria, whereas the signal for urinary tract infections is mixed. Large meta-analyses and real-world cohorts generally do not show a significant increase in severe UTI with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with other agents, though vigilance is prudent, particularly in patients with prior UTIs or complicated courses [^112mrANw] [^112pXreh] [^111Vr34m].

> I will now examine practical counseling and monitoring. Patients should be advised to expect increased urination during the first days to weeks, maintain adequate fluid intake, and monitor for dizziness, weakness, or postural symptoms. In older adults or those on diuretics, consider starting at the lower end of dosing ranges and reassessing concomitant diuretic therapy, with blood pressure and renal function checked within 1–2 weeks of initiation and periodically thereafter, aligning with guideline-based precautions [^111QH2BG] [^115kAGDZ] [^115MBKSQ].

> Let me reconsider the core message to ensure internal consistency. SGLT2 inhibitors cause a predictable, modest osmotic diuresis from glucosuria that is most pronounced early and attenuates with time. Clinically, this manifests as increased urinary frequency rather than dangerous volume depletion in most patients, but risk is higher in the elderly, those on loop diuretics, or with autonomic dysfunction, warranting anticipatory guidance and selective dose or co-therapy adjustments to maintain safety and adherence [^112X98Tg] [^1151yXrN] [^1139Z5Zy].

Increased urination with SGLT2 inhibitors is driven by **osmotic diuresis** from urinary glucose excretion [^112nwTaR], causing a transient rise in urine volume of about 200–400 mL/day [^112X98Tg] that typically abates within 1–2 weeks as the kidney adapts [^115VYxmv]. Persistent polyuria is uncommon and usually reflects inadequate hydration, high ambient glucose, or concomitant diuretics. Clinically, counsel patients to maintain hydration [^112nwTaR], monitor for volume depletion [^115MBKSQ], and adjust diuretics as needed; **no dose reduction is routinely required** unless symptoms are severe or renal function declines.

---

## Mechanism of increased urination

SGLT2 inhibitors block proximal tubular glucose reabsorption, increasing **urinary glucose excretion** [^113noHHh] and creating an osmotic diuresis that increases urine volume [^112X98Tg]. This effect is **transient** [^1151yXrN] and typically diminishes within 1–2 weeks as renal adaptation occurs [^115VYxmv].

---

## Magnitude and duration of increased urination

- **Initial increase**: Urine volume rises by ~200–400 mL/day at initiation [^112X98Tg].
- **Adaptation**: Volume returns to near baseline within 1–2 weeks despite ongoing glucosuria [^114orVxL].
- **Persistent polyuria**: Uncommon; consider inadequate hydration, high ambient glucose, or concomitant diuretics.

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

### Patient counseling

Counsel patients to **maintain adequate hydration** to prevent volume depletion and urinary symptoms [^115VYxmv]. Explain that increased urination is expected and usually transient, resolving within 1–2 weeks [^114orVxL].

---

### Monitoring and dose adjustments

- **Monitor**: Watch for volume depletion, hypotension, or renal function changes, especially in older adults or those on diuretics [^115MBKSQ].
- **Adjust diuretics**: Consider reducing concomitant diuretic doses if volume depletion occurs [^115hxLPR].
- **Dose reduction**: Not routinely required; consider only if persistent symptoms or renal impairment develop [^notfound].

## Long-term renal and cardiovascular effects

Renal effects include **reduced intraglomerular pressure**, albuminuria, and slowed CKD progression [^113usZQR]. Cardiovascular effects include **lower blood pressure**, reduced heart failure hospitalizations, and improved cardiovascular outcomes [^116a85c9].

---

Increased urination with SGLT2 inhibitors is a **transient osmotic diuresis** from glucosuria [^113noHHh] that typically resolves within 1–2 weeks [^115VYxmv]. Persistent polyuria is uncommon and usually reflects inadequate hydration, high ambient glucose, or concomitant diuretics. Management centers on hydration, monitoring volume status, and adjusting diuretics; **routine dose reduction is not required** unless symptoms persist or renal function declines.

Glycemic Mechanism of Action of SGLT2 Inhibitors

Empagliflozin is a member of a class of drugs known as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. As their name suggests, these drugs inhibit the action of the SGLT2 protein, a glucose transporter found mainly in the proximal tubule of the kidney. SGLT2 is the transporter predominately responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation.

All available SGLT2 inhibitors are competitive selective inhibitors of SGLT2, although there is some variation among agents in selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1, which is the other main glucose transporter in the kidney. By inhibiting SGLT2, these drugs reduce the reabsorption of filtered glucose in the kidney, thus increasing urinary glucose excretion. The kidneys filter around 180 g of glucose every day, and without inhibition, all this glucose is reabsorbed; the majority of glucose is reabsorbed by SGLT2 and a minority by SGLT1. When SGLT2 inhibitors are used, around a third of this glucose — approximately 60 g/day — will be lost in the urine (it is thought that SGLT1 compensates to some extent for the inhibited SGLT2; hence the majority of glucose is not lost). The actual amount of glucose excreted will also depend on factors such as the binding affinity of the specific SGLT2 inhibitor and the dose used; for example, with empagliflozin, urinary glucose excretion is about 64 g/day with empagliflozin 10 mg and 78 g/day with empagliflozin 25 mg.

Nephrology

Nephrology is another area of immense clinical value for SGLT2 inhibitors. These drugs may be of benefit by delaying the decline of renal function, reducing risk of end-stage kidney disease and renal deaths.

The presently known CVOTs of SGLT2 inhibitors have consistently shown renal benefits in patients with T2DM. There are multiple possible mechanisms through which SGLT2 inhibitors may improve renal dysfunction; some of these have been proven in clinical proof-of-concept studies.

Evidence from Pharmacodynamic and Mechanistic Studies

Kidneys are involved in glucose metabolism through renal gluconeogenesis as well as glucose reabsorption. While gluconeogenesis is the major mechanism, it does not contribute significantly to blood glucose levels because the kidneys also require considerable glucose consumption to maintain their function. On the other hand, glucose reabsorption can significantly contribute to glycaemia levels, particularly during states of increased glucose reabsorption like diabetes. Increased proximal tubular glucose flux, which typically happens in diabetes, increases SGLT2 transporter expression and function in renal tubules. Elevated SGLT2 transporter function is also known to increase sodium reabsorption, resulting in tubulo-glomerular feedback and hyperfiltration. The relevance of SGLT2 inhibitors in ameliorating this tubulo-glomerular feedback has received much clinical interest. Apart from this, several mechanisms like improved renal metabolism, reduced uric acid level, downregulation of sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE-3), and neurohumoral modulation are being explored.

Evidence from Clinical Trials

CREDENCE, a dedicated renal outcome trial in patients with advanced proteinuric diabetic kidney disease, demonstrated significant improvements in renal outcomes with canagliflozin. The value of SGLT2 inhibitors in non-diabetic kidney disease is a futuristic topic of interest. Ongoing EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD studies will evaluate the effect of these agents in patients with non-diabetic kidney disease. Table 3 shows an overview of these trials.

SGLT2 inhibitors also increase haematocrit, likely through an increase in erythropoiesis. A probable explanation for this effect is based on reduced metabolic stress in proximal tubular epithelial cells, secondary to reduced activity of sodium–potassium ATPase pump. This optimum milieu stimulates erythropoiesis from mesenchymal fibroblasts by partly reversing the early derangements of CKD. A corollary benefit of this mechanism could be plausible in anaemia of CKD, with reduction in dose of erythropoietin-stimulating agents. The present evidence for this benefit is scarce and requires substantiation.

### Risk of urogenital bacterial infection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors: a retrospective cohort study using a claims database [^115JhBos]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several potential reasons for the observed decrease in UTI incidence among patients with diabetes treated with SGLT2 inhibitors in this study. Clinicians may have expanded their advice to patients using SGLT2 inhibitors, advocating increased hydration to mitigate UTI risks. Given the widespread concern among clinicians regarding the increased UTI risk among users of SGLT2 inhibitors, there may have been a tendency to refrain from prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors to patients at an elevated risk of UTIs. Although we made substantial efforts to address this issue by extensively adjusting for UTI risk factors, the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors cannot be entirely ruled out. Moreover, while SGLT2 inhibitors may possess a greater glucose-lowering effect compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, the disease severity remains unknown due to the absence of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values in this database. Additionally, the database included a limited number of older individuals, who are typically at a higher risk for UTIs. Subgroup analyses of UTI focusing on older individuals showed similar results across different sex and age groups, indicating the potential relevance of the findings for high-risk populations. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first to identify an association between SGLT2 inhibitors and genital bacterial infections, although it is well-documented that genital mycotic infection is a common adverse effect of SGLT2 inhibitor use. High glucose concentrations in urine are known to accelerate the growth rate of Escherichia coli. SGLT2 inhibitors facilitate both sodium and glucose excretion in the proximal tubules, potentially reducing skin hypertonicity by lowering tissue sodium content. These mechanisms could potentially compromise the skin barrier, heightening susceptibility to soft tissue infection. However, a pooled post hoc analysis from two randomized trials showed that canagliflozin did not increase the risk of non-genital soft tissue infections compared to placebo (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85–1.11). Additionally, several retrospective cohort studies using a claims database showed no significant association between SGLT2 inhibitor use and FG. Consistent with these findings, our results did not indicate an association between SGLT2 inhibitor use and the risk of perineal soft tissue infections.

### Strategies for diabetes management: using newer oral combination therapies early in the disease [^115vtpaF]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

SGLT2 Inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors exert their effects via the kidney and their mechanism of action involves inhibiting the SGLT2 protein in the proximal nephron, thereby reducing the inappropriately increased glucose reabsorption found in T2DM and increasing urinary glucose excretion. SGLT2 inhibitors have proven to be effective not only in improving glycemic management but also in decreasing weight and reducing systolic blood pressure (BP), with a low risk of hypoglycemia, except when used with insulin or SUs. They provide significant reductions in HbA1c versus placebo and are similarly efficacious when compared with most standard oral agents in head-to-head trials. Because this action is independent of insulin, SGLT2 inhibitors may be used at any stage of T2DM, even after insulin secretion has waned significantly.

The SGLT2 inhibitors lead to increased risk of genital mycotic infections, particularly in women. Urinary tract infections have also been reported to be more common in some patient groups, such as older patients, but the increase is less clear-cut than for genital infections. Use of SGLT2 inhibitors also has the potential to cause hypotension and other hypovolemic events because of osmotic diuresis, particularly in older patients taking loop diuretics. In addition, trials have shown small increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and, although these can be managed with appropriate treatment, the long-term consequences are unclear. Long-term trials to establish CV safety are still ongoing for canagliflozin and dapagliflozin. Results from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME ® trial showed a significant CV risk reduction, decreased CV and overall mortality, slower progression of kidney disease, and lower rates of clinically relevant renal events in patients with T2DM and CV risk factors who were treated with empagliflozin versus placebo in addition to standard of care (see " CV Risk " section).

Post-marketing reports of ketoacidosis have emerged after the approval of SGLT2 inhibitors, with a number of cases reporting minimal elevation of blood sugar (i.e. euglycemic ketoacidosis). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has subsequently issued a warning alerting health care practitioners and patients to the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis.

### State-of-the-art-review: mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical implications [^1139Z5Zy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inhibitors of the Na+-coupled glucose transporter SGLT2 (SGLT2i) primarily shift the reabsorption of large amounts of glucose from the kidney's early proximal tubule to downstream tubular segments expressing SGLT1, and the non-reabsorbed glucose is spilled into the urine together with some osmotic diuresis. How can this protect the kidneys and heart from failing as observed in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes?

Goal

Mediation analyses identified clinical phenotypes of SGLT2i associated with improved kidney and heart outcome, including a reduction of plasma volume or increase in hematocrit, and lowering of serum urate levels and albuminuria. This review outlines how primary effects of SGLT2i on the early proximal tubule can explain these phenotypes.

Results

The physiology of tubule-glomerular communication provides the basis for acute lowering of GFR and glomerular capillary pressure, which contributes to lowering of albuminuria but also to long term preservation of GFR, at least in part by reducing kidney cortex oxygen demand. Functional co-regulation of SGLT2 with other sodium and metabolite transporters in the early proximal tubule explains why SGLT2i initially excrete more sodium than expected and are uricosuric, thereby reducing plasma volume and serum urate. Inhibition of SGLT2 reduces early proximal tubule gluco-toxicity and by shifting transport downstream may simulate "systemic hypoxia", and the resulting increase in erythropoiesis, together with the osmotic diuresis, enhances hematocrit and improves blood oxygen delivery. Cardio-renal protection by SGLT2i is also provided by a fasting-like and insulin-sparing metabolic phenotype and, potentially, by off-target effects on the heart and microbiotic formation of uremic toxins.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^111QH2BG]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) — dosing and considerations include Bexagliflozin 20mg daily (20mg daily), Canagliflozin 100mg daily (100mg-300mg daily), Dapagliflozin 5mg daily (5mg-10mg daily), Empagliflozin 10mg daily (10mg-25mg daily), and Ertugliflozin 5mg daily (5mg-15mg daily). Use may initiate if eGFR > 20 and continue until KRT is initiated; SGLT2i may cause ketoacidosis, genital mycotic infections, volume depletion, increased sCr, increased urination, and increased thirst, and monitoring is advised for fluid status, signs/symptoms of ketoacidosis, signs/symptoms of urinary tract infection, blood glucose kidney function, and blood pressure.

### Development and potential role of type-2 sodium-glucose transporter inhibitors for management of type 2 diabetes [^117Wdb3K]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

There is a recognized need for new treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recovery of glucose from the glomerular filtrate represents an important mechanism in maintaining glucose homeostasis and represents a novel target for the management of T2DM. Recovery of glucose from the glomerular filtrate is executed principally by the type 2 sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT2). Inhibition of SGLT2 promotes glucose excretion and normalizes glycemia in animal models. First reports of specifically designed SGLT2 inhibitors began to appear in the second half of the 1990s. Several candidate SGLT2 inhibitors are currently under development, with four in the later stages of clinical testing. The safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors is expected to be good, as their target is a highly specific membrane transporter expressed almost exclusively within the renal tubules. One safety concern is that of glycosuria, which could predispose patients to increased urinary tract infections. So far the reported safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical studies appears to confirm that the class is well tolerated. Where SGLT2 inhibitors will fit in the current cascade of treatments for T2DM has yet to be established. The expected favorable safety profile and insulin-independent mechanism of action appear to support their use in combination with other antidiabetic drugs. Promotion of glucose excretion introduces the opportunity to clear calories (80–90 g [300–400 calories] of glucose per day) in patients that are generally overweight, and is expected to work synergistically with weight reduction programs. Experience will most likely lead to better understanding of which patients are likely to respond best to SGLT2 inhibitors, and under what circumstances.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and external genital infection in male patients with type 2 diabetes [^112mrANw]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based cohort study, we found that SGLT2Is were associated with a higher risk of MEGI, compared with GLP-1RAs, among male patients with T2D. The HR for MEGI formation was 1.65 (95% CI, 1.59–1.71). The cumulative incidence of MEGI increased over a 3-year follow-up period with prolonged medication use. Moreover, regardless of age, kidney function, and diabetes control, the risk of MEGI was consistently higher in the SGLT2I group than in the GLP-1RA group. Additionally, the comparable levels of glycemic control and changes in kidney function observed in both the SGLT2I and GLP-1RA groups suggest that the mechanisms contributing to the increased incidence of MEGI with SGLT2I use are independent of these factors. The results from sensitivity analyses remained consistent across various statistical approaches, follow-up periods, and databases. On the basis of these findings, we concluded that SGLT2Is may carry a higher risk of MEGI than GLP-1RAs in patients with T2D. The estimated number needed to harm was 150, which provides a clinically interpretable measure of risk and may aid in shared decision-making. Clinicians should counsel patients with T2D about the potentially increased risks of MEGI associated with the use of SGLT2Is.

SGLT2Is manage glycemic control by inhibiting glucose reabsorption, thereby increasing glucose excretion to urine via the kidneys. Glucosuria has been proposed as a key mechanism underlying the increasing risk of UTIs. Furthermore, in 2015, the FDA announced that SGLT2Is might elevate the risk of serious UTIs. However, the association between SGLT2Is and UTIs remains controversial. Some studies, have demonstrated an association between the use of SGLT2Is and an increased risk of UTIs. Conversely, many studies, have found no significant difference in UTI prevalence when comparing SGLT2Is with placebos or other antiglycemic medications. Therefore, it remains a matter for debate whether patients with T2D who are at risk of complicated UTIs should discontinue SGLT2Is.

### Urological impact of flozins (SGLT2 inhibitors): an EAU endourology review of risks, side effects and clinical considerations [^117CZ78v]. Current Opinion in Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), also known as flozins, are one of the modern oral antidiabetic drugs. Currently, there are sufficient number of studies devoted to the effect of flozins on various genitourinary disorders, confirming their multifaceted positive and side effects. Thus, the purpose of this review is to analyze the current literature for an up-to-date definition of the role of these drugs in urological practice, prospects for their further study, and side effects that urologists need to remember when treating patients with T2DM taking flozins.

Recent Findings

Flozins (SGLT2i) are not linked to urological cancer risk, and might even lower the risk by disrupting tumor metabolism and cell cycle. Despite causing glucosuria, the resulting effect of Flozins is antilithogenic, which may be promising for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and kidney stone disease, especially regarding risk of recurrence. While the overall risk of UTI is not increased, flozins significantly increase the risk of genital mycotic infections. Flozins can worsen LUTS due to their diuretic action.

Summary

Current results of studies on the use of flozins in patients with T2DM are promising for different spectrums of genitourinary diseases caused by different pathogenetic mechanisms. However, we need future clinical trials with specific drugs and comparisons to get trustworthy results about how helpful flozins are for these patients and whether they can be used in urology.

### Association between sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes after urinary tract infection [^116LBpaJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In this real‐world cohort study of patients with T2DM recovering from UTI, the use of SGLT2i within 3 months was associated with significantly lower risks of mortality, kidney complications, and hospitalisation compared with DPP‐4i. Despite historical concerns regarding infection risk, SGLT2i use did not increase adverse infectious outcomes. These findings support early post‐UTI initiation of SGLT2i as a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with T2DM.

### Mechanisms of action of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin on tubular inflammation and damage: a post hoc mediation analysis of the CANVAS trial [^111RvPnj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Patients and study design

This study was a post hoc analysis of the CANVAS trial, which was a prospective, multicentre, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized trial to assess the efficacy primarily on cardiovascular outcomes and secondarily on kidney outcomes as well as the safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin. The trial was conducted in participants with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease or who had a history of cardiovascular disease. The study design and main results of the CANVAS trial have been published previously. In brief, a total of 4330 participants were enrolled and were randomly assigned using a web‐based response system in a 1:1:1 ratio to canagliflozin 300 mg, canagliflozin 100 mg or matching placebo. The median follow‐up duration during the trial was 6.1 years. During the study, all participants, care providers, trial staff and outcome assessors were blinded to treatment randomization. The trial was approved by an ethics committee at each site and was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial is registered with(NCT01032629). All participants were given the opportunity to also provide informed consent for the collection of blood and urine samples for future exploratory biomarker research. This was optional and separate from the informed consent provided for the main trial.

Participants eligible for randomization were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of ≥ 53 mmol/mol and ≤ 91 mmol/mol, had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and were either aged ≥ 30 years with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or aged ≥ 50 years with ≥ 2 risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The risk factors were defined as a diabetes duration of at least 10 years, a systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg, receiving > 1 antihypertensive agent, current smoking, micro‐ or macroalbuminuria, or an HDL cholesterol level of < 1 mmol/L. Participants also needed to meet other criteria for inclusion as described previously.

For this post hoc exploratory biomarker study we included only patients in whom urine samples were collected (N = 3475) and further excluded patients with normoalbuminuria at baseline (UACR < 30 mg/g; N = 2712) because canagliflozin does not decrease albuminuria in patients with normoalbuminuria, precluding assessment of potential mediating effects in these patients.

1.7 Perineal necrotising fasciitis

Concern has been raised that SGLT2 inhibitors may be associated with a minor increase in the risk of perineal necrotizing fasciitis, also known as Fournier's gangrene, although the extreme rarity of the complication makes the magnitude of the association difficult to quantify. Isolated reports in pharmacovigilance databases like the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System may not establish a causal relationship and are subject to reporting and other bias. In the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 trial, there was 1 perineal necrotizing fasciitis event with dapagliflozin compared with 5 events with placebo. There were no recorded events with SGLT2 inhibitor use in the other large cardiovascular and kidney outcome trials. Additionally, a real‐world study including more than 1 800 000 people with T2DM found no increase in hospital admission rates for perineal necrotizing fasciitis among SGLT2 inhibitor users. As a precaution, clinicians should advise people with diabetes who are using an SGLT2 inhibitor to seek urgent medical attention if they experience perineal pain, swelling or erythema and if they are systemically unwell.

1.8 Adverse effects with no apparent association withinhibitor use

Adverse effects with no convincing evidence of association with SGLT2 inhibitor use in studied populations are discussed in Box 2.

Adverse effects with no apparent association with SGLT2 inhibitor use

Urinary Tract Infections

Early case reports of SGLT2 inhibitor use, and the mechanism of action of increasing the glucose content of urine, raised concerned about a possible increased risk of urinary tract infections. There is no increased risk at meta‐analysis level, including more than 50 000 patients, and in subsequently published major clinical trials, or among real‐world patients. Specifically, no significant increase in risk of urosepsis or pyelonephritis has been observed in routine care.

### SGLT2 inhibition in diabetes mellitus: rationale and clinical prospects [^117GcHGc]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2012). Medium credibility.

This Review covers the rationale, physiological consequences and clinical application of pharmacological sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in whom renal glucose reabsorption might be upregulated, orally active, selective SGLT2 inhibitors improve glycaemic control to a therapeutically useful extent. Chronic administration of several SGLT2 inhibitors dose-dependently lowers HbA(1c) levels by 0.5–1.5% without causing hypoglycaemia. The unique mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors-which does not hinge upon β-cell function or tissue insulin sensitivity-means that they can exert their antihyperglycaemic effects in combination with any other oral antidiabetic drug as well as insulin. Available phase III studies confirm a good tolerability profile. Weight loss owing to urinary calorie leakage may be less than expected, but the negative energy balance offers a valuable clinical benefit. Offloading of sodium can assist blood pressure control. The progressive loss of efficacy in patients with reduced glomerular function will have to be balanced against the possibility of renal protection. The safety issues of genitourinary infections and cancer risk requires careful, proactive monitoring and analysis of robust exposure data, particularly in elderly, frail patients and in patients with impaired kidney function and/or high cardiovascular/cancer risk, who represent an increasing fraction of the population with diabetes mellitus.

### Empagliflozin induces transient diuresis without changing long-term overall fluid balance in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^114orVxL]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Since SGLT2 inhibitors induce sustained glucosuria, it has been speculated that increased osmolarity due to augmented glucose delivery to the tubular lumen of the kidneys could impact short-term and long-term whole-body fluid balance. Consequently, reports of adverse events consistent with volume depletion have emerged from clinical trials as well as the routine clinical use of SGLT2 inhibitors. We therefore assessed the acute and chronic effects of empagliflozin on 24-h urine volume production and daily fluid intake in Japanese patients with T2D using data retrieved from a previously completed phase 2, pharmacodynamic study.

Our results show that treatment initiation with empagliflozin leads to a rapid pharmacodynamic response which is reflected in a significant increase in UGE following the first intake of the study drug. This effect of empagliflozin was maintained throughout the study period, leading to stable and clinically relevant levels of glucosuria. Novel insights from this study show that patients initiated on either 10 mg or 25 mg empagliflozin presented a significant increase in 24-h urine volume on day 1. The observed increase in urine volume within the first 24 h of treatment corresponded to an average additional daily output of approximately 500–800 mL for the 10 mg and 25 mg doses of empagliflozin compared to placebo. Importantly, however, this increase in urine volume with empagliflozin was transient in nature, and returned to 24-h baseline urine levels similar to those observed in the placebo group after 4 weeks of chronic treatment. These results in Japanese patients with T2D are reminiscent of a previous study in Caucasian T2D patients treated with empagliflozin. Data showed a significant increase in 24-h urine volume with empagliflozin on day 1, but urine volume returned to baseline values, with no change versus placebo as early as day 5 despite sustained glucosuria. Similar data were also reported with another SGLT2 inhibitor, canagliflozin, with an initial increase in urine volume versus placebo observed in Japanese patients with T2D treated with 25–400 mg canagliflozin on day 1; this effect disappeared as early as day 2.

### Critical reanalysis of the mechanisms underlying the cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors and reaffirmation of the nutrient deprivation signaling / autophagy hypothesis [^112bnU1u]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Potential Benefits of SGLT2 Inhibitors Acting as Osmotic Diuretics

The possibility that SGLT2 inhibitors might treat HF by functioning as antagonists of renal sympathetic nerve hyperactivity or by ameliorating sodium retention is appealing (Figure 1). However, it has been difficult to show that SGLT2 inhibitors exert important natriuretic effects in patients with HF. In this setting, SGLT2 inhibition exerts a short-term osmotic diuretic effect with little increase in urinary sodium excretion, suggesting that any increase in urine volume is related to augmented glucose (and not sodium) excretion. However, early increases in urinary water excretion are not sustained because of the activation of adaptive mechanisms that decrease free water clearance, explaining why long-term SGLT2 inhibition does not change serum sodium concentration.

Figure 1.
Proposed framework by which SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors might exert cardioprotective and nephroprotective effects by acting to mute renal sympathetic nerve activity and promote natriuresis and osmotic diuresis. NHE3 indicates sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform 3.

Additional lines of evidence raise further doubts that a sustained diuretic effect can account for the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in HF. SGLT2 inhibitors are not more effective in patients with HF who have volume overload, as compared with those who are euvolemic. Although these drugs produce a modest decrease in body weight, this appears to be related to the urinary caloric loss and the shrinkage of fat depots rather than to changes in fluid status; changes in body weight are poorly correlated with changes in natriuretic peptides. The increase in hematocrit seen in clinical trials is a delayed effect that is related to erythrocytosis rather than hemoconcentration. Although SGLT2 inhibitors can decrease plasma volume, this represents a compensatory mechanism that is triggered by the increase in red blood cell mass; if plasma volume were not reduced, erythrocytosis would lead to intolerable hypervolemia.

Mechanism of Action of the SGLT2 Inhibitors

Three SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin) have been approved for clinical use in the United States and Europe, while many other molecules are currently under investigation. 26

In general, SGLT2 inhibitors can induce glycosuria by the following 3 mechanisms: (1) decreasing TmG, (2) lowering the threshold for glycosuria, and (3) decreasing the rate of reabsorption of filtered glucose. However, these mechanisms are insufficient to explain the induction of glycosuria in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors who have normal fasting glucose, and this could be explained by methodological inaccuracy in measuring the threshold of glycosuria. In individuals without DM, the 3 SGLT2 inhibitors, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin, can increase the urinary glucose excretion by 60 to 80 g/d. 27, 29

In a comparison study conducted in patients without DM, canagliflozin at a dose of 300 mg resulted in a daily excretion of glucose in the urine equal to 51.4 g, a significantly greater quantity than that obtained with the administration of dapagliflozin at a dose of 10 mg, which led to excretion of only 40.8 g of glucose. 30 The difference in urinary glucose excretion by these 2 molecules is the result of the longer half‐life of canagliflozin, which leads to increases in the plasma concentration of canagliflozin after 16 to 24 hours. The data are relevant in understanding how the different bioavailability of molecules that have similar pharmacological actions can lead to a different biologic efficacy. In T2DM, all 3 SGLT2 inhibitors produce a dose‐dependent increase in the elimination of glucose in the urine and a similar decrease in plasma fasting, postprandial glucose, and HbA 1c levels. 29, 30, 31, 32 However, no comparative study has yet to be performed to establish efficacy between different molecules in patients with DM. Controlled trials conducted with canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have shown that these SGLT2 inhibitors result in a reduction in HbA 1c of 0.7% to 1.0% in a patient with T2DM without prior diabetic treatment, as well as in patients already treated with metformin, sulphonylureas, pioglitazone, metformin, and insulin, or in patients with HbA 1c values of 7.8% to 8.2%. 32, 33

### Empagliflozin in nondiabetic individuals with calcium and uric acid kidney stones: a randomized phase 2 trial [^1157pWmC]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors decrease the activity of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3), the main sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption pathway in the proximal tubule. Inhibition of NHE3 is expected to decrease paracellular calcium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and augment urine calcium, which is what we observed in patients with calcium stones receiving empagliflozin. This effect was not observed in patients with UA stones receiving empagliflozin, suggesting that patients with high baseline urine calcium are more prone to develop SGLT2 inhibition-associated increases in urine calcium. Importantly, however, the protective rise in urine citrate greatly exceeded the increase of urine calcium observed in patients with calcium stones receiving empagliflozin.

SGLT2 inhibitors are uricosuric and lower plasma UA, which has raised concerns regarding increased risks for UA stone formation. The exact mechanism of the uricosuric effect is debated, but seems to be coupled to glucosuria in both rodent and human studies, with increased UA excretion from day 1 of treatment. We now provide clinical trial evidence that, despite decreasing plasma UA, empagliflozin significantly decreases RSR UA in patients with UA kidney stones.

Interestingly, empagliflozin induced differential urine pH changes in patients with calcium and UA kidney stones. Urine pH was clamped to 5.6 with empagliflozin in both groups of patients, resulting in an increase in urine pH in patients with UA stones and a decrease in urine pH in patients with calcium stones. Given the importance of pH for RSR CaP and RSR UA, these differential urine pH changes probably had a substantial impact on the beneficial changes in RSR CaP and RSR UA observed in patients with calcium and UA kidney stones, respectively. We can only speculate on the mechanism underlying the differential effect on urine pH. Although NGIA increased in both groups of patients treated with empagliflozin, NAE was lower in patients with UA kidney stones and higher in patients with calcium kidney stones treated with empagliflozin. Thus, empagliflozin seems to exhibit differential effects on endogenous acid generation and increased intestinal alkali absorption in the two groups of patients.

### Empagliflozin and decreased risk of nephrolithiasis: a potential new role for SGLT2 inhibition? [^111YWXuj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibition may also have indirect effects on bone and mineral metabolism, and some of these are not intuitively linked to decreased risk of urolithiasis. For example, increased sodium availability in the renal tubule modulates both nephron calcium and phosphate handling. Decreased renal calcium absorption and increased phosphate absorption results in increased urinary calcium excretion and low urinary phosphate concentrations. High urinary calcium in the setting of hypocitraturia and low urinary volume promotes supersaturation and crystallization of calcium oxalate and less frequently calcium phosphate, leading to renal stone formation. SGLT2 inhibitors are also associated with decreased serum uric acid levels from increased urate excretion. However, hyperuricosuria per se is not associated with increased risk of nephrolithiasis. The principal determinant of uric acid crystallization and precipitation (which may also serve as a nidus for calcium oxalate stone formation) is low urine pH. The uric acid crystals are more soluble in an alkaline milieu, thus preventing stone formation even in patients with high urinary urate. Animal experiments have in fact demonstrated increased urinary bicarbonate excretion and higher urine pH after SGLT2 inhibition. Finally, hypocitraturia is another common metabolic abnormality seen in 20% to 60% of patients with nephrolithiasis. Urinary citrate serves to inhibit supersaturation and crystallization of calcium salts. In addition, citrate increases urine pH and reduces calcium concentration in the urine by forming complexes with calcium ion in the urine, rendering it overall less lithogenic. Recent studies have also shown that therapy with dapagliflozin, another SGLT2 inhibitor, leads to a significant increase in urinary citrate excretion.

Thus, the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the predisposition to urinary tract stones appear complex. While any increase in urine flow due to osmotic diuresis could prevent urolithiasis, this could be counterbalanced by effects on urinary calcium and urate handling, which might promote stone formation. The possible benefits mediated through changes in urinary citrate and bicarbonate handling would also need to be considered.

While this study included a large number of patients with relatively long follow-up, our analysis has some limitations. It was post hoc and the definition applied for urolithiasis was based on adverse events reported by site investigators and not confirmed by chart review. Furthermore, since only 1 patient experienced a recurrent event of urolithiasis, we cannot draw any firm conclusion on the prevention of events in patients with a prior history. Finally, urine samples were not available from any study and, therefore, metabolic analyses regarding changes in stone risk profiles could not be performed.

### Practical approach to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes [^114stxX6]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

SGLT2 inhibitors are an attractive novel therapeutic option for the treatment of T2DM. They block the reabsorption of filtered glucose, mainly in proximal renal tubules, resulting in increased urinary glucose excretion and correction of diabetes-related hyperglycemia. Beyond improving glucose control, SGLT2 inhibitors offer potential benefits by reducing body weight and blood pressure. On the basis of the efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second- or third-line agents for the management of patients with T2DM. Beneficial effects on kidney disease progression, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure have also been demonstrated with one SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin). Potential AEs resulting from their mechanism of action (hypoglycemia and volume depletion-related events) make it advisable to review concomitant therapies when initiating with SGLT2 inhibitors. Although the overall frequency of AEs is relatively low among these patients, some individual characteristics (elderly, patients receiving diuretics, previous orthostatic hypotension, blood pressure lability, or prior syncope) may increase the risk of developing them.

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^1162K5BB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and thereby promotes urinary glucose excretion.

Dapagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulation of sympathetic activity, and decreased intraglomerular pressure which is believed to be mediated by increased tubuloglomerular feedback.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

General

Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin (see Figure 1). Dapagliflozin doses of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks resulted in excretion of approximately 70 grams of glucose in the urine per day at Week 12. A near maximum glucose excretion was observed at the dapagliflozin daily dosage of 20 mg. This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. After discontinuation of dapagliflozin, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg dosage.

Figure 1: Scatter Plot and Fitted Line of Change from Baseline in 24-Hour Urinary Glucose Amount versus Dapagliflozin Dose in Healthy Subjects and Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (Semi-Log Plot)

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Dapagliflozin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of QTc interval at daily doses up to 150 mg (15-times the recommended maximum dose) in a study of healthy subjects. In addition, no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval was observed following single doses of up to 500 mg (50-times the recommended maximum dose) of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects.

### Living with type 2 diabetes: patient commentary in response to the paper' SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes management: key evidence and implications for clinical practice' [^11791A5P]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

All of this has been to support others and to ensure people living with diabetes don't experience the same lack of information at diagnosis and while living with their diabetes as I did. I also continue to find additional information for myself in order to help with my own diabetes management.

I was chosen by Diabetes UK to be their expert patient for NICE when the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) medications were being discussed for a multiple technology appraisal. This gave me an opportunity to discuss type 2 diabetes, share my own experiences and frustrations, and give my opinion on this type of medication. I was put on an SGLT2i by a fantastic diabetes consultant nurse and I find this type of medication has had a positive effect on my health. I am less stressed and more able to manage my diabetes. My blood glucose levels are much improved, I cope better, feel better and am more confident knowing I can control my blood glucose levels more efficiently. The medication has lowered my blood pressure level too, which has taken away the worry of going on blood pressure medication, which was always under discussion with my GP prior to taking this medication. Anything that is better for the heart is good! The fear of having to inject myself with insulin has also disappeared.

When reading the journal paper "SGLT2i inhibitors in type 2 diabetes management: key evidence and implications for clinical practice", I found it useful to read about the weight loss outcomes and to learn that this is due to the reduction in visceral fat and is not attributed to the more frequent urination. When I was first given the SGLT2i medication, I was advised to drink plenty of water and did not get any adverse side effects (apart from needing the toilet more often because of the extra water I was drinking). However, I know patients who haven't been told this and have had urinary infections and other complications as a result. I don't think patients know enough about SGLT2i medications or have enough information about their treatments in general. In my opinion, some healthcare professionals don't either. For instance, metformin, a common medication for type 2 diabetes, must be taken with food. However, I have met patients through the peer support programme who have not been told this and subsequently have experienced unpleasant side effects.

### Prevention of cardiorenal complications with sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors: a narrative review [^113TJrwc]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

SGLT2i and Their Unique Mechanism of Action in Metabolic Control

Glucose reabsorption in the kidney is mainly mediated by SGLT2 receptor, located in the early proximal tubule, with a small contribution of sodium–glucose cotransporter type 1 (SGLT1), located in the late proximal tubule. All the SGLT2i share the same mechanism of action: by inhibiting SGLT2 receptor, they facilitate urine glucose and sodium excretion. Canagliflozin also exerts a small inhibiting effect on SGLT1 receptor, which contributes to the uptake of glucose and galactose in the intestine, but plays a minor role in renal reabsorption. The increased glycosuria and natriuresis mediated by SGLT2 inhibition associate with different metabolic benefits, such as a reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, and blood pressure. The renal action of SGLT2i is independent of β‐cell function and insulin secretion, limiting the risk of hypoglycemia; thus, these drugs have the potential to be used at any stage of T2D and in combination with any class of glucose‐lowering agent, including insulin, although their glucosuria effect is lower when renal function declines.

Current SGLT2i approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of patients with T2D are dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin. Generally, SGLT2i seems to be as effective at decreasing plasma glucose levels as other available therapeutic options. Although there are real-life studies that suggest differences between SGLT2i, head-to-head comparisons between the different gliflozins are lacking, so it is unknown if any improve glycemic control more than the others. A network meta-analysis showed that SGLT2i as monotherapy were more effective than placebo for lowering HbA1c levels (by 0.59–1.23%) after 24 weeks of treatment. Similarly, in another meta-analysis that included trials evaluating dapagliflozin, this drug produced greater mean reductions in HbA1c (−0.60%), fasting plasma glucose (−1.30 mmol/L), and body weight (−1.50 kg), compared with placebo. Apart from these metabolic benefits, SGLT2i have demonstrated to exert direct nephroprotective and cardioprotective effects and to be associated with favorable CV and kidney outcomes. This evidence is promoting a change of treatment paradigm, shifting from targeting glucose control and HbA1c concentrations to reduce microvascular complications, to a more comprehensive approach that also focuses on CV and renal prevention.

### Role of glycosuria in SGLT2 inhibitor-induced cardiorenal protection: a mechanistic analysis of the CREDENCE trial [^113r71PS]. Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to provide pronounced reductions in cardiorenal outcomes, including cardiovascular death, heart failure, and renal failure. The mechanisms underlying these benefits remain uncertain. We hypothesized that the effects could be attributed to the elevated glycosuria induced by these drugs. Urine concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and ketones were measured at baseline and after 1 year of treatment with either placebo or canagliflozin 100 mg/day, in approximately 2,600 individuals from the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial (enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and albuminuria). Associations between glycosuria and the primary composite end point from CREDENCE, and secondary outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Canagliflozin treatment increased fractional urinary glucose excretion (± SD) from 3 ± 9% at baseline to 30 ± 26% at year 1 (vs. 5 ± 19% with placebo; P < 0.001). Patients in the canagliflozin arm and in the top quartile of urine glucose to creatinine ratio at year 1 were significantly protected for the primary end point (hazard ratio [HR] 0.42; 95% CI 0.30–0.61); similar results were seen for cases of hospitalized heart failure (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.27–0.73) and all-cause death (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39–0.80). These associations persisted when adjustments were made for multiple conventional risk factors. Among patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD treated with canagliflozin, individuals with the highest glycosuria levels had the strongest protection against multiple cardiorenal outcomes.

### Triple therapy with low-dose dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus dual therapy with each monocomponent, all added to metformin, in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes [^113jTwiy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

An interesting finding from the present study was that addition of saxagliptin to dapagliflozin plus metformin appeared to prevent the increased production of β‐hydroxybutyrate that was seen with dapagliflozin plus metformin. SGLT2 inhibitors directly and indirectly stimulate glucagon secretion, which promotes the β‐oxidation of fatty acids and the formation of ketone bodies. 24 DPP‐4 inhibitors have previously been shown to suppress SGLT2‐inhibitor‐induced glucagon secretion, 25 which may have prevented the dapagliflozin‐mediated ketosis in the present study. Although this finding and the underlying mechanisms require further investigation, the present data are important. SGLT2 inhibitors are thought to be associated with a very small increase in the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, based on testing in patients with type 1 diabetes, although reports of this serious event are very rare in patients with type 2 diabetes. 23 Notably, no participant in the present study had a confirmed diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis. Although three participants had AEs of urinary ketones, there were no additional signs or symptoms suggestive of this condition.

As seen previously, the combination of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin was well tolerated, and there were no major differences in tolerability among the treatment groups. 26 As expected, UTIs and genital infections generally occurred more frequently in women than in men, 27 and the incidence of genital infections was higher with dapagliflozin‐containing treatment regimens than with saxagliptin. Notably, the mitigation of genital infections that has been seen with the combination of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin 23 was not seen with dapagliflozin 5 mg used in this study; however, genital infections were mostly mild and easily treated in all groups.

Although AEs of renal impairment or failure were more common with triple therapy than with dual therapy, these were mainly minor decreases in eGFR, and none of the events were considered serious. Notably, decreases in eGFR with SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to be reversible, but might also be renoprotective, owing to the resultant decrease in intraglomerular pressure that ultimately decreases the rate of eGFR decline in people with type 2 diabetes, relative to those not taking SGLT2 inhibitors. 28, 29 Findings from the DECLARE‐TIMI randomized trial also suggest that long‐term use of dapagliflozin is beneficial rather than detrimental to renal outcomes. In that trial, patients treated with dapagliflozin for a median of 4.2 years had lower rates of renal disease progression than those treated with placebo. 30

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and severe urinary tract infections: real-world meta-analysis of cohort studies [^112pXreh]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

There is limited knowledge about severe urinary tract infections associated with SGLT2i, despite this being the basis for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning. We aim to provide real-world evidence to clarify this relationship further.

Data Source

A literature review was performed in PubMed and Embase for cohort studies published up to August 2024 using PICO-consistent terms.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Cohort studies in English involving new users of SGLT2i that compare SGLT2i with glucagon-like receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), DPP4i, and other glucose-lowering medications and report severe urinary tract infection (UTI).

Data Synthesis

The random-effect model determined the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for severe UTI. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to identify sources of heterogeneity. In 11 cohort studies involving 679617 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a median age of 64 (interquartile range [IQR] = 56–72) and 42% (IQR = 39%-51%) females, it was found that the use of SGLT2i was associated with a reduced risk of severe UTI compared with both composite glucose-lowering medications (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.60–0.88) and DPP4i (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.43–0.54). There was no significant difference in the risk compared with GLP-1RA (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.78–1.14).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

The lack of increased risk for severe UTI reassures physicians when assessing benefit-risk to continue SGLT2i after a severe UTI. This may enhance patient adherence and improve diabetes management. Furthermore, our findings show no significant risk increase in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who would benefit significantly from SGLT2i.

Conclusion

SGLT2i does not appear to pose a greater risk of severe UTI than other oral glucose-lowering medications. This contributes to the existing literature on UTI, accounting for the event's severity. However, more data are needed to assess the potential association between SGLT2i and life-threatening UTI events.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in east Asians with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UUHPS]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

The antihyperglycemic mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitors underlies the increased risk of polyuria, dehydration, and genitourinary infections due to increased levels of sugar in the urine. Western population-based studies have shown that the risk of hypoglycemia with SGLT2 inhibitors is similar to that with other drugs, but that the risk of genitourinary infections increases. Only the increased risk of urinary and genital infections has been consistently reported in clinical trials and observational studies. Our meta-analysis indicates a slight increase in the risk of adverse reactions to SGLT2 inhibitors in East Asian T2DM patients compared to controls. In particular, the risk of developing GTIs was 1.73-fold higher in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors than in the control group. This result is consistent with the conclusion drawn by the authors of the Asian population-based study. A meta-analysis involving a large population (n = 50,880) and no ethnic restrictions found that SGLT-2 inhibitors did not appear to increase the risk of UTIs in patients with T2DM — with the exception of high-dose dapagliflozin (10 mg daily). In addition to race, sample size, drug type, and dose, study duration may also be a factor influencing the results of any analysis. To summarize, our results lead us to suggest that the treating physician should focus on GTIs in East Asian patients who use SGLT2 inhibitors and be alert to UTIs. The cardiovascular and renal safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in East Asian patients with T2DM could not be adequately assessed in our meta-analysis due to the limitation in study duration of the trials included in the meta-analysis. Therefore, further research is needed.

### Association between sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes after urinary tract infection [^113hES9Z]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Infections remain a frequent and clinically significant complication in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), primarily due to persistent hyperglycaemia, immune dysregulation, and endothelial dysfunction which together impair host defence mechanisms. Among these, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and acute pyelonephritis are especially common and may trigger prolonged inflammatory responses, metabolic instability, and organ vulnerability in diabetic patients. The period following such infections — often termed the "vulnerable recovery phase" — has been associated with increased risks of systemic complications, renal function deterioration, and cardiovascular events. Despite growing awareness of this transitional window, there remains limited evidence to guide the selection of optimal antihyperglycaemic agents that can safely support recovery while minimizing long‐term adverse outcomes.

Sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as a preferred therapeutic class for patients with T2DM, owing to their demonstrated benefits in reducing cardiovascular mortality, slowing kidney disease progression, and improving heart failure outcomes in multiple randomised controlled trials. These organ‐protective effects are thought to arise from pleiotropic mechanisms, including natriuresis, modulation of tubuloglomerular feedback, reduction in oxidative stress, and anti‐inflammatory activity. However, due to their known association with genital and urinary tract infections, clinicians have exercised caution regarding their use in patients with a recent history of UTI. While meta‐analyses suggest that the risk of serious infections such as urosepsis remains low with SGLT2i, the perceived infection‐related risk may influence prescribing decisions in real‐world settings. Consequently, many clinicians delay or avoid initiating SGLT2i in the post‐UTI period, potentially foregoing the opportunity for cardiometabolic benefit.

### Can the bladder itself "Measure" volume, and thereby help to determine when initiation of voiding should occur? ICI-RS 2024 [^116PkHJJ]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

AVP synthesized locally in the urothelium activates vasopressin 1 and vasopressin 2 receptors (VR1/VR2) in mouse and human bladders to complement the endocrine signaling of AVP in the dilution of plasma osmolality through reduction in the urine volume and amelioration of the filling sensations arising from the bladder wall via a rise in bladder compliance. While human urothelium can accelerate the reabsorption of Na + bound water for homeostasis of plasma electrolytes and hydration status to offset polyuria, mammalian urothelium lacks the biochemical machinery to absorb oil or to upregulate Na‐glucose cotransporters (SGLT) or GLUT‐1 glucose transporters for homeostasis of glycemia by acceleration of concentration‐dependent reabsorption of 5%–50% glucose instilled in human bladder. A three times slower reabsorption rate of glucose bound water (glucosuria) than that of Na + or Cl − bound water (polyuria) during closed cystometry of the rat underlines the pathologic significance of the glucosuria in the Streptozotocin‐induced diabetes model. Instead of polyuria, glucosuria is culpable in prolonged distension of bladder causing a threefold rise in ATP/NO release from the urothelium to stimulate the firing of bladder afferent nerves for causing dramatically higher urinary frequency accompanied with the rise in bladder weight. Accordingly, the causality of recently reported treatment‐associated adverse effects of OAB in non‐insulin dependent diabetes patients after treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors (new antidiabetic drugs): canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin is the evoked glucosuria instead of polyuria. Evidently, the receptors and channels expressed by the human urothelium can offset the effect of polyuria but not of glucosuria evoked by saturation of SGLT in diabetes or by inhibitors of SGLT. Overall, these reports provide clinical, and basic scientific evidence on the modulation of bladder permeability as a homeostatic lever to delay the full sensation of fullness and forestall urgency, the hallmark symptom of OAB.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors: new horizons for rheumatologists [^1178Kg6Z]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 INHIBITOR DRUG MECHANISM

SGLT2 inhibitors block the action of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), which is located in the early proximal tubule of the kidney. It is responsible for reabsorption of approximately 90% of glucose filtered by the kidney. Sodium glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) is located later in the proximal tubule and reabsorbs most of the remaining glucose but is also present in small intestine, heart and skeletal muscle making it a less ideal drug target.

When hyperglycemia occurs, increasing amounts of glucose are reabsorbed in the proximal tubule leading to sustained hyperglycemia in the body, which can be maladaptive in the setting of chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes. Prolonged hyperglycemia is also associated with upregulation of renal SGLT2 protein expression in rodent models, which can further perpetuate hyperglycemia, worsening long-term effects.

As glucose levels in the body escalate, SGLT2 works to reabsorb increasing amounts of glucose which is followed by sodium, chloride, and fluid. This decreases the levels of sodium and chloride delivered to the macula densa further through the nephron. Tubuloglomerular feedback interprets the lower concentrations of sodium and chloride as lower effective circulating volume, increases dilation of the afferent arteriole, and upregulates glomerular filtration at the level of the nephron. It is hypothesized that this leads to hyperfiltration in the diabetic kidney, propagating long term injury.

SGLT2 inhibitors' blockage of the actions of SGLT2 leads to an osmotic diuresis. In addition to increased levels of glucose remaining in the urine, there is an increased delivery of sodium, chloride, and water to the macula densa with SGLT2 blockade. The kidney interprets this as increased glomerular perfusion which leads to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and decreases intraglomerular pressure leading to less stress on the system. The decreased intraglomerular pressure also leads to a decrease in albumin lost in the urine, which is important as decreased albuminuria is associated with reduction in risk of end-stage renal disease. Hypoglycemia is not typically seen with isolated use of SGLT2 inhibition because of the compensatory response of SGLT1 further downstream in the proximal tubule. The glucose lower effects of SGLT2 inhibition are higher in the setting of hyperglycemia and decrease as serum glucose levels fall.

### Renal and cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibition in combination with loop diuretics in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure: the RECEDE-CHF trial [^115hxLPR]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized, controlled trial of the effects of SGLT2 inhibition in addition to loop diuretic in patients with HF with T2D, we found that within 6 weeks empagliflozin caused a significant increase in total urine volume without a significant increase in urinary sodium or FENa compared with placebo. We also found that empagliflozin caused a significant increase in electrolyte free water clearance. Empagliflozin also caused significant weight loss and overall changes in clinical status necessitating a reduction in furosemide dose. There were no significant changes in markers associated with intravascular volume change, including serum urea, hematocrit, or systolic blood pressure.

After DAPA-HF, SGLT2 inhibitors are increasingly being considered as an HF medication rather than as strictly antihyperglycemic therapy. The early benefit improvement in HF outcomes seen has raised the possibility that the osmotic diuresis caused by SGLT2 inhibitors might be one mechanism contributing to improved outcomes by improving ventricular loading conditions. Our study sheds light on this potential diuretic effect; our findings of a significant increase in urine volume without a significant increase in natriuresis with associated significant weight loss could be particularly beneficial in patients with HF in whom traditional strategies for reducing fluid overload — for example, combining loop and thiazide diuretics — can induce hyponatremia.

We found that empagliflozin caused a significant increase in 24-hour urine volume but did not have a significant effect on urine volume or sodium during the RPTs immediately after a single dose. This has been reported in other studies, although we have now extended this finding to patients with HF with T2D on loop diuretic, including in those with eGFR 45 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m². In a trial of 36 patients with T2D, canagliflozin caused an increase in total urine volume without any significant change in plasma volume at 12 weeks. In another small observational study in patients with CKD, dapagliflozin was associated with preferential reduction in extracellular water in comparison to furosemide. As a potential HF therapy, SGLT2 inhibitors could be frequently prescribed alongside loop diuretics, but there are little data on coadministration. A study of 42 healthy volunteers randomized to dapagliflozin, bumetanide, or combination therapy found that the combination of dapagliflozin and bumetanide caused a significant increase in urine volume, but not urinary sodium, compared with bumetanide alone. The authors also found that there was no significant change in natriuresis after the first dose of dapagliflozin, suggesting that there is an adaptive, synergistic increase in natriuresis over the first week.

### The relationship between increases in morning spot urinary glucose excretion and decreases in hbAin patients with type 2 diabetes after taking an SGLT2 inhibitor: a retrospective, longitudinal study [^111KcT2U]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although SGLT2 inhibitor treatment leads to reduced HbA 1C levels by augmenting UGE (i.e. medication efficacy), larger increases in UGE after SGLT2 inhibitor treatment do not correlate to larger reductions in HbA 1C (i.e. effectiveness). This suggests that the relation between morning spot urine glucose parameters and HbA 1C is not as simple as hypothesized and increases in UGE might not be an indicator of the degree of reductions in blood glucose.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: are they all the same? A narrative review of cardiovascular outcome trials [^111ccFtJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Genitourinary Infections and Acute Kidney Injury

Given the mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors improve hyperglycaemia, an increased incidence of genital and or urinary tract infections secondary to the increased glycosuria is possible. Consistently across each of the trials, the rate of genital tract infection was higher in those using SGLT2 inhibitors and the rate of urinary tract infections was only significantly higher in the VERTIS-CV study. Similar real-world findings have been identified in people with T2D using SGLT2 inhibitors compared with other classes of medication for diabetes. There was a significantly lower rate of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use in the DECLARE-TIMI and EMPA-REG trials, and a trend to reduced AKI incidence in all other CVOTs to date. These findings are also supported by recent real-world analyses of people with T2D using this class of medication.

Bone Fractures and Limb Amputation

The frequency of either bone fractures or limb amputation was only statistically significantly higher in the CANVAS study, and not significantly different in any other CVOT. As canagliflozin has significantly lower selectivity for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, some authors have suggested this may explain the increased fracture risk. However, there is no clear biological mechanism which would support this suggestion, as the SGLT1 protein has not been observed in bone. Moreover, as the CREDENECE study also included canagliflozin and did not demonstrate an increased fracture risk, many believe this observation is simply a result of chance.

### SGLT2 inhibitors may predispose to ketoacidosis [^112XvFE9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are antidiabetic drugs that increase urinary excretion of glucose, thereby improving glycemic control and promoting weight loss. Since approval of the first-in-class drug in 2013, data have emerged suggesting that these drugs increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. In May 2015, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning that SGLT2 inhibitors may lead to ketoacidosis.

Evidence Acquisition

Using PubMed and Google, we conducted Boolean searches including terms related to ketone bodies or ketoacidosis with terms for SGLT2 inhibitors or phlorizin. Priority was assigned to publications that shed light on molecular mechanisms whereby SGLT2 inhibitors could affect ketone body metabolism.

Evidence Synthesis

SGLT2 inhibitors trigger multiple mechanisms that could predispose to diabetic ketoacidosis. When SGLT2 inhibitors are combined with insulin, it is often necessary to decrease the insulin dose to avoid hypoglycemia. The lower dose of insulin may be insufficient to suppress lipolysis and ketogenesis. Furthermore, SGLT2 is expressed in pancreatic α-cells, and SGLT2 inhibitors promote glucagon secretion. Finally, phlorizin, a nonselective inhibitor of SGLT family transporters decreases urinary excretion of ketone bodies. A decrease in the renal clearance of ketone bodies could also increase the plasma ketone body levels.

Conclusions

Based on the physiology of SGLT2 and the pharmacology of SGLT2 inhibitors, there are several biologically plausible mechanisms whereby this class of drugs has the potential to increase the risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis. Future research should be directed toward identifying which patients are at greatest risk for this side effect and also to optimizing pharmacotherapy to minimize the risk to patients.

### SGLT1 and SGLT1 inhibitors: a role to be assessed in the current clinical practice [^114RPer3]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a complex disease of increasingly common occurrence worldwide. Attaining optimal glycemic control is the main challenge to prevent the development of diabetes-related complications and/or to stop their progression. In recent years, the pharmacologic toolkit for the treatment of diabetes has considerably expanded, thus paving the way to more pathophysiology-oriented therapies. For instance, the sodium-glucose cotransporters SGLT2 and SGLT1 have been in the spotlight because of better knowledge of their physiology and therapeutic potential. At present, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitors are widely applied in current clinical practice as an effective and well-tolerated treatment that increases the urinary excretion of glucose, less is known about the use of SGLT1 inhibitors. SGLT1s are of primary importance in the small intestine, an organ that does not express SGLT2, while in the kidney they are expressed in the late renal proximal tubules, where it reabsorbs the glucose escaped from the upstream SGLT2. Hence, SGLT1-mediated glucose reabsorption in the kidney is increased when the tubular glucose load overwhelms the capacity of SGLT2 or when the latter is inhibited. The role of SGLT1 in intestinal and renal glucose transport makes the transporter a potential target for antidiabetic therapy. Here, we briefly report the evidence on LX2761, a new inhibitor against SGLT1 and SGLT2 in vitro, which acts in vivo as a selective inhibitor of SGLT1 in the gastrointestinal tract. LX2761 improves glycemic control without the glycosuria-related side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly genitourinary tract infections. However, whether it represents a valid therapeutic option for all patients with diabetes or is more appropriate for specific phenotypes, e.g., patients with concomitant diabetes and chronic kidney disease, who may benefit less from the renal mechanism of selective SGLT2 inhibitors, remains to be tested in large randomized controlled trials.

### The relationship between increases in morning spot urinary glucose excretion and decreases in hbAin patients with type 2 diabetes after taking an SGLT2 inhibitor: a retrospective, longitudinal study [^111Tzzjz]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite numerous reports on the clinical efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors, a debate remains regarding the direct causality between the pharmacologic efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in UGE and their clinical effectiveness in lowering the glucose level as assessed by several glycemic indices since few observational studies based on routine care have been performed. We hypothesized that the increased glucose excretion into the urine might decrease glycemic parameters, such as HbA 1C or glycated albumin, in the blood. Based on these hypotheses, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between increases in morning spot urine glucose parameters and decreases in HbA 1C in patients with T2D after taking SGLT2 inhibitors.

In this retrospective, observational study of SGLT2 inhibitors in Korean patients with poorly controlled T2D, we demonstrated three main findings. First, based on the increased urinary glucose levels after starting SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, the pharmacological mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal tubules is intact and active. Second, based on the HbA 1C results, we determined that, despite the pharmacological activity of SGLT2 inhibitors, there are responders and non-responders among the subjects with T2D. Third, based on the increased morning spot urine glucose parameters and decreased HbA 1C, the relation between morning spot urine glucose parameters and HbA 1C is not as simple as hypothesized.

### Dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116FDAZh]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is a selective and reversible inhibitor of sodium-glucose linked transporter type 2 (SGLT2), which mediates approximately 90% of active renal glucose reabsorption in the early proximal tubule of the kidney. Dapagliflozin significantly reduces glucose reabsorption and decreases serum glucose concentration in an insulin-independent manner. The decrease of glucose reabsorption by dapagliflozin has also been associated with a reduction in body weight. Furthermore, the drug modestly reduces blood pressure levels through weight loss and its action as osmotic diuretic. Dapagliflozin has been approved as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who cannot tolerate metformin or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs, with the exception of pioglitazone due to the theoretical increased risk of bladder cancer. The drug should not be prescribed in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or in patients at risk for developing volume depletion. Dapagliflozin is associated with increased incidence of genital and lower urinary tract infections, but these infections are usually mild to moderate and respond to standard antimicrobial treatment. Based on current evidence, dapagliflozin is a useful drug for patients with T2DM with a favorable safety profile. However, further research regarding the effects of dapagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes is needed.

### Development and potential role of type-2 sodium-glucose transporter inhibitors for management of type 2 diabetes [^112nwTaR]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Increased glucose content in the urine following SGLT2 inhibition will likely serve to increase urinary flow as a consequence of the osmotic diuretic effect in the lumen of the nephron. This could result in modest, possibly beneficial, reductions in blood pressure, but raises additional safety concerns associated with possible loss of fluid and solutes. This may be of particular concern in elderly patients or those who do not have the capacity to maintain their fluid balance. However, it should be noted that the effect is considerably lower than that seen with frequently used loop diuretics and there is no apparent change in glomerular filtration rate that would be indicative of a direct effect on renal function. Simple instructions on maintaining a state of hydration with regular drinks may serve to overcome the concerns over both urinary infection and fluid imbalance.

### Potential for combination of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^1173PJs9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter-2 Inhibitors

Three SGLT2 inhibitors are currently approved for the treatment of T2DM in the USA and the European Union: canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. These agents cause reduced reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate and increased excretion of glucose into the urine, and cause urinary glucose excretion to occur at a lower plasma glucose concentration. SGLT2 inhibition results in the loss of ∼60–80 g of glucose in the urine per day, which helps to reduce hyperglycaemia in individuals with T2DM. In addition to improvements in glycaemic control, SGLT2 inhibitors provide other effects that are desirable in a T2DM agent, such as weight loss, moderate reductions in systolic blood pressure and no increase in hypoglycaemia risk.

Clinical trial data have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors improve glycaemic control by reducing HbA1c, postprandial glucose and FPG concentrations, and produce modest reductions in body weight and blood pressure–. When used as monotherapy, these agents have been found to lead to reductions in HbA1c [from −0.34 to −1.03% (3.7–11.3 mmol/mol)], body weight (from −2.0 to −3.4 kg), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (from −1.7 to −6.4 mmHg and from −0.3 to −2.6 mmHg, respectively). Specific adverse reactions of SGLT2 inhibitors are related to urinary glucose excretion, in that the continual presence of glucose in the urine may increase the risk of urinary tract infections and/or genital mycotic infections.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and severe urinary tract infections: real-world meta-analysis of cohort studies [^111Vr34m]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The SGLT2i does not appear to present a greater risk of severe UTI when compared with other oral glucose-lowering medications. In addition, a decreased association was observed among specific patient subgroups, including individuals with CKD, women under the age of 65, and those without a history of prior UTI. Nonetheless, the study does not eliminate the possibility of UTI or severe UTI as complications in diabetic patients who are administered oral glucose-lowering medications. Instead, it indicates that SGLT2i may not exacerbate this risk.

### Efficacy, safety and regulatory status of SGLT2 inhibitors: focus on canagliflozin [^113NvqyK]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, SGLT2 inhibition can lead to unexpected sequels. It appears logical that glucosuria, deliberately induced by SGLT2 inhibition, favours urinary tract infections, as glucose serves as nutrient for bacteria. Some increase in urinary tract infections was indeed observed in regulatory safety trials; however, serious cases were rare. Much more pronounced were canagliflozin-related increases in female mycotic genital infections. Infections are not serious in nature and easy to treat, but patients and prescribers should be aware of it. Another reported side effect of canagliflozin treatment is osmotic diuresis and subsequent water loss. However, unlike that observed during classical osmotic diuresis, where sodium is retained, SGLT2 inhibition causes sodium loss. This can be attributed to the fact that sodium is co-transported with glucose by SGLT2 (Figure 1). In fact, canagliflozin leads to a decrease in blood pressure and haemoconcentration, reflected by increased haemoglobin and haematocrit (increased levels of plasma lipoproteins could also be a consequence of it, see below), but notably no hypernatraemia as a trigger for thirst. The latter may explain why, in particular, elderly patients do not develop sufficient thirst to compensate for water loss and consequently tend to have dehydration, unstable blood pressure or syncope. A rather sharp decrease in blood pressure can particularly occur at the beginning of therapy; later on, counter-regulatory mechanisms like reduction in glomerular perfusion minimize diuresis and blood pressure reduction. In order to avoid haemodynamic problems in vulnerable patients, canagliflozin therapy should be initiated with the lower dose of 100 mg per day (instead of 300 mg per day). Consequently, concomitant use of canagliflozin and loop diuretics is not recommended.

### Sodium glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: a review of their basic and clinical pharmacology [^111CN6jg]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale

Glucosuria (i.e. the excretion of glucose through the kidneys) only occurs if the maximal capacity of various glucose transporter proteins (350 mg glucose/min) is exceeded. Earlier, glucosuria was thought to be a pathological mechanism, or a marker of illness. However, one may approach this condition from a different view point. Persons with ambient hyperglycemia are at risk of endothelial dysfunction and resultant complications, due to the high levels of glucose in circulation. Kidneys try to prevent an excessive rise in blood glucose levels by glucuresis, thereby mitigating the adverse effects associated with high glucose levels. Theoretically, compounds which promote glucuresis should help to reduce circulating glycemia, manage diabetes, and prevent long-term complications.

### Dapagliflozin [^113noHHh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and thereby promotes urinary glucose excretion.

Dapagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulation of sympathetic activity, and decreased intraglomerular pressure which is believed to be mediated by increased tubuloglomerular feedback.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

General

Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin (see Figure 1). Dapagliflozin doses of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks resulted in excretion of approximately 70 grams of glucose in the urine per day at Week 12. A near maximum glucose excretion was observed at the dapagliflozin daily dosage of 20 mg. This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. After discontinuation of dapagliflozin, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg dosage.

Figure 1: Scatter Plot and Fitted Line of Change from Baseline in 24-Hour Urinary Glucose Amount versus Dapagliflozin Dose in Healthy Subjects and Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (Semi-Log Plot)

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Dapagliflozin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of QTc interval at daily doses up to 150 mg (15 times the recommended maximum dose) in a study of healthy subjects. In addition, no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval was observed following single doses of up to 500 mg (50 times the recommended maximum dose) of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects.

### Why Do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans? [^112y7HAX]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is the most advanced SGLT2 inhibitor in clinical trials. In addition, multiple other SGLT2 inhibitors are in phase II to III trials (Fig. 1). However, none of these SGLT2 inhibitors are able to inhibit > 30–50% of the filtered glucose load, despite in vitro studies indicate that 100% inhibition of the SGLT2 transporter should be achieved at the drug concentrations in humans. In this perspective, we shall examine potential explanations for this apparent paradox. Resolution of the paradox has important clinical implications with regard to the efficacy of this class of drugs and the development of more efficacious SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Glucuretic effects and renal safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113bqX1X]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the United States, the European Union and other countries. Dapagliflozin increases renal glucose excretion in an insulin-independent manner, and its mechanism of action is complementary to those of other antidiabetes medications. When used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetes medications or insulin, dapagliflozin improves glycemic measures in patients with T2DM. Dapagliflozin treatment is also associated with weight reduction and a decrease in blood pressure, both of which may be beneficial in patients with T2DM. Because of its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin has a low intrinsic propensity to cause hypoglycemia. Overall, dapagliflozin is well tolerated, with the frequency of most adverse events similar to that seen with placebo. Cases of genital infections and, in some studies, urinary tract infections have been more frequent in dapagliflozin-treated groups compared with placebo groups. In the clinical development program, more cases of newly diagnosed bladder cancer were reported for patients treated with dapagliflozin (0.17%) compared with placebo or comparator (0.03%). Although there were not enough cases to determine causality, dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a history of bladder cancer. Dapagliflozin may decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), especially in elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function. Renal function should be monitored before initiation of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m². No cardiovascular safety signals have been detected for dapagliflozin, and a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study is ongoing. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that dapagliflozin is a promising new treatment option for T2DM.

1.3 Volume depletion

SGLT2 inhibitors exert an osmotic diuretic effect through promotion of glycosuria and natriuria. When initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor, a dose reduction of any concurrent diuretics should be considered, and SGTL2 inhibitors should not be used in people with hypovolemia or unstable volume status. A pause in therapy should be considered in conditions which may cause fluid loss, such as diarrhoeal illness. There may be a higher dehydration risk among those fasting for Ramadan, for whom treatment should be tailored to an individual risk assessment. The diuretic effect may also be associated with lower urinary symptoms such as urinary frequency and nocturia.

Across the major clinical trials, volume depletion event rates are only slightly greater than with placeboand are uncommon in real‐world studies,(Table 1). The effect is expected to be present among those with and without diabetes. The risk of volume depletion appears to be reduced in those with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². This reduced risk may relate to fewer functioning kidney filtration units (nephrons) in the kidneys of people with CKD, reducing the ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to produce glycosuric and natriuretic effects within the nephrons. Alternatively, it may relate to compensatory increases in fluid intake, or to increased water reabsorption via vasopressin (anti‐diuretic hormone). In contrast, however, a real‐world study found the risk was highest in those with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², which may relate to higher rates of diuretic use or cardiac comorbidities among such populations.

### The association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors with cancer: an overview of quantitative systematic reviews [^116avcZC]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

SGLT‐2 inhibitors do not appear to be associated with an overall increased risk of cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Point estimates reported for class effects of SGLT‐2 inhibitors on the risk of any cancer event, as well as specific cancer subtypes, showed no significant association with the use of these agents. This held true regardless of whether SGLT‐2 inhibitor interventions were compared with placebo or active comparators. However, practicing clinicians do not prescribe by class, but rather by individual SGLT‐2 inhibitor agents for antihyperglycaemic management. Considering popular SGLT‐2 inhibitor agents used globally (ie canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin), most cancer‐related data collected for these individual agents also indicated there were no significant associations between their use and overall risk of any cancer event. Some individual point estimates from included reviews, specifically for canagliflozin and empagliflozin, reported a statistically significant decreased risk of gastric cancer and increased risk of bladder cancers for users of these agents, respectively. 10, 13

There are several potential reasons that could account for the statistically significant associations observed between empagliflozin use and bladder cancer. First, detection bias is a plausible explanation for this increased risk. 22 SGLT‐2 inhibitors may increase the risk of genital tract infections secondary to their mechanism of action 23, 24, 25; however, investigation into these infections (eg urinalysis) may prompt further diagnostic workup and eventual diagnosis of bladder cancers that were present before initiation of SGLT‐2 inhibitor therapy. Second, cautious interpretation is warranted as the observed association is driven by the imbalance between empagliflozin and comparator users in a very lower numbers of events. In fact, there were zero events in each comparator group for the reported significant point estimates. Third, bladder cancer pathogenesis follows an insidious course over several years for most cases, and follow‐up beyond one year was rare in both randomized and nonrandomized studies assessed in our included systematic reviews. One quantitative systematic review excluded studies that had participant follow‐up of less than one year. This review accounted for 48 cases of bladder cancer in 28 055 participants treated with SGLT‐2 inhibitors, compared to 58 cases of bladder cancer in 20 594 participants treated with placebo or active comparators. 13 Lastly, it is possible that prolonged bladder irritation due to recurrent or chronic urinary tract infections increases the risk of bladder cancer; however, the current evidence is unreliable and does not demonstrate a causal association between empagliflozin and an increased risk of bladder cancer.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: a case study in translational research [^112bagyU]. Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are the most recently approved class of diabetes drugs. Unlike other agents, SGLT2 inhibitors act on the kidney to promote urinary glucose excretion. SGLT2 inhibitors provide multiple benefits, including decreased HbA 1c, body weight, and blood pressure. These drugs have received special attention because they decrease the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and slow progression of diabetic kidney disease (1–3). Balanced against these impressive benefits, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved prescribing information describes a long list of side effects: genitourinary infections, ketoacidosis, bone fractures, amputations, acute kidney injury, perineal necrotizing fasciitis, and hyperkalemia. This review provides a physiological perspective to understanding the multiple actions of these drugs complemented by a clinical perspective toward balancing benefits and risks.

### Magnesium biology [^112CbSUK]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The mechanism of action that explains the improved Mg 2+ reabsorption in response to treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors has not been elucidated yet. It has been hypothesized that the increased Na + content in the pre-urine leads to increased activity of NKCC2 in the TAL. Consequently, paracellular Mg 2+ reabsorption would increase due to an increased transepithelial voltage potential. However, animal studies showed unchanged NKCC2 expression upon SGLT2 inhibition. Interestingly, one study showed increased TRPM6 activity in Sprague–Dawley rats treated with the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, suggesting that the increased Mg 2+ reabsorption in the DCT explains the higher serum Mg 2+ level. The mechanism by which dapagliflozin increases TRPM6 activity is subject to future studies.

### Slope of change in hbAfrom baseline with empagliflozin compared with sitagliptin or glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113KYxfp]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The observation of greater reductions in HbA 1c with increasing baseline HbA 1c is consistent with the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, which act by reducing the renal threshold for glucose spillage into the urine to values less than the normal fasting plasma glucose concentration. 9 SGLT2 inhibitors target glucose that would otherwise be reabsorbed by the kidney. Thus, it is expected that the higher the glucose concentration up till the (untreated) renal threshold for glucose, the greater the incremental excretion of glucose into the urine with SGLT2 inhibition, and, ultimately, the greater the expected decline in HbA 1c. It should be noted that the reduction in HbA 1c observed with SGLT2 inhibitors is approximately 50% of that expected based on urinary glucose excretion, likely because of an increase in endogenous glucose production 17 and increased glucose reabsorption by SGLT1, which is capable of reabsorbing up to 30%‐40% of the filtered glucose load. 7 If the increase in endogenous glucose production were to be prevented or if glucose reabsorption by SGLT1 were blocked, the decline in HbA 1c for any given starting HbA 1c would potentially be even greater with empagliflozin compared to sitagliptin or glimepiride. Further, the slope of HbA 1c reduction in other commonly used antidiabetes agents will be influenced by their mechanism of action, that is, increased insulin secretion, glucagon suppression, inhibition of endogenous glucose production or insulin sensitization, which impose physiological limits to their efficacy. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the renal threshold for glucose to well below the fasting plasma glucose concentration observed in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. 9 This may contribute to a disproportionately greater HbA 1c reduction with SGLT2 inhibitors than with other antidiabetes agents with increasing plasma glucose levels as long as GFR is not significantly reduced. Glycosuria with empagliflozin decreases with decreasing estimated GFR, 18 and in patients with type 2 diabetes who have a reduced GFR, the glucose‐lowering effect of empagliflozin is reduced. 19

These are some limitations to the present analyses. First, these were post‐hoc analyses. Second, these exploratory analyses did not include the placebo arm of Study 1; this is different from the approach of the primary analysis of the study that included placebo as the main comparator.

In conclusion, reductions in HbA 1c with increasing baseline HbA 1c are greater with empagliflozin compared with sitagliptin or glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin: finally at the latter stage of understanding? [^114tsbQo]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are a relatively new adjunctive treatment option for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Extraglycemic benefits of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition include weight and blood pressure reduction. Cherney et al. now demonstrate that these extraglycemic properties of empagliflozin are preserved despite reduced urinary glucose excretion in advancing chronic kidney disease. Limited therapeutic options for patients with type 2 diabetes in the latter stages of chronic kidney disease make empagliflozin an attractive therapeutic agent with additional cardiovascular benefits.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and external genital infection in male patients with type 2 diabetes [^111GxUSS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned about the potential risk of Fournier gangrene (FG), a severe genital infection with high mortality, associated with SGLT2Is use. Between March 2013 and May 2018, 7 cases of FG were reported among men using SGLT2Is in the US, compared with only 6 cases with other glucose-lowering drugs over more than 30 years. Numerous studies, have indicated an association between SGLT2Is and FG, although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear, possibly involving glucosuria, immunosuppression, and enhanced bacterial adhesion to the urothelium. A large US cohort studyfound an increased, but not statistically significant, hazard ratio (HR) for FG risk among patients taking SGLT2Is compared with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 0.87–3.42), which further increased when GLP-1RAs were used as the comparator (HR, 2.52; 95% CI, 0.91–6.99). Similarly, a study by Mascolo et alreported a higher FG incidence among patients with diabetes than those with heart failure taking SGLT2Is, suggesting that diabetes itself may be a key risk factor.

Moreover, concerns about genital-urinary infections including urinary tract infections (UTIs), asymptomatic bacteriuria, and nonsexually transmitted genital infections have been raised due to the potential for increased glucosuria facilitated by SGLT2Is. Studies have suggested a possible link between SGLT2Is and UTIs, including urethritis, cystitis, pyelonephritis, and, in severe cases, urosepsis. However, research addressing a specific spectrum of infections involving the external genitalia remains scarce. In male individuals, these infections require heightened attention due to hygiene challenges and limited blood and oxygen supply in this area, and often necessitate surgical intervention for definitive treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of male external genital infections (MEGIs) associated with SGLT2Is, utilizing a nationwide claims database.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibition: therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112kmUcm]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Results from randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that the risk of microvascular complications can be reduced by intensive glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, only about half of patients with diagnosed diabetes achieve recommended glycaemic goals. New therapies with complementary mechanisms of action that are independent of insulin secretion or action may provide additional therapeutic options to enable patients to achieve glycaemic control. The kidney plays an important role in glucose homeostasis, primarily by the reabsorption of filtered glucose. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), located in the proximal convoluted tubule, is responsible for the majority of glucose reabsorption by the kidney. SGLT2 inhibitors offer a novel approach to treat T2DM and reduce hyperglycaemia by increasing urinary excretion of glucose. Dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor recently approved in Europe for the treatment of T2DM, improves glycaemic control in patients with T2DM when used as monotherapy or when added to other diabetes medications, such as metformin, sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, and insulin. As a class, SGLT2 inhibitors are well tolerated and have a low propensity to cause hypoglycaemia. An increase in signs, symptoms, and other events suggestive of genital and, in some studies, urinary tract infections has been reported with SGLT2 inhibitors. Results from ongoing and future clinical trials will help define the role for this new class of investigational compounds, with its unique mechanism of action, as a treatment option for reducing hyperglycaemia in patients with T2DM.

### Why Do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans? [^115KSLcv]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a novel and promising treatment for diabetes under late-stage clinical development. It generally is accepted that SGLT2 mediates 90% of renal glucose reabsorption. However, SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical development inhibit only 30–50% of the filtered glucose load. Why are they unable to inhibit 90% of glucose reabsorption in humans? We will try to provide an explanation to this puzzle in this perspective analysis of the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical trials and examine possible mechanisms and molecular properties that may be responsible.

### Practical approach to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes [^1153y7pr]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Physiological Action of SGLT2 Inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors treat T2DM by selectively blocking SGLT2, a high capacity and low affinity glucose transporter expressed mainly in the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal tubule, inhibiting glucose reabsorption, lowering the renal glucose threshold, and inducing urinary glucose elimination (Fig. 1). SGLT2 activity seems to be upregulated in patients with T2DM, thereby increasing the renal glucose threshold and exacerbating the tendency to hyperglycemia. Inhibiting SGLT2 activity is accompanied by glycosuria and osmotic diuresis. Despite the fact that SGLT2 activity accounts for up to 90% of renal glucose reabsorption, in clinical practice SGLT2 inhibitors only block 30–50% of the filtered glucose load, even at higher doses. An excess of 40–80 g of glucose and 200–600 mL urine per day are reported with the chronic administration of SGLT2 inhibitors. Dosing and glomerular filtration rate cutoffs for SGLT2 inhibitors are shown in Table 1. The therapeutically induced glycosuria and osmotic diuresis lead to reductions in plasma glucose, body weight, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These collateral effects are potentially beneficial because they may reduce the development of microvascular and macrovascular complications. On the basis of the efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second- or third-line agents for the management of patients with T2DM. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.

### The renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and a mini-review of the literature [^111Ksoxf]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new and promising class of antidiabetic agents which target renal tubular glucose reabsorption. Their action is based on the blockage of SGLT2 sodium-glucose cotransporters that are located at the luminal membrane of tubular cells of the proximal convoluted tubule, inducing glucosuria. It has been proven that they significantly reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), along with fasting and postprandial plasma glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The glucosuria-induced caloric loss as well as the osmotic diuresis significantly decrease body weight and blood pressure, respectively. Given that SGLT2 inhibitors do not interfere with insulin action and secretion, their efficacy is sustained despite the progressive β-cell failure in T2DM. They are well tolerated, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. Their most frequent adverse events are minor: genital and urinal tract infections. Recently, it was demonstrated that empagliflozin presents a significant cardioprotective effect. Although the SGLT2 inhibitors' efficacy is affected by renal function, new data have been presented that some SGLT2 inhibitors, even in mild and moderate renal impairment, induce significant HbA1c reduction. Moreover, recent data indicate that SGLT2 inhibition has a beneficial renoprotective effect. The role of this review paper is to explore the current evidence on the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Safety of sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors [^113wcbpx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have a well-defined safety profile based on data obtained from numerous clinical trials, including cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) and postmarketing pharmacovigilance reporting. Adverse events including risk of genital mycotic infection and volume depletion-related events are consistent with the mechanism of action of this drug class. However, several emergent (albeit infrequent) serious safety issues have also been reported. In their respective CVOTs, the proportion of patients with reported diabetic ketoacidosis was similar in empagliflozin or canagliflozin compared with their placebo groups, but it was higher for dapagliflozin. Canagliflozin may be associated with an increased risk of bone fracture and lower limb amputation; however, data are inconclusive. There is no evidence linking SGLT2 inhibitors with an increased risk of cancer, but these agents, particularly dapagliflozin, should be used with caution in patients with hematuria or a history of bladder cancer. Postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury have occurred in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, and cases identified in recent CVOTs occurred with similar frequency in SGLT2 inhibitor and placebo groups. Common adverse events associated with SGLT2 inhibitors (such as genital infections or volume depletion) are generally mild and manageable by patients or by primary care physicians, and the risk of rare events (such as ketoacidosis) can be minimized by appropriate patient selection and early recognition of symptoms. When selecting treatment, it is important that clinicians weigh the known risks of SGLT2 inhibitors against their proven benefits, including the reduction of adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

Glucosuria and urinary symptoms — Glucosuria can occur when blood glucose levels are elevated, including in undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and in those taking sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes mellitus; SGLT2 inhibitors work by blocking glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule, decreasing blood glucose and facilitating urinary excretion. Glucosuria potentially contributes to urinary symptoms via urothelial irritation and osmotic diuresis, and diabetes-related changes in detrusor muscle pathophysiology, neuronal impairment, and urothelial dysfunction, along with hyperglycemia-associated increased thirst and polydipsia, can further drive urinary symptoms.

### Dapagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Xigduo) [^112wW9dp]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Dapagliflozin

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose, and thereby promotes urinary glucose excretion.

Dapagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulation of sympathetic activity, and decreased intraglomerular pressure which is believed to be mediated by increased tubuloglomerular feedback.

Metformin HCl

Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

General

Dapagliflozin

Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin (see Figure 1). Dapagliflozin doses of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks resulted in excretion of approximately 70 grams of glucose in the urine per day. A near maximum glucose excretion was observed at the dapagliflozin daily dosage of 20 mg. This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. After discontinuation of dapagliflozin, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg dosage.

Figure 1: Scatter Plot and Fitted Line of Change from Baseline in 24-Hour Urinary Glucose Amount versus Dapagliflozin Dose in Healthy Subjects and Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (Semi-Log Plot)

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Dapagliflozin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of QTc interval at daily doses up to 150 mg (15-times the recommended maximum dose) in a study of healthy subjects. In addition, no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval was observed following single doses of up to 500 mg (50-times the recommended maximum dose) of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects.

### Novel hypothesis to explain why SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of filtered glucose load in humans [^1171GQRT]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

FIG. 1.
Renal glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule in NGT individuals under physiologic conditions.

Because SGLT2 is responsible for > 80% reabsorption of the filtered glucose load, one would expect that inhibiting SGLT2 will produce massive glucosuria (> 80% of filtered glucose load or > 145 g glucose/24 h). All SGLT2 inhibitors produce a dose-dependent glucosuria. However, the maximal amount of glucose excreted in the urine is far lower than that taken up by SGLT2 in normal glucose tolerant (NGT) individuals and does not exceed 35–40% of the filtered glucose load. For example, 20 mg dapagliflozin produced ∼55 g urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in 24 h in NGT individuals compared with ∼145 g/day taken up by SGLT2 under physiologic conditions. Moreover, further increase in dapagliflozin dose does not further increase UGE. Thus, 500 mg dapagliflozin caused 58 g UGE/24 h. Similar observations have been reported with other SGLT2 inhibitors currently under clinical development. Since, under physiologic conditions, SGLT2 is responsible for > 80% of glucose reabsorption (> 145 g/24 h), it is anticipated that specific SGLT2 inhibitors will produce > 145 g of glucosuria in NGT individuals. So, why then do all SGLT2 inhibitors produce only ∼50–60 g glucosuria, which represents < 50% of the glucose-filtered load?

Several explanations have been proposed to explain this paradox. However, none are completely satisfactory.

### Why Do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans? [^116q6fBg]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

PUZZLE ABOUT SGLT2 INHIBITORS

In healthy nondiabetic humans, ∼160–180 g of plasma glucose is filtered daily (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] = 180 L/day × plasma glucose = 900–1000 mg/L), and essentially all of the filtered glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule of the kidneys. It is generally believed that SGLT2 reabsorbs 80–90% of the filtered glucose load. However, SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical development induce a maximum of 50–80 g of urinary glucose excretion (UGE) per day (i.e. only 30–50% of the filtered glucose load) in healthy volunteers. Some SGLT2 inhibitors cause a maximum daily UGE at a low dose and cannot augment UGE even with a > 10-fold increase in dose. For example, dapagliflozin produces a maximum UGE of ∼60 g/day at a dose of 20 mg/day in healthy human volunteers, and UGE remains at 60 g/day when the dose is increased to 500 mg/day. Why can these inhibitors not block 90% of the filtered glucose load in humans?

A number of explanations have been proposed to explain this paradox (Table 1, explanations 1–5), but they are insufficient to account for many of the data and observations. In this perspective, we will analyze these explanations and attempt to provide a more satisfactory solution to this puzzle. We will start by examining the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) characteristics of SGLT2 inhibitors, which are varied and very unique.

### SGLT inhibitors in management of diabetes [^115TSnSg]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

The two main sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs), SGLT1 and SGLT2, provide new therapeutic targets to reduce hyperglycaemia in patients with diabetes. SGLT1 enables the small intestine to absorb glucose and contributes to the reabsorption of glucose filtered by the kidney. SGLT2 is responsible for reabsorption of most of the glucose filtered by the kidney. Inhibitors with varying specificities for these transporters (eg, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin) can slow the rate of intestinal glucose absorption and increase the renal elimination of glucose into the urine. Results of randomised clinical trials have shown the blood glucose-lowering efficacy of SGLT inhibitors in type 2 diabetes when administered as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering therapies including insulin. Increased renal glucose elimination also assists weight loss and could help to reduce blood pressure. Effective SGLT2 inhibition needs adequate glomerular filtration and might increase risk of urinary tract and genital infection, and excessive inhibition of SGLT1 can cause gastro-intestinal symptoms. However, the insulin-independent mechanism of action of SGLT inhibitors seems to offer durable glucose-lowering efficacy with low risk of clinically significant hypoglycaemia at any stage in the natural history of type 2 diabetes. SGLT inhibition might also be considered in conjunction with insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes.

### Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors as a new treatment for diabetes mellitus [^112MFfu3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) expressed in the proximal renal tubules accounts for about 90% of the reabsorption of glucose from tubular fluid. Genetic defects of SGLT2 result in a benign familial renal glucosuria. Pharmacological agents that block SGLT2 are being tested as potential treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Evidence Acquisition

A Pubmed search was used to identify all relevant articles on the physiology of SGLTs as well as published preclinical and clinical experimental studies with SGLT2 inhibitors; a reference search of all retrieved articles was also undertaken.

Evidence Synthesis

SGLT2 is almost exclusively expressed in the proximal renal tubules. Preclinical studies with selective SLGT2 inhibitors show dose-dependent glucosuria and lowering of blood glucose in models of type 2 diabetes. Preliminary clinical studies of up to 3-month duration show dose-dependent lowering of glycosylated hemoglobin up to 0.9% along with modest weight loss. Side effects include an increase in genital fungal infection compared to placebo, increased urine volume (300–400 ml/24 h), and evidence of volume depletion consistent with mild diuretic effect.

Conclusion

SGLT2 inhibitors are showing promise as a useful addition to the current therapeutic options in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results of ongoing phase III clinical trials are awaited and will determine whether the risk-benefit ratio will allow approval of this new class of drug for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Insights into SGLT2 inhibitor treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy: focus on the mechanisms [^112H64P2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Current challenges and future therapeutic strategies

SGLT2i are safe, well-tolerated drugs. They can improve all glycaemic parameters and have some additional benefits, such as weight and BP reductions, low risk of hypoglycaemia, improvements in β-cell function and insulin sensitivity, and reductions in macrovascular and microvascular events. However, there are still many challenges to be solved in clinical practice. These challenges include but are not limited to decreased blood pressure, urinary and genital tract infections, amputation, ketoacidosis, kidney injury and fracture. Reduced blood pressure in SGLT2i users is understandable, which is caused by insufficient circulating blood volume due to osmotic diuresis. Meta-analyses showed that SGLT2i induced an average reduction in systolic/diastolic BP of 3.62/1.70 mmHg in 24 h ambulatory blood pressure. However, the use of SGLT2i alone was very unlikely to cause postural hypotension. The use of SGLT2i has been reported to increase the risk of urinary and genital tract infections by more than 3 times. The main reason may be related to the increase in urine sugar concentration. As previously mentioned, canagliflozin caused twice the risk of lower limb amputation compared to the control, possibly due to the inhibition of angiogenesis. An increased incidence of ketoacidosis has been reported in SGLT2i users. The prevailing belief is that this outcome is associated with glucose loss, increased hyperglucagonemia, constant or decreased insulin levels, mild infections, and decreased blood volume. This mechanism may induce euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis. The evidence that SGLT2i may cause acute renal injury is available, and the associated factors include circulatory failure, increased uric acid in urine, and multiple drug use. However, this treatment is not recognized as an inducer of acute renal injury, and several clinical trials have confirmed that SGLT2i have positive effects on kidney function. In assessing the increased risk of fracture associated with SGLT2i, canagliflozin was directly associated with bone mineral density loss, especially in the hip. Dapagliflozin was associated with fractures unrelated to osteoporosis, mainly due to an increased risk of falls caused by fluctuations in blood pressure and hypoglycaemia caused by the combined use of hypoglycaemic drugs. However, empagliflozin was considered safe. In addition, there are still some unresolved questions. The limited clinic evidence showed that SGLT2i improves the concentration of circulating proteins in plasma, serum or urine that are known to have beneficial effects on the heart. These proteins include insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1, transferrin receptor protein 1, erythropoietin and so on. But the exact target and signalling pathway of SGLT2i in clinic treatment are still not fully understood. The optimal dose of SGLT2i for diabetic cardiomyopathy and whether this dose is consistent with the dose for diabetic treatment still need experimental verification.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors

Renal tubule regulation of glucose reabsorption by the kidney in the non-diabetic individual is shown in Fig. 1. Inhibition of SGLT2 results in a lowering of the threshold for renal glucose excretion and an increase in urinary glucose excretion, with an associated reduction in plasma glucose levels and the potential to decrease glucose toxicity with chronic administration. The action of SGLT2 inhibitors is glucose-dependent, becoming negligible when plasma glucose concentration drops below 90/mg/dL, so the risk of hypoglycemia is lower than with insulin-dependent antidiabetic drugs.

Evidence suggests that glycosuria induced by SGLT2 inhibitors can also significantly improve β-cell insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, associated with a reduction in plasma glucose concentration. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors as a class offer the clinical benefits of promoting body weight loss and produce a modest reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

The mechanisms of action of the blood pressure lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are not fully understood. However, they are likely due to a mild osmotic diuretic effect in association with reductions in body weight and increased hematocrit, although it is possible that there may be a contribution from local inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system secondary to enhancement of sodium delivery to the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Orthostatic hypotension is not increased with SGLT2 inhibitors.

Weight loss associated with SGLT2 inhibitors is biphasic, with an initial reduction in total body weight which can be attributed to fluid loss and a subsequent gradual continuous reduction resulting from increased urinary glucose excretion with associated loss of calories. Body composition assessment using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging analysis in patients with T2DM treated with dapagliflozin showed that the reduction in total body weight was predominantly via reductions in total body fat mass, visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue volume.

### Sodium glucose transporter protein 2 inhibitors: focusing on the kidney to treat type 2 diabetes [^1124E6RR]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide. Treatment of T2DM continues to present challenges, with a significant proportion of patients failing to achieve and maintain glycemic targets. Despite the availability of many oral antidiabetic agents, therapeutic efficacy is also offset by side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutic agents with an improved benefit-risk profile continues. In the following review we focus on a novel class of oral antidiabetic drugs, the sodium glucose transporter protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which have unique characteristics. SGLT2 inhibitors focus on the kidney as a therapeutic target, where they inhibit the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule, causing an increase in urinary glucose excretion. Doing this, they reduce plasma glucose independently of the β-cell function of the pancreas. SGLT2 inhibitors are effective at lowering hemoglobin A1c, but also induce weight loss and reduce blood pressure, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. In general, the SGLT2 inhibitors are well tolerated, with the most frequent adverse events being mild urinal and genital infections. Since their primary site of effect is the kidney, these drugs are less effective in patients with impaired kidney function but evidence is emerging that these drugs may also have a protective effect against diabetic nephropathy. This review focuses on the most extensively studied SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin. Dapagliflozin and canagliflozin have already been approved for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration. The European Medicines Agency has accepted all three drugs for marketing.

### Empagliflozin and decreased risk of nephrolithiasis: a potential new role for SGLT2 inhibition? [^112X98Tg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Recently published data indicate that SGLT2 inhibitor therapy is associated with a reduced risk of nephrolithiasis, at least in comparison to GLP-1 RA therapy. We confirm these findings in a large dataset encompassing more than 15 000 T2D patients randomized to either empagliflozin or placebo, usually against a backdrop of a variety of glucose-lowering therapies.

About 75% to 80% of all renal stones are composed of calcium salts, commonly calcium oxalate and less frequently calcium phosphate, and the remaining 20% to 25% stones are composed of uric acid, struvite, or cystine. Abnormal urinary concentrations of lithogenic substances along with decreased urinary flow promotes crystallization of stone-forming salts. One proposed mechanism for decreased stone risk with SGLT2 inhibitors is increased urinary flow rate due to osmotic diuresis from glucosuria and natriuresis and consequent changes in urinary concentrations of lithogenic substances. Urine volume increases by 200 to 400 mL/day at the initiation of treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and is most likely accompanied by a commensurate increase in oral fluid intake. While natriuresis appears to be transient and quickly reversed by compensatory mechanisms, glucosuria, and therefore an osmotic diuresis, persists while on treatment even when the blood glucose concentrations are in the normal range.

### The effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on body composition in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a narrative review [^114fR3m2]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Body Composition

Changes in body composition influence the risk of developing T2DM through a variety of mechanisms such as insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction, and de novo lipogenesis in ectopic tissues. There is also a bidirectional interplay between T2DM and loss of muscle mass giving rise to a vicious cycle. Sarcopenia, characterized as progressive age-related muscle mass and function decline, is more common in people with T2DM and is influenced mainly by insulin resistance. Sarcopenia contributes to poor glycemic control and increased risk of adverse outcomes such as frailty, particularly among the aging population.

Impaired insulin action in skeletal muscle disrupts multiple pathways, thereby promoting protein degradation and muscle catabolism, while also hampering protein synthesis. A chronic inflammatory state, oxidative stress, increased reactive oxygen species, and accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AEGs) also exacerbate muscle loss in people with diabetes.

Effective weight management and improving body composition are crucial in the management of T2DM and achieving better glycemic control while minimizing diabetes-related chronic complications. Current guidelines emphasize on the importance of sustained weight loss and muscle mass restoration through individualized therapeutic approaches, dietary modifications, and regular exercise.

Mechanism of Action of Sodium–Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors on Body Composition

SGLT2 inhibitors reduce renal glucose reabsorption, leading to decreased blood glucose levels independent of insulin release. In a healthy adult, almost all of the filtered glucose is reabsorbed, primarily by SGLT2 proteins. These proteins are expressed in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidneys and actively transport glucose into the interstitium. In individuals with diabetes, SGLT2 proteins are paradoxically upregulated, resulting in excessive glucose reabsorption despite high blood glucose levels. Inhibition of SGLT2 transporters promotes renal glucose excretion and improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Additional metabolic benefits include an early diuretic effect and calorie loss in the urine, causing a significant weight reduction. Despite sustained urinary glucose excretion, compensatory adaptation mechanisms attenuate excess water and calorie loss associated with long-term SGLT2 inhibition. These mechanisms include upregulation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, increased appetite, and changes in energy expenditure/substrate utilization.

SGLT2 inhibitors also induce gluconeogenesis while enhancing the uptake, utilization, and catabolism of fatty acids, leading to various effects on lipid metabolism, including glucagon release, ketogenesis, and free fatty acid oxidation and mobilization. Consequently, SGLT2 inhibitors are linked to alterations in body composition even during prolonged use.

### Empagliflozin induces transient diuresis without changing long-term overall fluid balance in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^1151yXrN]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Empagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, ameliorates hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) by inducing sustained glucosuria. Empagliflozin treatment was previously associated with a transient increase in 24-h urine volume in Caucasian patients with T2D, however comparable evidence in Japanese T2D individuals is scarce. We therefore assessed acute and chronic changes in 24-h urine volume and fluid intake with empagliflozin in Japanese patients with T2D.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multiple-dose, 4-week trial, 100 Japanese patients with T2D were randomized to receive either 1, 5, 10, or 25 mg empagliflozin or placebo once-daily. Changes from baseline in 24-h urine volume and fluid intake were assessed at days 1, 27, and 28 after the initiation of empagliflozin.

Results

The 24-h urine volume and fluid intake were comparable across all treatment groups at baseline. Patients treated with either 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin (i.e., the licensed doses in Japan) showed a significant increase in 24-h urine volume compared to placebo at day 1 (mean change from baseline: + 0.83, + 1.08, and + 0.29 L/day in the empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg groups and the placebo group, respectively; both p < 0.001 vs. placebo). However, 24-h urine volume levels in the empagliflozin groups were comparable to placebo at day 27 and 28 (differences vs placebo < 0.1 L/day; p > 0.05). The 24-h fluid intake was comparable across all study groups throughout the entire study period. No events consistent with dehydration were reported during empagliflozin treatment.

Conclusion

Treatment initiation with empagliflozin in Japanese patients with T2D was associated with transient diuresis; however, overall urine volume returned towards baseline levels within 4 weeks of treatment. These findings are consistent with a physiological, adaptive mechanism of the kidney to maintain overall body fluid balance in response to treatment initiation with a SGLT2 inhibitor.

### A trial to evaluate the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (DAPA-HF) [^113bsaKm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Several aspects of the design of DAPA‐HF merit discussion.

Study drug and dose

Dapagliflozin is a once daily, selective, competitive, reversible inhibitor of SGLT2 with similar in vitro potency to canagliflozin and empagliflozin. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 It causes a dose‐dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion with a near maximum effect at 10 mg daily and has no clinically important drug interactions. In common with other SGLT2 inhibitors, dapagliflozin causes small reductions in blood pressure and weight, a small initial increase in creatinine (although long‐term treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be reno‐protective in type 2 diabetes – see below), as well as an increase in the risk of genital mycotic infection.

Why an SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction?

As described in the introduction, canagliflozin, empagliflozin and dapagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalization among patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease/cardiovascular risk factors, with an apparently similar treatment effect in the small subgroup (∼10–15%) of patients in each trial with baseline heart failure of undetermined phenotype, as illustrated in a meta‐analysis of EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE–TIMI 58. 7, 8, 9, 23 Examination of the event curves in these trials shows a reduction in heart failure hospitalization within weeks to months of randomization. The rapidity of onset of the benefit in the three trials is not consistent with traditional views about the mechanisms and time course of cardiovascular protection accruing with conventional glucose‐lowering therapies. 9, 10, 11, 12, 24, 25, 26, 27 Consequently, numerous additional beneficial mechanisms have been proposed, ranging from diuretic–haemodynamic actions, through effects on cardiac metabolism, adipokines, myocardial fibrosis, uric acid, myocyte ion channels and kidney function. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 A recent mediation analysis suggested that the rise in haematocrit concentration following SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is related to benefit, supporting a diuretic action, and mathematical modelling suggests SGLT2 inhibitors may remove fluid preferentially from the interstitial space and cause less intravascular volume contraction. 27, 28 Other data suggest SGLT2 inhibition can lead to ketogenesis and an increase in β‐hydroxybutyrate, which provides an alternative and more efficient substrate for myocardial energy generation.

### Dapagliflozin reduces albuminuria in patients with diabetes and hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin blockers [^113PTcLm]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

As SGLT2 inhibition has been shown to increase urinary glucose excretion and reduce eGFR, there have been concerns around renal safety. There have also been concerns of unfavourable volume loss attributable to the diuretic action. In the present analysis in patients with albuminuria and a renal function mainly within CKD stage 1 and 2 categories, there were numerically more laboratory‐associated AEs related to renal function with dapagliflozin than with placebo, mainly as a result of increases in blood creatinine. This was an expected finding, given dapagliflozin's mode of action. Importantly, none of these events was classified as serious by the investigators. There was also no increase in the proportion of patients with more pronounced creatinine increases (≥ 1.5× baseline values) as compared with placebo. The proportion of patients with a marked increase in serum potassium was also similar to placebo. Although there were more patients with potentially volume‐related AEs as compared with placebo, none of these AEs was classified as serious. As observed in previous studies, more patients receiving dapagliflozin experienced a urinary tract infection, although the total number was low. Overall, this post hoc analysis indicated a beneficial renal profile in the studied CKD categories.

The present study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration. First, this was a post hoc analysis of two randomized controlled trials, and the original studies were not designed to assess the effect of dapagliflozin on renal variables. The results can therefore only be interpreted as hypothesis‐generating. The study did not include an active comparator to prospectively determine whether the albuminuria‐lowering effects were independent of glucose or blood pressure control. A study design with two additional treatment arms including a sulphonylurea derivative to control HbA1c and hydrochlorothiazide to control blood pressure could add to the interpretation. UACR was measured in a single spot urine sample. It is known that the day‐to‐day variability in spot urine samples is larger than first morning void samples. The use of single spot urine samples in the present study may have resulted in a lower precision (larger standard error) of the treatment effect compared with when first morning void samples were used; however, despite the use of single spot urine samples, a clear and highly significant treatment effect could still be detected. Finally, renal blood flow and filtration fraction were not measured to determine with 'gold‐standard' techniques the effect of dapagliflozin on intraglomerular pressure. The lack of measured GFR and use of eGFR, which is less accurate, may explain why the effect of dapagliflozin on albuminuria was not mediated by changes in GFR.

### Efficacy, safety and regulatory status of SGLT2 inhibitors: focus on canagliflozin [^112od9JT]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

SGLT2 inhibitors are a promising new class of antidiabetic drugs currently approved in Europe, the US and Japan. They allow weight-reducing and effective glycaemic control combined with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. The medication can be used in any stage of the disease independently of existing co-medications. Furthermore, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in addition to insulin therapy in type 1 diabetic patients is conceivable, for example, to improve their glycaemic profile and avoid hyperglycaemia. However, whether SGLT2 inhibitor therapy also improves the clinical consequences of diabetes, such as micro- or macrovascular late complications, cannot be answered at present owing to immature clinical data, and provides some uncertainty of this class of drugs. Caution with these drugs should be exercised in elderly patients (tendency to dehydration and urinary-, genital infections), patients with recurrent urinary tract or genital infections and patients with reduced renal function (reduced efficacy).

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115kAGDZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in older adults — SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HbA1c by ~0.8%, can reduce weight, and do not cause hypoglycemia; empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to decrease major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure, and the progression of CKD; these compounds cause an obligate increase in urine volume and an increase in urogenital candida infections, and because adverse effects related to volume depletion were more frequent in older patients treated with canagliflozin, recommendations limit the dosage to 100 mg/d in such patients.

### Rationale, design and baseline characteristics of a 4-year (208-week) phase III trial of empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, versus glimepiride as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with insufficient glycemic control [^115LhrtB]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor

Empagliflozin is a potent and selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor in development for the treatment of T2DM. SGLT2, found in the proximal tubule of the nephron, is responsible for the reabsorption of ~90% of the glucose filtered through the kidneys. By blocking SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal glucose reabsorption, leading to excretion of glucose in the urine, thus reducing hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM. In Phase II and III studies, empagliflozin improved glycemic control in patients with T2DM when used as monotherapy or as add-on therapy. In Phase III studies, treatment with empagliflozin was also associated with mean placebo-corrected reductions in body weight of 1.6 kg to 2.9 kg over 24 to 78 weeks, likely due to the loss of calories (glucose) in the urine. Further empagliflozin was associated with mean placebo-corrected reductions in systolic blood pressure of 2.1 mmHg to 4.8 mmHg over 24 to 78 weeks; this may be due to a mild osmotic diuretic effect associated with urinary glucose excretion.

Empagliflozin is well tolerated in patients with T2DM. As the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors is independent of the action of insulin, empagliflozin is associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia. It is tempting to speculate that the insulin-independent mechanism of action of empagliflozin may preserve beta-cell function and provide better durability of glycemic control than SUs. In an 8-week study in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats, an animal model of T2DM, treatment with empagliflozin, but not with the SU glibenclamide, preserved beta-cell mass, increased insulin levels, and improved glycemic control. Furthermore, due to its body weight and blood pressure lowering properties, in addition to its effects on glycemic control, treatment with empagliflozin may have a beneficial effect on CV risk. A large dedicated CV outcome study is underway to determine the effect of empagliflozin on CV endpoints (NCT01131676).

### Effects of dapagliflozin on urinary metabolites in people with type 2 diabetes [^1151RSN6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the effects of the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin on a pre-specified panel of 13 urinary metabolites linked to mitochondrial metabolism in people with type 2 diabetes and elevated urine albumin levels.

Materials and Methods

Urine and plasma samples were used from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 31 people with type 2 diabetes, with an albumin:creatinine ratio > 100mg/g, and who were on a stable dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. Dapagliflozin or placebo treatment periods each lasted 6 weeks, with a 6-week washout period in between. Urinary and plasma metabolites were quantified by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry, corrected for creatinine level, and then combined into a single-valued urinary metabolite index. Fractional excretion of the metabolites was calculated.

Results

All 13 urinary metabolites were detectable. After 6 weeks of dapagliflozin therapy, nine of the 13 metabolites were significantly increased from baseline. The urinary metabolite index increased by 42% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.5 to 85.6; p = 0.01) with placebo versus 121% (95% CI 69 to 189; P < .001) with dapaglifozin. The placebo-adjusted effect was 56% (95% CI 11 to 118; p = 0.012). In plasma, seven of the 13 metabolites were detectable, and none was modified by dapagliflozin.

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin significantly increased a panel of urinary metabolites previously linked to mitochondrial metabolism. These data support the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibitors improve mitochondrial function, and improvements in mitochondrial function could be a mechanism for kidney protection. Future studies with longer treatment duration and clinical outcomes are needed to confirm the clinical impact of these findings.

### Sodium glucose Co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: targeting the kidney to improve glycemic control in diabetes mellitus [^117Hj4wc]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

UTI events after 24 weeks were reported in 8.3–10.3% of empagliflozin patients versus 8.0% of those on placebo, and the rates of genital infection events were 2.3–2.7% for empagliflozin and 0.9% for placebo. A pooled analysis of safety data from four 24-week phase 3 trials (n = 2,477) examined the effect of empagliflozin on UTIs and genital infections. The percentage of patients with events consistent with a UTI was similar across all groups (7.5% and 9.3% for empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, vs. 8.2% for placebo); however, more patients receiving empagliflozin reported events consistent with genital infection (4.2% and 3.6% for empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, vs. 0.7% for placebo). Both types of event were more common in women than in men, and were more common in patients with a history of UTI or genital infection. Nevertheless, of those who reported events consistent with UTI or genital infection, most experienced only one episode; the episodes were generally mild in severity, and very few led to study discontinuation [4 cases of UTI (placebo: 1 case; empagliflozin: 2 cases, 10 mg and 1 case, 25 mg); 3 cases of genital infection (empagliflozin: 1 case, 10 mg; 2 cases, 25 mg)].

### Diabetes and gout: another role for SGLT2 inhibitors? [^113DdgGT]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Thus, having emerged as agents to manage T2DM, particularly in people who are overweight, SGLT2 inhibitors have recently expanded their indications to include heart failure and CKD for people with or without diabetes. Because the lowering of serum urate by SGLT2 inhibitors is independent of existing treatments for hyperuricaemia and additive to such treatments, SGLT2 inhibitors offer an extra resource for the management of hyperuricaemia and symptomatic gout. Moreover, the opportunity for improved long-term control of serum urate is anticipated to further reduce the risk of CV and renal disease associated with hyperuricaemia. Also, the independent cardiorenal protection provided by an SGLT2 inhibitor should afford additional health gains for individuals with hyperuricaemic gout.

### Why Do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans? [^114pTJd6]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The SGLT2 inhibitors in human clinical trials have good efficacy, but they do not inhibit > 30–50% of the filtered glucose load. Based upon their PK/PD relationship, we postulate that their mechanism of action is related to secretion and/or active reabsorption in the proximal tubule and slow off rate from the SGLT2 target. Renal micropuncture studies with radiolabeled SGLT2 inhibitors and comparison of drug radioactivity in the glomerular filtrate and proximal tubule will help to define the relative contributions of tubular secretion and/or reabsorption versus glomerular filtration in establishing the drug concentration at the site of the SGLT2 transporters in the proximal tubule. A better understanding of the renal handling of the SGLT2 inhibitors will help to develop more effective medications that are capable of inhibiting a greater percentage of filtered glucose load and causing a greater reduction in HbA 1c.

### Novel hypothesis to explain why SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of filtered glucose load in humans [^117AV2Hf]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) are a novel class of antidiabetes drugs, and members of this class are under various stages of clinical development for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is widely accepted that SGLT2 is responsible for > 80% of the reabsorption of the renal filtered glucose load. However, maximal doses of SGLT2 inhibitors fail to inhibit > 50% of the filtered glucose load. Because the clinical efficacy of this group of drugs is entirely dependent on the amount of glucosuria produced, it is important to understand why SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit < 50% of the filtered glucose load. In this Perspective, we provide a novel hypothesis that explains this apparent puzzle and discuss some of the clinical implications inherent in this hypothesis.

### A new class of drug for the management of type 2 diabetes: sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitors:' glucuretics' [^112s8h5j]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes is a common, chronic disease with a prevalence that is increasing at epidemic proportions. Management involves advice on lifestyle changes, oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents and/or insulin. The kidneys play a major role in the regulation of glucose, re-absorbing 99% of the plasma glucose filtered through the renal glomeruli tubules. The glucose transporter, SGLT2, which is found primarily in the S1 segment of the proximal renal tubule accounts for 90% of glucose re-absorption. Competitive inhibition of SGLT2 induces glucosuria in a dose dependent manner and appears to have beneficial effects on glucose regulation in individuals with type 2 diabetes. O-glucoside phlorozin is the model substance for SGLT2 inhibitors: various O-, C-, N- and S-glucosides with varying affinity and specificity have been synthesised.

Aims

The aim of this review is to describe the background, the mechanism of action and the possible role for sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes.

Materials and Methods

Databases, including MEDLINE, COCHRANE, EMBASE and EBM reviews were searched for literature relating to sodium glucose transport inhibitors and improvements in glycaemic control in patients with diabetes.

Results

The data suggest that sodium glucose transport inhibitors significantly improve glycaemic control by increasing glucosuria. Some studies described significant reductions in weight and improvement in blood pressure. The most common side effect was infection involving the urinary and genital tracts.

Conclusions

Sodium glucose co-transport inhibitors appear to be an effective line of treatment, well tolerated and could be a further drug class in the armamentarium available for the management of type 2 diabetes.

### The sweet spot: heart failure prevention with SGLT2 inhibitors [^116LgPYj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel class of medications that reduce plasma glucose concentrations through an insulin-independent mechanism of increased urinary glucose excretion, with concomitant natriuresis and diuresis. Clinical outcomes trials with SGLT2 inhibitors revealed a cardioprotective benefit among patients with diabetes mellitus, with a consistent reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. As such, the 2018 updated US and European treatment guidelines for diabetes mellitus incorporated SGLT2 inhibitors as second-line glucose-lowering agents after metformin. Although well tolerated, there are known adverse effects with SGLT2 inhibitors that require clinical monitoring, such as genital mycotic infections, diabetic ketoacidosis, volume depletion particularly in the setting of concomitant diuretic use, and lower limb amputations with canagliflozin. Ongoing clinical trials will uncover the potential benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with prevalent heart failure with or without diabetes mellitus.

### SGLT2 inhibition and uric acid excretion in patients with type 2 diabetes and normal kidney function [^115GV3SK]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor-induced uric acid lowering may contribute to kidney-protective effects of the drug class in people with type 2 diabetes. This study investigates mechanisms of plasma uric acid lowering by SGLT2 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes with a focus on urate transporter 1.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted an analysis of two randomized clinical trials. First, in the Renoprotective Effects of Dapagliflozin in Type 2 Diabetes study, 44 people with type 2 diabetes were randomized to dapagliflozin or gliclazide for 12 weeks. Plasma uric acid, fractional uric acid excretion, and hemodynamic kidney function were measured in the fasted state and during clamped euglycemia or hyperglycemia. Second, in the Uric Acid Excretion study, ten people with type 2 diabetes received 1 week of empagliflozin, urate transporter 1 blocker benzbromarone, or their combination in a crossover design, and effects on plasma uric acid, fractional uric acid excretion, and 24-hour uric acid excretion were measured.

Results

In the Renoprotective Effects of Dapagliflozin in Type 2 Diabetes study, compared with the fasted state (5.3 ± 1.1 mg/dl), acute hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia significantly reduced plasma uric acid by 0.2 ± 0.3 and 0.4 ± 0.3 mg/dl (both P < 0.001) while increasing fractional uric acid excretion (by 3.2% ± 3.1% and 8.9% ± 4.5%, respectively; both P < 0.001). Dapagliflozin reduced plasma uric acid by 0.8 ± 0.8 during fasting, 1.0 ± 1.0 in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic state, and 0.8 ± 0.7 mg/dl during hyperglycemic conditions (P < 0.001), respectively, whereas fractional uric acid excretion in 24-hour urine increased by 3.0% ± 2.1% (P < 0.001) and 2.6% ± 4.5% during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic conditions (P = 0.003). Fractional uric acid excretion strongly correlated to fractional glucose excretion (r = 0.35; P = 0.02). In the Uric Acid Excretion study, empagliflozin and benzbromarone both significantly reduced plasma uric acid and increased fractional uric acid excretion. Effects of combination therapy did not differ from benzbromarone monotherapy.

Conclusions

In conclusion, SGLT2 inhibitors induce uric acid excretion, which is strongly linked to urinary glucose excretion and is attenuated during concomitant pharmacologic blockade of urate transporter 1.

### Practical approach to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes [^115Mek7U]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are an attractive novel therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. They block the reabsorption of filtered glucose in kidneys, mainly in proximal renal tubules, resulting in increased urinary glucose excretion and correction of the diabetes-related hyperglycemia. Beyond improving glucose control, SGLT2 inhibitors offer potential benefits by reducing body weight and blood pressure. On the basis of the efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second- or third-line agents for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. Beneficial effects on kidney disease progression, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure have also been demonstrated with one SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin). Potential adverse events resulting from their mechanism of action or related to concomitant therapies are reviewed. A treatment algorithm for the adjustment of concomitant therapies after initiating SGLT2 inhibitors is also proposed.

### Ertugliflozin (Steglatro) [^115nCTbW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. Ertugliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, ertugliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Urinary Glucose Excretion and Urinary Volume

Dose-dependent increases in the amount of glucose excreted in urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following single- and multiple-dose administration of ertugliflozin. Dose-response modeling indicates that ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg result in near maximal urinary glucose excretion (UGE). Enhanced UGE is maintained after multiple-dose administration. UGE with ertugliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of STEGLATRO on QTc interval was evaluated in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled 3-period crossover study in 42 healthy subjects. At 6.7 times the therapeutic exposures with maximum recommended dose, STEGLATRO does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin are similar in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmaxwere 398 ng∙hr/mL and 81.3 ng/mL, respectively, with 5 mg ertugliflozin once-daily treatment, and 1,193 ng∙hr/mL and 268 ng/mL, respectively, with 15 mg ertugliflozin once-daily treatment. Steady-state is reached after 4 to 6 days of once-daily dosing with ertugliflozin. Ertugliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulates in plasma up to 10–40% following multiple dosing.

### Empagliflozin induces transient diuresis without changing long-term overall fluid balance in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^115VYxmv]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Our data address an important clinical consideration pertaining to the appropriate use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2D. Since the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors is known to induce sustained glucosuria, concerns have been raised that patients could be at increased risk of a clinically relevant loss of plasma and/or whole-body fluids, leading to volume depletion or dehydration events. Such concerns are of clinical relevance to Japanese T2D patients due to important demographic differences such as a higher average age and a lower BMI as compared to Caucasian T2D populations. The existing evidence for SGLT2 inhibitors to date, including studies in Japanese T2D patients, indicates that an increase in urine volume occurs immediately after treatment initiation (i.e. during the first 24–48 h). Hence, patients may be advised to increase fluid intake accordingly and to monitor acute changes in both urine output and body weight when starting a SGLT2 inhibitor. After this short-term initial phase of increased urine production, equilibrium is expected to be reached within the first week of SGLT2 treatment. Notably, comprehensive studies of patients at increased risk for dehydration (e.g. T2D individuals > 75 years old and/or receiving concomitant diuretic therapy) are currently scarce, so careful weighing of the benefits and risks of SGLT2 inhibitors, including the clinical risk of volume changes in these patients, is warranted.

### The role of sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^116brMHW]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia that results from insulin resistance, diminished or absent insulin secretion, or both. Approximately one-half of patients with diabetes fail to achieve acceptable glycemic control. Consequently, morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes is high, resulting from complications such as cardiovascular disease and nephropathy. The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This article provides an overview of efficacy and safety data for the SGLT2 inhibitors and outlines their role in the management of diabetes.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified through searches of PubMed and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts by using the key terms canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor. A review of bibliographies of retrieved articles was also performed to identify additional references. All identified trials published in English and that involved the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes were reviewed.

Findings

The SGLT2 inhibitors improve glucose control by increasing urinary glucose excretion. Effectiveness is decreased in the presence of renal dysfunction. These agents are efficacious as monotherapy and add-on therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin, sulfonylureas, insulin, and other antihyperglycemic combinations. The SGLT2 inhibitors lower glycosylated hemoglobin by 0.5% to 1% and fasting plasma glucose by ~15 to 35 mg/dL, depending on the agent and the dosage used, and are also associated with modest reductions in weight (-1.5 to -3.5 kg) and systolic blood pressure (-3 to -5 mm Hg). Genital mycotic infections and increased urination, owing to the mechanism of action, are the most common adverse effects. In general, the class is well tolerated, and the risk of hypoglycemia is low.

Implications

With their unique mechanism of action and good safety and tolerability profiles, the SGLT2 inhibitors are an important addition to existing treatments for type 2 diabetes. Because of the lack of data with this class of drugs when current treatment guidelines for diabetes were published, the SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second- or third-line therapies for diabetes. Forthcoming data on the long-term efficacy and safety profile of these agents should help to solidify the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of diabetes.

### Efficacy, safety and regulatory status of SGLT2 inhibitors: focus on canagliflozin [^1178nCTr]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Prevalence of diabetes mellitus is inc6reasing, with a burden of 382 million patients worldwide at present (more than the entire US population). The International Diabetes Federation anticipates an increase up to 592 million patients by 2035. Another major problem arises from the fact that just 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at target glycaemic control with currently available medications. Therefore, a clear need for new therapies that aim to optimize glycaemic control becomes evident. Renal sodium-linked glucose transporter 2 inhibitors are new antidiabetic drugs with an insulin-independent mechanism of action. They pose one remarkable advantage compared with already established antidiabetics: increasing urinary glucose excretion without inducing hypoglycaemia, thereby promoting body weight reduction due to loss of ~300kcal per day. This review focuses on canagliflozin, which was the first successful compound of this class to be approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency in 2013. Clinical trials showed promising results: enhancing glycaemic control was paralleled by reducing body weight and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Nevertheless, some safety concerns remain, such as genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections and cardiovascular risks in vulnerable patients, which will be closely monitored in several post-authorization safety studies.

### Sodium-glucose transport: role in diabetes mellitus and potential clinical implications [^116XYM45]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Current options for glycemic control are less than optimal in terms of efficacy and to reduce complications in the diabetic population. Selective inhibition of SGLT2 in the proximal tubule increases urinary glucose excretion thereby reducing plasma glucose levels, which may present a novel therapeutic approach.

Recent Findings

SGLT2 inhibitors enhance glucose excretion and improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in the absence of clinically relevant hypoglycemia or sustained changes in volume status or glomerular filtration rate. This is associated with lowering of body weight and may reduce systolic blood pressure. The increased glucosuria appears to increase the risk of genital infections but may not increase the risk of urinary tract infections.

Summary

The ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce plasma glucose without inducing increased insulin secretion, clinically relevant hypoglycemia, or weight gain constitutes a major advance. The ability to increase glucose excretion provides a powerful means to treat caloric excess conditions. Important questions remain to be resolved and more clinical research is needed on the long-term effects of SGLT2 inhibition. Potential extrarenal effects need to be explored in order to determine the safety of these compounds. It also remains to be determined whether these drugs lower the toxicity of glucose directly on renal cells, independent of hyperglycemia, which may slow or prevent the progressive nature of diabetic nephropathy.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus glimepiride as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^116mNH3J]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, dapagliflozin‐containing treatment regimens were associated with the additional benefit of weight loss, compared with glimepiride therapy which was associated with weight gain during treatment. Over 20% of patients in both dapagliflozin treatment groups achieved ≥ 5% weight loss, compared with only 3.5% of patients in the add‐on glimepiride group. This is of importance, given that body weight reduction is a key treatment goal in patients with type 2 diabetes. 1 Dapagliflozin‐containing regimens also reduced SBP, an effect that has been observed previously with SGLT‐2 inhibitor treatment 21, 22 and might be attributable to the osmotic, natriuretic and weight‐reducing effects of these agents. 23, 24 This is likely to be beneficial to patients with type 2 diabetes, given that achievement of blood pressure targets is associated with reduced risk of microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications, including cardiovascular disease. 25

Dapagliflozin‐containing treatment regimens were well tolerated during the study. Although there were more UTIs and genital infections in the dapagliflozin groups than in the glimepiride group, these were all mild or moderate in intensity and the frequency was consistent with previous reports. 11, 26, 27 In line with some previous reports, the frequency of both types of infection was lower in the dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin combination arm compared with the dapagliflozin arm. Several hypotheses for the mechanism underlying this phenomenon have been proposed, the simplest being that addition of a DPP‐4 inhibitor augments overall glucose control and thereby reduces SGLT‐2 inhibitor‐mediated glucosuria. 28 However, there are arguments that challenge this hypothesis and dedicated experimental studies are required to provide greater clarity.

Treatment with SGLT‐2 inhibitors has been associated with transient reductions in eGFR. More patients receiving dapagliflozin plus metformin experienced decreased CrCl leading to study discontinuation than did patients receiving glimepiride (2.9% vs 1.3%) However, the study criterion for discontinuation because of decreased CrCl was strict and did not allow CrCl to decrease below 60 mL/min if not reversed within 1 week of detection. Previous studies have shown that the initial effect of SGLT‐2 inhibitors on renal filtration is reversible and is associated with beneficial effects such as reduced albumin excretion and protection of renal function in patients with micro‐ and macroalbuminuria. 29, 30, 31, 32

### Effective utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents to achieve individualized HbA1c targets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112RGtHc]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

SGLT2 Inhibitors

These are the newest group of oral hypoglycemic agents, and include dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin. SGLT2 is a protein which encourages glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule in the kidney. The SGLT2 inhibitors block the receptor site, preventing activation of the glucose channel and glucose reabsorption, so the glucose remains in the renal filtrate and ultimately the urine. As the filtrate passes through the loop of Henle, water is reabsorbed by osmosis, but as a result of the elevated levels of glucose in the filtrate, reduced water reabsorption occurs, resulting in increased urine production. The loss of glucose in the urine and thus calories can result in weight loss. However, the side effects due to the glycosuria include increased risk of urinary tract infections and thrush/balanitis. For SGLT2 inhibitors to be effective, good renal function is required, and they should not be prescribed to patients whose eGFR is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m². The increased diuresis that can result from glycosuria can potentially cause hypotension, and SGLT2 inhibitors should be used with caution in combination with a loop diuretic. The three SGLT2 inhibitors vary in their licensing guidance. Dapagliflozin is not licensed with pioglitazone, is not recommended in triple therapy, and should be stopped if eGFR drops below 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Canagliflozin and empagliflozin are both licensed for triple therapy and with pioglitazone. They can be continued at the lower prescribable dose even if eGFR drops below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 if a therapeutic benefit has been noted, but are stopped if eGFR drops below 45 mL/min/1.73 m². SGLT2 inhibitors are taken once daily, with canagliflozin and empagliflozin having the option of a titrating dose. If the HbA1c has not reduced by 6 mmol/mol following the initiation of treatment, it should be discontinued. Unless prescribed in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, then the risk of hypoglycemia is low.

### Insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes: pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic relevance [^112XFhab]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 Inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) increase urinary glucose excretion and natriuresis, improve hyperglycemia, decrease glucotoxicity and oxidative stress, promote weight loss, and reduce systolic blood pressure. Common adverse events include urinary tract/genital infections and diabetic (also euglycemic) ketoacidosis. Empagliflozin and dapagliflozin have been widely investigated as adjuncts to insulin in T1D. In the EASE trials, administration of empagliflozin (2.5, 10, or 25 mg) along with insulin to overweight people with T1D for 26 to 52 weeks, induced a progressive reduction in HbA1c from 0.28 to 6.4%, body weight from 0.54 to 13.3%, and insulin dose per day from 0.53 to 12.7%. In the DEPICT trials, administration of 5 or 10 mg dapagliflozin along with insulin to overweight individuals with T1D for 52 weeks decreased HbA1c by 0.2 and 0.23%, body weight by 2.57 and 3.34 kg, and daily insulin dose by 8.3 and 10.51%, respectively. In a placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over study, short-term administration of dapagliflozin (10 mg for 3 days) did not improve whole-body sensitivity of glucose disposal to insulin during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemia. Intervention studies directly assessing insulin sensitivity after a longer-term period of SGLT-2i treatment are however lacking. In all studies, hypoglycemia was rare with similar frequency for empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and placebo. The incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis was 0.8%, 4.3%, and 3.3% with 2.5, 10, and 25 mg empagliflozin, respectively, and 4% and 3.5% with 5 and 10 mg dapagliflozin, respectively. Canagliflozin has also been investigated in people with T1D for 18 weeks vs placebo. Administration of 100 or 300 mg canagliflozin induced similar reductions of HbA1c > 0.4%, while total daily insulin dose was reduced by 4.1 and 7.6 units/day with the 2 doses of the drug, respectively; the decrease was mainly due to basal insulin. Body weight was also reduced by 3.4% and 5.3% for 100 and 300 mg, respectively. The treatment did not increase hypoglycemia risk, while adverse events included diabetic ketoacidosis mainly related to a reduction in insulin dose or illness and insulin resistance.
