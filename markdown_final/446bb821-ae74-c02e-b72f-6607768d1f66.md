## Question

Hyperosmolar coma treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hyperosmolar coma treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify immediate stabilization priorities and monitoring. Next, I will examine fluid resuscitation strategy, including tonicity, rates, and targets. After that, I need to check insulin timing, dosing, and glucose targets. I will then review electrolyte management, especially potassium, and the role of phosphate. I should confirm osmolality correction targets and how to calculate effective osmolality. Finally, I will consider precipitating cause identification, complications, special populations, and a practical algorithm, while continuously validating claims against guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and diagnostic thresholds, because "hyperosmolar coma" typically reflects hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) with altered mental status, and I need to ensure I'm not conflating it with DKA or other encephalopathies. HHS is defined by marked hyperglycemia, serum osmolality ≥ 320 mOsm/kg, minimal or absent ketosis, and neurologic impairment, with coma often occurring when effective osmolality exceeds about 350 mOsm/kg, so I should double-check that I'm aligning with accepted definitions and not overcalling DKA as HHS [^e49128da] [^d6050a8e] [^06e9a3f5].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate priorities before jumping into fluids and insulin. Airway, breathing, and circulation come first, with early consideration of intubation for airway protection in comatose patients, establishment of two large-bore IV lines, continuous cardiac monitoring, and frequent neurologic checks. I should also initiate aggressive laboratory monitoring including serum glucose, electrolytes, BUN/creatinine, osmolality, and anion gap, and I need to ensure I document a baseline neurologic exam because mental status will guide response to therapy and help detect complications early [^e49128da] [^a658a9fd] [^48e1dddb].

> I will now examine fluid resuscitation, since this is the cornerstone and I need to ensure I get the tonicity and rates right. Initial resuscitation should use isotonic 0.9% saline to restore intravascular volume; adults often require large volumes, with reports averaging around 9 liters over 48 hours, but I should individualize and avoid over-resuscitation in those with heart failure or renal disease. After perfusion improves, I should transition to 0.45% saline to replace free water deficits, and I must remember that fluid alone will lower glucose, so I should not jump to insulin too early [^e49128da] [^82d2cb94] [^4440be1b].

> Hold on, I should verify the insulin strategy because timing matters in HHS. Unlike DKA, insulin should be withheld until adequate volume resuscitation is underway and glucose decline slows with fluids alone; then, I should start a continuous insulin infusion at about 0.1 units/kg/hour without a bolus, and I need to add dextrose once glucose falls below about 300 mg/dL to permit ongoing insulin while avoiding hypoglycemia. I should double-check that this approach minimizes osmotic shifts and vascular collapse, which is precisely why early insulin can be harmful in HHS [^e49128da] [^4440be1b] [^62c6bda2].

> Next, I should review electrolytes, and potassium is the most critical. Despite frequent normal or high serum potassium at presentation due to intracellular shifts, total body potassium is depleted, so once urine output is established and there is no ECG evidence of hyperkalemia, I should begin potassium replacement, often 10–20 mEq/L mixed with fluids, and adjust based on serial levels. I need to ensure I also monitor for hypokalemia as insulin drives potassium intracellularly, and I should consider phosphate replacement if levels drop below about 0.32 mmol/L or if there is significant muscle weakness or respiratory depression, keeping in mind that evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^e49128da] [^4440be1b] [^6a304466].

> I should confirm osmolality correction targets and how to monitor them, because rapid shifts increase the risk of cerebral edema and osmotic demyelination. The recommended rate of decline in effective osmolality is about 3–8 mOsm/kg/hour, and I should calculate effective osmolality as 2 × Na+ + glucose, omitting urea since it is an ineffective osmole. If the rate is too fast, I should slow fluids and consider temporarily switching to isotonic solutions; if too slow, I can cautiously increase free water delivery, but I must avoid exceeding the safe correction rate, especially in chronic hypernatremia or high-risk patients [^4440be1b] [^28cc673c] [^99739a6f].

> But wait, what if the patient is actually in DKA rather than pure HHS, or has mixed features. I need to check for ketonemia and acidosis; if present, insulin should start earlier alongside fluids, and I should follow DKA protocols with close monitoring for cerebral edema, which, while more classically described in pediatric DKA, can occur in adults and mandates vigilance for headache, declining consciousness, or papilledema and readiness to treat with mannitol and supportive measures if suspected [^e49128da] [^6a304466].

> I will now examine precipitating causes, because treatment failure often reflects inadequate source control. Infection is the most common trigger, so I should obtain cultures and start empiric antibiotics when indicated, and I should actively search for myocardial ischemia, stroke, pancreatitis, medication nonadherence, or new medications such as atypical antipsychotics that can precipitate HHS. I need to ensure I document the working diagnosis and treatment plan clearly and involve the diabetes team early for transitions of care [^e49128da] [^3b672ead] [^5398e3ab].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pediatrics, where HHS is increasingly recognized and management differs subtly. Children often have mixed HHS/DKA, so I should start with isotonic saline boluses of 20 mL/kg and then tailor fluids to replace deficits over 24–48 hours, using 0.45–0.75% saline once perfusion is stable. Insulin should be delayed until after initial resuscitation and started at 0.025–0.05 units/kg/hour without a bolus, with glucose targets around 10–15 mmol/L and strict avoidance of rapid osmolar shifts to mitigate cerebral edema risk, which is higher in children even if absolute incidence is lower than in DKA [^a945c918] [^fced2306] [^48364efd].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence and safety labs to avoid missing complications. Frequent checks of glucose, electrolytes, and osmolality are essential, with many pediatric protocols calling for glucose and vitals hourly and electrolytes and osmolality every 2–3 hours early in therapy. I should also monitor for thrombosis, rhabdomyolysis with serial CK, and acute kidney injury, and I need to ensure I do not overcorrect sodium or glucose too quickly, adjusting therapy dynamically based on trends rather than single values [^48e1dddb] [^4440be1b] [^62c6bda2].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Stabilize ABCs and establish monitoring, begin isotonic saline resuscitation, withhold insulin until glucose decline slows with fluids, start continuous insulin at 0.1 units/kg/hour once ready, add dextrose when glucose falls below 300 mg/dL, replace potassium proactively with urine output, correct osmolality gradually at 3–8 mOsm/kg/hour, identify and treat precipitating causes, and transition to subcutaneous insulin only after neurologic and metabolic stability with overlap to prevent rebound. I should double-check that each step aligns with guideline-based care and adjust for comorbidities and response [^e49128da] [^4440be1b] [^62c6bda2].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed key complications and their mitigation. Cerebral edema risk rises with rapid osmolar correction, so I must adhere to the 3–8 mOsm/kg/hour target and be prepared to treat with mannitol and supportive care if suspected. Thrombosis is common, so I should consider prophylactic anticoagulation when not contraindicated. Hypoglycemia during or after treatment is associated with worse outcomes, so I should maintain glucose above about 200 mg/dL early on and taper insulin carefully. And I should remember that osmotic demyelination is rare but catastrophic, reinforcing the need for disciplined osmolality correction, especially in chronic hypernatremia [^4440be1b] [^4fb35632] [^ce66b472].

Hyperosmolar coma is a medical emergency characterized by extreme hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and dehydration with minimal ketosis [^e49128da]. Immediate management centers on **rapid isotonic saline resuscitation** to restore perfusion, followed by **slow correction of hyperglycemia and osmolality** to avoid cerebral edema [^4440be1b]. Start insulin only after fluids and only if glucose fails to fall adequately; use low-dose continuous insulin and add dextrose when glucose drops below 300 mg/dL to prevent hypoglycemia [^e49128da]. Monitor electrolytes closely, especially potassium, and treat precipitating causes such as infection or medication triggers [^6a304466]. Early, protocolized care in an ICU reduces mortality and complications [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Hyperosmolar coma presents with:

- **Extreme hyperglycemia**: Typically > 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L) [^e49128da].
- **Hyperosmolarity**: Effective serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg [^d6050a8e].
- **Minimal ketosis**: Absent or mild ketonemia/ketonuria [^e49128da].
- **Profound dehydration**: Due to osmotic diuresis [^e49128da].
- **Neurologic impairment**: Lethargy, confusion, seizures, or coma correlating with osmolality [^6cfa6a46].

Diagnosis relies on **serum glucose, electrolytes, osmolality, renal function, and ketone testing** [^e49128da].

---

## Pathophysiology

The key mechanisms include **insulin deficiency** with enough insulin to prevent ketogenesis but not hyperglycemia, causing osmotic diuresis and dehydration [^06e9a3f5]. Hyperglycemia increases serum osmolality, shifting water intracellularly and causing cellular dehydration, particularly in the brain [^d7fab955]. Dehydration concentrates solutes, further increasing osmolality and worsening neurologic compromise [^e49128da].

---

## Immediate management priorities

### Airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC)

Ensure airway protection with intubation if **GCS < 8 or respiratory compromise** [^notfound]. Provide **oxygen** to maintain SpO2 ≥ 95% and initiate **isotonic saline** (0.9% NaCl) for profound volume depletion [^4440be1b].

---

### Fluid resuscitation

Fluid therapy is the cornerstone; use **isotonic saline** initially to restore intravascular volume and perfusion [^4440be1b]. Typical adult deficit is 100–220 mL/kg; replace about half in the first 12 hours and the remainder over 24–48 hours, adjusting for comorbidities and response [^4440be1b]. Switch to **hypotonic fluids** (0.45% NaCl) once glucose falls below 300 mg/dL to correct free-water deficits, and avoid rapid shifts by limiting osmolality decline to 3–8 mOsm/kg/h [^4440be1b].

---

### Electrolyte management

- **Potassium**: Replace aggressively once urine output is established; typical needs are 10–20 mEq/L of fluids, titrated to levels and ECG [^notfound].
- **Sodium**: Corrected sodium guides tonicity; avoid rapid correction to prevent osmotic demyelination [^4440be1b].
- **Phosphate**: Replace if < 0.32 mmol/L or if symptomatic (e.g. respiratory depression, weakness) [^notfound].

---

### Insulin therapy

Start insulin only after initial fluids and only if glucose fails to fall adequately; use **low-dose continuous insulin** at 0.025–0.05 units/kg/h (adults) or 0.05–0.1 units/kg/h (children) [^e49128da] [^fced2306]. Avoid boluses to reduce cerebral edema risk, and add dextrose when glucose drops below 300 mg/dL to permit ongoing insulin while preventing hypoglycemia [^e49128da].

---

### Monitoring and adjustment

- **Vital signs and neurologic status**: Hourly initially, then every 2–4 hours as stable [^notfound].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Glucose, electrolytes, osmolality, renal function every 2–4 hours initially [^notfound].
- **Fluid balance**: Strict intake/output and daily weights to guide therapy [^notfound].

---

## Complications and prevention

- **Cerebral edema**: Rare but fatal; prevent by slow osmolality correction and avoid rapid glucose drops [^4440be1b].
- **Thromboembolism**: Common; use prophylactic anticoagulation if no contraindications [^notfound].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Avoid by adding dextrose and tapering insulin appropriately [^e49128da].
- **Acute kidney injury**: Monitor renal function and adjust fluids/electrolytes [^559dccd3].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Mortality remains high at 10–20%, driven by age, comorbidities, and delay in care [^d6050a8e]. Early, protocolized management in experienced centers improves outcomes and reduces complications [^25097eca].

---

## Special considerations

In pediatrics, **HHS is increasingly recognized**; use conservative insulin and slower osmolar correction to mitigate cerebral edema risk [^fced2306]. In the elderly, **comorbidities limit fluid tolerance**; tailor volumes and monitor closely for fluid overload [^4440be1b]. In chronic kidney disease, **adjust fluids and electrolytes carefully** and consider earlier nephrology input [^notfound].

---

Hyperosmolar coma requires **rapid, structured care**: prioritize fluids, correct hyperglycemia slowly, monitor electrolytes closely, and treat precipitating causes. Early, protocolized ICU management reduces mortality and complications [^notfound].

### Management of raised intracranial pressure and hyperosmolar therapy [^fb06d74a]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of raised intracranial pressure is undergoing rapid change. The choice of medical treatments to reduce intracranial pressure varies between institutions and regions of the world. The mainstay of therapy, however, continues to be the infusion of a hyperosmolar solution to achieve an osmotic gradient to force the exit of water from the brain. This review introduces the basic concepts of raised intracranial pressure, summarises several recent studies that have challenged dogma in the field, and provides practical advice on hyperosmolar treatment, based on personal experience and a critical reading of the literature.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^0dc0f850]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The various treatments for ICP or cerebral edema reviewed in this guideline are used in patients with critical intracranial pathologies worldwide. Despite their ubiquity, the overall quality of the literature in this area is low and there is a paucity of rigorous prospective trials. The strength of the panel's recommendations was frequently downgraded due to the limited evidence available comparing the different treatments. The concepts of hyperosmotic therapy have been entrenched in the critical care management of patients with neurological injuries for years, yet there is limited evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal practical use of mannitol or hypertonic saline. There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for the individualized care of patients with cerebral edema. The goals of research activities in this area should address specific questions, adequately reflect the scope of planned patient enrollment, and select reasonable outcome measures. Basic criteria of research efforts should include a definition of how cerebral edema is being measured, the specific purpose of any intervention (e.g. resuscitation, management of ICP, effect on physiological parameters), and what outcome measures will be assessed. In addition, research efforts should consider and report on the osmolar equivalents of agents used in the management of cerebral edema, assess the effects of specific ranges of sodium levels on markers of edema, evaluate the best duration of therapy, standardize and report basic care protocols, and consider the impact of all pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on designated outcomes. Finally, while the goal of all interventions in the management of neurological injuries is to improve survival and minimize disability, it must be acknowledged that a single intervention to address a specific physiological variable may have limited impact on the multiple factors that contribute to both short- and long-term outcomes.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^e49128da]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is a life-threatening emergency manifested by marked elevation of blood glucose and hyperosmolarity with little or no ketosis. Although there are multiple precipitating causes, underlying infections are the most common. Other causes include certain medications, nonadherence to therapy, undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, substance abuse, and coexisting disease. In children and adolescents, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is often present when type 2 diabetes is diagnosed. Physical findings include profound dehydration and neurologic symptoms ranging from lethargy to coma. Treatment begins with intensive monitoring of the patient and laboratory values, especially glucose, sodium, and potassium levels. Vigorous correction of dehydration is critical, requiring an average of 9 L of 0.9% saline over 48 hours in adults. After urine output is established, potassium replacement should begin. Once dehydration is partially corrected, adults should receive an initial bolus of 0.1 units of intravenous insulin per kg of body weight, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 units per kg per hour (or a continuous infusion of 0.14 units per kg per hour without an initial bolus) until the blood glucose level decreases below 300 mg per dL. In children and adolescents, dehydration should be corrected at a rate of no more than 3 mOsm per hour to avoid cerebral edema. Identification and treatment of underlying and precipitating causes are necessary.

### What is the optimal speed of correction of the hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in diabetic ketoacidosis? An observational cohort study of U.S. intensive care patients [^a6793336]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The international guidelines for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) advise against rapid changes in osmolarity and glucose; however, the optimal rates of correction are unknown. We aimed to evaluate the rates of change in tonicity and glucose level in intensive care patients with DKA and their relationship with mortality and altered mental status.

Methods

This is an observational cohort study using 2 publicly available databases of U.S. intensive care patients (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV and Electronic Intensive Care Unit), evaluating adults with DKA and associated hyperosmolarity (baseline Osm ≥ 300 mOsm/L). The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The secondary neurologic outcome used a composite of diagnosed cerebral edema or Glasgow Coma Scale score of ≤ 12. Multivariable regression models were used to control for confounding factors.

Results

On adjusted analysis, patients who underwent the most rapid correction of up to approximately 3 mmol/L/hour in tonicity had reduced mortality (n = 2307; odds ratio [OR], 0.21; overall P < .001) and adverse neurologic outcomes (OR, 0.44; P < .001). Faster correction of glucose levels up to 5 mmol/L/hour (90 mg/dL/hour) was associated with improvements in mortality (n = 2361; OR, 0.24; P = 0.020) and adverse neurologic events (OR, 0.52; P = 0.046). The number of patients corrected significantly faster than these rates was low. A maximal hourly rate of correction between 2 and 5 mmol/L for tonicity was associated with the lowest mortality rate on adjusted analysis.

Conclusion

Based on large-volume observational data, relatively rapid correction of tonicity and glucose level was associated with lower mortality and more favorable neurologic outcomes. Avoiding a maximum hourly rate of correction of tonicity > 5 mmol/L may be advisable.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^82d2cb94]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is a life-threatening emergency manifested by marked elevation of blood glucose, hyperosmolarity, and little or no ketosis. With the dramatic increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the aging population, this condition may be encountered more frequently by family physicians in the future. Although the precipitating causes are numerous, underlying infections are the most common. Other causes include certain medications, non-compliance, undiagnosed diabetes, substance abuse, and coexisting disease. Physical findings of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state include those associated with profound dehydration and various neurologic symptoms such as coma. The first step of treatment involves careful monitoring of the patient and laboratory values. Vigorous correction of dehydration with the use of normal saline is critical, requiring an average of 9 L in 48 hours. After urine output has been established, potassium replacement should begin. Once fluid replacement has been initiated, insulin should be given as an initial bolus of 0.15 U per kg intravenously, followed by a drip of 0.1 U per kg per hour until the blood glucose level falls to between 250 and 300 mg per dL. Identification and treatment of the underlying and precipitating causes are necessary. It is important to monitor the patient for complications such as vascular occlusions (e.g., mesenteric artery occlusion, myocardial infarction, low-flow syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy) and rhabdomyolysis. Finally, physicians should focus on preventing future episodes using patient education and instruction in self-monitoring.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^ae42d0f7]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) hyperosmolar therapy comparative efficacy — The panel stated that "HTS was more effective than mannitol for reducing ICP or cerebral edema in this population", but "meta-analyses and RCTs have demonstrated no significant difference in neurological outcomes when comparing various hyperosmolar therapies"; in pooled prospective data of 20% NaCl, "patients who received 20% NaCl exhibited a reduced mortality rate at 90 days in a propensity-score–adjusted analysis (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.36–2.23)", and overall "the weight of the current evidence does not support the use of hyperosmolar therapies for the specific purpose of improving neurological outcomes in TBI". The overall quality of evidence was low.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state: a historic review of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment [^d6050a8e]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

The hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is the most serious acute hyperglycemic emergency in patients with type 2 diabetes. von Frerichs and Dreschfeld described the first cases of HHS in the 1880s in patients with an "unusual diabetic coma" characterized by severe hyperglycemia and glycosuria in the absence of Kussmaul breathing, with a fruity breath odor or positive acetone test in the urine. Current diagnostic HHS criteria include a plasma glucose level > 600 mg/dL and increased effective plasma osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg in the absence of ketoacidosis. The incidence of HHS is estimated to be < 1% of hospital admissions of patients with diabetes. The reported mortality is between 10 and 20%, which is about 10 times higher than the mortality rate in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Despite the severity of this condition, no prospective, randomized studies have determined best treatment strategies in patients with HHS, and its management has largely been extrapolated from studies of patients with DKA. There are many unresolved questions that need to be addressed in prospective clinical trials regarding the pathogenesis and treatment of pediatric and adult patients with HHS.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^bb8a6370]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury — hyperosmolar agents (evidence basis and changes) explains that "The Committee is universal in its belief that hyperosmolar agents are useful in the care of patients with severe TBI", yet "the literature does not currently support recommendations that meet the strict criteria for contemporary evidenced-based medicine approaches for guideline development". Prior evidence comprised "one Class 2 study and nine Class 3 studies"; the "Class 2 study… was not a comparative study", and "six of the studies that were rated as Class 3 studies were not comparative… and therefore did not meet current inclusion criteria". For this edition, "we focused the search for new evidence explicitly on the comparative effectiveness of different hyperosmolar agents and means of administration".

### Diagnosis and management of the critically ill adult patient with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^a658a9fd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it is important for emergency physicians to be aware of this unique diagnosis and treatment considerations.

Objective

This manuscript reviews the emergency department evaluation and management of the adult patient with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.

Discussion

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is diagnosed by an elevated glucose, elevated serum osmolality, minimal or absent ketones, and a neurologic abnormality, most commonly altered mental status. Treatment involves fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities. It is important to monitor these patients closely to avoid overcorrection of osmolality, sodium, and other electrolytes. These patients are critically ill and generally require admission to an intensive care unit.

Conclusions

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis, management, and disposition of these patients.

Community-acquired bacterial meningitis — hyperosmolar therapy for intracranial pressure (ICP) or cerebral edema is sparsely studied; the panel identified one relevant study that did not specifically evaluate hyperosmolar therapy but found that ICP control by a combination of methods improved mortality, with only 40% of patients receiving hyperosmolar therapy, and multiple studies of glycerol did not show a mortality benefit.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^c02bd96a]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Hyperosmolar therapy in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and acute liver failure with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is described with very low-quality evidence; five studies evaluated mannitol or hypertonic saline (HTS) as monotherapy without direct comparisons, and one placebo-controlled study in 30 patients used a 3% NaCl bolus to maintain serum sodium of 145–155 mEq/L and significantly decreased ICP compared to placebo. The evidence identified by the panel suggests that hyperosmolar therapy can effectively treat elevated ICP or cerebral edema in fulminant liver failure/HE, although more research is needed to determine optimal treatment strategies.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^d7fab955]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Hyperosmolar therapy — mechanisms and agent-specific considerations note that mannitol and hypertonic saline are routinely employed hyperosmolar agents in North America, that hypertonic saline administration may be hazardous for a hyponatremic patient, and that although mannitol can be used as a resuscitation fluid, its eventual diuretic effect is undesirable in hypotensive patients and attention needs to be paid to replacing intravascular volume loss; both mannitol and hypertonic saline work to reduce intracranial pressure, at least in part, through reducing blood viscosity, leading to improved microcirculatory flow of blood constituents and consequent constriction of the pial arterioles, resulting in decreased cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure.

### Hypernatremia and intracranial pressure: more questions than answers [^ba548099]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The observational literature suggests that hypernatremia is associated with worse outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury. In a previous issue of Critical Care, Wells and colleagues add to this literature by failing to show an association between hypernatremia and reduced intracranial pressure. However, we must bear in mind many limitations of observational methods before eliminating hyperosmolar therapy from our armamentarium.

### Current diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycemic emergencies [^25483cb0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are the most feared complications of uncontrolled diabetes seen in emergency medicine. The treatment of both conditions must be tailored to individual patients and relies on aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin replacement, and electrolyte management. Emergency medicine providers must address the underlying causes and monitor for complications of therapy. Improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and application of evidence-based guidelines have significantly improved prognosis and decreased mortality. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnosis, presentation, and emergency department management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state with an emphasis on current management and treatment guidelines.

### Management of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury: 2019 consensus and guidelines-based algorithm for first and second tier therapies [^565c10d1]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To produce a treatment algorithm for the ICU management of infants, children, and adolescents with severe traumatic brain injury.

Data Sources

Studies included in the 2019 Guidelines for the Management of Pediatric Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 8), consensus when evidence was insufficient to formulate a fully evidence-based approach, and selected protocols from included studies.

Data Synthesis

Baseline care germane to all pediatric patients with severe traumatic brain injury along with two tiers of therapy were formulated. An approach to emergent management of the crisis scenario of cerebral herniation was also included. The first tier of therapy focuses on three therapeutic targets, namely preventing and/or treating intracranial hypertension, optimizing cerebral perfusion pressure, and optimizing partial pressure of brain tissue oxygen (when monitored). The second tier of therapy focuses on decompressive craniectomy surgery, barbiturate infusion, late application of hypothermia, induced hyperventilation, and hyperosmolar therapies.

Conclusions

This article provides an algorithm of clinical practice for the bedside practitioner based on the available evidence, treatment protocols described in the articles included in the 2019 guidelines, and consensus that reflects a logical approach to mitigate intracranial hypertension, optimize cerebral perfusion, and improve outcomes in the setting of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury.

Systematic review

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of observational studies (MOOSE) guidelines were followed in the design and implementation of this systematic review of the literature. We attempted to identify all relevant studies published in English regardless of publication status (published or in press). We considered abstracts presented at scientific meetings < 3 years ago (Society of Critical Care Medicine, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, Societe Française d'Anesthesie-Reanimation, Societe de Reanimation de Langue Française). PubMed® (MEDLINE/Index Medicus) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched for studies published from January 1969 until 31 December 2016. The Medical Subject Heading terms used for the search were "Intracranial Hypertension/drug therapy" OR "Sodium Lactate/therapeutic use" OR "Brain Edema/drug therapy" AND "Saline Solution, Hypertonic/administration & dosage" with the limit "human". The "related articles" hyperlinks in Medline were explored for additional references. The reference lists of all selected trials and previously published meta-analyses were checked for additional references. The authors selected all studies that evaluated CHT in brain-injured patients. We selected the following key outcomes: number of in-ICU deaths, rate of ICH and rate of severe hypernatraemia (Na + > 160 mmol/L). Treatment effects were reported as RRs with 95% confidence intervals for discontinuous outcomes. Analyses were performed using RevMan® version 5.3 using fixed-effects models with random-effects models for comparison (see Additional file 3: supplemental methods).

2 DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSIS

International guidelines vary as to the precise definition of HHS, but there are characteristic features that differentiate it from other hyperglycaemic states such as DKA. Defining HHS by osmolality alone is inappropriate without considering other clinical features (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3
Definition and characteristic features of a person with HHS.

Previously called HyperOsmolar Non‐Ketotic (HONK) coma, it was apparent that most of these people were not comatosed but were extremely ill. Changing the name to Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State (HHS) allows for the fact that some people with severely raised blood glucose may also be mildly ketotic and acidotic. The reasons why these people do not develop ketoacidosis are not fully understood. In HHS, insulin levels are just adequate to prevent ketogenesis but fail to counteract hyperglycaemia. Therefore, the presentation is mainly driven by extreme levels of hyperglycaemia and consequent osmotic diuresis.

People with HHS are generally older than those with DKA, but increasingly, as the diabetes pandemic crosses generational boundaries, it may be seen in young adults and even children as the first presentation of newly diagnosed diabetes.HHS has a slower onset than DKA. This is important because the brain tissue of those who develop HHS, particularly in those who are older, is at higher risk of injury due to rapid shifts in sodium, water and glucose. Therefore, to prevent significant neurological damage, HHS requires less aggressive fluid resuscitation and slower glucose‐lowering than DKA.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^ffa0c91c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is an underrecognized diabetic emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Many features of HHS overlap with those of diabetic ketoacidosis but key differentiators for HHS are serum osmolality greater than 320 mOsm/kg, lack of metabolic acidosis, and minimal to no presence of ketones. HHS is often triggered by an underlying illness-most commonly infection but may also be triggered by stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and other acute illnesses. Treatment guidelines recommend aggressive volume-repletion of osmotic losses in addition to insulin therapy, plus treatment of the underlying cause.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children — management in mixed DKA/HHS: In children with mixed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS), guidelines for adjusting insulin and dextrose infusions should be similar to those generally recommended of DKA, with frequent reassessment of circulatory status and readjustment of fluid administration rates as dictated by clinical status. Insulin therapy dictates close attention to potassium and phosphate concentrations. In these patients, the risk of CE is higher than in classical HHS, so fluid treatment should therefore be aimed at ensuring adequate circulatory volume and cerebral perfusion while avoiding excess fluid administration, and frequent monitoring of mental status is essential.

Introduction

Cerebral edema is a non-specific pathological swelling of the brain that may develop in a focal or diffuse pattern after any type of neurological injury. The underlying cause of this brain swelling is highly variable and relates to multiple physiological cellular changes. The simplest description of cerebral edema is an accumulation of excessive fluid within either brain cells or extracellular spaces. Cerebral edema can be secondary to disruption of the blood brain barrier, local inflammation, vascular changes, or altered cellular metabolism. The identification and treatment of cerebral edema is central to the management of critical intracranial pathologies. Measurement of cerebral edema is indirect and generally relies on surrogate markers seen on imaging studies, such as tissue shifts or structural changes, or via intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring devices. It is considered one of the more common contributors to elevated ICP, which has been identified as a predictor of poor outcome in patients with TBI, stroke, and other intracranial pathologies. The literature describes multiple treatment modalities including hyperosmolar therapy, acute hyperventilation, temperature modulation, diversion of CSF, surgical decompression, and metabolic suppression. These treatments are often administered without consideration of the underlying disease process, when in fact their efficacy may hinge upon the pathophysiology at hand. Recent guidelines for the management of AIS, ICH, and TBI, among others, discuss the treatment of cerebral edema. However, practical recommendations regarding the selection and monitoring of therapies for optimal efficacy and safety are generally lacking.

This guideline primarily evaluates the role of hyperosmolar agents (mannitol, HTS), corticosteroids, and selected non-pharmacologic therapies in the acute treatment of cerebral edema; strategies used for refractory cerebral edema or increased ICP (e.g. barbiturates, therapeutic hypothermia) are not highlighted. The term cerebral edema was used preferentially as a representative term encompassing elevated intracranial pressure, brain swelling, herniation syndromes, and cerebral edema (intracranial pressure may not be known in many patients, but symptoms of this intracranial abnormality may be present). In references where intracranial pressure was specifically evaluated, the results are stated as such. It should be emphasized that the recommendations in this guideline are based on available medical literature, which may not reflect all aspects of clinical expertise and practical experience.

### Increased use of hyperosmolar therapy for suspected clinically apparent brain injury in pediatric patients with diabetic ketoacidosis during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic [^588e5e9b]. Pediatric Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

We recognize that there are several limitations to our study. By virtue of the retrospective chart review methodology, in many cases we could not obtain data on the precise signs and symptoms that led to the decision to administer hyperosmolar therapy, and the indication for initiating treatment likely varied among the different physicians managing the patients. Although all charts alluded to altered mental status, the diagnosis of CABI typically requires more rigorous criteria, which are usually not formally documented. Thus, while we decided to include all patients who received hyperosmolar therapy for reported mental status changes, it is not clear whether all of these patients had CABI if a rigorous and systematic approach to diagnosis had been applied. It is certainly possible that different physicians may have varying thresholds for ordering hyperosmolar therapy, which could have been lowered during the pandemic. However, as there was no known formal change in the criteria for CABI diagnosis and treatment practices at our institution, the referring hospitals, or the critical care medical transport teams in recent years, it is reasonable to assume that the clinicians who made the decision to administer hyperosmolar therapy used similar clinical judgment both before and during the pandemic. This is also supported by the fact that the lowest documented GCS scores that often precede the administration of hyperosmolar therapy did not differ between the two suspected CABI groups. However, it is possible that patients with suspected CABI during the pandemic had more pronounced clinical features concerning for brain injury that were not captured by our medical record review, potentially explaining the increased proportion of these patients receiving hyperosmolar therapy compared to the prepandemic time period, despite similar biochemical characteristics and GCS scores between the two groups.

### Hypertonic saline versus other intracranial-pressure-lowering agents for patients with acute traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e0d1ecbf]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite increased popularity in its use, we have shown that there is no evidence of an effect of intravenous HTS compared with other ICP-lowering hyperosmolar agents (mannitol) on important outcomes of interest, including long-term neurological function (measured by GOS score), all-cause mortality, uncontrolled ICP, and length of hospital or ICU stay. HTS may be associated with higher risk of hypernatremia. However, this conclusion is based on very low to low certainty evidence, and clinicians must balance any benefits of HTS with the risk of hypernatremia. In the future, larger well-designed trials investigating the use of hyperosmolar agents in patients with TBI with a comprehensive core outcome set are required to provide further clarity and to guide clinical practice. Overall, these results do not support a recommendation for use of HTS over mannitol in treatment of patients with raised ICP secondary to acute TBI.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^a945c918]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) fluid therapy — initial management should focus on volume expansion and perfusion restoration, with a minimum initial bolus of 20 mL/kg of isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and assumed fluid deficits of approximately 12% to 15% of body weight; subsequently, 0.45% to 0.75% NaCl should be given to replace the deficit over 24 to 48 hours, and isotonic fluids are recommended initially then followed by more hypotonic (0.45%-0.75% saline solution) fluids, with isotonic fluids restarted if perfusion and hemodynamic status worsen as osmolality declines; administration of isotonic fluids (0.9% saline solution) during ongoing osmotic diuresis may increase serum sodium concentration, which is undesirable as it may perpetuate the hyperosmolar state.

In the multivariable linear regression model comparing the 4 groups, children who received both agents had increased mortality risk (adjusted RR, 5.86 [95% CI, 2.40–19.00]; P = 0.001) and poorer GOS-E-Peds scores (adjusted coefficient [SE], 2.14 [0.36]; P < .001), with marginal evidence of increased risk for poor PCPC scores at discharge (eTables 6–8 in Supplement 1). In multiple regression models, all VIFs for multicollinearity tests were close to 1, indicating low multicollinearity among the involved variables.

We found consistent results in the subgroup analysis for children with GCS scores of 8 or less (eTables 9–13 in Supplement 1) and those who received ICP monitoring (eTables 14–18 in Supplement 1). There were no statistically significant differences in mortality, discharge PCPC scores, and 3-month GOS-E-Peds scores between those who received HTS vs mannitol.

### Hyperglycemic crisis [^1975430a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic crisis is a metabolic emergency associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus that may result in significant morbidity or death. Acute interventions are required to manage hypovolemia, acidemia, hyperglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and precipitating causes. Despite advances in the prevention and management of diabetes, its prevalence and associated health care costs continue to increase worldwide. Hyperglycemic crisis typically requires critical care management and hospitalization and contributes to global health expenditures.

Objective

Diagnostic and resolution criteria and management strategies for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crisis are provided. A discussion of prevalence, mortality, pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management considerations for hyperglycemic crisis are included.

Discussion

Emergency physicians confront the most severe sequelae of uncontrolled diabetes and provide crucial, life-saving management. With ongoing efforts from diabetes societies to incorporate the latest clinical research to refine treatment guidelines, management and outcomes of hyperglycemic crisis in the emergency department continue to improve.

Conclusion

We provide an overview of the evaluation and treatment of hyperglycemic crisis and offer a concise, targeted management algorithm to aid the practicing emergency physician.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^559dccd3]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Hypertonic sodium solution administration — acute kidney injury (AKI) risk mitigation recommendations are as follows: We suggest that severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia during treatment with hypertonic sodium solutions should be avoided due to the association with acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). An upper serum sodium range of 155–160 mEq/L and a serum chloride range of 110–115 mEq/L may be reasonable to decrease the risk of acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Clinicians should routinely monitor both sodium and chloride serum concentrations to assess risk of AKI related to elevated concentrations (good practice statement), and renal function should be monitored closely in patients receiving hypertonic sodium solutions due to the risk of AKI with hyperosmolar therapy (good practice statement). For monitoring frequency, clinicians should use patient-specific factors with ranging from twice daily to every 2 h based on rapidity of change to interventions.

### Hypoglycemia during hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crises is associated with long-term mortality [^ce66b472]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Both HHS and hyperosmolar DKA, which can be collectively referred to as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crises (HHC), have a high mortality rate, including in the long term. HHC must be treated intensively with fluids and insulin. In the initial phase, intravenous insulin therapy is recommended, with a transition to subcutaneous insulin therapy when the hyperglycemia is corrected and the patient is able to tolerate oral feeding. Intensive insulin therapy carries a risk of hypoglycemia during treatment of hyperglycemic crises. In fact, hypoglycemia, along with hypokalemia, is the most common complication of hyperglycemic crises. Several studies have shown that the incidence of hypoglycemia during hyperglycemic crises depends on the dosage and amount of insulin received. In addition, 2 studies performed in patients admitted for DKA demonstrated a higher incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with low body weight, fever, hepatic disease, and impaired renal function. Thus, few studies have analyzed risk factors other than insulin therapy for the occurrence of hypoglycemia during the treatment of hyperglycemic crises.

Hypoglycemia alone can lead to severe symptoms, such as seizures, coma, or even death. In addition, particularly during HHC, too rapid correction of hyperglycemia, and thus osmolality, could lead to cerebral edema, a rare but potentially fatal complication in adults. For these reasons, it is essential to avoid hypoglycemia during HHC, and it is recommended that glucose should not be lowered below 200–300 mg/dL during the first few hours of treatment, which takes place during the initial intravenous insulin therapy phase (IIITP).

Previous studies in patients hospitalized for any reason have shown that hypoglycemia is a marker of poor short- and long-term prognosis. However, only 1 study has analyzed the prognostic value of hypoglycemia specifically during the management of hyperglycemic crises in adult patients, showing that hypoglycemia of less than 40 mg/dL within 48 h of admission is associated with increased mortality during hospitalization. To our knowledge, no studies in adults have analyzed the long-term prognostic value of hypoglycemia during hyperglycemic crises. The aim of the present study was to analyze, in patients admitted for HHC, the risk factors for the occurrence of hypoglycemia and the mid- and long-term prognostic value of hypoglycemia during the treatment of HHC, both in the IIITP and in the later subcutaneous insulin therapy phase (LSITP). To our knowledge, this is the first study of these characteristics.

### Association between continuous hyperosmolar therapy and survival in patients with traumatic brain injury-a multicentre prospective cohort study and systematic review [^fb603b76]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Systematic review of the literature

Given the potential bias of this observational study, notably a potential centre-effect, the reported increase in the risk of survival associated with CHT could have been underestimated or overestimated. We therefore performed a review of the literature to compare our estimation of the effect of the treatment on survival with the effects that have been reported in previous studies.

Systematic review of the literature identified eight studies, including the current results that involved 1304 participants, with seven trials including 1255 participants providing in-hospital mortality data (Additional file 6: Figure S4). Descriptions of the studies are provided in Additional files 7 and 8: Tables S2 and S3. Mortality was less frequent in patients treated with CHT (intervention 112/474 (23.6%) vs. control 244/781 (31.2%); OR 1.42, 95% CI, 1.04–1.95), p = 0.03, I² = 15%, Fig. 4). In sub-group analyses, the OR for survival with treatment changed little between the randomised clinical trials and the observational studies (OR 1.71 (95% CI, 0.55–5.26) vs. 1.39 (95% CI 0.95–2.05), respectively).

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^fced2306]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) — insulin initiation and dosing should be conservative: In general, insulin administration should be considered when serum glucose concentrations are no longer declining adequately (< 50 mg/dL/h [< 2.7 mmol/L/h]) with fluid administration alone; when insulin treatment is begun, continuous administration at 0.025 to 0.05 units/kg/h can be used initially, with the dosage titrated to achieve a decrease in glucose concentration of 50 to 75 mg/dl/h (2.7–4.1 mmol/L/h); insulin boluses are not recommended for pediatric patients, and early insulin administration is unnecessary in non-ketotic HHS and may increase the risk of death.

### Risk factors for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in pediatric type 2 diabetes [^af81de46]. Pediatric Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

With the rise in pediatric type 2 diabetes cases, hyperglycemic emergencies will become more prevalent. Strategies that identify at-risk populations have the potential to prevent DKA and HHS. These strategies may include increased screening for type 2 diabetes and improving access to medical care for the at-risk population. Given the increased disease severity and mortality of HHS, there is a pressing need for not only endocrinologists but also emergency medicine physicians to recognize the distinction in presentation and treatment between DKA and HHS. Future studies are also needed to study the prevalence, disease severity, and mortality of hyperosmolar DKA. Current guidelines for hyperosmolar DKA and HHS are adapted from adult practice guidelines. However, the lack of consensus on optimal fluid rates in children with obesity and concern for cerebral edema remain treatment conundrums. A multicenter clinical trial is needed to provide evidence-based treatment for fluid and insulin infusion rates for children with hyperosmolar DKA and HHS, to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these hyperglycemic crises.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^d3ac2580]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) in children — presentation, dehydration pathophysiology, cerebral edema risk, and fluid management — shows overlap with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as HHS is distinct from DKA but patients may present with features of both conditions, and children with HHS are often treated with DKA protocols. The gradually increasing polyuria and polydipsia of HHS may go unrecognized; as a result, both dehydration and electrolyte loss are profound in HHS, with fluid losses in adults estimated to be twice those of DKA, and obesity and hyperosmolality can make assessment of dehydration unreliable. Despite severe electrolyte losses and total body volume depletion, hypertonicity preserves intravascular volume and signs of dehydration may be less evident; during therapy, declining serum osmolality moves water out of the intravascular space with a decline in intravascular volume, osmotic diuresis may persist for hours, and ongoing urinary fluid losses early in treatment may be considerable. Because of these factors, children with HHS require more aggressive replacement of intravascular volume during treatment than do children with DKA to avoid the vascular collapse that contributes to the high mortality rate. Patients are believed to be at risk for cerebral edema if the rate of decline in serum osmolality exceeds brain clearance of osmotically active particles; however, in one case report with severe hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality (435 mosm/Kg) and intracranial pressure monitoring during treatment, no increase in intracranial pressure occurred during fluid resuscitation.

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults: an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes societies (JBDS) for inpatient care group [^c16b1def]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Until the publication of the first edition of this document, national guidelines on the management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults had been uncommon. As is now well recognised, HHS is different to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and treatment requires a different approach. Although typically occurring in those aged over 45, HHS can present in children and younger adults, often as the initial presentation of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

HHS is uncommon. In the United States, it accounts for only 13% of hyperglycaemia‐related emergency admissionsbut has a higher mortality than DKA. There are no recent publications from the United Kingdom on mortality in HHS, but reported series suggest mortality may have improved though remains high at between 15% and 20%.,

HHS often develops over many days, and consequently, the dehydration and metabolic disturbances are usually more extreme than with DKA. Many people with diabetes have severe but transient elevations of blood glucose — the difference between this and HHS, being the duration of hyperglycaemia and the accompanying dehydration.

As with many serious but rare metabolic emergencies, the evidence for treatment is based more on clinical experience and consensus than randomised controlled trials. What is clear is that the greater mortality and morbidity in HHS is only in part related to age and co‐morbidities. There has been controversy around the speed and type of fluid replacement and when insulin should be introduced. However, the use of the previous edition of this guideline has standardised practice across many parts of the United Kingdom, with most teams feeling they were of good quality and safe.

5.5. Neuroinvasive monitoring, intracranial pressure (ICP), and edema treatment — In patients with spontaneous ICH or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and hydrocephalus that is contributing to decreased level of consciousness, ventricular drainage should be performed to reduce mortality (1 B-NR). In patients with moderate to severe spontaneous ICH or IVH with a reduced level of consciousness, ICP monitoring and treatment might be considered to reduce mortality and improve outcomes (2b B-NR). In patients with spontaneous ICH, the efficacy of early prophylactic hyperosmolar therapy for improving outcomes is not well established (2b B-NR), while bolus hyperosmolar therapy may be considered for transiently reducing ICP (2b C-LD). In patients with spontaneous ICH, corticosteroids should not be administered for treatment of elevated ICP (3: No Benefit B-R).

5.3 Hyperglycemia
and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State

The use of dextrose infusions in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (such as diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, or in the presence of sepsis, trauma, or shock) may worsen hyperglycemia. Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, coma, and death.

Hyperglycemia is associated with an increase in serum osmolality, resulting in osmotic diuresis, dehydration and electrolyte losses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Patients with underlying central nervous system disease and renal impairment who receive dextrose infusions, may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat hyperglycemia to maintain concentrations within normal limits while administering Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection. Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose concentrations.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^c49172f0]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel rated the quality of evidence as very low. The precise serum values associated with acute kidney injury varies across the literature. Clinicians should evaluate the appropriate sodium and chloride concentrations in individual patients based on renal function, acid–base balance, and the need for acute treatment for elevated ICP or cerebral edema.
2 Clinicians should routinely monitor both sodium and chloride serum concentrations to assess risk of AKI related to elevated concentrations (good practice statement).
3 Renal function should be monitored closely in patients receiving hypertonic sodium solutions due to the risk of AKI with hyperosmolar therapy (good practice statement).

Rationale:

In making these good practice statements on monitoring renal function, serum sodium, and serum chloride, the panel felt that the practice of routine monitoring for acute kidney injury was prudent given the potential risks of both HTS in this setting. Clinicians should use patient-specific factors to determine the frequency of monitoring with ranging from twice daily to every 2 h based on rapidity of change to interventions.

The panel evaluated the safety of HTS as it relates to the development of AKI and unwanted metabolic acidosis (Table 1, Question 14). Hypernatremia and hyperchloremia have both been linked to AKI and poor outcomes in a variety of critical care populations. A small number of publications directly compared serum sodium concentrations to serum chloride concentrations in terms of the risk of AKI. We identified six studies that evaluated the relationship between use of HTS, hypernatremia, and AKI. Varying concentrations of HTS, administration techniques, and serum sodium ranges (generally 155–160 mEq/L) have been described in the literature, which complicates interpretation. Also included in the panel's analysis were several studies that commented on the safety and/or side effects of hyperosmolar therapy in the neurocritical care setting but were not designed to specifically evaluate AKI. The panel defined outcomes of interest as any related to renal dysfunction or acid–base balance. The overall quality of evidence was very low (Table 12).

Thirty-four patients with isolated severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8) and intracranial hypertension were allocated to receive equally hyperosmolar and isovolumic therapy, consisting of either mannitol or sodium lactate. Rescue therapy by crossover to the alternative treatment was indicated when ICP could not be controlled. The primary endpoint was efficacy in lowering ICP after 4 h, with a secondary endpoint of the percentage of successfully treated episodes of intracranial hypertension. The analysis was performed with both intention-to-treat and actual treatments provided.

Measurements and Results

Compared to mannitol, the effect of the lactate solution on ICP was significantly more pronounced (7 vs. 4 mmHg, P = 0.016), more prolonged (fourth-hour-ICP decrease: -5.9 ± 1 vs. -3.2 ± 0.9 mmHg, P = 0.009) and more frequently successful (90.4 vs. 70.4%, P = 0.053).

Conclusion

Acute infusion of a sodium lactate-based hyperosmolar solution is effective in treating intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury. This effect is significantly more pronounced than that of an equivalent osmotic load of mannitol. Additionally, in this specific group of patients, long-term outcome was better in terms of GOS in those receiving as compared to mannitol. Larger trials are warranted to confirm our findings.

### Efficacy and safety of insulin in type 2 diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^dd09eb43]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Insulin for T2D should only be used when no other treatment is available, to prevent short-term acute complications (such as hyperosmolar coma or ketoacidosis in case of an infection) or when the lack of insulin per se assigns patients in a high risk group.

This meta-analysis, as well as two other recent meta-analyses on metformin and sulfonylureas, discredits blood glucose and HbA1c as valid surrogate outcomes for morbidity in T2D. The HbA1c target should be reconsidered since "the lower the better" model is censored by the increased mortality in the ACCORD study. "The lower the better" and "treat to target" models, greatly increased requirements for insulin in patients with T2D (in the UK: 137,000 patients in 1991 vs. 421,000 in 2010).

The most appropriate treatment target in T2D is reduction in global cardiovascular risk. Although statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have shown their efficacy to reduce cardiovascular mortality, for now, insulin has not.

Implications for research

Further long-term studies are needed to establish whether insulin is beneficial in T2D.

### Hypertonic saline versus other intracranial pressure-lowering agents for people with acute traumatic brain injury [^3beb2e64]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Increased intracranial pressure has been shown to be strongly associated with poor neurological outcomes and mortality for patients with acute traumatic brain injury. Currently, most efforts to treat these injuries focus on controlling the intracranial pressure. Hypertonic saline is a hyperosmolar therapy that is used in traumatic brain injury to reduce intracranial pressure. The effectiveness of hypertonic saline compared with other intracranial pressure-lowering agents in the management of acute traumatic brain injury is still debated, both in the short and the long term.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of hypertonic saline versus other intracranial pressure-lowering agents in the management of acute traumatic brain injury.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Injuries' Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase Classic+Embase, ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, as well as trials registers, on 11 December 2019. We supplemented these searches with searches of four major Chinese databases on 19 September 2018. We also checked bibliographies, and contacted trial authors to identify additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We sought to identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of hypertonic saline versus other intracranial pressure-lowering agents for people with acute traumatic brain injury of any severity. We excluded cross-over trials as incompatible with assessing long-term outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results to identify potentially eligible trials and extracted data using a standard data extraction form. Outcome measures included: mortality at end of follow-up (all-cause); death or disability (as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)); uncontrolled intracranial pressure (defined as failure to decrease the intracranial pressure to target and/or requiring additional intervention); and adverse events e.g. rebound phenomena; pulmonary oedema; acute renal failure during treatment).

Main Results

Six trials, involving data from 287 people, met the inclusion criteria. The majority of participants (91%) had a diagnosis of severe traumatic brain injury. We had concerns about particular domains of risk of bias in each trial, as physicians were not reliably blinded to allocation, two trials contained participants with conditions other than traumatic brain injury and in one trial, we had concerns about missing data for important outcomes. The original protocol was available for only one trial and other trials (where registered) were registered retrospectively. Meta-analysis for both the primary outcome (mortality at final follow-up) and for 'poor outcome' as per conventionally dichotomised GOS criteria, was only possible for two trials. Synthesis of long-term outcomes was inhibited by the fact that two trials ceased data collection within two hours of a single bolus dose of an intracranial pressure-lowering agent and one at discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). Only three trials collected data after participants were released from hospital, one of which did not report mortality and reported a 'poor outcome' by GOS criteria in an unconventional way. Substantial missing data in a key trial meant that in meta-analysis we report 'best-case' and 'worst-case' estimates alongside available case analysis. In no scenario did we discern a clear difference between treatments for either mortality or poor neurological outcome. Due to variation in modes of drug administration (including whether it followed or did not follow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, as well as different follow-up times and ways of reporting changes in intracranial pressure, as well as no uniform definition of 'uncontrolled intracranial pressure', we did not perform meta-analysis for this outcome and report results narratively, by individual trial. Trials tended to report both treatments to be effective in reducing elevated intracranial pressure but that hypertonic saline had increased benefits, usually adding that pretreatment factors need to be considered (e.g. serum sodium and both system and brain haemodynamics). No trial provided data for our other outcomes of interest. We consider evidence quality for all outcomes to be very low, as assessed by GRADE; we downgraded all conclusions due to imprecision (small sample size), indirectness (due to choice of measurement and/or selection of participants without traumatic brain injury), and in some cases, risk of bias and inconsistency. Only one of the included trials reported data on adverse effects; a rebound phenomenon, which was present only in the comparator group (mannitol). None of the trials reported data on pulmonary oedema or acute renal failure during treatment. On the whole, trial authors do not seem to have rigorously sought to collect data on adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

This review set out to find trials comparing hypertonic saline to a potential range of other intracranial pressure-lowering agents, but only identified trials comparing it with mannitol or mannitol in combination with glycerol. Based on limited data, there is weak evidence to suggest that hypertonic saline is no better than mannitol in efficacy and safety in the long-term management of acute traumatic brain injury. Future research should be comprised of large, multi-site trials, prospectively registered, reported in accordance with current best practice. Trials should investigate issues such as the type of traumatic brain injury suffered by participants and concentration of infusion and length of time over which the infusion is given.

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state in adults with diabetes [^99739a6f]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is a medical emergency, which differs from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and requires a different approach. The present article summarizes the recent guidance on HHS that has been produced by the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care, available in full at http://www.diabetologists-abcd.org.uk/JBDS/JBDS_IP_HHS_Adults.pdf. HHS has a higher mortality rate than DKA and may be complicated by myocardial infarction, stroke, seizures, cerebral oedema and central pontine myelinolysis and there is some evidence that rapid changes in osmolality during treatment may be the precipitant of central pontine myelinolysis. Whilst DKA presents within hours of onset, HHS comes on over many days, and the dehydration and metabolic disturbances are more extreme. The key points in these HHS guidelines include: (1) monitoring of the response to treatment: (i) measure or calculate the serum osmolality regularly to monitor the response to treatment and (ii) aim to reduce osmolality by 3–8 mOsm/kg/h; (2) fluid and insulin administration: (i) use i.v. 0.9% sodium chloride solution as the principal fluid to restore circulating volume and reverse dehydration, (ii) fluid replacement alone will cause a fall in blood glucose (BG) level, (iii) withhold insulin until the BG level is no longer falling with i.v. fluids alone (unless ketonaemic), (iv) an initial rise in sodium level is expected and is not itself an indication for hypotonic fluids and (v) early use of insulin (before fluids) may be detrimental; and (3) delivery of care: (i) The diabetes specialist team should be involved as soon as possible and (ii) patients should be nursed in areas where staff are experienced in the management of HHS.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^abef6839]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Cerebral edema — evidence quality and research priorities — "Despite their ubiquity, the overall quality of the literature in this area is low and there is a paucity of rigorous prospective trials", and "The strength of the panel's recommendations was frequently downgraded due to the limited evidence available comparing the different treatments". Accordingly, "There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for the individualized care of patients with cerebral edema". Research goals "should address specific questions, adequately reflect the scope of planned patient enrollment, and select reasonable outcome measures", and efforts "should consider and report on the osmolar equivalents of agents used in the management of cerebral edema, assess the effects of specific ranges of sodium levels on markers of edema, evaluate the best duration of therapy, standardize and report basic care protocols, and consider the impact of all pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on clinical outcomes".

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults: an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes societies (JBDS) for inpatient care group [^4440be1b]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Use of the previous version of this guidelinehas confirmed that fluid replacement alone will lower glucose concentrations. An FRIII should not be started as part of the initial treatment unless significant ketonaemia is present (> 3.0 mmol/L or urine ketones > 2+). In all other circumstances, intravenous fluids should be administered first, and an FRIII only started once the glucose has stopped falling. The risk of adding insulin at the start of treatment will lead to larger osmotic shifts leading to neurological complications. In addition, adding IV insulin too early will also potentially lead to circulatory collapse(see Appendix S2).

If the IV fluids and FRIII are managed appropriately, the fall in serum osmolality should be within the target range of 3.0–8.0 mOsm/kg/h. If the rate is faster than this, it increases the risk of neurological complications such as cerebral oedema and osmotic demyelination.

4.4 Fluid replacement

The aim of treatment should be to replace approximately 50% of estimated fluid loss within the first 12 h and the remainder in the following 12 h. However, this will in part be determined by the initial severity, degree of renal impairment and co‐morbidities such as heart failure, which may limit the speed of correction. An initial target glucose of between 10 and 15 mmol/L is a reasonable goal until the person is eating and drinking normally, and then an individual target glucose (if appropriate 6–10 mmol/L) should be set by the diabetes specialist team and the person with diabetes. Ideally, people will recover quickly enough to replace the water deficit themselves by taking fluids orally.

The goal of the initial therapy is expansion of the intravascular and extravascular volume and to restore peripheral perfusion. There are almost no data on the benefits or risks of particular fluid replacement regimens in HHS. Controversies persist around the speed and type of fluid replacement, and a systematic review is being undertaken. However, a Cochrane review recommended the use of crystalloid fluids rather than colloid in critically ill individuals because the use of crystalloids is associated with less need for further interventions. As the majority of electrolyte losses are sodium, chloride and potassium, the initial fluid replacement of choice should be 0.9% sodium chloride solution with potassium added as required.

### Beneficial effect of pretreatment hyperosmolality on outcome in severe traumatic brain injury: evidence from a South Korean multicenter registry and propensity score matching analysis [^1c10902b]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperosmolar therapy has long been a cornerstone in managing increased intracranial pressure and improving outcomes in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). This therapy hinges on elevating serum osmolality, creating an osmotic gradient that draws excess water from the brain's cellular and interstitial compartments and effectively reducing cerebral edema. Given this information, we hypothesized that the serum hyperosmolality prior to any treatment could significantly impact the clinical outcomes of patients with severe TBI, potentially mitigating secondary cerebral edema after trauma.

Methods

Data were extracted from the Korean Multi-center Traumatic Brain Injury data bank, encompassing 4628 patients with TBI admitted between January 2016 and December 2018. Of these, 507 patients diagnosed with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 9) were selected for comprehensive analysis across four data domains: clinical, laboratory, initial computed tomography scan, and treatment. Serum osmolality was assessed prior to treatment, and the hyperosmolar group was defined by a pretreatment serum osmolality exceeding 320 mOsm/L, whereas favorable outcomes were characterized by a modified Rankin Scale score of ≤ 3 at 6 months after trauma. Multivariate regression with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and propensity score matching were used to dissect the data set.

Results

Multivariate analysis showed serum osmolality is significantly associated with clinical outcome in patients with severe TBI (p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff value for predicting favorable outcome was 331 mOsm/L, with a sensitivity of 38.9% and a specificity of 87.7%. Notably, the propensity score matching analysis comparing patients with pretreatment serum hyperosmolality with those without indicated a markedly improved functional outcome in the former group (32.5% vs 18.8%, p = 0.025).

Conclusions

The present study has uncovered a significant correlation between the pretreatment serum osmolality and the clinical outcomes of patients with severe TBI. These findings offer a novel perspective, indicating that a serum hyperosmolality prior to any treatment might potentially have a neuroprotective effect in patients with severe TBI.

History of Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State

Robert Rushakoff, MD

Key ideas

The Bradshawe Lecture on Diabetic Coma by Julius Dreschfeld classified the cases of diabetic coma, according to the symptoms, into three groups: drowsiness, alcohol intoxication, and dyspnea.
The use of insulin in the treatment of diabetic coma at home and in the hospital began around 1945.
Further treatment methods such as bicarbonate therapy for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) continued to be developed.

Summary

A foundational reference for the clinical presentation of hyperglycemic crisis is the 1886 Bradshawe Lecture by Julius Dreschfeld. He describes three presentations of "diabetic coma". The most common one demonstrates dyspnea, severe abdominal pain, and includes Adolph Kussmaul's description of breathlessness and "expelled air with a chloroform-like smell". Another occurs in "stout" patients beyond age 40, with a rapid pulse and urine with high sugar but no acetone. These represent DKA and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS); the third form described is less clear. Identified precipitants included excessive exercise, physiologic or mental stress, and an exclusively meat diet, with treatment by avoiding the same. In the 1970s, low dose insulin (on average 46 units of insulin) vs high dose (236 units of insulin) was found to cause less hypokalemia and hypoglycemia and became standard. Further studies showed all insulin delivery routes effectively treated DKA, but no improvement with the use of bicarbonate.

### Pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^ec3987f1]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is an important complication of diabetes in children and is the most frequent diabetes-related cause of death in childhood. The pathophysiology of this condition can be viewed as an exaggeration of the normal physiologic mechanisms responsible for maintaining an adequate fuel supply to the brain and other tissues during periods of fasting and physiologic stress. The optimal therapy has been a subject of controversy, particularly because the most frequent serious complication of diabetic ketoacidosis-cerebral edema-and the relationship of this complication to treatment are incompletely understood. In this article, the author reviews the pathophysiology of diabetic ketoacidosis and its complications and presents an evidence-based approach to the management of this condition.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^e1ade482]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Mixed HHS and DKA — children with severe hypertonicity plus substantial ketosis and acidosis — requires combined management: Treatment must take into account potential complications of both diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS), with frequent reassessment of circulatory status and fluid balance to guide therapy. To maintain adequate circulatory volume, the rate of fluid administration will generally exceed that used for treatment of typical DKA, and the rate of electrolyte administration required to maintain normal concentrations is also likely to exceed that used for DKA. Insulin treatment is necessary to resolve ketosis and continuous insulin infusion should be started after the initial fluid bolus(es), recognizing that insulin administration may produce a more rapid decline in glucose concentration and therefore a potential decrease in intravascular volume.

### Hyperosmolar syndrome in a patient with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus [^1efd7a73]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is found mostly in type 2 diabetic patients with marked hyperglycemia. HHS is a metabolic emergency and is associated with a high mortality rate. It is characterized by extreme dehydration and neurologic symptoms, which are related directly to the degree of hyperosmolality. We describe a 65-year-old patient who was admitted because of impaired consciousness caused by HHS. The relevant clinical and laboratory findings are discussed, and a brief overview of the pathophysiology and therapeutic management is provided.

### Increased use of hyperosmolar therapy for suspected clinically apparent brain injury in pediatric patients with diabetic ketoacidosis during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic [^600120a4]. Pediatric Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

The incidence of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) increased during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to investigate whether rates of hyperosmolar therapy administration for suspected clinically apparent brain injury (CABI) complicating DKA also increased during this period as compared to the three years immediately preceding the pandemic and to compare the characteristics of patients with suspected CABI before the pandemic, patients with suspected CABI during the peak of the pandemic, and those with DKA but without suspected CABI during the pandemic. Patients aged ≤ 18 years presenting with DKA before (March 11, 2017-March 10, 2020) and during the peak of the pandemic (March 11, 2020-March 10, 2021) were identified through a rigorous search of two databases. Predefined criteria were used to diagnose suspected CABI. Biochemical, clinical, and sociodemographic data were collected from a comprehensive review of the electronic medical record. The proportion of patients with DKA who received hyperosmolar therapy was significantly higher (P = 0.014) during the pandemic compared to the prepandemic period; however, this was only significant among patients with newly diagnosed diabetes. Both groups with suspected CABI had more severe acidosis, lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores, and longer hospital admissions (P < 0.001 for all) than cases without suspected CABI. During the pandemic, the blood urea nitrogen concentration was significantly higher in patients with suspected CABI than those without suspected CABI, suggesting they were more severely dehydrated. The clinical, biochemical, and sociodemographic characteristics of patients with suspected CABI were indistinguishable before and during the pandemic. In conclusion, administration of hyperosmolar therapy for suspected CABI was more common during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly a result of delayed presentation, highlighting the need for increased awareness and early recognition of the signs and symptoms of diabetes and DKA, especially during future surges of highly transmissible infections.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^c54599f2]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome: review of acute decompensated diabetes in adult patients [^6a304466]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) are life threatening complications that occur in patients with diabetes. In addition to timely identification of the precipitating cause, the first step in acute management of these disorders includes aggressive administration of intravenous fluids with appropriate replacement of electrolytes (primarily potassium). In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, this is always followed by administration of insulin, usually via an intravenous insulin infusion that is continued until resolution of ketonemia, but potentially via the subcutaneous route in mild cases. Careful monitoring by experienced physicians is needed during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS. Common pitfalls in management include premature termination of intravenous insulin therapy and insufficient timing or dosing of subcutaneous insulin before discontinuation of intravenous insulin. This review covers recommendations for acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS, the complications associated with these disorders, and methods for preventing recurrence. It also discusses why many patients who present with these disorders are at high risk for hospital readmissions, early morbidity, and mortality well beyond the acute presentation.

### Increased use of hyperosmolar therapy for suspected clinically apparent brain injury in pediatric patients with diabetic ketoacidosis during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic [^e42c8ee1]. Pediatric Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

The following clinical variables were collected: date and time of presentation, transfer status, new diabetes diagnosis versus established diabetes, type of diabetes (type 1, type 2, or other), initial and lowest Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, length of stay (in days), and presence of suspected or documented infection. For patients presenting with suspected CABI, the following additional variables were collected: neurologic status and results of the cranial computed tomography (CT) imaging, the time from presentation to the initiation of hyperosmolar therapy (as a surrogate for the time to development of suspected CABI), the time between the first and last hyperosmolar treatment (as a surrogate for duration of treatment), the number of hyperosmolar treatments, and patient outcome.

The following sociodemographic variables were collected: age at presentation, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance type, caregiver scores on the Newest Vital Sign health literacy assessment tool (expressed as an average for multiple caregiver scores), caregiver occupations, presence of an intact family (defined as families in which both biological parents are present in the home), and presence of developmental/psychiatric concerns in the child. Caregiver occupations were assigned a skill level from 0–3 (0 if unemployed) based on a system modified from the International Standard Classification of Occupations (expressed as an average for multiple caregiver skill levels). As the caregiver occupation code was chosen as a surrogate for socioeconomic status, caregivers not working outside the home (e.g. stay-at-home parents and homemakers) were assigned a skill level of 0 if they did not have an income.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^a58b368a]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric HHS — targets for glucose and sodium correction during fluid therapy emphasize gradual changes: With adequate rehydration, serum glucose concentrations should decline by 75 to 100 mg/dL/hr (4.1–5.5 mmol/L/h), and lack of appropriate decline in serum glucose should prompt reassessment and evaluation of renal function; although there are no data to indicate an optimal rate of decline in serum sodium, a rate of 0.5 mEq/L per hour has been recommended for hypernatremic dehydration; replacement of urinary losses is recommended, and 0.45% saline solution approximates the typical urine sodium concentration during osmotic diuresis.

### A child with altered sensorium, hyperglycemia, and elevated troponins [^6ceaa2ea]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) are potentially life-threatening complications of diabetes mellitus. Although DKA and HHS share similar features, they are distinct clinical entities requiring different treatment measures.

Objective

This case illustrates that the clinical distinction between these two entities can be difficult at times, especially in children who can present with an overlapping picture.

Case Report

We report an interesting case of a 12-year-old whose initial presentation of diabetes was a mixed picture of hyperosmolar DKA and HHS coma complicated by myocardial strain and acute renal insufficiency. The myocardial strain resolved completely with resolution of the metabolic abnormalities.

Conclusions

Emergency physicians should be cognizant of varied presentations of hyperglycemic emergencies in children to initiate appropriate management for better outcomes.

### Potassium chloride, dextrose monohydrate and sodium chloride (potassium chloride in dextrose and sodium chloride) [^ed0a523d]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State

The use of dextrose infusions in patients with impaired glucose tolerance may worsen hyperglycemia. Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, coma, and death.

Hyperglycemia is associated with an increase in serum osmolality, resulting in osmotic diuresis, dehydration and electrolyte losses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Patients with underlying central nervous system disease and renal impairment who receive dextrose infusions, may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat hyperglycemia to maintain concentrations within normal limits while administering Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection. Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose concentrations.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state… [^6cfa6a46]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Various changes in mental status may manifest, ranging from complete lucidity to disorientation to lethargy to coma. The degree of neurologic impairment is related directly to the effective serum osmolarity, 15 with coma often occurring once the serum osmolarity is greater than 350 mOsm per kg. Seizures are present in up to 25 percent of patients and may be generalized, focal, myoclonic jerking, or movement induced. 23 Hemiparesis may occur, 13, 23 but it is reversible with correction of the fluid deficit. 13 Serum potassium levels may be elevated or normal. 13 Creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and hematocrit levels are almost always elevated. 24 Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state produces significant total body losses of many electrolytes.
10.

Treatment The treatment of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state involves a five-pronged approach: vigorous intravenous rehydration, electrolyte replacement, administration of intravenous insulin, diagnosis and management of precipitating and coexisting problems, and prevention. FLUID REPLACEMENT The first and most important step in the treatment of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is aggressive fluid replacement, which should begin with an estimate of the fluid deficit. If the glucose level does not decrease by 50 to 70 mg per dL per hour, this rate of administration may be doubled. Once the serum glucose concentration is below 300 mg per dL, dextrose should be added to the intravenous fluid and insulin should be titrated by a low-dose sliding scale until the mental obtundation and hyperosmolarity are resolved.

When the patient is able to eat, subcutaneous insulin or the previous treatment regimen may be initiated.

Cerebral edema should be treated with intravenous mannitol in a dose of 1 to 2 g per kg over 30 minutes and intravenous dexamethasone. Slowing the correction of hyperosmolarity in children may prevent cerebral edema. 28.

### Diagnosis and acute management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children and adolescents [^3335a16f]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is an indolent process characterized by significantly increased levels of serum glucose, high osmolality, and electrolyte abnormalities. The incidence of HHS has steadily risen in the pediatric population over the past several years. Patients with HHS often present with profound dehydration, fatigue, and early mental status changes. Primary emergency management of HHS involves fluid replacement, hemodynamic support, correcting electrolyte derangements, and addressing complications and underlying illnesses. Insulin is not an initial therapy in HHS and should be considered only after the patient's fluids and electrolytes have been repleted. Unlike in diabetic ketoacidosis, HHS patients are not acidotic, although children may present with mixed HHS/diabetic ketoacidosis syndromes. Complications of HHS include thrombosis, rhabdomyolysis, and, rarely, malignant hyperthermia.

Abstract

Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State (HHS) is a medical emergency associated with high mortality. It occurs less frequently than diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), affects those with pre‐existing/new type 2 diabetes mellitus and increasingly affecting children/younger adults. Mixed DKA/HHS may occur. The JBDS HHS care pathway consists of 3 themes (clinical assessment and monitoring, interventions, assessments and prevention of harm) and 5 phases of therapy (0–60 min, 1–6, 6–12, 12–24 and 24–72 h). Clinical features of HHS include marked hypovolaemia, osmolality ≥ 320 mOsm/kg using [(2×Na +) + glucose+urea], marked hyperglycaemia ≥ 30 mmol/L, without significant ketonaemia (≤ 3.0 mmol/L), without significant acidosis (pH > 7.3) and bicarbonate ≥ 15 mmol/L. Aims of the therapy are to improve clinical status/replace fluid losses by 24 h, gradual decline in osmolality (3.0–8.0 mOsm/kg/h to minimise the risk of neurological complications), blood glucose 10–15 mmol/L in the first 24 h, prevent hypoglycaemia/hypokalaemia and prevent harm (VTE, osmotic demyelination, fluid overload, foot ulceration). Underlying precipitants must be identified and treated. Interventions include: (1) intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride to restore circulating volume (fluid losses 100–220 ml/kg, caution in elderly), (2) fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) should be commenced once osmolality stops falling with fluid replacement unless there is ketonaemia (FRIII should be commenced at the same time as IV fluids). (3) glucose infusion (5% or 10%) should be started once glucose < 14 mmol/L and (4) potassium replacement according to potassium levels. HHS resolution criteria are: osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg, hypovolaemia corrected (urine output ≥ 0.5 ml/kg/h), cognitive status returned to pre‐morbid state and blood glucose < 15 mmol/L.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^a130289d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Complications (thrombosis, rhabdomyolysis, malignant hyperthermia, and CE) in pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) include thromboembolism for which prophylactic low-dose heparin lacks proven benefit and carries bleeding risk; therefore, heparin treatment should generally be reserved for children with central venous catheters who are immobile for > 24 to 48 hours, with compression stockings considered. Rhabdomyolysis may occur and monitoring of creatine kinase concentration every 2 to 3 hours is recommended, with prompt nephrology consultation if suspected. A malignant hyperthermialike syndrome has been reported, and treatment with dantrolene should be initiated early for children with fever and a rise in creatine kinase. Altered mental status is common with osmolality greater than 330 mOsm/Kg at presentation, but declines after improvement in the hyperosmolar state are unusual and should prompt further investigation; patients should be monitored for headache and changes in consciousness, and severe dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, and hypertonicity are far more frequent causes of death than CE, so concerns about possible CE should not deter giving necessary fluids.

### Association between continuous hyperosmolar therapy and survival in patients with traumatic brain injury-a multicentre prospective cohort study and systematic review [^651d2268]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Alteration of renal function has also been reported during CHT. Our results revealed no changes in urea or creatinine – suggesting no harm to the kidney. However, Froelich et al. reported a higher risk of pathological creatinine and urea levels in brain-injured patients receiving CHT without pre-specified biological monitoring. Taken together, these data underline the need to set predetermined thresholds for natraemia, enabling a slow and controlled increase in natraemia along with close biological monitoring.

This study has several weaknesses. First, this observational cohort demonstrates an association but not a causal link between CHT and survival. Second, continuous osmotherapy was performed in one centre, exposing our results to a centre effect. Even if we found little heterogeneity in the estimation of the treatment effects between the studies included in the meta-analysis, suggesting that the effect of the treatment is robust to inter-centre variations in clinical practice, we cannot definitively rule out that other interventions participate in the better outcomes of patients treated with CHT. Notably, moderate hypocapnia and decompressive craniectomy were less frequently used in the group of patients treated than in patients not treated with CHT. Moreover, the blood electrolyte levels were probably more frequently measured in the CHT group than in the control group. A protocol of care with frequent electrolyte measures could enhance the outcomes of critically ill patients, as severe dysnatraemia (> 160 mmol/L) is associated with death. However, protocol-based control of natraemia was used in the control group, and no severe dysnatraemia was apparent in this group (see Fig. 2a). Third, only three randomised trials were available for the review of literature. We have included five before/after studies or quasi-experimental studies because their study designs provide a good level of evidence and an accurate estimation of the effect of the intervention. The results of the systematic review were not significantly changed when only the randomised clinical trials were included. Fourth, the COBI cohort included patients with moderate to severe TBI while other studies covered in the systemic review included patients with severe brain injury. However, the heterogeneity between the subgroups (other studies vs. COBI cohort) for the risk of death was low (I 2 = 0%). Moreover, the international recommendations on the methodology of clinical trials, which aimed to improve the power of neuro-reanimation trials, argue for the use of inclusion criteria that are as broad as possible, as long as they are compatible with the mechanisms of action of the evaluated intervention. Since the secondary occurrence of ICH cannot be excluded in patients with moderate head trauma, patients with moderate to severe head trauma were included in this study. Fifth, the rate of pupillary abnormalities was higher in the COBI cohort than in recent studies in patients with moderate to severe TBI. The COBI cohort included patients with moderate to severe TBI requiring mechanical ventilation, for whom the GCS scores were frequently quoted early at the trauma scene, and CHT was administered only in patients with ICH. We therefore cannot exclude that the recorded GCS score underestimates trauma severity and patients with moderate TBI were kept in the analysis. Moreover, CHT was administrated in patients with moderate TBI only in the case of secondary neurologic deterioration and ICH. Finally, and despite the very low incidence of side effects recorded in the present results, it should be noted that our study was not powered for a description of side effects.

### Mannitol [^f3af9c6e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

During and following infusion of Mannitol Injection for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor the patient clinically and laboratory tests for changes in fluid and electrolyte status. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if renal function worsens [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

5.3 Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity

CNS toxicity manifested by, e.g., confusion, lethargy, coma, has been reported in patients treated with mannitol, some resulting in death, in particular in the presence of impaired renal function CNS toxicity may result from high serum mannitol concentrations, serum hyperosmolarity resulting in intracellular dehydration within CNS, hyponatremia or other disturbances of electrolyte and acid/base balance secondary to mannitol administration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].

At high concentrations, mannitol may cross the blood brain barrier and interfere with the ability of the brain to maintain the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid especially in the presence of acidosis.

In patients with pre-existing compromise of the blood brain barrier, the risk of increasing cerebral edema (general and focal) associated with repeated or continued use of Mannitol Injection must be individually weighed against the expected benefits.

A rebound increase of intracranial pressure may occur several hours after the infusion. Patients with a compromised blood brain barrier are at increased risk.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^10fd32c7]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children — conclusions on epidemiology and management: HHS may be occurring with increased frequency in children and adolescents, and although population-based data are lacking, available literature suggests that pediatric HHS may differ from adult HHS. Pediatric HHS appears to occur most often in otherwise healthy children and adolescents with type 2 DM, particularly in obese African American males, and both rhabdomyolysis and a malignant hyperthermia-like syndrome may occur as complications. Mixed features of DKA and HHS may be more common in children than in adults, there may be a tendency toward inadequate rehydration in children with HHS, and increased awareness of pediatric HHS and differences in management strategy between DKA and HHS are needed to improve outcomes.

### Diabetic emergencies-ketoacidosis, hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state and hypoglycaemia [^526d24e2]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) and hypoglycaemia are serious complications of diabetes mellitus that require prompt recognition, diagnosis and treatment. DKA and HHS are characterized by insulinopaenia and severe hyperglycaemia; clinically, these two conditions differ only by the degree of dehydration and the severity of metabolic acidosis. The overall mortality recorded among children and adults with DKA is < 1%. Mortality among patients with HHS is ~10-fold higher than that associated with DKA. The prognosis and outcome of patients with DKA or HHS are determined by the severity of dehydration, the presence of comorbidities and age > 60 years. The estimated annual cost of hospital treatment for patients experiencing hyperglycaemic crises in the USA exceeds US$2 billion. Hypoglycaemia is a frequent and serious adverse effect of antidiabetic therapy that is associated with both immediate and delayed adverse clinical outcomes, as well as increased economic costs. Inpatients who develop hypoglycaemia are likely to experience a long duration of hospital stay and increased mortality. This Review describes the clinical presentation, precipitating causes, diagnosis and acute management of these diabetic emergencies, including a discussion of practical strategies for their prevention.

### Clinical manifestations… [^fb1bafce]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

2, 7 However, many patients have no clouding of consciousness. 2, 7 When present, coma is primarily the result of hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity, not acidosis. 2, 3, 7, 8 Coma rarely occurs unless the measured osmolarity exceeds 340 mOsm per L or the effective osmolarity is greater than 320 mOsm per L. Treatment FLUIDS Patients with hyperosmolarity who have adequate urine output and blood pressure on hospital admission may become oliguric and hypotensive after insulin lowers their glucose level to 250 to 350 mg per dL unless total body fluid losses are concomitantly replaced. Once the glucosuric osmotic load dissipates, urine output falls to oliguric levels until total body water and intravascular volume are restored. These patients suffer from the "latent shock of dehydration". If the effective osmolarity exceeds 320 mOsm per L, significant hyperosmolarity exists, and this value guides the tonicity of the replacement solution used.

4, 10 Above an effective osmolarity of 320 mOsm per L, hypotonic crystalloids may be employed; below this value, isotonic electrolyte solutions are preferred. Recommendations for potassium administration in adults are provided in Table 2. 4 Potassium replacement should begin in the first hour of treatment if urine output is adequate, the electrocardiogram shows no evidence of hyperkalemia and the serum potassium level is less than 5 mEq per L. The use of potassium acetate, potassium phosphate or a mixture of the two avoids administration of excess chloride. 2, 4. Complications Concern, primarily focused on the potential for cerebral edema, has been expressed about the effects of rapid fluid administration, the use of hypotonic fluids to treat hyperglycemic hyperosmolarity and the dangers of rapid reduction of the effective osmolarity to 320 mOsm per L or the glucose level to 250 to 300 mg per dL.

Cerebral edema occurs almost exclusively in young patients who have nonhyperosmolar diabetes with diabetic ketoacidosis. This complication is exceedingly rare in adult patients with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity and infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity or infusion reaction develops [see Contraindications (4)]. Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.2 Hyperglycemia and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State

The use of dextrose infusions in patients with impaired glucose tolerance may worsen hyperglycemia. Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, coma, and death.

Hyperglycemia is associated with an increase in serum osmolality, resulting in osmotic diuresis, dehydration and electrolyte losses. Patients with underlying central nervous system disease and renal impairment who receive dextrose infusions, may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat hyperglycemia to maintain concentrations within normal limits while administering Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection. Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose concentrations.

8 COMPLICATIONS

HHS has high mortality because it may be due to, or complicated by, vascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial and venous thrombosis. Neurological complications, such as cerebral oedema and ODS are uncommon but can be seen as a complication of the rapid changes in osmolality during treatment of HHS.

### Olanzapine-induced hyperglycaemic coma and neuroleptic malignant syndrome: case report and review of literature [^9b1ce7b2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Although the relationship between antipsychotic medication, particularly second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), and metabolic disturbance is increasingly accepted, there is an important, but little recognised, potential interaction between this and the other important serious adverse effect of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). We report a case of a 35-year old female who developed new onset type II diabetes mellitus with hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic coma and acute renal failure following treatment with a SGA for a first manic episode. The history is strongly suggestive of concurrent NMS. This case raises important questions about non-ketotic, hyperosmolar diabetic coma with antipsychotics, the possible association between hyperglycaemia and hyperthermia, and the direction of causality in this, the recognition of either syndrome when they co-exist and management issues in such patients. These questions are considered in the context of currently available literature.

### Severe complications after initial management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis with a standard diabetic ketoacidosis protocol [^a6d4cb6a]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a clinical entity not identical to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and with a markedly higher mortality. Children with HHS can also present with concomitant DKA. Patients with HHS (with or without DKA) are profoundly dehydrated but often receive inadequate fluid resuscitation as well as intravenous insulin therapy based on traditional DKA protocols, and this can lead to devastating consequences. In this article, we briefly review HHS along with a report of an adolescent who presented with HHS and DKA and was initially managed as DKA. She went into hypotensive shock and developed severe, multiorgan failure. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of HHS and its differences from DKA in terms of initial management is crucial to guide management and improve outcomes. Additionally, fluid therapy in amounts concordant with the degree of dehydration remains the mainstay therapy.

### Ziprasidone hydrochloride (Geodon) [^3b672ead]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus

Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of hyperglycemia or diabetes in patients treated with GEODON. Although fewer patients have been treated with GEODON, it is not known if this more limited experience is the sole reason for the paucity of such reports. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.

Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults: an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes societies (JBDS) for inpatient care group [^28cc673c]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum sodium, a close approximation to osmolality in the absence of hyperglycaemia, may be reassuringly normal or even low in the presence of hyperglycaemia. The addition of glucose to the extracellular space causes an osmotic shift of free water into the extracellular fluid and a resultant dilution of serum sodium.

There are many different formulae to calculate osmolality, for example [(2×Na +) + glucose + urea], [2(Na + +K +) + glucose], and [2×Na + + glucose]. The best approximation to measured osmolality can be calculated using the formula [(2×Na +) + glucose + urea], though a more accurate formula has been derived. However, as urea is an ineffective osmolyte, it can be omitted from the equation to allow calculation of tonicity (or effective osmolality). This is of the greatest importance when someone is hyponatraemic since tonicity indicates risk of cerebral oedema, that is, hypo‐osmolality.

Thus, an individual with a Na + 122 mmol/L, glucose 13 mmol/L, urea 23 mmol/L has a calculated osmolality of 280 mOsm/kg and an effective osmolality of 257 mOsm/kg, whereas a person with a Na + 122 mmol/L, glucose 30 mmol/L, urea 4 mmol/L has a calculated osmolality of 278 mOsm/kg and an effective osmolality of 274 mOsm/kg. So the person with the raised urea has a much lower effective osmolality and is therefore at a greater risk of osmotic demyelination should correction of the hyponatraemia be too fast. The hyponatraemia in an individual with a blood glucose of 30 mmol/L is largely dilutional and will correct as the glucose falls (corrected Na + = 122 + (2.4 × 4) = 131.6). In the hyperosmolar state, osmolality is useful as an indicator of severity and for monitoring the rate of change with treatment. If frequent measurement of osmolality is not practical, osmolality should be calculated using the formula [(2×Na +) + glucose + urea]. This is the formula used throughout this guideline.

### Aripiprazole (Opipza) [^5398e3ab]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus

Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with aripiprazole [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics.

Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics, including OPIPZA, should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the atypical antipsychotic drug.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome [^8286691b]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS) are life-threatening acute metabolic complications of diabetes mellitus. Although there are some important differences, the pathophysiology, the presenting clinical challenge, and the treatment of these metabolic derangements are similar. Each of these complications can be seen in type 1 or type 2 diabetes, although DKA is usually seen in patients with type 1 diabetes and HHNS in patients with type 2 disease. The clinical management of these syndromes involves careful evaluation and correction of the metabolic and volume status of the patient, identification and treatment of precipitating and comorbid conditions, a smooth transition to a long-term treatment regimen, and a plan to prevent recurrence.
