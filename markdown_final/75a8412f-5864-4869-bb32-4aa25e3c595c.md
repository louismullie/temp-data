## Question

What are the common causes of vision loss in diabetic patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of vision loss in diabetic patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary retinal causes, especially diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Then, I should verify non-retinal ocular complications that occur more frequently or earlier in diabetes. Next, I will review the underlying pathophysiology to connect mechanisms with clinical manifestations. After that, I need to quantify risk factors and epidemiology to contextualize prevalence and progression. Finally, I will integrate screening and treatment implications, including guideline-based care and vision rehabilitation, and close with a concise synthesis of the hierarchy of causes and their relative contributions to vision loss.

> Let me first confirm the dominant retinal etiologies. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of new cases of blindness and moderate-to-severe vision impairment among working-age adults, driven by microvascular injury and neuroretinal degeneration, with progression from nonproliferative to proliferative stages and frequent co-occurrence of diabetic macular edema, which itself is the most common mechanism of central vision loss in diabetes and can present at any retinopathy stage [^112nGMge] [^1137CAFT] [^113aJupZ]. Wait, let me verify the relative burden of vision-threatening disease: in U.S. adults with diabetes aged 40 and older, about 40% have diabetic retinopathy and roughly 8% have vision-threatening retinopathy, while DME affects approximately 3.8% nationally, reinforcing that DME and proliferative DR are the principal drivers of sight loss in this population [^11392T1R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about non-retinal causes; I should review them carefully. Cataracts occur earlier and more frequently in diabetes and are a major cause of reversible vision loss, with population data showing cataracts in about one-third of adults with diabetes and cataract-related vision loss in nearly one in ten, increasing with diabetes duration, which aligns with clinical experience of accelerated lenticular opacification in hyperglycemia [^114r6QV4] [^1171ydHo]. I need to check glaucoma next: open-angle glaucoma is more prevalent in diabetes and contributes to irreversible field loss, with population estimates around 7% in adults with diabetes and vision loss due to glaucoma in about 2%, again rising with longer disease duration, supporting the need for routine intraocular pressure assessment in diabetes eye care [^114r6QV4] [^1171ydHo]. But wait, what if the patient reports sudden diplopia or ptosis? Cranial neuropathies, particularly III and VI, can cause binocular vision disturbances and are more common in diabetes, warranting prompt evaluation for microvascular etiology and exclusion of other causes [^1133ewUt].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure mechanistic coherence. Chronic hyperglycemia drives a cascade including advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, protein kinase C activation, and inflammatory signaling that injure retinal capillary pericytes and endothelial cells, leading to microaneurysms, capillary nonperfusion, and breakdown of the blood–retinal barrier; VEGF upregulation then promotes leakage and neovascularization, culminating in DME, vitreous hemorrhage, and tractional retinal detachment with profound vision loss [^1137CAFT] [^116VVvZm]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should also consider neurodegeneration: emerging evidence indicates that retinal neurons, including photoreceptors, can be damaged early, even before clinically evident microvascular disease, which may explain functional deficits such as reduced contrast sensitivity and color vision changes that precede structural findings on fundus exam [^113aJupZ] [^1143eHmp].

> Next, I should review risk factors and epidemiology to frame pretest probabilities. Duration of diabetes is the strongest predictor, with risk rising sharply after 10 years and exceeding 75% after 15 years, and poor glycemic control markedly increases incidence and progression; hypertension and dyslipidemia independently worsen outcomes, and early intensive glycemic control confers a durable "metabolic memory" benefit on retinopathy risk, while fenofibrate added to statin therapy in type 2 diabetes slows DR progression, likely via pleiotropic effects beyond lipid lowering [^1176K3Pt] [^112zUgr5]. I should double-check the burden projections: the number of Americans with diabetic retinopathy is expected to triple by 2050, underscoring the urgency of prevention and early intervention strategies [^11392T1R].

> Let me consider the clinical manifestations and functional impact to ensure I'm not missing subtle deficits. Patients may report blurred or fluctuating vision, floaters from hemorrhage, metamorphopsia or central scotoma with macular involvement, and difficulty with night vision, glare, or color discrimination; importantly, visual acuity can be deceptively preserved early, while contrast sensitivity and color vision may already be impaired, so targeted testing can unmask deficits not captured by Snellen acuity alone [^114VgkXv] [^114qv3Vt]. Hold on, I should verify the functional consequences: diabetes-related vision loss impairs activities of daily living, self-care, and mental health, reinforcing the need for vision rehabilitation alongside disease-directed therapy [^116L5w97] [^115HCAem].

> I need to ensure screening and surveillance recommendations are precise. Annual dilated eye examinations are advised for most adults with diabetes, with more frequent visits for advancing retinopathy or DME, and telemedicine-based retinal photography can expand access where specialists are limited; for type 1 diabetes, the first exam should occur within 5 years of diagnosis, whereas for type 2 diabetes an initial comprehensive exam should occur at or soon after diagnosis given the high prevalence of existing retinopathy at presentation [^117RCp7g] [^112Yq6BT] [^117KYm5W]. Wait, let me verify interval flexibility: in well-controlled type 2 patients without retinopathy, extending screening to every 2 years may be safe and cost-effective, but individualized risk assessment remains essential to avoid missed progression in higher-risk patients [^113AjqxB] [^112Ng6RF].

> Next, I should review treatment strategies and make sure I align with current standards. For DME, intravitreal anti-VEGF agents are first-line and reduce vision loss risk substantially, though a meaningful minority have persistent edema and require ongoing therapy; for proliferative DR, panretinal photocoagulation remains a key modality to reduce severe vision loss, with anti-VEGF increasingly used as adjunct or alternative in selected cases, and vitrectomy is indicated for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage or tractional detachment; systemic optimization of glucose, blood pressure, and lipids is foundational and should be coordinated with endocrinology and primary care [^111VZB2D] [^116tYhHq] [^116Ykqv6]. I should confirm that vision rehabilitation is not an afterthought: guidelines emphasize early referral for low-vision services to preserve function and quality of life when impairment persists despite disease control [^113VmWWv] [^116sUsd9].

> But wait, what about disparities and care gaps that could alter outcomes even with the right treatments? Minority populations experience higher prevalence of vision-threatening DR and DME yet receive fewer anti-VEGF injections, and loss to follow-up is common in PDR and DME, both of which contribute to preventable vision loss; addressing social determinants, access, and navigation support is therefore integral to effective DR care pathways [^1126JDjJ] [^116Ykqv6]. I should also note that real-world data show rising rates of diabetes eye complications over time, highlighting the need for proactive screening and timely intervention at the population level [^1126JDjJ].

> Let me synthesize the hierarchy of causes to ensure internal consistency. Primary drivers of permanent vision loss in diabetes are diabetic retinopathy with progression to proliferative disease and diabetic macular edema, which together account for most diabetes-related blindness in working-age adults; secondary but significant contributors include cataracts, open-angle glaucoma, and cranial neuropathies, all of which occur more frequently in diabetes and can compound functional impairment; early neuroretinal dysfunction and contrast/color deficits may precede visible vasculopathy, explaining dissociation between acuity and real-world visual performance early in the disease course [^112nGMge] [^1137CAFT] [^113aJupZ]. Hold on, I should verify that this synthesis aligns with guideline priorities: contemporary standards emphasize comprehensive risk-factor control, risk-stratified screening, timely anti-VEGF or laser therapy for vision-threatening disease, and mandatory vision rehabilitation referral for those with persistent impairment, which matches the pathophysiologic and epidemiologic picture described above [^112SUPe1] [^113VmWWv].

---

Vision loss in diabetes is primarily due to **diabetic retinopathy** (DR) and **diabetic macular edema** (DME) [^111Kx5ez], with DR the most common microvascular complication and DME the leading cause of vision loss in diabetes [^113y1G2H] [^113AKuNw]. Other important causes include **cataracts**, **glaucoma**, and **optic neuropathy** [^1115g1Bi]. Risk increases with duration of diabetes, poor glycemic control, and hypertension [^1176K3Pt]; early detection via annual dilated eye exams [^117RCp7g] and timely treatment (anti-VEGF, laser, vitrectomy) [^115EWG2e] can prevent or slow vision loss [^114x9zVH].

---

## Diabetic retinopathy (DR)

DR is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of **vision loss in working-age adults** [^1137CAFT] [^111UwAoa]. It progresses from non-proliferative (NPDR) to proliferative (PDR) forms, with the latter carrying a higher risk of severe vision loss [^113aJupZ].

- **Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR)**: Characterized by microaneurysms, retinal hemorrhages, and exudates. Vision loss is typically mild unless macular edema is present [^111DaSK7] [^113aJupZ].

- **Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)**: Characterized by neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, and tractional retinal detachment, leading to severe vision loss [^113aJupZ].

---

## Diabetic macular edema (DME)

DME is a complication of DR characterized by **retinal thickening and fluid accumulation** in the macula, causing significant central vision loss [^112vS9J8]. It can occur at any stage of DR and is the leading cause of vision loss in diabetic patients [^116Ykqv6].

---

## Cataracts

Diabetic patients have an increased risk of cataracts, particularly **age-related cataracts**, which develop earlier and progress more rapidly than in non-diabetic individuals [^1171ydHo]. Cataracts cause progressive vision loss and can significantly impair daily functioning [^114r6QV4].

---

## Glaucoma

Diabetic patients have a higher risk of glaucoma, including **open-angle and neovascular glaucoma** [^111pZkvK]. Neovascular glaucoma, associated with PDR, is particularly aggressive and can lead to rapid vision loss [^117Tq1FJ].

---

## Optic neuropathy

Diabetic optic neuropathy, including **non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)**, can cause sudden, painless vision loss [^notfound]. It is less common than DR and DME but can result in permanent vision impairment [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors for vision loss in diabetic patients

Several factors increase the risk of vision loss in diabetic patients:

- **Duration of diabetes**: Longer duration significantly increases the risk of DR and other complications [^1176K3Pt].

- **Poor glycemic control**: Elevated HbA1c levels are strongly associated with increased risk and progression of DR [^116dAHLJ].

- **Hypertension**: High blood pressure exacerbates retinal damage and increases the risk of vision loss [^111pZkvK].

- **Dyslipidemia**: Abnormal lipid levels contribute to retinopathy progression [^112zUgr5].

- **Ethnicity**: Certain ethnic groups, such as African Americans and Hispanics, have higher rates of DR and vision loss [^111Fuorm].

---

## Prevention and management strategies

Effective prevention and management of vision loss in diabetic patients include:

- **Regular eye examinations**: Annual dilated eye exams are essential for early detection and treatment of DR and other complications [^117RCp7g].

- **Glycemic control**: Intensive control of blood glucose levels significantly reduces the risk and progression of DR [^114x9zVH].

- **Blood pressure control**: Strict blood pressure management reduces the risk of retinopathy and other microvascular complications [^1176K3Pt].

- **Treatment options**: Anti-VEGF injections, laser photocoagulation, and vitrectomy are effective treatments for DR and DME [^1137CAFT] [^114x9zVH].

- **Patient education**: Educating patients about the importance of regular eye care and adherence to treatment plans is crucial [^116Qg2a1].

---

Vision loss in diabetic patients is primarily due to **diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema**, with additional contributions from cataracts, glaucoma, and optic neuropathy [^113aJupZ]. Early detection through regular eye examinations and strict control of glycemic and blood pressure levels are essential to prevent or delay vision loss [^112SUPe1].

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^113bvCZo]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion — Vision impairment from diabetes is a significant public health problem which affects the health, economic well-being, and productivity of individuals, families, and society as a whole. Steps to prevent visual impairment in persons with diabetes include optimal glycemic control, the treatment of ancillary risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol levels, and ongoing comprehensive eye examinations for the early detection and, when needed, treatment of eye and vision problems. All persons with diabetes should be informed of the possibility of developing retinopathy or other nonretinal ocular complications, with or without symptoms, and of the associated threat of vision loss. The natural course and treatment of diabetic retinopathy should be discussed with the person, and the importance of lifelong eye examinations should be stressed; they should be made aware of the benefits of early diagnosis and available treatment options in preserving vision, and should be advised of the availability of vision rehabilitation services to address functional vision issues and provided with referral or treatment for diabetes-related vision loss. Until therapies are available to prevent or cure diabetic retinopathy and other ocular complications of diabetes, emphasis must be placed on diagnosis, careful follow-up, and timely treatment, and doctors of optometry may be the first to examine persons with signs of diabetes or diabetic retinopathy; therefore, they have a key role in identifying individuals with undiagnosed diabetes and reinforcing the importance of diabetes control and appropriate follow-up care to lower the risk for vision loss.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^112rfjyC]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Overview of diabetes mellitus — burden, prevalence, and eye care — Diabetes mellitus is a significant, costly, and potentially preventable public health problem and the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. The economic burden of diabetes (all ages) reached nearly $404 billion in 2017, consisting of $327.2 billion for diagnosed diabetes, $31.7 billion for undiagnosed diabetes, $43.4 billion for prediabetes, and nearly $1.8 billion for gestational diabetes. Depending on the criteria used, an estimated 12 to 14 percent of adults in the United States have diabetes, and in 2015 about 1.5 million new cases of diabetes (6.7 per 1,000 persons) were diagnosed in Americans aged 18 years or older; if the current trend continues, one in three adults in the United States may have diabetes by 2050. Diabetic retinopathy is the most significant vision-threatening complication of diabetes, yet more than 1/3 of persons with diabetes do not receive an annual eye examination; the annual rate of dilated eye examinations for adults in the United States varies by state from 49.8 percent in Indiana to 76.7 percent in Massachusetts, and overall 61.6 percent of American adults with diabetes received a dilated eye examination from 2014–2015. Studies including the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS), Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC), and the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) provide evidence-based care interventions that rely on early referral for eye care with prompt and appropriate intervention to lessen the risk of, and the severity of, vision loss related to diabetes, and timely diagnosis, intensive diabetes treatment, and consistent, long-term follow-up evaluations for persons with diabetes are essential for effective care, which can preserve vision and substantially lower the risk of vision loss.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^116L5w97]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Management of persons with visual impairment — prevalence and impact: Vision plays an important role in everyday activities, and as the population increases and ages, vision loss from diabetic retinopathy and DME will also increase, with approximately 11 percent of adults in the United States with diabetes having some form of visual impairment. People with diabetes-related vision loss can face challenges in managing their diabetes and completing activities of daily living, which may lead to depression, anxiety, social isolation, and difficulties at home, in school, or at work, and individuals with diabetes are at increased risk of chronic vision loss, subsequent functional impairment, and resultant disability; visual impairment has physical, psychological, behavioral, and social consequences that affect patients, their family, friends, and caregivers.

Vision rehabilitation for diabetes-related vision loss — CONSENSUS-BASED ACTION STATEMENT: Persons who experience vision loss from diabetes should be counseled on the availability and scope of vision rehabilitation care and provided, or referred for, a comprehensive examination of their visual impairment by a practitioner trained or experienced in vision rehabilitation. Evidence Quality: There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. Benefit and Harm Assessment: Implementation of this recommendation is likely to enhance visual abilities and quality of life for individuals suffering from vision loss due to diabetes, and a Veterans Affairs model involves at least 10 hours of low-vision therapy, including a home visit and assigned homework to encourage practice, for patients with moderate and severe vision loss from macular diseases.

### Review of therapeutic advances in diabetic retinopathy [^113pty4m]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is a common microvascular complication of prolonged diabetes. It is one of the leading causes of vision loss in working age adults and a significant source of morbidity. To reduce the incidence and severity of diabetic retinopathy, it is important to identify patients at risk and promptly implement intensive glycemic and hypertensive control. To date, there are many interventions that can limit moderate and severe vision loss in people with diabetes, including laser photocoagulation, vitrectomy surgery, and intravitreal pharmacological injections. This review aims to define the different stages of diabetic retinopathy and the important therapeutic advances developed to address the major causes of vision loss in each stage.

### Visual complications in diabetes mellitus: beyond retinopathy [^1115g1Bi]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss in people with diabetes mellitus; however, other causes of visual impairment/loss include other retinal and non-retinal visual problems, including glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy and cataracts. Additionally, when a person with diabetes complains of visual disturbance despite a visual acuity of 6/6, abnormalities in refraction, contrast sensitivity, straylight and amplitude of accommodation should be considered. We review and highlight these visual problems for physicians who manage people with diabetes to ensure timely referral and treatment to limit visual disability, which can have a significant impact on daily living, especially for those participating in sports and driving.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^113y1G2H]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

American Optometric Association guideline — introduction and clinical rationale: Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both, and the chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage to organs including the eyes. Type 2 diabetes is often undiagnosed for many years, during which time individuals are at risk of developing microvascular and macrovascular complications including visual impairment and blindness. Diabetic retinopathy, the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of new cases of vision impairment among people 20 to 74 years of age, and intensive treatment to maintain blood glucose concentrations close to the normal range has been shown to reduce the risk of development and decrease the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy; early intensive glycemic control appears to have a lasting protective effect due to "metabolic memory". Undiagnosed disease is common, with an estimated 10 to 25 percent of people with diabetes unaware they have the disease, and signs found during an eye examination may be the initial indication; about 20 to 40 percent of individuals with type 2 diabetes already have retinopathy at the time of first diagnosis. Doctors of optometry may be the first health care practitioners to examine persons with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus or ocular manifestations of diabetes, and this Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline provides examination and management recommendations designed to preserve vision and reduce the risk of vision loss through timely diagnosis, intervention, determination of need for future evaluation, and appropriate referral.

### Frontiers in diabetic retinal disease [^114ZxNHk]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinal disease (DRD) remains a leading cause of vision loss and blindness globally. Although treatments can be effective when given at vision-threatening stages of DRD, there is a lack of knowledge about the earliest mechanisms leading to the development of clinically evident DRD. Recent advances in retinal imaging methods for patients with diabetes allow a more precise and granular characterization of the different stages of DRD than is provided by the classic Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale based on fundus photographs. In addition, recent clinical studies have yielded more information on how to adjust blood glucose levels, lipid levels and blood pressure to minimize the risk of DRD. Given the incomplete success of current therapies, there is a critical need for better understanding of the mechanisms underlying DRD and novel treatment targets that address the entire neurovascular retina. Moreover, the causes for interindividual variability in the development of DRD in patients with similar glycemic history and other metabolic factors are not yet clarified either. Finally, greater focus on patients' experience with visual disabilities and treatment effects should be addressed in research in this field.

### Diabetic retinopathy: pathogenic mechanisms and current treatments [^115AAech]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Since diabetes is now a global epidemic, the incidence of retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness in patients aged 20–74 years, is also expected to rise to alarming levels. The risk of development and progression of diabetic retinopathy is closely associated with the type and duration of diabetes, blood glucose, blood pressure and possibly lipids. It is an unmet medical need that can lead to severe and irreversible loss of vision in people of working age worldwide. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the clinical and anatomical changes during the progression of retinopathy, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms that link hyperglycemia with retinal tissue damage, current treatments, and the emerging pharmacological therapies for this sight-threatening complication of diabetes.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^11392T1R]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Epidemiology of diabetic retinal disease and vision loss — prevalence and burden: In the United States, an estimated 40.3 percent of adults ≥ 40 years of age with diabetes have diabetic retinopathy and 8.2 percent have vision-threatening retinopathy (proliferative or severe nonproliferative retinopathy and/or macular edema). The worldwide prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in persons with diabetes is estimated to be 34.6 percent, with 10.2 percent having vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy. In addition, approximately 3.8 percent of individuals in the United States ≥ 40 years of age with diabetes have DME, and globally, 6.8 percent of persons 20 to 79 years of age are estimated to have DME. In 2010, 800,000 people worldwide were blind and 3.7 million were visually impaired due to diabetic retinopathy, representing an increase of 27 percent and 64 percent, respectively, from 1990 to 2010. The number of Americans aged 40 years or older with diabetic retinopathy and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy is projected to triple by 2050.

### Ocular associations of diabetes other than diabetic retinopathy [^111pZkvK]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is the most well-known ocular complication of diabetes and the leading cause of blindness among people 20–64 years of age in the U.S. Up to 4 million Americans with diabetes, 40 years of age and older, have retinopathy, and nearly 1 million have sight-threatening retinopathy. In major clinical trials, tight control of blood glucose and blood pressure has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of retinopathy and associated blindness.

A range of ocular diseases is also associated with diabetes, which may lead to vision loss. However, some of these ocular conditions may not be familiar to noneye clinicians. In this review, we aim to highlight the frequencies, clinical presentations, natural histories, and management of these ocular conditions. Physicians who manage patients with diabetes may benefit from knowledge of these associated conditions and are thus able to ensure adequate and timely referral and treatment. Routine eye screening for retinopathy of individuals with diabetes offers the opportunity to detect these other ocular diseases early, many of which are sight threatening. Physician education remains an important public health strategy in the prevention of vision loss in patients with diabetes.

Prognosis and follow-up — diabetes and ocular complications: Disability and premature death are not inevitable consequences of diabetes, and lifestyle and behavioral modification and pharmacotherapy can delay progression to type 2 diabetes among persons with prediabetes; (Evidence Grade: A) however, all patients with diabetes mellitus are at risk for the development of ocular-related complications, and adherence to treatment recommendations to maintain optimal control of blood glucose levels is a substantial factor in slowing the development and progression of complications of diabetes. Studies indicate that the rates of progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and severe vision loss are substantially lower, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes, than reported thirty or more years ago, and these findings may be due to improvements in the management of risk factors (hyperglycemia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia) and overall diabetes care, along with earlier identification of diabetes.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^117RCp7g]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Diabetic eye care — consensus-based action statement indicates that individuals with diabetes should receive at least annual dilated eye examinations, and more frequent examination may be needed depending on the presence of co-morbidities, changes in vision and/or the severity, progression, or treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Evidence Quality: There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. Benefit and Harm Assessment: Implementation of this recommendation is likely to result in the earlier diagnosis and treatment of potentially sight-threatening vision problems. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion.

### Vision loss in older adults [^112ZSRdi]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Vision loss affects 37 million Americans older than 50 years and one in four who are older than 80 years. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concludes that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in adults older than 65 years. However, family physicians play a critical role in identifying persons who are at risk of vision loss, counseling patients, and referring patients for disease-specific treatment. The conditions that cause most cases of vision loss in older patients are age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, ocular complications of diabetes mellitus, and age-related cataracts. Vitamin supplements can delay the progression of age-related macular degeneration. Intravitreal injection of a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor can preserve vision in the neovascular form of macular degeneration. Medicated eye drops reduce intraocular pressure and can delay the progression of vision loss in patients with glaucoma, but adherence to treatment is poor. Laser trabeculoplasty also lowers intraocular pressure and preserves vision in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, but long-term studies are needed to identify who is most likely to benefit from surgery. Tight glycemic control in adults with diabetes slows the progression of diabetic retinopathy, but must be balanced against the risks of hypoglycemia and death in older adults. Fenofibrate also slows progression of diabetic retinopathy. Panretinal photocoagulation is the mainstay of treatment for diabetic retinopathy, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors slow vision loss resulting from diabetic macular edema. Preoperative testing before cataract surgery does not improve outcomes and is not recommended.

Diagnosis of ocular complications of diabetes mellitus — individuals with undiagnosed or suspected diabetes mellitus: A comprehensive eye and vision examination may be the basis for the initial diagnosis in an individual who is unaware of having diabetes mellitus, and the examination provides the means to evaluate the structure, function and health of the eyes and visual system, obtain information to explain symptoms and diagnose the cause of signs, and identify other ocular or systemic conditions that may exist without symptoms. The examination is a dynamic and interactive process that involves collecting subjective data directly from the patient and obtaining objective data by observation, examination, and testing.

### Current understanding of the molecular and cellular pathology of diabetic retinopathy [^116VVvZm]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Diabetes mellitus has profound effects on multiple organ systems; however, the loss of vision caused by diabetic retinopathy might be one of the most impactful in a patient's life. The retina is a highly metabolically active tissue that requires a complex interaction of cells, spanning light sensing photoreceptors to neurons that transfer the electrochemical signal to the brain with support by glia and vascular tissue. Neuronal function depends on a complex inter-dependency of retinal cells that includes the formation of a blood-retinal barrier. This dynamic system is negatively affected by diabetes mellitus, which alters normal cell-cell interactions and leads to profound vascular abnormalities, loss of the blood-retinal barrier and impaired neuronal function. Understanding the normal cell signalling interactions and how they are altered by diabetes mellitus has already led to novel therapies that have improved visual outcomes in many patients. Research highlighted in this Review has led to a new understanding of retinal pathophysiology during diabetes mellitus and has uncovered potential new therapeutic avenues to treat this debilitating disease.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116sUsd9]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of diabetic retinopathy, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to counsel patients experiencing vision loss from diabetes on the availability and scope of vision rehabilitation care and provide or refer for a comprehensive evaluation of visual impairment by a practitioner experienced in vision rehabilitation. Provide patients with educational materials and resources for eye care support, in addition to self-management education (glycemic management and hypoglycemia awareness).

### Diabetic retinopathy [^1137CAFT]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus and is a major cause of vision loss in middle-aged and elderly people. One-third of people with diabetes have DR. Severe stages of DR include proliferative DR, caused by the abnormal growth of new retinal blood vessels, and diabetic macular oedema, in which there is exudation and oedema in the central part of the retina. DR is strongly associated with a prolonged duration of diabetes, hyperglycaemia and hypertension. It is traditionally regarded as a microvascular disease, but retinal neurodegeneration is also involved. Complex interrelated pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by hyperglycaemia underlie the development of DR. These mechanisms include genetic and epigenetic factors, increased production of free radicals, advanced glycosylation end products, inflammatory factors and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Optimal control of blood glucose and blood pressure in individuals with diabetes remains the cornerstone for preventing the development and arresting the progression of DR. Anti-VEGF therapy is currently indicated for diabetic macular oedema associated with vision loss, whereas laser photocoagulation prevents severe vision loss in eyes with proliferative DR. These measures, together with increasing public awareness and access to regular screening for DR with retinal photography, and the development of new treatments to address early disease stages, will lead to better outcomes and prevent blindness for patients with DR.

### Guidelines on diabetic eye care: the international council of ophthalmology recommendations for screening, follow-up, referral, and treatment based on resource settings [^112Yq6BT]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global epidemic and affects populations in both developing and developed countries, with differing health care and resource levels. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major complication of DM and a leading cause of vision loss in working middle-aged adults. Vision loss from DR can be prevented with broad-level public health strategies, but these need to be tailored to a country's and population's resource setting. Designing DR screening programs, with appropriate and timely referral to facilities with trained eye care professionals, and using cost-effective treatment for vision-threatening levels of DR can prevent vision loss. The International Council of Ophthalmology Guidelines for Diabetic Eye Care 2017 summarize and offer a comprehensive guide for DR screening, referral and follow-up schedules for DR, and appropriate management of vision-threatening DR, including diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative DR, for countries with high- and low- or intermediate-resource settings. The guidelines include updated evidence on screening and referral criteria, the minimum requirements for a screening vision and retinal examination, follow-up care, and management of DR and DME, including laser photocoagulation and appropriate use of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors and, in specific situations, intravitreal corticosteroids. Recommendations for management of DR in patients during pregnancy and with concomitant cataract also are included. The guidelines offer suggestions for monitoring outcomes and indicators of success at a population level.

Diabetes is a widespread and long‐lasting metabolic disorder marked by high blood sugar levels due to irregularities in insulin production or response. Ocular complications in diabetic patients, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic cataract, diabetic macular oedema, diabetic maculopathy, diabetic optic neuropathy and the indirect impact of other systemic complications, often accompany blindness and vision loss, particularly due to DR. DR is a common complication of diabetes, with a global prevalence of 20%–35% among diabetic patients. Globally, the prevalence of DR among adults is anticipated to surge, with projections indicating a 25.9% rise to 129.84 million by 2030, and a 55.6% increase to 160.50 million by 2045. This sharp increase will place a considerable burden on both society and the economy. Notably, DR is the leading cause of blindness and vision loss in the working‐age population. Furthermore, DR is an irreversible eye disease leading to blindness, which can be easily prevented but is challenging to treat. Many researchers are diligently exploring the mysteries behind the comprehensive breakdown of retinal microvasculature and neurons, as well as the continuous deterioration of vision caused by DR. DR is generally classified into background retinopathy (non‐proliferative DR) and proliferative DR, with diabetic macular oedema potentially developing at any stage. In the non‐proliferative DR stage, retinal microvascular damage and leakage, combined with ischaemia and hypoxia in the proliferative DR stage, and the abnormal proliferation of neovascularization, along with subsequent neuroretinal degeneration, collectively lead to blindness and vision loss. Additionally, studies have indicated that the transforming growth factor‐β signalling family plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of DR, due to its crucial involvement in maintaining retinal vascular homeostasis, pericyte differentiation and endothelial cell barrier function. In summary, there are numerous connections between diabetes and blindness as well as vision loss; however, there is a lack of sufficient research support.

1 Problem statement

Diabetic retinal disease (DRD) is the most common complication of diabetes mellitus, and one of the leading causes of vision-loss and blindness globally. Over the next few decades it will increase in incidence worldwide with correspondingly greater socioeconomic costs. Currently, approximately 103 million persons with diabetes have DRD, of which 19 million have clinically significant diabetic macular edema and 29 million have vision-threatening retinopathy.

Current therapies with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) and corticosteroid injections or laser photocoagulation address late-stage retinal vascular disease and do not target the factors initiating the disruption of normal visual function. Thus, a better understanding of the basic mechanisms and pathophysiology of DRD may provide new clinical practices to fully optimize visual outcomes for patients with diabetes.

The concepts included herein were formulated at the "Frontiers in Diabetes Complications" Conference held at the University of Michigan Caswell Diabetes Institute, May 11 and 12, 2022. The aim of this paper is to address how research should move forward to enable patients to maintain good vision by focusing on three interrelated areas of investigation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common complication of diabetes and remains the leading cause of blindness among working‐age individuals in most developed countries. 1, 2 DR has long been considered a microvascular complication of diabetes; however, growing evidence suggests that abnormalities in retinal function can be detected in patients without any evidence of microvascular abnormalities, and the American Diabetes Association defined DR as a highly specific neurovascular complication. 3, 4

DR is characterized by degeneration of endothelial cells and pericytes in retinal capillaries, which leads to ischaemia and the formation of microaneurysms. 5 In the advanced stage of the disease, pathologic proliferation of retinal vessels occurs via upregulation of proangiogenic mediators, particularly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 5 The resulting alterations of the retinal microvasculature and increased leakage from the retinal vessels may lead to sight‐threatening vision loss. 5 As the number of adults with diabetes worldwide is projected to increase from 415 million to 642 million by 2040, 6 DR represents a significant global health threat. According to recent estimates, DR accounts for 2.6 million cases of moderate to severe vision impairment worldwide, and this figure is expected to rise to 3.2 million by 2020. 7

A pooled analysis of data from 35 studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia estimated that in 2010, worldwide, the number of patients with diabetes who had DR or vision‐threatening DR (VTDR) was 92.6 and 28.4 million, corresponding to prevalence rates of 34.6% and 10.2%, respectively. 1 The global number of patients with diabetes who have retinopathy in the general population is projected to reach 191 million by 2030. 8

Longer duration of diabetes is a major risk factor for DR. 9 One study estimated that individuals who have type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) for 20 years or more are 2.7 times more likely to develop retinopathy (relative risk [RR], 2.69; 96% confidence interval, 2.47‐2.93), and are 8.7 times more likely to have VTDR (RR, 8.69; 96% CI, 7.10‐10.63), compared with individuals who have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for less than 10 years. 1 However, more recently, DR has also been reported with various prevalence rates in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. 2

### Factors associated with annual vision screening in diabetic adults: analysis of the 2019 national health interview survey [^113t4ypH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of diabetes worldwide and in the United States is on the rise. In 2019, 28.7 million people in the United States — or 8.7% of the US population — had diagnosed diabetes mellitus and an additional 8.5 million people were estimated to have undiagnosed diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common ocular complication of diabetes and the leading cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 18–64 years in the United States. About one in three people living with diabetes has some degree of diabetic retinopathy and one in ten will develop a vision-threatening form of the disease with these numbers expected to increase in the coming years. Minority Americans, rural Americans, and low-income adults have higher rates of DR and are less likely to receive regular screening exams than their non-minority and wealthier counterparts.

A routine annual eye exam to detect early DR and consequent treatment could prevent 90% of vision loss caused by diabetes. For this reason, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommends that all individuals with diagnosed diabetes receive annual dilated eye exams, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screenings minimally once every other year if there is no sign of retinopathy and glycemia is well controlled. Yet, studies have reported that between 23% and 65% of patients with diabetes are not receiving guideline-concordant care. Further, the proportion of Americans with diabetes who receive an annual dilated eye exam has not changed between 2005 and 2016. The US Department of Health and Human Services has identified increasing the proportion of adults with diabetes who have a yearly eye exam as a national public health objective in its Healthy People 2030 Report.

Patient education and counseling — patients with diabetes should be encouraged to report ocular symptoms and to understand the need for timely follow-up and rehabilitation resources. The vast majority of persons with diabetes will develop diabetic retinopathy at some point, and individuals need to be aware that retinopathy may exist even when vision is good and asymptomatic. Patients should be encouraged to report all ocular symptoms (e.g., blurred vision, flashes, floaters), and doctors of optometry should help their patients understand that timely follow-up examinations and management are critical to reduce the risk of vision loss from diabetic retinopathy. Individuals should also be informed about their higher risk for other nonretinal ocular complications (such as cataracts and glaucoma) and about available optometric vision rehabilitation care. A patient-centered communication style that uses active listening, elicits patient preferences and beliefs, and assesses potential literacy barriers to care can be used to optimize patient health outcomes.

2 Clinical presentation and diagnosis

DR is the commonest cause of vision loss in adults aged 20–74 years [1]. An estimated 285 million people suffer from diabetes, and one-third of these are affected by vision-threatening DR, which may include diabetic macular edema (DMO) or proliferative DR (pDR) [8].

In patients with type I diabetes, pDR is the most prevalent vision-threatening condition. In type II diabetics however, DMO is more common, and this explains the significant increase seen with the prevalence of DMO over recent years, in which everincreasing levels of obesity in the western world have been implicated [1].

Clinically, pDR and DMO may present with a variety of symptomatic ailments and variability between patients is common. During the early stages of the disease, patients are often asymptomatic but progress over time to develop microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities [9]. Upon examination, this can manifest as dark spots occluding vision, blurred vision, impaired color vision, and eventually vision loss if treatment is not effective [10]. As DR progresses, DMO may occur, defined as the presence of retinal thickening and hard exudates within 500 µm of the center of the macula [11]. Additionally, some patients demonstrate severe pDR in which aberrant neovascularization leads to the formation of highly permeable blood vessels across the retina.

To diagnose DR, ophthalmologists use fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess retinal blood vessel permeability (leakage) and thickness, respectively [12]. Newer techniques, including OCT angiography, are also becoming more widely used.

Practice principles and clinical considerations

In diabetes management, commitment of patients can deteriorate over time. People generally are more willing to consider behavioural change at the time of diabetes diagnosis. But enthusiasm typically wanes, with condition fatigue emerging with therapy escalation. Poor glucose control is often explained by clinical inertia, which limits or delays intensification of treatment when needed in the management of diabetes.

Diabetic retinopathy and DMO are the two major retinal complications that account for most diabetes-related vision loss. Left unchecked, approximately half of people with DMO at baseline lose 2 or more lines of visual acuity within 2 years. Hyperglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia are risk factors for both the development and progression of DR/DMO and there is substantial evidence that control over metabolic factors can effectively prevent development and progression of potentially blinding diabetic eye disease.

For optimal clinical care of patients with visual impairment due to DMO, several practice-based principles merit consideration in NHS ophthalmic service provision and care pathway redesign.

Diabetic retinopathy remains a frightening prospect to patients and frustrates physicians. Destruction of damaged retina by photocoagulation remains the primary treatment nearly 50 years after its introduction. The diabetes pandemic requires new approaches to understand the pathophysiology and improve the detection, prevention, and treatment of retinopathy. This perspective considers how the unique anatomy and physiology of the retina may predispose it to the metabolic stresses of diabetes. The roles of neural retinal alterations and impaired retinal insulin action in the pathogenesis of early retinopathy and the mechanisms of vision loss are emphasized. Potential means to overcome limitations of current animal models and diagnostic testing are also presented with the goal of accelerating therapies to manage retinopathy in the face of ongoing diabetes.

### Management of patients with newly diagnosed diabetic mellitus: ophthalmologic outcomes in intensive versus conventional glycemic control [^116dAHLJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Diabetic retinopathy, a microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus, is one of the most important causes of visual loss in developed countries. Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of intensive versus conventional glycemic control of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in terms of ophthalmologic outcome, pathogenesis of the early worsening of diabetic retinopathy, risk factors for early worsening and diabetic retinopathy progression.

Methods

A literature search on publications concerning glycaemic control in diabetic retinopathy and management of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus by intensive versus conventional glycaemic control.

Results

A total of 22 articles were reviewed after curation by the authors for relevance. Nineteen articles are randomized control trial, 2 articles are observational studies and 1 is clinical trial. Fifteen articles investigated the glycaemic control in T1DM-related diabetic retinopathy and 8 on T2DM-related diabetic retinopathy. The level of glycemia (in terms of HbA1c level) is significantly related to the diabetic retinopathy progression in both T1DM and T2DM. Intensive glycemic control was found to reduce the development of severe diabetic retinopathy, including severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, neovascularization, clinically significant macular edema and loss of vision. Early worsening of diabetic retinopathy commonly occurs during the first year of intensive treatment, especially those initially present with proliferative or severe non-proliferative retinopathy. However, most patients with early worsening can recover and their long-term ophthalmologic outcomes are better when compared to conventional glycemic control.

Conclusion

The current guideline on HbA1c level is considered sufficient for the minimization of diabetic retinopathy progression. More frequent monitoring for early worsening should be recommended for newly diagnosed diabetes cases already presenting with retinopathy.

### New treatments for diabetic retinopathy [^112NTVYf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is the major cause of vision loss in middle-aged adults. Alteration of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is the hallmark of diabetic retinopathy and, subsequently, hypoxia may result in retinal neovascularization. Tight control of systemic factors such as blood glucose, blood pressure and blood lipids is essential in the management of this disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most important factors responsible for alteration of the BRB. The introduction of anti-VEGF agents has revolutionized the therapeutic strategies used in people with diabetic retinopathy, and the use of laser therapy has been modified. In the present article, we examine the clinical features and pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy and review the current status of new treatment recommendations for this disease, and also explore some possible future therapies.

There has been a considerable advancement in the treatment of diabetes and understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying diabetic complications in the last 20 years. However, this advancement has not translated into a consistent reduction in diabetic retinopathy, one of the most frightening complications of diabetes mellitus. It is probable that greater attention to preventive intervention will help reduce the damage load in the next future, and that several drugs for the treatment of more advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy will become available. Competent strategies targeting prevention based on screening programs should be proposed to reduce the burden and to improve the clinical outcome of this devastating diabetes complication.

### Microvascular lesions of diabetic retinopathy: clues towards understanding pathogenesis? [^116rRPCd]. Eye (2009). Low credibility.

Retinopathy is a major complication of diabetes mellitus and this condition remains a leading cause of blindness in the working population of developed countries. As diabetic retinopathy progresses a range of neuroglial and microvascular abnormalities develop although it remains unclear how these pathologies relate to each other and their net contribution to retinal damage. From a haemodynamic perspective, evidence suggests that there is an early reduction in retinal perfusion before the onset of diabetic retinopathy followed by a gradual increase in blood flow as the complication progresses. The functional reduction in retinal blood flow observed during early diabetic retinopathy may be additive or synergistic to pro-inflammatory changes, leucostasis and vaso-occlusion and thus be intimately linked to the progressive ischaemic hypoxia and increased blood flow associated with later stages of the disease. In the current review a unifying framework is presented that explains how arteriolar dysfunction and haemodynamic changes may contribute to late stage microvascular pathology and vision loss in human diabetic retinopathy.

### Can the retinal screening interval be safely increased to 2 years for type 2 diabetic patients without retinopathy? [^113AjqxB]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

In the U.K., people with diabetes are typically screened for retinopathy annually. However, diabetic retinopathy sometimes has a slow progression rate. We developed a simulation model to predict the likely impact of screening patients with type 2 diabetes, who have not been diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy, every 2 years rather than annually. We aimed to assess whether or not such a policy would increase the proportion of patients who developed retinopathy-mediated vision loss compared with the current policy, along with the potential cost savings that could be achieved.

Research Design and Methods

We developed a model that simulates the progression of retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients, and the screening of these patients, to predict rates of retinopathy-mediated vision loss. We populated the model with data obtained from a National Health Service Foundation Trust. We generated comparative 15-year forecasts to assess the differences between the current and proposed screening policies. RESULTS The simulation model predicts that implementing a 2-year screening interval for type 2 diabetic patients without evidence of diabetic retinopathy does not increase their risk of vision loss. Furthermore, we predict that this policy could reduce screening costs by ~25%.

Conclusions

Screening people with type 2 diabetes, who have not yet developed retinopathy, every 2 years, rather than annually, is a safe and cost-effective strategy. Our findings support those of other studies, and we therefore recommend a review of the current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for diabetic retinopathy screening implemented in the U.K.

### Global causes of blindness and distance vision impairment 1990–2020: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113c3rGP]. The Lancet: Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Contemporary data for causes of vision impairment and blindness form an important basis of recommendations in public health policies. Refreshment of the Global Vision Database with recently published data sources permitted modelling of cause of vision loss data from 1990 to 2015, further disaggregation by cause, and forecasts to 2020.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analysed published and unpublished population-based data for the causes of vision impairment and blindness from 1980 to 2014. We identified population-based studies published before July 8, 2014, by searching online databases with no language restrictions (MEDLINE from Jan 1, 1946, and Embase from Jan 1, 1974, and the WHO Library Database). We fitted a series of regression models to estimate the proportion of moderate or severe vision impairment (defined as presenting visual acuity of < 6/18 but ≥ 3/60 in the better eye) and blindness (presenting visual acuity of < 3/60 in the better eye) by cause, age, region, and year.

Findings

We identified 288 studies of 3983541 participants contributing data from 98 countries. Among the global population with moderate or severe vision impairment in 2015 (216.6 million [80% uncertainty interval 98.5 million to 359.1 million]), the leading causes were uncorrected refractive error (116.3 million [49.4 million to 202.1 million]), cataract (52.6 million [18.2 million to 109.6 million]), age-related macular degeneration (8.4 million [0.9 million to 29.5 million]), glaucoma (4.0 million [0.6 million to 13.3 million]), and diabetic retinopathy (2.6 million [0.2 million to 9.9 million]). Among the global population who were blind in 2015 (36.0 million [12.9 million to 65.4 million]), the leading causes were cataract (12.6 million [3.4 million to 28.7 million]), uncorrected refractive error (7.4 million [2.4 million to 14.8 million]), and glaucoma (2.9 million [0.4 million to 9.9 million]). By 2020, among the global population with moderate or severe vision impairment (237.1 million [101.5 million to 399.0 million]), the number of people affected by uncorrected refractive error is anticipated to rise to 127.7 million (51.0 million to 225.3 million), by cataract to 57.1 million (17.9 million to 124.1 million), by age-related macular degeneration to 8.8 million (0.8 million to 32.1 million), by glaucoma to 4.5 million (0.5 million to 15.4 million), and by diabetic retinopathy to 3.2 million (0.2 million to 12.9 million). By 2020, among the global population who are blind (38.5 million [13.2 million to 70.9 million]), the number of patients blind because of cataract is anticipated to rise to 13.4 million (3.3 million to 31.6 million), because of uncorrected refractive error to 8.0 million (2.5 million to 16.3 million), and because of glaucoma to 3.2 million (0.4 million to 11.0 million). Cataract and uncorrected refractive error combined contributed to 55% of blindness and 77% of vision impairment in adults aged 50 years and older in 2015. World regions varied markedly in the causes of blindness and vision impairment in this age group, with a low prevalence of cataract (< 22% for blindness and 14.1–15.9% for vision impairment) and a high prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (> 14% of blindness) as causes in the high-income subregions. Blindness and vision impairment at all ages in 2015 due to diabetic retinopathy (odds ratio 2.52 [1.48–3.73]) and cataract (1.21 [1.17–1.25]) were more common among women than among men, whereas blindness and vision impairment due to glaucoma (0.71 [0.57–0.86]) and corneal opacity (0.54 [0.43–0.66]) were more common among men than among women, with no sex difference related to age-related macular degeneration (0.91 [0.70–1.14]).

Interpretation

The number of people affected by the common causes of vision loss has increased substantially as the population increases and ages. Preventable vision loss due to cataract (reversible with surgery) and refractive error (reversible with spectacle correction) continue to cause most cases of blindness and moderate or severe vision impairment in adults aged 50 years and older. A large scale-up of eye care provision to cope with the increasing numbers is needed to address avoidable vision loss.

### Diabetic retinopathy in 2011: further insights from new epidemiological studies and clinical trials [^1168F5Aq]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common and specific microvascular complication of diabetes and one of the leading global causes of preventable blindness. Population-based studies suggest that about one-third of the diabetic population have signs of DR and approximately one-tenth have vision-threatening stages of retinopathy, such as diabetic macular edema and proliferative retinopathy. Notwithstanding its effects on vision, DR is costly, substantially impacts on the patient's quality of life, and is linked with a greater risk of life-threatening systemic vascular complications.

Because blindness from DR is preventable from both public health screening and clinical management perspectives, it is important to precisely identify persons at risk for developing DR and those most likely to progress to severe vision-threatening stages. In this issue of Diabetes Care, Zavrelova et al. present a fascinating and informative article that discusses people with diabetes having distinct developmental patterns of DR and that there may be specific risk factors associated with different patterns of progression. From a large group of patients with type 2 diabetes (N = 3,343), the authors identified five clusters of developmental patterns of DR. The largest (cluster A) included patients who did not develop any form of DR over a 6-year period ("persistent no retinopathy"). Cluster B included patients with a high probability of a mild form of DR, which disappeared over time and thus are not at risk for vision loss. Two progressive clusters (C and D) were identified and differed from each other in severity and in speed of developing retinopathy. Finally, a fifth cluster (E) consisted of patients who had persistent proliferative DR, including previous laser treatment.

Ocular complications of diabetes mellitus — diabetic retinal disease overview: Diabetic retinal disease primarily manifests as diabetic retinopathy and/or diabetic macular edema (DME) and is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, and diabetic retinopathy remains a leading cause of moderate and severe visual loss among working-aged adults in the United States and other industrialized countries. Diabetic retinopathy is often asymptomatic early, and visual loss is primarily due to DME, vitreous hemorrhage, or traction retinal detachment; diabetes duration and sustained hyperglycemia are among the primary risk factors for development. Progression occurs in well-defined stages from mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) with increased vascular permeability, to moderate and severe NPDR with vascular closure, to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) with growth of new vessels on the retina and posterior surface of the vitreous. The level of retinopathy does not always correlate with visual function and can be severe without significant visual loss, and each level of NPDR is associated with a corresponding risk for progression to PDR and subsequent severe visual loss. DME may be present at any severity level of nonproliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy and is caused by breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier leading to intraretinal fluid accumulation in the macula, causing photoreceptor disruption and, if untreated, increased risk of loss of vision. Multiple biological pathways have been implicated, including sorbitol pathway, advanced glycation end-products, protein kinase C activation, oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, alteration in retinal blood flow, and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), with studies demonstrating changes in retinal biochemistry and physiology long before clinically evident disease. Early neuronal degeneration may develop in the inner retina before clinical retinopathy, with changes detectable by optical coherence tomography (OCT), contrast sensitivity, and pattern electroretinogram testing, though it has not been determined if these changes are caused directly by chronic hyperglycemia or vascular diabetic retinopathy (Evidence Grade: D).

American Optometric Association — patient education, counseling, and rehabilitation in diabetes eye care — states that persons with diabetes should be educated about the ocular signs and symptoms of diabetic retinopathy and other nonretinal ocular complications and encouraged to comply with follow-up eye examinations and care (Consensus Statement). Patients with diabetes should be encouraged to participate in lifestyle education and diabetes self-management programs (Evidence Grade: B, Recommendation). Individuals should be advised by their health care providers of the risks of smoking and encouraged to quit smoking and/or seek smoking cessation assistance (Evidence Grade: A, Strong Recommendation). Persons who experience vision loss from diabetes should be counseled on the availability and scope of vision rehabilitation care and provided, or referred for, a comprehensive examination of their visual impairment by a practitioner trained or experienced in vision rehabilitation (Consensus Statement). Referral for counseling is indicated for any individual experiencing difficulty dealing with vision and/or health issues associated with diabetes or diabetic retinopathy, and educational literature plus a list of support agencies and other resources should be made available (Consensus Statement).

### Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and its risk factors in rural patients with type 2 diabetes referring to beijing huairou hospital, China [^114HvPiC]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a systemic metabolic condition. In DM, insulin secretion in the body is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands, resulting in impaired metabolism of carbohydrates. International Diabetes Federation has estimated that the prevalence of DM will increase from 537 million people in 2021 to 643 million people by 2030 and 783 million by 2045. Thus, DM has been identified as one of the most challenging public health issues of the present century. DM is associated with disabling micro- and macrovascular complications. Diabetes-induced chronic hyperglycemia is thought to play a significant role in developing its vascular complications by causing impairments such as production of advanced glycation end-products, abnormal activation of signaling cascades (such as protein kinase C), increased production of C-reactive oxygen species (oxygen-contained molecules which can interact with other biomolecules and cause damage), and abnormal stimulation of hemodynamic regulation systems (such as renin-angiotensin system).

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common microvascular complication of diabetes and the main reason for visual impairment and blindness in diabetic patients. Diabetic macular edema, characterized by macular thickening and edema, is the most common contributing factor to vision loss in DR patients. The risk of DR development depends on diabetes duration and severity of hyperglycemia. Despite advances in optimal management of hyperglycemia and hypertension, regarded as systemic risk factors for DR, the prevalence of DR is still high in diabetic patients. Various factors contribute to the persistently high rate of DR, including its complex nature, which involves much more than hyperglycemia and hypertension; its late screening and diagnosis; and the lack of a comprehensive prevention approach consisting of regular ocular examinations, lifestyle modification, and patient education. The results of a comprehensive systematic review meta-analysis have indicated that the estimated prevalence of DR in diabetic patients was 28.4 overall (25.9% and 28.9% in women and men, respectively). DR is a progressive disease that is typically asymptomatic in its early stages. Thus, it can be easily overlooked by diabetic patients until later stages when the macula is affected and the vision has deteriorated. Moreover, when left untreated, DR can cause a gradual diminution of vision, ultimately leading to blindness due to its detrimental effects on the macula. Fundus screening and early intervention are crucial to prevent vision deterioration and mitigate the likelihood of blindness in diabetic patients.

### Five-year patterns of diabetic retinopathy progression in US clinical practice [^117Tq1FJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR), the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of adult-onset blindness worldwide.–DR is observable via retinal examination and regular screening is recommended for those with diabetes;, however, it may also be present in individuals who are unaware of their diabetes status.

The burden of DR is largely attributed to its progression from mild and asymptomatic to severe and vision-threatening. In earlier stages of nonproliferative DR (NPDR), damage to the retinal microvasculature occurs as a consequence of chronic hyperglycemia and manifests as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, and the development of diabetic macular edema (DME). Without appropriate treatment, the resulting retinal ischemia promotes neovascularization characteristic of proliferative DR (PDR), leading to vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, neovascular glaucoma, and severe vision loss. This progression is accompanied by worsening vision-related quality of life and increasing functional burden.

Clinical guidelines, including the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) Preferred Practice Pattern ® and American Diabetes Association (ADA) Position Statement, recommend regular monitoring for patients with DR to track disease progression and identify those who require referral and/or treatment. Recommended follow-up intervals are dependent on DR severity and the presence of DME, and have been shortened in updated AAO guidance to promote closer monitoring of patients with more advanced disease. Eye examinations are recommended every 1–2 years for patients with diabetes and no evidence of DR and then annually for those with mild NPDR. Current ADA and AAO guidelines recommend follow-up intervals of 6–9 months and 6–12 months for patients with moderate NPDR, respectively, decreasing to every 3–6 months and 3–4 months for those with severe NPDR. ADA guidelines recommend that patients with PDR are monitored every 3 months, whereas the AAO recommends follow-up every 2–4 months, depending on the presence of early or high-risk PDR. In addition to closer monitoring, patients with severe NPDR and PDR are typically indicated for treatment, with panretinal laser photocoagulation and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy representing the preferred treatment strategies in clinical guidance. For patients across all stages of DR, more frequent monitoring and earlier treatment are advised when concurrent DME, particularly center-involved DME, is present.

4 How do we develop more effective therapeutics?

Results from Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study (DCCT/EDIC) clearly showed that DRD and other complications of type 1 diabetes can be reduced with intensive metabolic control. However, there are other factors, many not well characterized, that contribute to the development and progression of DRD, and the degree of glucose control required for optimal glucose management benefit is difficult for many persons to achieve due to risks of hypoglycemia and the expenses of medications and devices. Thus, the goal is to determine means to benefit persons whose control is suboptimal as well as account for the other contributors to the development and progression of DRD. We submit that a multifaceted approach offers a potential way forward to eliminate visual loss and blindness from diabetes.

New understanding of DRD pathophysiology may arise from studies of human eyes using targeted and untargeted -omic analyses, similar to the path used to develop therapeutic targets for diabetic kidney disease. Structure-function analyses of various grades of DRD severity (no detectable DRD, mild nonproliferative retinopathy, moderate-severe nonproliferative retinopathy, diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy before and after standard treatment) can define the cellular defects that can be modified. Patients with diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy can continue to have impaired visual acuity despite anti-VEGF therapy. – These conditions are prime candidates for restorative approaches that benefit from the lessons derived from successful gene therapy for photoreceptor dystrophies.

Having the patient in focus is crucial for optimized treatment. How do the patients perceive a difference in vision after treatment? Is an improvement in visual acuity always related to a subjective improvement of vision? How can we better study how patients with diabetes live with visual disabilities? It is important to find ways to address psychosocial impacts of DRD on patients' lives. For this purpose, we suggest development of up-to-date, cloud-based, computer-assisted questionnaires for patient-reported outcomes. Also, we need to consider how we can best explain to newly-diagnosed diabetes patients the risk of late complications, taking into consideration the benefits of newer continuous blood glucose measurement devices, to combat fears of vision loss and blindness. We also believe that bringing patient voices into the research lab will help scientists think about disease within the context of patients' lives.

### Can the retinal screening interval be safely increased to 2 years for type 2 diabetic patients without retinopathy? [^112Ng6RF]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our model predicts that it is safe to screen type 2 diabetic patients who have not been diagnosed with retinopathy every 2 years, rather than annually, because the proportion of patients who develop retinopathy-mediated vision loss is unaffected. Furthermore, such a policy could reduce the cost of screening by ∼25%, thereby mitigating the problem of increased demand on screening services arising from significant increases in diabetic prevalence. The proportion of patients developing vision loss remains the same under the new policy because retinopathy progresses slowly, and a screening interval of 2 years is sufficiently frequent to identify patients at or before the proliferative stage, where treatment can be given.

By increasing the screening interval for patients without retinopathy, it is possible that early stages of retinopathy will be diagnosed later. However, even if a patient progresses through one or two stages of retinopathy in the 2-year interval, they will be screened more frequently once this is identified. It is unlikely that a lower-risk patient would progress from no retinopathy to the proliferative stage within a 2-year period, given the slow rate of progress of the disease for many patients.

The proportion of patients who lose their vision when considering maculopathy complications never exceeds that of the population that never develops maculopathy. Therefore, the 2-year screening interval predicted to be safe by ReSS would not be problematic for these patients.

Although the predictions generated by ReSS are compelling, it is prudent to highlight potential caveats to a proposed policy of 2-year screening intervals. First, diabetic care is most effective when individualized, and the importance of retinal clinicians using discretion on a case-by-case basis cannot be overstated. Diabetic retinopathy has been shown to be closely linked to individual risk factors, and in some cases such risks (longer duration of diabetes, poor metabolic control, or a dramatic change in glycemic levels) may necessitate more frequent screening because of the potentially higher rates of progression in these patients. Even if these patients do not show signs of retinopathy, more frequent screening may be prudent due to the increased risk for this subpopulation.

### Artificial intelligence for early detection of diabetes mellitus complications via retinal imaging [^112Jiuqy]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects more than 422 million people globally and is among the top ten causes of mortality and morbidity. It significantly increases the risk of macrovascular complications, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD), with mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases being two to six times higher in individuals with diabetes than in non-diabetic populations Additionally, it predisposes patients to microvascular complications, such as peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy, where the prevalence of end-stage kidney disease is ten times greater in diabetic populations, and retinopathy.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of preventable adult blindness with a prevalence of 34.6% among diabetic patients. DR can be categorized into non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR). NPDR is the early stage of DR, in which existing retinal blood vessels weaken, leading to microaneurysms and possible fluid leakage. It progresses from mild to severe stages without new blood vessel formation. However, PDR refers to the advanced stage of DR characterized by the growth of new abnormal blood vessels on the retina or optic disc, which can lead to serious vision complications. The incidence of sight-threatening diabetic macular edema (DME), where fluid accumulates in the macula due to leaking retinal blood vessels, causing swelling and potential vision loss, can occur at any stage and increases as DR progresses. With the rising prevalence and incidence of DM, the burden of DR and the consequent vision loss has increased. Globally, 1.4 million patients with DM have severe NPDR and PDR and will require treatment to prevent or slow further ‎vision deterioration. Therefore, the term referable DR refers to cases in which DR has progressed to a level requiring specialist referral, typically encompassing moderate NPDR or worse, or the presence of DME. Preemptive systematic and continual screening of asymptomatic diabetic patients, with early initiation of antiproliferative treatment where indicated, is obligatory for preventing clinical sequelae and reducing the human costs of DR.

### Developing and validating models to predict progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^114S9mi5]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Vision loss from diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-aged adults in the United States. In many patients, blindness associated with diabetic retinopathy can be prevented with appropriate and timely diagnosis and treatment. There have been many studies aimed at identifying risk factors associated with progression of diabetic retinopathy. Large population-based studies and randomized controlled trials, such as the landmark ETDRS in the 1980s, informed us of the risk factors for diabetic retinopathy progression and helped to establish guidelines for screening and management. However, there have been improvements in screening, diagnosis, and treatment for diabetes and diabetic retinopathy since many of those studies were first conducted, and the risk factors for diabetic retinopathy progression should be revisited.

In 2013, a study using health care claims data found that 6.7% of newly diagnosed nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) patients progressed to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) with a median follow-up time of 1.7 years. Using a similar method to the ETDRS paper, they determined the risk factors for progression to PDR at 5 years were hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), diabetic nephropathy, and non-healing ulcers. The investigators acknowledged intrinsic limitations to claims data including no clinical examination information (i.e. vitals, laboratory data, eye examination), no information about disease severity and duration using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 codes, and the inclusion of only insured patients. Electronic health record (EHR) data can help overcome many of these limitations. There has been significant adoption of EHRs in the United States in the last decade; they are used in nearly 90% of outpatient physician offices. Concurrently, newer statistical and machine-learning techniques have been developed, allowing researchers to better utilize and analyze the massive amount of EHR data available.

Summary: Diabetes is an escalating global health challenge.
Diabetes is an escalating global health challenge; global diabetes prevalence has doubled since 1980.
Type 2 diabetes, consequent upon complex pathophysiology but effectively driven by defective energy homoeostasis and closely linked with obesity and physical inactivity, accounts for the majority of people with diabetes worldwide.
Recent prevalence estimates of 2015 indicate that around 9% of the adult population in United Kingdom has diabetes (3.8 million people, of which 940 000 have diabetes that is undiagnosed).
Implementation of effective measures may help prevent type 2 diabetes and improve management to reduce diabetes-related complications and premature deaths; obesity and overweight are the strongest risk factors for type 2 diabetes.
The National Diabetes Audit shows that those aged under 65 with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes are much less likely to achieve recommended treatment targets for HbA1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol compared with those aged 65 and older.

### Clinical evidence of a photoreceptor origin in diabetic retinal disease [^1143eHmp]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is widely recognized by its hallmark microvascular abnormalities, which are often implicated as root causes of vision loss in this disease. However, diabetes is also associated with various forms of retinal neuropathy, including inner retinal thinning and inner retinal dysfunction in the absence of visible vascular lesions. Collectively, these disease phenotypes are termed diabetic retinal disease (DRD). The mainstay of current therapy for DR is directed against VEGF or allied pathways and is aimed at reducing complications of tissue ischemia. Though these approaches are effective for most patients, many remain poorly responsive. Moreover, anti-VEGF therapies may not be useful for treating nonvascular features of DRD, such as inner retinal thinning or field loss.

Understanding the early pathophysiology of DRD, including the earliest cell targets of diabetes in the retina, is crucial to developing next-generation therapies. Although DRD visibly damages the inner retina, photoreceptors are highly distinctive in their metabolic properties and may therefore be uniquely susceptible to metabolic disturbances of diabetes. Because some organs, such as the retina, have increased vulnerability to diabetes compared with other organs, including the brain, many have hypothesized the presence of local susceptibility factors. Such a factor in the retina may indeed be the photoreceptor, whose activity constitutes the bulk of retinal adenosine triphosphate demand and ranks among the highest of bodily tissues in terms of adenosine triphosphate usage per unit mass.

Preclinical experimental evidence strongly suggests that the pathophysiology of photoreceptors and/or their codependent cell type (retinal pigment epithelium [RPE] cells), as well as the extracellular space between them (i.e. the subretinal space), likely initiates ensuing vascular pathologies that characterize at least the early stages of DR. Here, we focus predominantly on clinical data suggesting a central photoreceptor role in the pathogenesis of diabetic eye disease. We review evidence from population-based studies to identify susceptibility loci, from electroretinography (ERG) and visual function testing, and from studies of patients with diabetes and coexisting photoreceptor dystrophic disease. We also draw on a proposed photoreceptor-centric model for the mechanism of action for macular laser photocoagulation, the traditional mainstay of treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME).

### Loss to follow-up in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular edema [^116Ykqv6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most prevalent microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of vision loss globally. The most common cause of vision loss is diabetic macular edema (DME), which can occur in the nonproliferative form of DR and the proliferative form of DR (PDR). Intravitreal injections (IVIs) of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are widely administered as a primary treatment for patients with DME or as a primary or adjunctive therapy to panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) in patients with PDR. In the setting of DME, anti-VEGF IVIs may substantially reduce the risk of vision loss and may improve visual acuity.

The management of DR necessitates frequent clinic visits, hence reliable patient follow-up is paramount to improving functional and anatomical outcomes. Interruptions in treatment regimens may exacerbate DR progression and contribute to irreversible vision loss. It is important for clinicians to understand the factors associated with patients being lost to follow-up (LTFU). It is estimated that 12% to 61% of patients with PDR may become LTFU, which may be attributed to a complex interplay among social determinants of health. Further understanding of the risk factors associated with higher LTFU rates is critical to develop corresponding measures that can be integrated into the care of patients with DR. Our investigation aims to determine associations of sociodemographic and clinical factors with LTFU rates in patients with PDR or DME.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^111UpNcX]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Nonretinal ocular complications — visual function in diabetes mellitus include loss of visual acuity, refractive error changes, changes in color vision, accommodative dysfunction, and visual field changes. Reductions in visual acuity can occur due to refractive shifts, cataracts, ischemic optic neuropathy, macular edema, ocular surface disease, or other diabetes-related ocular changes. Persons with diabetes may experience transient changes in their refractive status; fluctuations may be myopic or hyperopic in association with hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, and these changes are thought to involve fluid absorption by the crystalline lens. Refractive shifts often occur as a symptom or sign of undiagnosed diabetes, may be several diopters or more, and regardless of magnitude or direction, refractive status tends to normalize within weeks of initiation of treatment for diabetes. Transient hyperopic changes may occur after glycemic control in patients with severe hyperglycemia, and the degree of transient hyperopia is highly dependent on A1C levels before treatment and the rate of reduction of the blood glucose level (Evidence Grade: C). In persons of similar age, those with type 1 diabetes are more likely to be slightly myopic than those with type 2 diabetes; however, overall mean refractive errors are similar to those reported in populations without diabetes (Evidence Grade: D). Color vision changes may appear in persons with diabetes, can precede the development of diabetic retinopathy, can involve both blue-yellow and red-green discrimination, and when diabetic retinopathy is present have been shown to correlate with the duration of diabetes; the presence of macular edema is a strong predictor of poor color discrimination with impairment increasing with severity of macular edema. Accommodative ability may be altered in persons with diabetes, and a decrease of accommodation is usually transient and improves with control of glucose levels; a reduction in accommodation has also been observed in persons who undergo panretinal (scatter) laser photocoagulation. Visual field loss can occur secondary to preretinal and vitreous hemorrhages, new vessel growth and fibrous proliferation on the retina, neovascular or primary open angle glaucoma, posterior vitreous detachment, papillopathy, ischemic optic neuropathy or peripheral retinal ischemia, and persons undergoing panretinal (scatter) laser photocoagulation may experience a reduction in their visual fields.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy is a common ocular consequence presenting in patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus (DM). More than 38 million Americans have diabetes mellitus, equating to 11.6% of the overall population. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a result of inadequately controlled diabetes causing retinal microvascular damage and is the most frequent complication of the disease, with an estimated prevalence of 25–30% among those with diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy has been found to be the leading cause of vision loss in working aged adults, making diabetic retinopathy care a matter of public health. The problem is even more dire for minority populations, with black and Hispanic populations suffering at higher prevalences and being more likely to have vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy than their white counterparts. Compared to white individuals standardized for age and sex, Hispanic individuals have a 111% higher prevalence of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, while Black individuals have a 155% higher prevalence of vision-threating diabetic retinopathy. Importantly, early screening, continuous monitoring, and prompt treatment when warranted can help to prevent or delay vision loss.

Racial and ethnic minority groups bear an overwhelming degree of morbidity and mortality from some of the prevalent diseases including coronary vascular disease, stroke, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Indeed, minority populations are twice as likely to be diagnosed with type 2 DM and 2–3 times more likely to develop visual complications from the disease. Additionally, racial minorities have a significantly higher prevalence of DR compared to their white counterparts and are less likely to be screened for DR, with black individuals having the highest proportion of DR overall and the proliferative subtype. Even after patients with DM receive appropriate care, minority populations are at greater odds of having a lapse in diabetic retinopathy care. The racial disparities in screening, referral and treatment of DR have important consequences such as permanent vision loss, which is associated with difficulty completing daily tasks of life, decreased independence, and deleterious effects on social interactions and mental well-being.

### Diabetic retinopathy [^111UwAoa]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is a common and specific microvascular complication of diabetes, and remains the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-aged people. It is identified in a third of people with diabetes and associated with increased risk of life-threatening systemic vascular complications, including stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. Optimum control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and possibly blood lipids remains the foundation for reduction of risk of retinopathy development and progression. Timely laser therapy is effective for preservation of sight in proliferative retinopathy and macular oedema, but its ability to reverse visual loss is poor. Vitrectomy surgery might occasionally be needed for advanced retinopathy. New therapies, such as intraocular injection of steroids and antivascular endothelial growth-factor agents, are less destructive to the retina than are older therapies, and could be useful in patients who respond poorly to conventional therapy. The outlook for future treatment modalities, such as inhibition of other angiogenic factors, regenerative therapy, and topical therapy, is promising.

### Ophthalmologic emergencies in the patient with diabetes [^1133ewUt]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Diabetes is associated with many emergent ophthalmologic conditions. The management of patients with diabetes requires careful monitoring for visual symptoms and frequent physical examination for signs of retinopathy. Randomized studies have documented a significant reduction in the development of new retinopathy and the progression of existing retinopathy with tight control of diabetes. Photocoagulation laser therapy is helpful in preserving vision in severe nonproliferative retinopathy, for proliferative retinopathy, and for clinically significant macular edema. Vascular events include arterial and venous occlusions and cranial nerve palsies; important diagnostic clues are visual symptoms and the findings of ocular and neurologic examinations. Life-threatening infections associated with diabetes include endophthalmitis and mucormycosis, which require prompt diagnosis to prevent blindness or systemic infection. Herpes zoster infection, which is common in older patients and in patients with immunosuppression, may affect the trigeminal nerve and cause anterior uveitis and keratitis. Patients with zoster and skin vesicles on the face need emergent ophthalmologic evaluation and treatment because untreated ocular infection and inflammation may lead to scarring and synechiae formation in the anterior chamber, resulting in vision loss.

### The relationship between carotid disease and retinopathy in diabetes: a systematic review [^111DaSK7]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication affecting over one-third of people with diabetes mellitus. It is one of the leading causes of moderate or severe visual impairment globally. Known modifiable risk factors comprise hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia, but the pathophysiology of DR is not fully understood. Several biochemical mechanisms have been suggested including increased oxidative stress, inflammation, neurodegeneration and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Despite screening programs aimed at early detection, there are few treatments for DR and most can only be used to prevent worsening of established disease. There is, therefore, a need for improved understanding of the epidemiology of DR including risk factors so that it can be identified earlier, new preventive strategies and treatments developed, and vision loss prevented or delayed.

Diabetic retinopathy is characterised by vascular lesions including microaneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates. Less severe DR typically refers to mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), while more severe DR generally comprises severe NPDR or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) which have a greater effect on vision. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol is commonly used to assess the severity of DR. According to this scheme, mild NPDR consists of at least one microaneurysm without evidence of other pathological lesions. When NPDR progresses to PDR there is evidence of neovascularisation.

Appropriately intensive management of hyperglycemia and hypertension reduces the risk of DR. Of the few available specific treatments, intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, such as aflibercept, ranibizumab and bevacizumab, are now considered as a first-line treatment for vision-threatening DR but not all patients respond and these therapies are costly. Laser photocoagulation, which used to be the first-line treatment, and intravitreal corticosteroids are also used to treat severe DR. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), fenofibrate is a treatment that can prevent DR progression. The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, which recruited 9795 participants, showed fenofibrate reduced the need for laser treatment and, in those with pre-existing DR, the risk of progression. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Eye study, which involved 10,251 participants, showed that those in the fenofibrate and statin arm had lower odds of DR progression after 4 years than those in the placebo and statin only arm. Nevertheless, there is still a residual risk of DR progression despite these interventions.

In northern USA with good access to care, cumulative lifetime incidence of diabetic retinopathy for a person with type 1 diabetes was estimated at 90% in 1984 and for type 2 diabetes, approximately 50% (Klein et al, 1984 and 1984). The risk seems to be decreasing over time, particularly in high-income countries, probably because of improved risk factor control and advances in diagnostics over the past 30 years (Sabanayagam et al, 2019 and 2016).

Several factors influence the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. Glycaemic control is a key factor, particularly in type 1 diabetes, and improved glycaemic control reduces the incident risk of diabetic retinopathy, progression, and sight loss (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, 1993; UK Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS] Group, 1998). Increasing duration of diabetes is another major determinant for diabetic retinopathy, with incident risk rising to more than 75% in those living with diabetes for more than 15 years (Klein et al, 1984 and 1984). Hypertension is the third risk factor and might be more important in people with type 2 diabetes. Tight blood pressure control is thought to prevent the development of diabetic retinopathy, although its effect on diabetic retinopathy progression is less clear (UKPDS, 1998; Do et al, 2015). There appears to be genetic variation in diabetic retinopathy susceptibility, particularly among people with type 1 diabetes (Arar et al, 2008; Huang et al, 2011). Epigenetic factors might also be important in the pathophysiology (Kowluru et al, 2015).

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^116qenXd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Eye complications in older adults with diabetes — quality of life impact, predictors, and care effects are described. "Responses to standardized questionnaires suggest that vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy may significantly reduce quality of life and that treatment satisfaction may be significantly affected by the severity of macular edema" and "Retinopathy and neuropathy may affect the ability of a person to safely operate a motor vehicle". Predictors include that "The duration of diabetes predicts the presence of retinopathy, and control of hyperglycemia profoundly affects the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy in both T1D and T2D", and "the presence of albuminuria, hypertension, and dyslipidemia predict retinopathy". In a Medicare study "comparing 119 pairs of patients who received guideline care vs the closest matched controls who did not, low vision/blindness was substantially reduced during a 3-year period among persons who received recommended levels of care".

### Perspectives of diabetic retinopathy-challenges and opportunities [^112FZEVf]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) may lead to vision-threatening complications in people living with diabetes mellitus. Decades of research have contributed to our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy from non-proliferative to proliferative (PDR) stages, the occurrence of diabetic macular oedema (DMO) and response to various treatment options. Multimodal imaging has paved the way to predict the impact of peripheral lesions and optical coherence tomography-angiography is starting to provide new knowledge on diabetic macular ischaemia. Moreover, the availability of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factors has changed the treatment paradigm of DMO and PDR. Areas of research have explored mechanisms of breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, damage to pericytes, the extent of capillary non-perfusion, leakage and progression to neovascularisation. However, knowledge gaps remain. From this perspective, we highlight the challenges and future directions of research in this field.

### Demographic and metabolic risk factors associated with development of diabetic macular edema among persons with diabetes mellitus [^112T2mqK]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a common cause of vision loss for patients with diabetes and affects nearly 750 000 people in the United States. In the United States, prevalence of DME in adults ≥ 40 years has been reported between 4% and 10% with variability based on racial/ethnic background and diabetes duration. Diabetic macular edema results from swelling of the macula caused by fluid leaking from damaged retinal blood vessels and may occur with any stage of diabetic retinopathy (DR) or diabetes type. Patients with DME require frequent monitoring by an eye care professional to identify when treatment with intraocular injections of anti-VEGF agents and, less commonly, laser photocoagulation, is needed. Once intraocular injections are started, patients may need treatments as often as monthly and potentially indefinitely.

Development and progression of DR have been shown to be associated with diabetes duration and glycemic control, and so it is well accepted in ophthalmic practice that control of diabetes, hypertension, and serum lipids is foundational for DR management. Yet these comorbidities are often managed by an internist or endocrinologists, and not all ophthalmologists systematically consider these systemic markers of disease in clinical decision making for DME. Although the development of DME has been associated with increased diabetes mellitus (DM) duration and hypertension, recent data revealed systolic blood pressure (SBP), not current hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), a marker of recent glycemic control, was associated with receiving anti-VEGF intraocular therapy in patients with diabetes.

It has been hypothesized that clinical and pathophysiologic heterogeneity seen in DME may stem from underlying variations in individual metabolic control. A recent study broadly assessing glucose, blood pressure (BP), and lipid control in patients with diabetes found that the presence of DR and DME increased when a combination of factors were present. Chronic local inflammation has been hypothesized to contribute to underlying neurovascular pathology in DMEand may even precede vascular changes. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) characterized by the presence of central obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, represents a state of low-grade, chronic systemic inflammation and is a well-described risk factor for macrovascular diseases such as stroke and cardiovascular disease, although its role in microvascular diseases such as DR or DME is unclear.,

The purpose of this study is to leverage a large multicenter repository of nearly 50 000 patients with DM across multiple health systems in the United States to look for associations between components of systemic metabolic dysfunction associated with MetS, and new onset of DME.

### Research progress on the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy [^116QJhkw]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the common complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is an irreversible and blinding eye disease. Depending on the degree of progression, DR is categorized as non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy(NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR), specifically mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In NPDR, the condition is accompanied by loss of perivascular cells in the retina, leakage of dilated microvessels, and formation of small aneurysms until the retina swells and affects the patient's vision. In PDR, the blood-retinal barrier is broken and the vascular perfusion pressure is reduced. The most typical feature of PDR is the proliferation of the ischemia-mediated imbalance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors leading to neointimal hyperplasia, which can lead to vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. Vision loss is primarily associated with two advanced diseases: diabetic macular oedema(DMO) and PDR; DMO can occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy, but the risk increases with the severity of the DR lesion, with a prevalence of up to 71% of patients with PDR. Hyperglycemia and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) hypertension are the main risk factors for DMO, which primarily destroys the blood-retinal barrier by altering endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pro-inflammatory cytokines pro- inflammatory cytokines, which can lead to vascular leakage and ultimately to blindness. This article provides a review and outlook of the main influencing factors and pathogenesis involved in DR-related research areas and potential therapeutic targets.

### Retinopathy in juvenile diabetes: a 10-year (1990–2000) review [^112q6KEV]. Pediatric Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent complication of diabetes and a leading cause of impaired vision in the Western world. There is general agreement that early diagnosis and treatment of DR can slow its progression and help to prevent blindness. However, as a result of its asymptomatic nature and its etiopathogenesis, which is still unclear due to its multifactorial complexity, DR-related blindness has a growing social impact in industrialized countries. Therefore, in order to gain a better understanding of this serious disease, the author performed an updated 10-year review of risk factors and management of DR in type 1 diabetes.

### Progression of diabetic retinopathy in a longitudinal real-world study of patients in primary care [^116ywrCk]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the most common complications of diabetes mellites (DM), is a leading cause of preventable blindness and vision loss in working-aged adults. DR progresses insidiously, from mild, moderate, then severe non-proliferative DR (NPDR) to vision-threatening proliferative DR (PDR), without easily detectable retinal abnormalities and no or minimal symptoms through all stages of NPDR. Although factors associated with DR severity progression are known, including duration of DM, age at diagnosis, HbA1c levels, blood pressure, insulin use, and presence of proteinuria, PDR is estimated to occur in about 8% patients with DM. Central vision can quickly deteriorate and patients can develop diabetic macular edema (DME) and clinically significant macular edema (CSME) at any stage of DR.

### Management of diabetic retinopathy: a systematic review [^114x9zVH]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in the working-aged population in the United States. There are many new interventions for DR, but evidence to support their use is uncertain.

Objective

To review the best evidence for primary and secondary intervention in the management of DR, including diabetic macular edema.

Evidence Acquisition

Systematic review of all English-language articles, retrieved using a keyword search of MEDLINE (1966 through May 2007), EMBASE, Cochrane Collaboration, the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology database, and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Database, and followed by manual searches of reference lists of selected major review articles. All English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 12 months of follow-up and meta-analyses were included. Delphi consensus criteria were used to identify well-conducted studies.

Evidence Synthesis

Forty-four studies (including 3 meta-analyses) met the inclusion criteria. Tight glycemic and blood pressure control reduces the incidence and progression of DR. Pan-retinal laser photocoagulation reduces the risk of moderate and severe visual loss by 50% in patients with severe nonproliferative and proliferative retinopathy. Focal laser photocoagulation reduces the risk of moderate visual loss by 50% to 70% in eyes with macular edema. Early vitrectomy improves visual recovery in patients with proliferative retinopathy and severe vitreous hemorrhage. Intravitreal injections of steroids may be considered in eyes with persistent loss of vision when conventional treatment has failed. There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy or safety of lipid-lowering therapy, medical interventions, or antivascular endothelial growth factors on the incidence or progression of DR.

Conclusions

Tight glycemic and blood pressure control remains the cornerstone in the primary prevention of DR. Pan-retinal and focal retinal laser photocoagulation reduces the risk of visual loss in patients with severe DR and macular edema, respectively. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of other treatments.

### Incidence of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and numbers needed to screen: a systematic review [^115XWuYt]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy is a chronic, potentially sight‐threatening complication of diabetes mellitus that can be detected by periodic screening of the fundus. For the classification of diabetic abnormalities, two grading schemes are used: the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study classification (ETDRS) and the more recent National Screening Committee (NSC) 1, 2. Absence of diabetic retinopathy is classified as '10' (ETDRS) or 'R0' (NSC). Aneurysms and small retinal haemorrhages may progress to mild, non‐proliferative diabetic retinopathy or background diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS 20–35, NSC R1), or to moderate to severe non‐proliferative diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS 43–53, NSC R2), and ultimately to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS ≥ 61, NSC R3) 1, 2. It is estimated that this progressive pattern takes on average ~17 years 3, 4. Regression from mild non‐proliferative diabetic retinopathy (R1) to no visible retinopathy occurs in up to 46% of cases 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. This regression is reinforced by effective treatment of hypertension and hyperglycaemia 3, 9.

Diabetic maculopathy or macular oedema (NSC M1) represents a spectrum of retinopathy symptoms characterized by oedema, fine macular exudates with or without haemorrhages and thickening of the central macula and surrounding non‐central macula. The gradings R2, R3 and M1 are classified as sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR) or referable diabetic retinopathy.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (R3) is an urgent sight‐threatening condition, which needs a fast‐track referral for ophthalmological treatment to prevent loss of vision. All screen‐detected STDRs need comprehensive diagnosis, monitoring, and eventually treatment by an ophthalmologist. Timely screen detection of STDR and referral and treatment can prevent or slow down loss of visual acuity.

The incidence of STDR has decreased over the last decades 10, 11. Between 1991 and 2006, the screen‐detected prevalence of all referable diabetic retinopathy (R2 or R3 or M1) cases increased from 2.0% to 4.7% in the UK, but in that period the prevalence of the most severe STDR (R3 or M1) dropped by 91%: from 1.7% to 0.16% 12. Several authors suggest extending the screening interval for people with Type 2 diabetes without retinopathy at last screening session 13, 14, 15, 16 to 2 12, 17 or 3 years 18, 19, 20.

### Systemic and ocular diseases associated with the development of diabetic macular edema among Japanese patients with diabetes mellitus [^113AKuNw]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) continues to increase worldwide, and diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of vision loss in many countries. The reported prevalence of DR among patients with DM varies widely, from 1 to 40%. According to Yau et al. approximately 93 million people worldwide develop DR, 17 million are diagnosed with proliferative DR (PDR), and 21 million are diagnosed with diabetic macular edema (DME).

Although PDR is the most common vision-threatening retinopathy, DME is responsible for most of the vision loss experienced by patients with DM and remains the major cause of vision loss among patients with DM with or without PDR. Many previous population-based or hospital-based studies have focused on the prevalence of DME, yet there are few large-scale studies examining the incidence of DME. In addition, the annual incidence rates of DME in previous studies varied widely from 0.01 to 6.0%.

Previous epidemiological studies have also identified several risk factors associated with DR, including many systemic and lifestyle factors, nephropathy, obesity, alcohol consumption, hematological markers of anemia, hypothyroidism, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes duration, ethnic origin, pregnancy, and puberty. Some risk factors have been associated with DME development, including duration of diabetes, hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, nephropathy, higher cholesterol, retinal and vitreous inflammation, and oxidative stress in the retina, but inconsistencies exist among reports. Furthermore, risk factors for DME may differ from those for DR, and the precise roles of these factors in the pathogenesis of DME are not well defined. Some epidemiological studies have examined the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for DM and DR, including studies employing the Japan Diabetes Clinical Data Management Study Group (JDDM). Unfortunately, an insufficient number of studies have focused on DME in Japan. Currently, the main therapeutic procedures for DME are laser photocoagulation, vitrectomy, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections, though these approaches are not always effective. In addition to the three approaches mentioned above, targeted therapies can ameliorate some of the identified risk factors. Here, we investigate systemic and ocular factors associated with DME development in a large-scale study based on the health insurance claim database in Japan.

### Improving the identification of diabetic retinopathy and related conditions in the electronic health record using natural language processing methods [^116wyEzn]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of vision loss among working age adults in the United States. As the prevalence of diabetes rises, diabetic eye diseases including retinopathy, macular edema (ME), and related conditions (e.g. vitreous hemorrhage [VH], tractional retinal detachments [TRDs], and neovascular glaucoma [NVG]) are also expected to increase. Despite the rising prevalence, identifying such patients in routinely collected observational health data, for example, the electronic health record (EHR), is challenging. Accurately identifying such patients is important for establishing disease prevalence for epidemiologic surveillance or public health planning, for example, to ensure there are sufficient health care providers to treat the conditions in certain areas. The complexity and richness of the data available in the EHR also enables hypothesis driven precision medicine research that accounts for the uniqueness of each individual.

Accurate case identification of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and related conditions is essential to studies using routinely collected observational health data. Many studies rely on structured data including International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes for case identification. Although investigators have found acceptable concordance between billing and provider free-text documentation for many ocular conditions, there are limitations to solely relying on ICD diagnosis codes for case identification. The accuracy of ICD diagnosis codes can vary by condition and is influenced by local billing practices and documentation workflows. For example, evidence suggests that more severe clinical diseases that necessitate changes in clinical management, such as proliferative DR (PDR), tend to be captured more completely than less severe diseases like nonproliferative DR (NPDR). There are also missing data in diagnosis codes selected that do not specify laterality (i.e. which eye is affected) or severity (e.g. mild or severe NPDR). Nonspecific diagnosis codes are seen more commonly for older patients, those with better vision, patients with lower utilization of eye care, and also depends on the specialty of the eye care provider.

### Factors associated with impaired color vision without retinopathy amongst people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study [^1125mBFb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

ICV could impact on myriad daily living activities and social life of affected people, ranging from play, sports, driving, education, occupation, discrimination, health and personal safety. Trento M et al. in their multi-centered study in Italy also alluded that vision loss and ICV resulting in poor vision functioning, would impact on their social role and quality of life.

The prevalence of T2DM amongst the multi-ethnic Asian population in Singapore is expected to rise from 11.3% in 2010 to 15% in 2050. With its dual private-public healthcare system, 45% of these people with T2DM are managed in the local public primary care clinics (polyclinics). With increasing prevalence of T2DM, the number of people with ICV is expected to expand significantly, raising their risks of poorer quality of life and reduced social functioning. In view of findings from earlier studies, we postulated that the local patients with diabetes mellitus were at higher risks of ICV in relation to their age, duration of disease, glycaemia and dyslipidemia control. Identifying these risk factors open up a window for intervention to mitigate the development of ICV.

Thus, the study aimed to determine the factors associated with ICV without diabetic retinopathy amongst people with T2DM who were managed in primary care.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^117KYm5W]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Laser photocoagulation surgery in both trials was beneficial in reducing the risk of further vision loss, but generally not beneficial in reversing already diminished acuity. This preventive effect and the fact that patients with PDR or macular edema may be asymptomatic provide strong support for a screening program to detect diabetic retinopathy.

As retinopathy is estimated to take at least 5 years to develop after the onset of hyperglycemia, patients with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination within 5 years after the onset of diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes who generally have had years of undiagnosed diabetes and who have a significant risk of prevalent diabetic retinopathy at the time of diabetes diagnosis should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination soon after diagnosis. Examinations should be performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is knowledgeable and experienced in diagnosing the presence of diabetic retinopathy and is aware of its management. Subsequent examinations for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients are generally repeated annually. Less frequent exams (every 2–3 years) may be cost effective after one or more normal eye exams, while examinations will be required more frequently if retinopathy is progressing.

Examinations can also be done with retinal photographs (with or without dilation of the pupil) read by experienced experts. In-person exams are still necessary when the photos are unacceptable and for follow-up of abnormalities detected. Photos are not a substitute for a comprehensive eye exam, which should be performed at least initially and at intervals thereafter as recommended by an eye care professional. This technology has great potential in areas where qualified eye care professionals are not available and may also enhance efficiency and reduce costs when the expertise of ophthalmologists can be used for more complex examinations and for therapy.

Results of eye examinations should be documented and transmitted to the referring health care professional. For a detailed review of the evidence and further discussion of diabetic retinopathy, see the ADA technical review and position statement on this subject.

### Action on diabetic macular oedema: achieving optimal patient management in treating visual impairment due to diabetic eye disease [^113TpfE8]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

Proactive clinical management of diabetes and co-morbidities, emphasis on patient-centred care

Given the evidence of benefit and supported by both national and international guidelines, a major focus for the care of people with type 2 diabetes is the achievement and maintenance of optimal glucose control early within the natural history of the condition. The clinical paradigm in managing glucose control centres on individualisation of therapy as there are many effective glucose-lowering agents to choose from when tailoring individual antihyperglycaemic treatment strategies for patients with type 2 diabetes. A stepwise approach is typically adopted, advancing from initial single drug therapy to dual combination and triple drug combination therapy when needed. Insulin therapy is considered a key component of any combination regimen when hyperglycaemia is severe.

Treatment targets and strategies should be individualised based on a patient-centred approach (Table 3). This is reinforced in an updated joint position statement from the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. Personalisation of treatment is recommended, balancing the benefits and risks of glycaemic control, taking account of the potential risk of hypoglycaemia and other adverse effects and the patient's age and health status. Glycaemic control needs to be combined with a comprehensive cardiovascular risk factor reduction programme, to include smoking cessation and the adoption of other healthy lifestyle habits, blood pressure control, and lipid management. Personalised management plans for patients with type 2 diabetes should therefore encompass glycaemic control and effective blood pressure and lipid management

Evidence statements note that intensive treatment of dyslipidemia using a combination of simvastatin and fenofibrate, along with intensive glucose control, has been shown to slow the rate of progression of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus; the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) Study reported that patients treated with fenofibrate had statistically significant reduction in the need for laser treatment for maculopathy and proliferative retinopathy; in Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia, those taking statins had a lower rate of diabetic retinopathy and the need for treatment of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, with benefits reported to increase as statin intensity and patient adherence increased; observational data from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) suggest that lipid lowering may decrease the risk of hard exudate formation and associated vision loss; and lipid-lowering therapy with statins protected against the development of diabetic macular edema and progression of diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Potential benefits include reduced risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy; potential risks/harms are side effects of medications; the benefit and harm assessment states benefits significantly outweigh harms; potential costs are time for counseling; value judgments none; role of patient preferences large; intentional vagueness none; and gaps in evidence none identified.

### Frontiers in diabetic retinal disease [^114RhNUH]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2023). Medium credibility.

5 Final recommendations based on the provided solutions

To summarize, more research in pathophysiology and early detection of DRD is needed to understand the gap between its subclinical stages and vision-threatening abnormalities, and to find new therapeutic targets for preventing DRD development. Keeping the patient voice in focus is important to have accurate evaluations of treatment effects. The latter should not be restricted to visual acuity or structural measures, but also parameters of subjective visual function. For this purpose, computer- assisted, patient-reported outcome questionnaires could be developed that can be widely applied to any context of care, region, or community. Additionally, not only better characterization of disease development, but also of its relation with metabolic and inflammatory factors, such as blood glucose levels, serum lipid levels, blood pressure, oxidative stress and mitochondrial function, is key to understanding DRD and developing more effective therapeutics.

### Treatments for diabetes eye complications… [^1126JDjJ]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Diabetes can cause eye complications.
- The longer someone has diabetes, the more likely they are to develop complications.
- Prevention and treatment options can help avoid vision loss.
- CDC researchers studied trends in eye-related diabetes complications and treatments given. What did this study examine. This study measured eye-related diabetes complications, from 2009–2018, in Medicare patients ages 65 and older. Researchers examined how treatments for eye-related diabetes complications have changed over this time, and how they differed by race. Terms to know Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that damages blood vessels in the eyes. DR can be mild to moderate, or it can be more severe, known as vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic macular edema happens in about half of people with any type of DR.

With DME, blood vessels in the eyes leak and start to swell, which can cause vision loss or blindness. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections, or anti-VEGF injections, are the first-line treatment for DME. This is because of their effectiveness and ease of application. Laser photocoagulation is a procedure used to treat diabetes-related eye complications. Study results Roughly 1 in 4 Medicare patients had diabetes. Researchers found that the rate of eye complications for those with diabetes increased by 54% from 2009–2018. For people with DME, anti-VEGF injections increased from 16% to 35%. For people with VTDR and DME, anti-VEGF injections increased from 20% to 48%. Use of laser photocoagulation decreased from 46% to 13% for people with DME. Laser photocoagulation also decreased from 54% to 20% for people who had VTDR and DME. Researchers saw racial differences in vision complications from diabetes that did not match treatment trends.

People from racial and ethnic minority groups had higher rates of DME or VTDR, but lower rates of anti-VEGF injections. In contrast, White people had the lowest rates of DME or VTDR, but the highest rates of anti-VEGF injections. These findings reflect a health disparity, which is a difference in health based on social or economic status, location, or environment. What's important about this study.

Age-adjusted percentage of adults aged 45 and over with diagnosed diabetes who had cataracts and vision loss due to cataracts, by years since diabetes diagnosis: United States, 2016–2017.
- Nearly
9. 0% of adults aged 45 and over with diagnosed diabetes had diabetic retinopathy, and 4. 1% had vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy.
- Adults aged 45 and over who have had diagnosed diabetes for 10 years or more were more likely to have diabetic retinopathy than those having diagnosed diabetes for less than 10 years.
- Adults who have had diagnosed diabetes for 10 years or more were more likely to have vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy than those having diagnosed diabetes for less than 10 years. Figure 2. Age-adjusted percentage of adults aged 45 and over with diagnosed diabetes who had diabetic retinopathy and vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy, by years since diabetes diagnosis: United States, 2016–2017. NOTES: Diabetic retinopathy and vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy are based on separate questions that asked sample adults if they were ever told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetic retinopathy or vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy. Percentages shown for both diabetic retinopathy and vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy are among adults aged 45 and over with diagnosed diabetes.
- Among adults aged 45 and over with diagnosed diabetes, 7. 1% had glaucoma, and
2. 1% had vision loss due to glaucoma.

### Treatment options for diabetes eye complications… [^114AqGg8]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment Options for Diabetes Eye Complications Diabetes can cause health complications, including vision loss. Because diabetes progresses over time, these complications are more likely to develop the longer a person has diabetes. Researchers at CDC studied trends in eye-related diabetes complications and treatment options. What did this study examine. This study measured eye-related diabetes complications, for the period of 2009–2018, in Medicare patients age 65 and older. Researchers also looked at how treatments for diabetes eye complications have changed over this time, as well as at how treatments differed by race. What's important about this study. This study highlights how trends in treatments for diabetes eye complications have changed over time. This information is key for clinicians to ensure the latest standard of care and is helpful for people with diabetes to understand the treatment options. What terms should I know.

This study examined four diabetes treatment measures: Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that damages blood vessels in the eyes. DR can be mild to moderate, or it can be more severe, known as vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic macular edema happens in about half of people with any type of DR. With DME, blood vessels in the eyes leak and start to swell, which can cause vision loss or blindness.
- Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections, or anti-VEGF injections, are the first-line treatment for DME because of their ease of application and their effectiveness. Laser photocoagulationis a procedure used to treat diabetes-related eye complications. What were the results.
- Roughly 1 in 4 Medicare patients had diabetes. Researchers found that the rate of eye complications for those with diabetes increased by 54% during the period 2009–2018.
- For people with DME, anti-VEGF injections increased from 16% to 35%. For people with VTDR and DME, anti-VEGF injections increased from 20% to 48%.
- Use of laser photocoagulation decreased from 46% to 13% for people with DME, and from 54% to 20% for people who had VTDR and DME.
- Researchers saw racial differences in vision complications from diabetes that did not match treatment trends. People from racial and ethnic minority groups had higher rates of DME or VTDR, but lower rates of anti-VEGF injections than White people. In contrast, White people had the lowest rates of DME or VTDR, but the highest rates of anti-VEGF injections. These findings reflect a health disparity, which is a difference in health based on social or economic status, location, or environment. What is the main message. This study shows which treatments are used for vision complications, and how anti-VEGF injections have grown in popularity.

CDC continues to promote diabetes prevention and management, since diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in US adults ages 20–74. People with diabetes are urged to receive annual dilated eye exams for early detection and timely treatment.

### How to promote eye health for people with diabetes… [^1171ydHo]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

How to Promote Eye Health for People With Diabetes 5 Actions for Health Care Teams We all have a role to play to help people with diabetes live their best life. Optometrists and ophthalmologists are eye care specialists who play a key role in the early detection and timely treatment of diabetes-related eye diseases such as retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts. These conditions can be avoided or delayed with annual dilated eye examinations and treatment if needed.
- Encourage your patients with diabetes to get a comprehensive vision exam, including a dilated retinal exam, once a year.
- **Remind your patients that**:

- Many eye problems do not have obvious symptoms. Tell them to watch for any changes in their vision.
- They can reduce their risk of visual impairment by keeping their blood glucose level under control and maintaining overall good health.
- **Share information from CDC's Take Charge of Your Diabetes**: Healthy Eyes fact sheet.

Take These 5 Actions to Help Your Patients 1. Know the risks of vision loss and eye diseases for people with diabetes. Although people with diabetes are at a higher risk of vision loss and eye diseases, 60% do not get annual eye exams. 1 In the United States:

- People with diabetes have a 25 times higher risk of blindness than people without diabetes. 2
- Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. 3Glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye disorders occur earlier and more often in people with diabetes. 4
- Diabetic retinopathy is projected to aﬀect 16 million people with diabetes by 2050. 5
- More than 90% of vision loss caused by diabetes can be avoided with early detection and treatment. 6
- Intensive management of blood glucose levels can reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy by 27%. 7
- Dark, floating spots or streaks that look like cobwebs.
- Dry eyes.
- Sudden changes in the ability to see clearly, focus, or adjust to changes in light or darkness.
- Double vision or difficulty focusing due to vision fluctuations.
2. Understand how diabetes can change eye health and encourage your patients to monitor their vision. At each health care visit, tell your patients with diabetes about the signs of eye problems. This will help them be aware of changes in their eyesight when they start. Make sure your patients understand the information by asking them to repeat back what they heard.
3. Ask your patients questions about their eye health at each health care visit. For example:

- Do you get a comprehensive eye exam with dilated pupils at least once a year.
- Do you know how diabetes can affect your eyes.
- Do you know what to do if you suddenly have a change in your vision.

You can refer your patients to an eye health specialist or ask them if they want more information about recommended eye care for people with diabetes. You can base this action on how your patients answer your questions and any other concerns they share during their visit.
4. Remind your patients to keep their blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood lipids within normal levels for optimum hearing health. Use the following discussion points to help you talk with your patients about their self-care habits and their feelings about managing diabetes:

- Promote the ABCs of diabetes and a healthy lifestyle.
- Ensure that patients have access to health coaches, patient navigators, and community health workers when possible.
- Ask your patients what other health exams they are getting, including regular ear health checkups.
- Assess symptoms that might require referral to a specialist.
