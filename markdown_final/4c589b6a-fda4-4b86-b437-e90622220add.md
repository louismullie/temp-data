## Question

EPS symptoms of antipsychotic medications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and subtypes of EPS. Then, I should examine the pathophysiology, including classical D2 blockade and newer kinetic models. Next, I will review clinical manifestations, comparative drug risks, and patient- and treatment-related risk factors. After that, I should cover monitoring tools, prevention, and management, including acute strategies and tardive dyskinesia. Finally, I will consider special populations, outcomes, and a practical algorithm, cross-checking key assertions against FDA labels, meta-analyses, and mechanistic studies as I proceed.

> Let me first confirm definitions and the clinical taxonomy. Extrapyramidal symptoms are drug-induced movement disorders linked to dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, classically encompassing acute dystonia, akathisia, drug-induced parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia, with FDA labels and clinical reviews aligning on these categories and features [^113cVs8h] [^116jWX87] [^117Gq6AG].

> I will now examine core mechanisms. The traditional view is that antipsychotic antagonism of D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal system disrupts basal ganglia motor circuitry while mesolimbic D2 blockade treats psychosis; this D2-centric model remains foundational, though serotonergic modulation and other receptor interactions modulate risk in practice [^11492QDa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the "fast off" hypothesis as the sole explanation for lower EPS with atypicals. I initially thought dissociation rate (koff) primarily determined EPS liability, but wait, newer kinetic work shows that association rate (kon) and the modeled reversal rate of receptor blockade under limited diffusion (kr) correlate better with clinical EPS, supporting a rebinding framework where rapid association and frequent rebinding increase EPS risk despite similar affinities, while slower association reduces EPS propensity [^114N7qiw] [^1163vzLk] [^1148VrZa] [^113sqemr].

> Next, I should review serotonin–dopamine balance. Let me consider that 5-HT2A antagonism may buffer striatal dopamine release and reduce EPS for some SGAs, but I need to acknowledge counterexamples like amisulpride, where relatively high D2 selectivity does not translate to uniformly high EPS, indicating that kinetics and network-level effects complicate a simple 5-HT2A explanation [^11492QDa] [^1148VrZa].

> I will now characterize acute dystonia. Onset is often within the first days, with neck spasm, oculogyric crisis, jaw and tongue involvement, occasionally progressing to dysphagia or dyspnea; I should confirm that risk is higher in younger males and with high-potency agents or higher doses, which is consistently described in FDA labeling [^1125uzoy] [^112nec4N] [^112VMyKv].

> Let me consider akathisia. It presents as subjective inner restlessness with observable motor agitation, often emerging within days to weeks; objective scales like BARS help quantify severity, and I should confirm that some labels report increased akathisia-related events while scale-based differences can be modest, underscoring the need for both subjective and objective assessment [^115yBZgq].

> I will now examine drug-induced parkinsonism. The clinical triad of bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor is typical, with masked facies and drooling possible, and prevalence is substantial in early psychosis cohorts; importantly, I should double-check that spontaneous parkinsonian signs also occur in unmedicated schizophrenia, complicating attribution solely to medication in some cases [^117Gq6AG] [^114yvm2d] [^112dwUi7].

> Next is tardive dyskinesia. Onset is delayed after months to years, often with orofacial choreoathetoid movements; let me verify that early fine "vermicular" tongue movements can presage TD and that discontinuation is recommended when possible, while acknowledging uncertainty in reversibility and the masking effect of ongoing antipsychotic treatment noted in FDA labels and clinical reviews [^112nec4N] [^113t7AR1] [^113Hutxb].

> I need to compare EPS liability across antipsychotic classes. High-potency FGAs like haloperidol and perphenazine carry higher EPS risk than lower potency agents, and their labels emphasize dose-related increases; wait, at first I thought low-potency FGAs invariably cause more EPS, but that's backward for EPS specifically, as high-potency D2 antagonism drives more parkinsonism and dystonia whereas low-potency agents often have more anticholinergic and sedative burdens, which can paradoxically blunt EPS signs [^116k38hm] [^116jWX87] [^117Gq6AG].

> Let me review SGA differences. Clozapine and quetiapine are generally low-EPS, olanzapine is low to moderate, while risperidone and paliperidone exhibit dose-related EPS that approach FGA levels at higher doses, and ziprasidone shows intermediate rates; I should confirm these trends with label data and head-to-head meta-analyses showing higher antiparkinsonian medication use with risperidone and lower with quetiapine compared with several SGAs [^111BwYAu] [^115yBZgq] [^1125uzoy] [^111WwvP7].

> Wait, I should verify broader comparative evidence. Systematic reviews in first-episode psychosis consistently show higher EPS with haloperidol versus SGAs, even at low haloperidol doses, while differences among SGAs are smaller and dose dependent, aligning with clinical experience but warranting careful dosing and monitoring [^11522qag] [^111WwvP7].

> Next, I should review risk factors. Patient factors include younger male sex for acute dystonia and female sex, especially postmenopausal, for parkinsonism, akathisia, and TD; treatment factors include prior antipsychotic exposure, higher dose, longer duration, and antipsychotic polypharmacy, which escalates D2 blockade beyond efficacy thresholds and increases EPS risk without added benefit [^1135RM3F] [^114yvm2d] [^117FpApx].

> I need to ensure monitoring is standardized. Baseline and serial assessments with validated scales such as ESRS, SAS for parkinsonism, BARS for akathisia, and AIMS for TD improve detection; hold on, I should confirm scale use from trials and systematic reviews to reinforce structured follow-up, particularly early in treatment and periodically thereafter [^1174Xzfc] [^115yBZgq] [^113MSNMr].

> For prevention, I should confirm that using the lowest effective dose, selecting lower-EPS agents when feasible, and avoiding routine anticholinergic prophylaxis are foundational, with early reassessment of ongoing need to limit cumulative exposure and downstream TD risk [^113XgCpt].

> For acute dystonia or parkinsonism, let me verify first-line steps. Reducing the dose or switching to a lower-EPS agent is appropriate, and targeted anticholinergic therapy such as benztropine is effective for dystonia and parkinsonism but should be avoided in TD, a precaution clearly stated in labeling and clinical guidance [^113DbPPL] [^113XgCpt].

> For akathisia, I should double-check that dose reduction or switching may be supplemented by adjuncts such as propranolol, with short-term benzodiazepines as needed, while recognizing variable anticholinergic benefit; this aligns with pragmatic management reviews [^113XgCpt].

> Now, tardive dyskinesia management requires special caution. Early recognition and antipsychotic discontinuation or switching to clozapine when feasible are key strategies, and VMAT2 inhibitors are evidence-based options, while anticholinergics can worsen TD and should generally be avoided, per labels and clinical reviews emphasizing limited reversibility and the masking effect of continued D2 blockade [^112nec4N] [^113DbPPL] [^113Hutxb] [^113XgCpt].

> I need to check whether antipsychotic dose reduction alone reliably reduces EPS. High-quality evidence suggests dose reduction does not consistently change EPS rates versus continuation, though individualized trials of dose minimization remain reasonable when balanced against relapse risk, necessitating shared decision-making and close monitoring [^113SArWT] [^1174Xzfc].

> Let me now consider special populations. In pregnancy and neonates, third-trimester exposure can lead to neonatal EPS or withdrawal requiring monitoring; in dementia with Lewy bodies, profound neuroleptic sensitivity and EPS risk necessitate avoiding FGAs and great caution with SGAs; in Parkinson's disease psychosis, prioritize dopaminergic regimen adjustment and consider quetiapine pragmatically, pimavanserin where available, and clozapine when needed, guarding against motor worsening and adverse events [^116cKhPn] [^113KgkgM] [^116kMP8J] [^115Qhydj].

> I should confirm the clinical impact of EPS. EPS impair quality of life and adherence, can precipitate treatment discontinuation and relapse, and severe complications such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome require urgent recognition and management, reinforcing the need for proactive prevention and prompt intervention [^113XgCpt] [^117TfTv7].

> Finally, let me outline a pragmatic algorithm and verify key decision points. At initiation, assess EPS risk factors, select a lower-EPS agent when feasible, and start at the lowest effective dose with baseline scales; during treatment, monitor early and periodically, and for emergent EPS, first reduce dose, then consider switching, and use targeted adjuncts such as benztropine for dystonia/parkinsonism and propranolol for akathisia while avoiding anticholinergics in TD; for maintenance, reassess indication and dose regularly, minimize polypharmacy, and perform routine AIMS screening for TD, adjusting strategy based on patient-specific risk and response [^1125uzoy] [^113DbPPL] [^113XgCpt] [^113SArWT] [^111WwvP7].

Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are **drug-induced movement disorders** resulting from dopamine D2 receptor blockade [^114N7qiw] by antipsychotics in the nigrostriatal pathway [^1163vzLk]. They include **acute dystonia**, **parkinsonism**, **akathisia**, and **tardive dyskinesia** [^1169nTfQ] [^113cVs8h]. EPS are more common with **first-generation antipsychotics** [^112nec4N] [^116Z5PSn] and at higher doses [^1125uzoy], yet can occur with any antipsychotic [^115yBZgq]. Management includes dose reduction [^113SArWT], switching to lower-EPS agents, and adjunctive medications such as anticholinergics or beta-blockers [^113XgCpt]; **early recognition and monitoring are essential** to prevent persistent or irreversible symptoms [^113Hutxb].

---

## Types of extrapyramidal symptoms

EPS fall into **four main categories**:

| **Type** | **Clinical features** | **Onset** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute dystonia | - Sustained muscle contractions <br/> - Spasms <br/> - Oculogyric crisis <br/> - Torticollis <br/> - Laryngospasm | Hours to days after initiation or dose increase | Anticholinergics (benztropine, diphenhydramine) [^113DbPPL] and benzodiazepines are recommended [^112nec4N] |
| Parkinsonism | - Bradykinesia <br/> - Rigidity <br/> - Resting tremor <br/> - Masked facies <br/> - Shuffling gait | Days to weeks after initiation | - Anticholinergics [^113DbPPL] <br/> - Amantadine <br/> - Dose reduction <br/> - Switch to lower-EPS antipsychotic [^112nec4N] |
| Akathisia | - Subjective restlessness <br/> - Inability to sit still <br/> - Inner tension | Days to weeks after initiation | - Beta-blockers (propranolol) [^113XgCpt] <br/> - Benzodiazepines [^1138CNru] <br/> - Dose reduction <br/> - Switch to lower-EPS antipsychotic [^112nec4N] |
| Tardive dyskinesia | - Involuntary choreoathetoid movements <br/> - Facial grimacing <br/> - Tongue protrusion <br/> - Lip smacking <br/> - Limb/trunk movements | Months to years after chronic exposure | - Discontinue or switch antipsychotic [^112nec4N] <br/> - VMAT2 inhibitors (valbenazine, deutetrabenazine) [^113Hutxb] <br/> - Clozapine |

## Pathophysiology

EPS arise from **dopamine D2 receptor blockade** [^114N7qiw] in the nigrostriatal pathway, which reduces dopamine transmission and causes motor symptoms [^112nec4N]. Chronic blockade can lead to dopamine receptor supersensitivity, contributing to tardive dyskinesia [^1169nTfQ] [^113t7AR1].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase **EPS risk**:

- **Antipsychotic type**: First-generation antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, fluphenazine) [^112nec4N] have higher EPS risk [^116Z5PSn] than second-generation antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine) [^1125uzoy] [^111WwvP7].
- **Dose and duration**: Higher doses [^1125uzoy] and prolonged treatment [^1125SAmG] increase EPS risk [^112nec4N].
- **Patient factors**: Age, gender [^1135RM3F], genetic predisposition, and pre-existing neurological conditions [^116kMP8J] influence susceptibility [^1125uzoy].

---

## Clinical impact

EPS significantly affect patient **quality of life** [^113XgCpt], causing physical discomfort, social embarrassment, and functional impairment. They often lead to medication nonadherence [^1169nTfQ], increasing the risk of relapse and hospitalization [^113Hutxb].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management of **EPS** involves:

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or switch to lower-EPS antipsychotics [^113XgCpt] [^113SArWT].
- **Adjunctive medications**: Anticholinergics for dystonia/parkinsonism [^113DbPPL]; beta-blockers or benzodiazepines for akathisia; VMAT2 inhibitors for tardive dyskinesia [^113XgCpt] [^113Hutxb].
- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment [^113XgCpt] using standardized scales (e.g. Simpson-Angus Scale, Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale) [^1174Xzfc].

---

## Prevention

Preventive measures include:

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the minimal effective dose and shortest duration [^1125SAmG] [^113XgCpt].
- **Patient education**: Inform patients about EPS symptoms and encourage early reporting [^113XgCpt] [^113Hutxb].
- **Regular monitoring**: Early detection and intervention to prevent progression [^1174Xzfc] [^113XgCpt].

Extrapyramidal symptoms are common, dose-related movement disorders caused by dopamine blockade from antipsychotics [^114N7qiw]. They are more frequent with first-generation agents [^116Z5PSn] and higher doses [^1125uzoy], yet can occur with any antipsychotic [^115yBZgq]. Management includes dose reduction, switching to lower-EPS agents, and adjunctive therapies [^113XgCpt]; **early recognition and monitoring are critical** to prevent persistent or irreversible symptoms [^113Hutxb].

### Chronic subdural haematoma mimicking extrapyramidal symptoms [^1169nTfQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are among the most common adverse effects observed in patients taking antipsychotics. Also referred to as drug-induced movement disorders, EPS symptoms include dystonia, akathisia, and Parkinsonism. Additionally, prolonged use of antipsychotics can cause tardive dyskinesia.

Drug-induced EPS results from antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors, a primary action of antipsychotics, particularly in first-generation drugs such as haloperidol and fluphenazine. Although blocking D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway can improve psychotic symptoms, blockage of the same receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway may lead to unwanted EPS effects. When the blockage is long-term, overexpression of downstream D2 receptors can occur to compensate for the lack of dopamine, clinically manifesting as tardive dyskinesia. Treatment usually involves discontinuing the antipsychotics or prescribing anticholinergics such as biperiden or trihexyphenidyl.

EPS can severely affect patients' quality of life and is one of the leading causes of patients discontinuing pharmacotherapy, which directly increases the risk of relapse and rehospitalization. Dealing with EPS is a significant aspect of clinical practice and a familiar scenario in psychiatry. However, medication is not the sole cause of EPS; organic brain injuries, for instance, may mimic such symptoms. Given the potentially lethal nature of brain injuries, timely and correct identification of the symptom causes is crucial. Reported here is a case.

### Tardive dyskinesia: Recognition, patient assessment, and differential diagnosis [^113Hutxb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an involuntary movement disorder associated with antipsychotic treatment. Due to the serious and potentially irreversible nature of TD, accurate diagnosis is crucial. However, diagnosing TD can be challenging, as the subtle and often fluctuating symptoms are easily mistaken for symptoms of mental illness or other side effects. Although the risk of developing TD with second-generation antipsychotics is lower compared to first-generation antipsychotics, the risk still exists and may be greater than previously believed.

Clinicians prescribe antipsychotics for various illnesses and may underestimate the possibility of a patient developing TD, thus missing early signs of the disorder. In this academic highlight, experts review the prevalence, phenomenology, risk factors, and impact of TD, illustrated by case examples, and provide valuable clinical information to guide early recognition and accurate diagnosis.

### Management of common adverse effects of antipsychotic medications [^113XgCpt]. World Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The benefits of antipsychotic medications are sometimes obscured by their adverse effects. These effects range from relatively minor tolerability issues, such as mild sedation or dry mouth, to very unpleasant experiences like constipation, akathisia, and sexual dysfunction. They can also be painful, such as in cases of acute dystonias, disfiguring, as with weight gain and tardive dyskinesia, or even life-threatening, such as myocarditis and agranulocytosis. Importantly, adverse effect profiles are specific to each antipsychotic medication and do not neatly fit into first- and second-generation classifications.

This paper reviews management strategies for the most frequent side effects and identifies common principles intended to optimize net antipsychotic benefits. Only use antipsychotics if the indication is clear, and only continue antipsychotics if a benefit is discernible. If an antipsychotic is providing substantial benefit and the adverse effect is not life-threatening, the first management choice is to lower the dose or adjust the dosing schedule. The next option is to change the antipsychotic, which is often reasonable unless the risk of relapse is high. In some instances, behavioral interventions can be tried.

Concomitant medications, though generally not desirable, are necessary in many instances and can provide considerable relief. Among these strategies, anticholinergic medications for dystonias and parkinsonism are often effective. Beta-blockers and anticholinergic medications are useful for akathisia, and metformin may lead to slight to moderate weight loss.

### Risperdal [^1125uzoy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Data from two fixed-dose trials in adults with schizophrenia provided evidence of dose-relatedness for extrapyramidal symptoms associated with Risperdal treatment. Two methods were used to measure extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in an 8-week trial comparing four fixed doses of Risperdal (2, 6, 10, and 16 mg/day), including (1) a parkinsonism score (mean change from baseline) from the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, and (2) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS. Similar methods were used to measure EPS in an 8-week trial comparing five fixed doses of Risperdal (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day).

- **Dystonia**: Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

- **Other adverse reactions**: Adverse event data elicited by a checklist for side effects from a large study comparing five fixed doses of Risperdal (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day) were explored for dose-relatedness of adverse events. A Cochran-Armitage Test for trend in these data reveals…

### Haloperidol [^112nec4N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; antiparkinson agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome may be masked.

It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia, and if the medication is stopped at that time, the full syndrome may not develop.

- **Tardive dystonia**: Tardive dystonia, not associated with the above syndrome, has also been reported. It is characterized by a delayed onset of choreic or dystonic movements, is often persistent, and has the potential of becoming irreversible.

- **Dystonia**:
	- **Class effect**: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine D receptors [^1148VrZa]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Several different pharmacological theories have been proposed to account for the atypicality of SGAs. One proposed mechanism is antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptor, which is thought to "balance" striatal dopamine signaling and thus reduce extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). However, the observation that the SGA amisulpride, which is considerably more D2 selective over 5-HT2A yet still exhibits reduced EPS, suggests that this theory cannot account for all examples of atypicality.

Another enduring theory of atypicality is based on the dissociation kinetics of APDs from the D2 receptor. This concept originated from the observation that some atypical APDs have lower affinity for the D2 receptor than typical APDs, which was later demonstrated to be due to a faster dissociation rate. This led Seeman and Kapur to propose the "fast off hypothesis", whereby rapid dissociation from the D2 receptor contributes to the reduced side effect profile of atypical APDs. Key to this hypothesis is the rapid and transient nature of synaptic dopamine signaling. Rapid dissociation of an antagonist will allow a greater fraction of D2 receptors to be bound by the transiently high local concentrations of released dopamine, therefore out-competing the antagonist in a surmountable fashion. In contrast, an antagonist with a slow dissociation rate is unlikely to dissociate from the D2 receptor in the short time frame between dopamine release and re-uptake, blocking the receptor regardless of the local concentration of dopamine that is achieved, i.e. making the antagonism effectively insurmountable.

### Extrapyramidal symptoms and signs in first-episode, antipsychotic exposed and non-exposed patients with schizophrenia or related psychotic illness [^114yvm2d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Movement disorders in first-episode psychosis are increasingly recognized; however, the prevalence and clinical correlates remain uncertain. We compared antipsychotic-exposed (less than 12 weeks) with non-exposed first-episode patients and reported prevalence alongside clinical and demographic variables associated with extrapyramidal dysfunction. The data are baseline assessments from a multicenter, international drug trial of first-episode psychosis (n = 535). The analysis included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, Premorbid Adjustment Scale, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.

Of the non-exposed patients, 28.1% (n = 47/167) exhibited at least one mild sign of extrapyramidal dysfunction, as did 46.3% (n = 169/365) of previously exposed patients. Hypokinetic Parkinsonism was the most prevalent disorder. While the severity of movement disorders and negative symptoms were correlated, the effect sizes were small.

- **Risk factors for all patients**: Logistic regression analysis indicated that the salient risk factors included previous antipsychotic exposure [odds ratio (OR) = 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6–3.6] and poor premorbid functioning (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.2–2.6).

- **Non-exposed group (n = 167)**: Significant risk factors identified were having severe mental illness in the family (OR = 2.9; 95% CI 1.2–7.2) and poor premorbid functioning (OR = 2.3; 95% CI 1.0–5.3).

- **Previously exposed group (n = 368)**: Salient variables included poor premorbid functioning (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.2–2.8) and a shorter duration of untreated psychosis (OR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.64–0.94).

### Adverse effects of antipsychotic medications [^117Gq6AG]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Use of antipsychotic medications entails a difficult trade-off between the benefit of alleviating psychotic symptoms and the risk of troubling, sometimes life-shortening adverse effects. There is more variability among specific antipsychotic medications than there is between the first- and second-generation antipsychotic classes. The newer second-generation antipsychotics, especially clozapine and olanzapine, generally tend to cause more problems relating to metabolic syndrome, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Also, as a class, the older first-generation antipsychotics are more likely to be associated with movement disorders. However, this is primarily true of medications that bind tightly to dopaminergic neuroreceptors, such as haloperidol, and less true of medications that bind weakly, such as chlorpromazine. Anticholinergic effects are especially prominent with weaker-binding first-generation antipsychotics, as well as with the second-generation antipsychotic clozapine.

All antipsychotic medications are associated with an increased likelihood of sedation, sexual dysfunction, postural hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. Primary care physicians should understand the individual adverse effect profiles of these medications. They should be vigilant for the occurrence of adverse effects, be willing to adjust or change medications as needed (or work with psychiatric colleagues to do so), and be prepared to treat any resulting medical sequelae.

### Haloperidol lactate [^1125SAmG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)**: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs), and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

### The orexin-1 antagonist SB-334867 blocks antipsychotic treatment emergent catalepsy: Implications for the treatment of extrapyramidal symptoms [^111mzLbU]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

We have previously shown that the orexin-1 antagonist SB-334867 blocks the electrophysiological effects of haloperidol and olanzapine on the activity of A9 and A10 dopamine neurons. To evaluate if orexin-1 antagonists might block other effects of antipsychotic drugs in animals, we examined the effects of SB-334867 on the behavioral, neurochemical, and neuroendocrine effects of antipsychotic drugs. Pretreatment with SB-334867 (0.01–10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [IP]) significantly decreased the catalepsy produced by the administration of haloperidol (1 mg/kg, subcutaneous [SC]), risperidone (2 mg/kg, SC), and olanzapine (10 mg/kg, SC). Administration of SB-334467 also reversed catalepsy after it had been established in animals pretreated 2 hours earlier with haloperidol. However, pretreatment with SB-334867 (1–10 mg/kg, IP) did not block the decreases in exploratory locomotor activity produced by administration of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, SC) or risperidone (0.3 mg/kg, SC). In addition, pretreatment with SB-334867 (1–10 mg/kg, IP) neither blocked the increased levels of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the nucleus accumbens or striatum nor the elevation in serum prolactin produced by administration of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, SC) and risperidone (1 mg/kg, SC). Administration of SB-334867 alone neither changed locomotor activity and DOPAC or prolactin levels nor produced catalepsy. These results show that orexin-1 antagonists block the cataleptogenic effects of antipsychotics but do not block other locomotor, neurochemical, or neuroendocrine effects of antipsychotics.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine D receptors [^11492QDa]. Nature Communications (2017). High credibility.

Modeling of APD D2 receptor rebinding and its consequences for clinical "on-target" toxic effects involves the following:

- **Under conditions of limited diffusion**: Simulated dissociation rates of clinically relevant antipsychotics (APs) to human D2 receptors are based on the association (k_on) and dissociation (k_off) rates determined in competition kinetic binding experiments.

- **Under conditions of free diffusion**: The dissociation rates are measured by the off rates (k_off) obtained in competition kinetic binding experiments. For simulation purposes, the reversal rate (kᵣ) was modeled after an immunological synapse, as detailed in the methods section.

The relationship between clinical "on-target" effects and the kinetically derived overall reversal rate (kᵣ) was examined. A correlation plot illustrates the relationship between the log of kᵣ and the EPS odds ratio, taken from Leucht et al. This plot also highlights the relationship between the log of kᵣ and EPS odds ratio (relative to placebo or baseline conditions, averaged across studies), based on research in early psychosis patients. Additionally, a correlation plot depicts the relationship between the log of kᵣ and prolactin increase, also referenced from Leucht et al.

All kinetic data used in these plots are detailed in Table 1. Kinetic data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. from four experiments, while clinical data are expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) for prolactin increase and odds ratio for EPS, including credible intervals where indicated. The relationship between the two variables was assessed using a two-tailed Spearman's rank correlation.

### Seroquel XR [^113MSNMr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

At the end of treatment, the mean change from baseline in the SAS total score and BARS Global Assessment score was similar across the treatment groups. The use of concomitant anticholinergic medications was infrequent and similar across the treatment groups. The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was consistent with that seen with the profile of Seroquel in schizophrenia patients.

- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: In Tables 16–19, dystonic events included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, dystonia, muscle rigidity, and oculogyration; parkinsonism included cogwheel rigidity, tremor, drooling, and hypokinesia; akathisia included akathisia and psychomotor agitation; dyskinetic events included tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis; other extrapyramidal events included restlessness, extrapyramidal disorder, and movement disorder.

- **Clinical trial results**: In a placebo-controlled clinical trial for the treatment of bipolar mania, utilizing the dose range of 400–800 mg/day of Seroquel XR, the incidence of any adverse reactions related to EPS was 6.6% for Seroquel XR and 3.8% in the placebo group. In this study, the incidence of individual adverse reactions (akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, tremor, dystonia, restlessness, and cogwheel rigidity) did not exceed 2.0% for any adverse reaction.

### Ziprasidone [^115yBZgq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The incidence of reported extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which included the adverse reaction terms: extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, dystonia, dyskinesia, hypokinesia, tremor, paralysis, and twitching, was observed at 14% for ziprasidone-treated patients compared to 8% for those receiving placebo in short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia trials. Objectively collected data from these trials, utilizing the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale for EPS and the Barnes Akathisia Scale for akathisia, generally did not demonstrate a significant difference between ziprasidone and placebo.

- **Dystonia**: Symptoms of dystonia, which are prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms can include: spasm of the neck muscles, progressing sometimes to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. Although these symptoms can manifest at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher doses and with high potency first-generation antipsychotic drugs. There is an elevated risk of acute dystonia observed in males and younger age groups.

- **Vital sign changes**: Ziprasidone is associated with orthostatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

### Antipsychotic dose reduction compared to dose continuation for people with schizophrenia [^1174Xzfc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The DIEPSS is a clinician-rated scale assessing extrapyramidal side effects. It consists of eight items concerning individual extrapyramidal symptoms, scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 "normal" to 4 "severe". Similarly, a ninth item measures the global severity and frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms as well as their impact on daily living. A total score can be calculated by summing the scores of the eight individual items, ranging from 0 to 32, with a higher score indicating greater severity of extrapyramidal symptoms. Additionally, subscores can be used to measure parkinsonism, akathisia, and dyskinesia. One study used DIEPSS [Takeuchi 2014].

The Maryland Psychiatric Research Center Involuntary Movement Scale (MPRC) [Cassady 1997] is a clinician-rated scale measuring drug-induced dyskinesia and parkinsonism. The dyskinesia rating consists of 13 items, each scored on an 8-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 7, indicating lower to higher severity. A total score can be calculated by summing the scores of all relevant items, where a higher score indicates a higher severity of dyskinesia. Similarly, the parkinsonism rating consists of 15 items that can be scored from 0 to 7, and a total score is calculated by summing the scores of all relevant items, with a higher score indicating a higher severity of parkinsonism. One study used MPRC [Carpenter 1999].

The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) [Barnes 1989] is a clinician-rated scale measuring drug-induced akathisia. It consists of three items corresponding to two domains: 1) objective, scored from 0 to 3, and 2) subjective awareness of restlessness, scored from…

### Rykindo extended-release microspheres [^111BwYAu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The dose dependency of adverse reactions in clinical trials was examined with a focus on extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Two methods were utilized to measure EPS in a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. This trial compared three doses of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) — 25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg — with a placebo in patients with schizophrenia. The methods included: (1) the incidence of spontaneous reports of EPS symptoms and (2) the change from baseline to endpoint on the total score of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), which is the sum of the subscale scores for parkinsonism, dystonia, and dyskinesia.

The overall incidence of EPS-related adverse reactions, including akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism, and tremor, in patients treated with the 25 mg risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) was comparable to that of patients treated with placebo. However, the incidence of EPS-related adverse reactions was higher in patients treated with the 50 mg risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular).

The median change from baseline to endpoint in the total ESRS score showed no worsening in patients treated with risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) compared with patients treated with placebo: 0 in the placebo group, -1 in the 25-mg group (significantly less than the placebo group), and 0 in the 50-mg group.

Symptoms of dystonia, which are prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include neck muscle spasms, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine D receptors [^113sqemr]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Consistent with the fast-dissociation hypothesis of APD atypicality, we found that hyperprolactinemia was correlated with the dissociation rate (k_off). Ligands that were the slowest to dissociate from the D2 receptor displayed the greatest liability for prolactin elevation in patients. Surprisingly, however, we found it was k_on and not k_off that was correlated with the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Thus, drugs that bind more rapidly have greater liability for EPS, challenging the hypothesis that the dissociation rate is the sole determinant of a compound's liability to produce this side effect. To illustrate, the typical APD chlorpromazine has a k_off value similar to that of clozapine but has much greater EPS liability. The increased propensity for EPS of chlorpromazine relates instead to its rapid association rate (k_on). A recent study by Sahlholm and colleagues is consistent with this interpretation. These authors used D2 receptor-evoked potassium channel activation to estimate receptor kinetics. Interestingly, the off rates determined by this indirect measurement, which were broadly consistent with the values obtained in the study, did not distinguish between the typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.

### SPL drug information for loxapine succinate [^116cKhPn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of loxapine PO (also known as Adasuve) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms. Neonates exposed to loxapine and other antipsychotic medications during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms after delivery. Reports include agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorders in these neonates. These complications have ranged in severity from self-limited to those requiring ICU support and prolonged hospitalization. Neonates exhibiting signs or symptoms of extrapyramidal effects or withdrawal should be carefully monitored. The knowledge about the long-term neurobehavioral effects in offspring is limited for all antipsychotic agents and requires further investigation.

### Antipsychotics with similar association kinetics at dopamine Dreceptors differ in extrapyramidal side-effects [^115e6D4T]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

The recent publication in Nature Communications by Sykes et al. made the interesting observation that forward binding rate constants (k on) at the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) differ widely between antipsychotics. Moreover, k on, rather than k off (dissociation rate constant) values, correlate with their liabilities to produce extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). A high k on is postulated to cause a high degree of rebinding of the antipsychotic to D2R, conferring increased competition with endogenous dopamine and thereby more EPS.

As pointed out by the authors, their results are largely in agreement with our previous findings from a potassium channel (G protein-activated inward rectifier potassium; GIRK) activation assay. However, there are some discrepancies between their work and ours, which may have important consequences for the interpretation of the correlation between k on and EPS, and which we would like to point out below.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine D receptors [^114N7qiw]. Nature Communications (2017). High credibility.

To further explore this finding, we employed a more holistic model of receptor binding that integrates both the association and dissociation rates in a system mimicking the environment of the synapse. This model assumes that diffusion of the drug out of the synapse is reduced by the physical barriers created by the pre- and post-synaptic membranes, effectively creating a compartment separate from the bulk aqueous phase. The consequence of this is that freshly dissociated ligands tend to remain in close proximity with membrane surfaces for longer, increasing the probability of a second binding event to the same or nearby receptor. By using our measured association and dissociation rates in this model, we have estimated the overall relative rate of reversal of receptor blockade, termed k r.

As illustrated in Fig. 4, compounds with similar affinity and/or k off do not share the same potential to rebind receptors, a process which in the face of limited diffusion and subsaturating dopamine concentrations, is governed largely by k on. Remarkably, when we calculated the receptor reversal rate kᵣ for each APD using the measured kinetic parameters, we found that this parameter was significantly correlated with the incidence of EPS (Spearman's rₛ = −0.64, P < 0.05, see Fig. 4c). The active standardized mean difference (SMD) produced a similar correlation with k on and k r, strongly suggesting that the process of rebinding and associated EPS liability may be a limiting factor for treatment effectiveness (see Supplementary Figs. 2 c and 3a), ultimately leading to discontinuation.

### Antipsychotic medication for women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^1135RM3F]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Antipsychotics such as amisulpride, risperidone, paliperidone, and aripiprazole are associated with a high risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Although acute dystonia appears to be less common in premenopausal female patients, women seem to have a greater risk of developing parkinsonism and akathisia compared to males, likely due to higher dopamine receptor binding at lower dosages in women. The higher risk for women of developing parkinsonism has also been reported in other patient populations prescribed antipsychotic medications, for example, in patients with dementia. Multiple reviews indicate that an increased prevalence of EPS in women is associated with a postmenopausal estrogen decline. Long-term exposure to dopamine receptor-blocking agents can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), which is also more common in women compared to men of all ages. The incidence of antipsychotic-induced TD is relatively low in premenopausal women (3–5%), possibly due to the protective antioxidant effects of estrogens, but can reach an incidence rate of 30% in postmenopausal women after one year of cumulative exposure to antipsychotics.

### Thioridazine hydrochloride [^113cVs8h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Extrapyramidal symptoms include akathisia, agitation, motor restlessness, dystonic reactions, trismus, torticollis, opisthotonus, oculogyric crises, tremor, muscular rigidity, and akinesia.

Tardive dyskinesia is a condition that can develop with the chronic use of antipsychotics; the salient features of this syndrome are detailed in the warnings section. The syndrome is characterized by involuntary choreoathetoid movements which variously involve the tongue, face, mouth, lips, or jaw (e.g. protrusion of the tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of the mouth, chewing movements), trunk, and extremities. The severity of the syndrome and the degree of impairment produced varies widely.

The syndrome may become clinically recognizable either during treatment, upon dosage reduction, or upon withdrawal of treatment. Movements may decrease in intensity and may disappear altogether if further treatment with antipsychotics is withheld. Reversibility is generally believed to be more likely after short, rather than long-term, antipsychotic exposure. Consequently, early detection of tardive dyskinesia is important. To increase the likelihood of detecting the syndrome at the earliest possible time, the dosage of antipsychotic drug should be reduced periodically (if clinically possible) and the patient observed for signs of the disorder. This maneuver is critical, as antipsychotic drugs may mask the signs of the syndrome.

### Risperidone versus haloperidol in psychotic patients with disturbing neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms: A double-blind, multi-center trial [^112dXtY4]. Schizophrenia Research (2000). Low credibility.

A randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial was initiated to compare the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during risperidone and haloperidol treatment in schizophrenic patients who experienced disturbing EPS during previous neuroleptic treatment. Additional objectives of this trial included comparing the antipsychotic effectiveness of the two treatments and the use of antiparkinsonian medication.

- **Methods**: Effects of flexible doses of risperidone and haloperidol were compared in 77 psychotic patients (83% with chronic schizophrenia) with disturbing neuroleptic-induced EPS (risperidone 40 patients, haloperidol 37). The trial was completed by 47 patients: 25 in the risperidone group (12 women, 13 men), and 22 in the haloperidol group (10 women, 12 men).

- **Results**: An adequate antipsychotic effect was obtained in most patients by both treatments. The primary aim of this trial was comparing parkinsonism measured with the extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS) during treatment with risperidone and haloperidol. Two primary parameters were selected: the change from baseline to the worst score during treatment of ESRS II (parkinsonism) and ESRS VI (clinical global impression of severity of parkinsonism). The CGI of severity of parkinsonism was better with risperidone (P = 0.025), while the parkinsonism total score tended to be better with risperidone (P < 0.10). Before the double-blind treatment, 34 (of the 77) had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 18, haloperidol 16). During the double-blind treatment phase, 21 patients had used antiparkinson medication.

### Extrapyramidal symptoms in unmedicated schizophrenia [^112dwUi7]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Studies of spontaneous extrapyramidal symptoms, dyskinesia, and parkinsonism in unmedicated schizophrenia are crucial for understanding their underlying pathology and relation to psychosis. This study examines extrapyramidal symptoms by using the Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale for dyskinesia and the Simpson-Angus Scale for parkinsonism in 143 schizophrenia patients who have never received antipsychotic medication. Psychopathology was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Dyskinesia was present in 35% of patients, and parkinsonism in 15%. The two disorders coexisted in 11 subjects, with orofacial dyskinesia, rigidity, and tremor being common symptoms noted.

There was no significant change in the rates and total scores of dyskinesia and parkinsonism with gender, age, duration of illness, or age at onset of psychosis. Dyskinesia was unrelated to psychopathology. However, the parkinsonism score correlated positively with the motor symptom cluster of psychopathology. Additionally, dyskinesia and parkinsonism scores correlated positively with each other, and the parkinsonism score was able to discriminate the presence of dyskinesia.

The associations between these spontaneous abnormal movements and other aspects of schizophrenia differ from those described in treated patients. Dyskinesia and parkinsonism appear to be integral parts of the schizophrenia disease process, with their relationships with other factors potentially influenced by antipsychotic drug treatment.

### Antipsychotics with similar association kinetics at dopamine D receptors differ in extrapyramidal side-effects [^113DF7Ya]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

In summary, while we find the concept of rebinding, as discussed by Sykes et al, to be of great interest and potential utility to the field of neuropharmacology, we believe that the rate constant (k on) is not the only factor governing extrapyramidal side-effect (EPS) liability, even when considering D2 receptor-preferring compounds. This is illustrated by comparing haloperidol and remoxipride, which, despite having similar k on at D2 receptors in our studies, show very distinct EPS profiles in the clinic.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: Recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^112pcFdC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Use of antipsychotics is one of the most controversial areas in catatonia management. Antipsychotic medications can induce catatonia (see section 'Antipsychotic-induced catatonia') and worsen it. Catatonia is also a risk factor for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a severe antipsychotic-induced movement disorder. Moreover, in some studies of catatonia, the use of antipsychotics has been associated with poor outcomes.

Nevertheless, dopamine receptor antagonists and partial agonists have been reported in some cases as beneficial in catatonia. This may particularly be the case in catatonic schizophrenia. There have been reports of the use of olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) theoretically would be less likely to strongly antagonize dopamine receptors. This makes them potentially less dangerous adjunctive treatments than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) in terms of NMS risk. Aripiprazole's partial agonism might balance the dopaminergic effects and be of some benefit for catatonia. A recent Cochrane review found only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) of antipsychotics for schizophrenia spectrum disorders with catatonic features, and considered the evidence to be of very low quality due to a small sample size, short duration, risk of bias and other methodological issues. This RCT compared risperidone to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), finding greater improvement in the ECT-treated group.

Given that D2 receptor antagonists can worsen catatonia and trigger NMS in an at-risk group, careful consideration is warranted in their use.

### Fluphenazine decanoate [^113KgkgM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pregnancy: Non-teratogenic effects - Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.

Fluphenazine decanoate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

- **Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis**: In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy. Fluphenazine decanoate injection, USP should be discontinued at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm³) require special attention.

### Treating movement disorders and akathisia as side effects of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy [^1138CNru]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

One of the most common reasons for switching antipsychotic medication is to reduce the burden of side effects, particularly movement disorders and akathisia associated with typical antipsychotics. Adjusting the antipsychotic dose and, if necessary, switching treatment to an antipsychotic with a low extrapyramidal symptom liability may help to optimize the clinical management of schizophrenia. Switching from a typical to an atypical antipsychotic or between atypical antipsychotics involves considering a variety of factors relating to the patient, illness, medication, and the patient's environment.

### Drug-induced psychotic symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Problems, management and dilemma [^113EEmqe]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Psychotic symptoms develop in 20–30% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who receive chronic anti-PD medications. Visual hallucinations, with or without delirium and paranoid delusions, are the most frequent symptoms. These psychotic symptoms disturb the activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QOL) of PD patients, placing a greater burden on caregivers than the motor disabilities. Effective management of drug-induced psychotic symptoms is crucial.

Withdrawal of anti-PD drugs can relieve the patients' psychotic side effects, but this often worsens parkinsonian motor symptoms. The first step in treatment involves eliminating triggering factors other than anti-PD drugs, such as infections, metabolic disorders, subdural hematoma, and hallucinogenic drugs.

- **Medication adjustments**: Anti-PD drugs should be eliminated in the following order:
	- **First**: Anticholinergics, amantadine, and selegiline
	- **Second**: Dopamine agonists
	- **Finally**: Levodopa/carbidopa

Anti-PD medications should be reduced to improve psychotic side effects without significantly worsening parkinsonian motor symptoms.

- **Consideration of antipsychotic drugs**: When prior adjustments fail to alleviate psychotic side effects sufficiently, the use of antipsychotic drugs may be considered, despite their potential to antagonize dopamine D2 receptors and worsen parkinsonism. Atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, are recommended, though clozapine is not available in Japan.

### Haloperidol [^117TfTv7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome. For further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to adverse reactions.

- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)**: A potentially fatal symptom complex, sometimes referred to as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs), and evidence of autonomic instability, such as irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g. pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

### Second-generation antipsychotic drugs and extrapyramidal side effects: A systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head comparisons [^111WwvP7]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

While all second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are promoted for having a low risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), clinical observations suggest differences between the various agents. Nevertheless, this question has never been examined in a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head comparisons.

- **Methods**: We searched the register of the Cochrane schizophrenia group (last search May 2007), supplemented by MEDLINE (last search July 2009) for randomized, blinded studies comparing the following SGAs in the treatment of schizophrenia or related disorders: amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone, and zotepine. At least three reviewers extracted the data independently. The primary outcome was "use of antiparkinson medication". The results were combined in a meta-analysis.

- **Results**: We included 54 studies with 116 arms. Risperidone was associated with more use of antiparkinson medication than clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone. Ziprasidone showed more use of antiparkinson medication than olanzapine and quetiapine, and zotepine more than clozapine. There was no significant difference between amisulpride and its comparators (olanzapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone). Quetiapine showed significantly less use of antiparkinson medication than the three other SGAs it was compared with (olanzapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone). Scale-derived data (Barnes Akathisia Scale and Simpson Angus Scale) were limited.

- **Conclusions**: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that there are differences between the SGAs in terms of their association with the use of antiparkinson medication.

### Pimozide [^11121kGy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that minimizes the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients with a chronic illness known to respond to these drugs and for whom alternative, equally effective but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients requiring chronic treatment, the smallest dose and shortest duration producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought, and the need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome. For further information about tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to the sections on adverse reactions and precautions.

### Antipsychotic drugs and extrapyramidal side effects in first episode psychosis: a systematic review of head-head comparisons [^11522qag]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

This systematic review aimed to determine whether the risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) differed between antipsychotic drugs used in first episode psychosis (FEP). We identified 11 RCTs comparing two or more antipsychotics in FEP and reporting on EPS. All trials assessed one or more second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs); one assessed chlorpromazine, one zuclopenthixol, and seven trials assessed haloperidol. Assessment and reporting of EPS varied. Compared with one or more SGA comparators, haloperidol was associated with significantly higher rates/severity of parkinsonism (seven trials), akathisia (six trials), and greater use of anticholinergics (five trials) and beta-blockers (two trials). Two trials with low-dose haloperidol (≤ 4 mg) showed significantly worse EPS outcomes versus an SGA. Two of four long-term haloperidol trials (≥ 1 year) found a higher dyskinesia risk with haloperidol versus olanzapine and risperidone, respectively. The remaining two trials found no difference (various SGA comparators). There was an EPS advantage for clozapine versus chlorpromazine (one trial) and risperidone versus zuclopenthixol (one trial). There was little evidence of EPS differences between SGAs, possibly reflecting the use of low doses. We conclude that SGAs offer an EPS advantage over FGAs in FEP, though the evidence largely relates to comparisons with haloperidol. Standardized assessment and reporting of EPS would assist future research.

### Antipsychotic dose reduction compared to dose continuation for people with schizophrenia [^113SArWT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

- **Incidence and scale-based change of various specific adverse effects**:

	- **Number of participants needing antiparkinsonian medication**: Two studies reported the number of participants needing antiparkinsonian medication. Only one study reported data at the 12-month time point. No difference emerged between dose reduction and dose continuation (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.31, n = 397) (Analysis 1.94).

	- **Number of participants with at least one extrapyramidal symptom**: Two studies reported the number of participants with at least one extrapyramidal symptom. No difference emerged between dose reduction and dose continuation (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.76, 2 RCTs, n = 417, I² = 0%) (Analysis 1.95). There was no difference between separate time points (test for subgroup differences P = 0.88) (Analysis 1.96).

	- **Number of participants with parkinsonism**: Two studies reported the number of participants with parkinsonism. No difference emerged between dose reduction and dose continuation at any time point (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.81, 2 RCTs, n = 863, I² = 0%). There was no difference between separate time points (test for subgroup differences P = 0.66) (Analysis 1.97).

	- **Numbers of participants with other movement disorder symptoms**: Two studies reported the number of participants with rigidity. No difference emerged between dose reduction and dose continuation at any time point (less than six months: RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.11 to 54.87, 1 RCT, n = 20; less than one year: RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.11 to 54.87, 2 RCTs, n = 486).

### Combined low-dose clozapine with low-dose aripiprazole in a schizophrenic patient [^111roMWv]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Aripiprazole, a partial dopaminergic agonist, represents a well-tolerated and effective addition to the antipsychotic armamentarium. However, accumulated data indicates that aripiprazole may still induce extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) in susceptible patients. Guidelines for treating schizophrenia have consistently recommended antipsychotic monotherapy. Nevertheless, in certain clinical situations, a thorough evaluation of the benefit/risk ratio suggests that combinations of antipsychotic agents may improve treatment efficacy and tolerability. We report a schizophrenic patient for whom sequential administration of aripiprazole and risperidone induced severe EPS, and subsequent combination therapy with clozapine and aripiprazole achieved adequate symptom control and markedly reduced EPS.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine D receptors [^111YocXS]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) have been hypothesized to show reduced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) due to their rapid dissociation from the dopamine D2 receptor. However, support for this hypothesis is limited to a relatively small number of observations made across several decades and under different experimental conditions. Here, we show that association rates, but not dissociation rates, correlate with EPS.

We measured the kinetic binding properties of a series of typical and atypical APDs in a novel time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay and correlated these properties with their EPS and prolactin-elevating liabilities at therapeutic doses. EPS are robustly predicted by a rebinding model that considers the microenvironment of postsynaptic D2 receptors. This model integrates association and dissociation rates to calculate the net rate of reversal of receptor blockade.

Thus, optimizing binding kinetics at the D2 receptor may result in APDs with an improved therapeutic profile. Atypical antipsychotics show reduced extrapyramidal side effects compared to first-generation drugs. The authors use time-resolved FRET to measure binding kinetics and show that side effects correlate with drug association rates to the D2 receptor, while dissociation rates correlate with prolactin elevation.

### High dose antipsychotic polypharmacy and dopamine partial agonists - time to rethink guidelines [^117FpApx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). High credibility.

The combination of two antipsychotic agents may exceed the high dose threshold, which is perceived as high risk and may require explicit justification for their prescription. The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines indicate that antipsychotic augmentation to address inadequate symptom response should only be considered after other treatment options have been exhausted, including "several, adequate, sequential trials of antipsychotic monotherapy". This guideline reflects and guides UK practice where switching is generally preferred over augmentation with another antipsychotic drug, despite the acknowledged paucity of supportive evidence. Consequently, drug combinations are often avoided, and alternative, but perhaps suboptimal, strategies are employed.

The pharmacological basis for the high dose risk is clear; additional blockade of D2 receptors above what is necessary for an antipsychotic response increases the liability for dopaminergic side effects, such as EPS and prolactin secretion, without enhancing efficacy. Furthermore, depending on the particular drugs being combined, other receptor-mediated side effects are likely to increase. Some side effects, such as metabolic effects and QT prolongation, may contribute to increased mortality. However, this pharmacological argument does not consistently hold up for the combination of partial agonists with antagonists. In terms of the main antipsychotic mechanism, which involves drug action at the dopamine D2 receptor, dopamine D2 partial agonists should be further evaluated.

### Relationship of extrapyramidal symptoms to age at onset and drug treatment in middle-aged and elderly schizophrenic patients [^113eojS6]. Schizophrenia Research (2001). Low credibility.

The relationship between antipsychotic drugs and dyskinesias, as well as other extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in schizophrenia, is not straightforward. There is a need to study variables that may influence the occurrence of EPS in schizophrenic patients receiving drugs. This study examined the relationship of age at onset of illness and treatment to the development of EPS in 122 middle-aged and elderly schizophrenic patients: 84 treated and 38 who had never received antipsychotic drugs.

The illness had an early onset (before 45 years, EOS) in 68 patients and a late onset (after 45 years, LOS) in 54 patients. The patients were evaluated for dyskinesia and parkinsonism using the Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale (AIMS) and the Simpson-Angus Scale. The prevalence of dyskinesia and parkinsonism was similar in all patient groups. The scores on limb-axial and severity subscales of AIMS were significantly higher in the treated than the untreated patients of the early onset group. This was not the case with the late onset patients. The total parkinsonism score was higher among the treated patients, notably the LOS patients.

The development of dyskinesia and parkinsonism in schizophrenia is possibly related to the age at onset of the illness. In late onset forms, the aging of the patient and a possible neurological abnormality related to schizophrenia might enhance the EPS-inducing effect of drugs.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine Dreceptors [^114sKRG9]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Moreover, our model and the relative positions of compounds in Fig. 5a appear to help rationalize why certain compounds originally introduced as SGA/atypical APDs have typical profiles, e.g. zotapine, and conversely why drugs originally classified as FGA/typical APDs, such as melperone, are capable of displaying atypical behavior. The reality is that the side effects of APDs comprise multiple, pharmacologically separable effects. Hence, a more rational approach to classification is to consider a continuum based on the specific pharmacology of a given side effect rather than the dichotomous system. This has led us to speculate that there is likely to be a kinetic "sweet spot" where rebinding is sufficient for efficacy but not enough to cause EPS. Through optimization of these kinetic parameters, it may be possible to develop a new generation of safer drugs for a disease that still has high unmet medical need.

### Antipsychotic-induced urinary dysfunction: Anticholinergic effect or otherwise [^113yDSDj]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary difficulties such as incontinence (UI) and retention (UR) have been reported with both typical and atypical antipsychotics. These challenges have been hypothesized as being a form of extrapyramidal side effects or due to anticholinergic side effects. However, we believe this may not be the case. Here, we report a male patient with bipolar disorder who developed urinary difficulties with antipsychotics, both typical and atypical, and in whom only aripiprazole seemed to work. We also hypothesize on the possible mechanisms of adverse urinary effects of antipsychotics.

### Lewy body dementia: The litmus test for neuroleptic sensitivity and extrapyramidal symptoms [^116kMP8J]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Lewy body dementia, also referred to as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), is a neurodegenerative disorder now considered to be the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Postmortem findings suggest that DLB accounts for 20% to 34% of all dementia cases and is often underdiagnosed. Salient features of DLB include fluctuations in cognition, perceptual abnormalities (e.g. visual hallucinations), and mild parkinsonism. Other symptoms include frequent falls, nighttime agitation, and depression.

DLB symptomatology can be partly explained by the extensive destruction of dopaminergic and acetylcholinergic pathways caused by neurodegeneration. For this reason, DLB patients are especially vulnerable to the antidopaminergic and anticholinergic actions of most conventional antipsychotics, which makes treatment of the psychotic symptoms of DLB extremely difficult. Patients are particularly sensitive to developing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and also to the potentially fatal complication of neuroleptic sensitivity, which affects approximately 50% of DLB patients. Therefore, a need exists for antipsychotic drugs with less propensity to induce EPS and reduced affinity for dopamine and acetylcholine receptors.

Here we review studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of psychoses associated with DLB. Olanzapine appears to be poorly tolerated, and risperidone has been associated with a high risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Clozapine use remains controversial because of its potent anticholinergic action.

### Improvement of extrapyramidal symptoms following dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) administration in antipsychotic treated schizophrenia patients: a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial [^116kZUVv]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

Recent investigation in schizophrenia indicated dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels to be inversely correlated with extrapyramidal symptomatology (EPS). This study thus investigates the effect of DHEA administration on medication-induced EPS. Inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either 100 mg DHEA or placebo in addition to a constant dosage of antipsychotic medication. Parkinsonism showed a favorable effect of DHEA with a significant time effect (p < 0.0001), as well as a significant group by time interaction (p < 0.05), with no change noted on akathisia. Change of DHEA blood levels was negatively associated with the change of Parkinsonism (p < 0.05) as well as with the change of total EPS ratings (p < 0.05). DHEA appears to demonstrate a significant effect on EPS, with improvement observed particularly in Parkinsonian symptoms.

### A randomised controlled study of risperidone and olanzapine for schizophrenic patients with neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia or parkinsonism [^112xjzjH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of risperidone and olanzapine in schizophrenic patients with intolerant extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) on first-generation antipsychotics. We conducted an 8-week, rater-blinded, flexible dose study. Seventy patients with schizophrenia who met the DSM-IV research criteria of having neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia or parkinsonism were randomly assigned to the risperidone or olanzapine group. The primary outcome was a comparison of the incidence of concomitant anticholinergic drug usage between the groups to manage their acute dystonia and parkinsonism. The average doses of risperidone and olanzapine from baseline to study endpoint were 1.8–3.5 mg/day and 7.7–11.7 mg/day, respectively.

There were no significant differences in demographic data, severity of EPS, or psychotic symptoms between the groups at baseline assessment. Patients taking risperidone had a significantly higher incidence of using anticholinergic drugs to manage acute dystonia or parkinsonism overall during the study (OR = 5.17, 95% CI = 1.49–17.88, P = 0.013). There was no significant between-group difference in the change of rating scales for EPS and psychotic symptoms. The results of our study favor olanzapine as a better choice in schizophrenic patients with intolerant EPS. A double-blinded, fixed-dose study with different ethnic groups for EPS-intolerant schizophrenic patients is needed to confirm the results of our study.

### Chlorpromazine hydrochloride [^113t7AR1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, and therapy may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

For further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to the sections on PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS.

### Lack of association between antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms and polymorphisms in dopamine metabolism and transport genes [^11139YSo]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between functional polymorphisms in genes coding for dopamine metabolism and transport enzymes and the incidence of acute antipsychotic (AP)-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). We did not find evidence of the involvement of these polymorphisms in the predisposition towards or protection from EPS.

### Sensorimotor dysfunction of grasping in schizophrenia: A side effect of antipsychotic treatment [^116C1A85]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia is frequently associated with extrapyramidal side effects. Objective behavioral measures to evaluate the severity of these side effects in the clinical setting do not exist.

- **Objectives**: This study was designed to investigate grasping movements in five drug-naive and 13 medicated subjects with schizophrenia, comparing their performance with that of 18 healthy control subjects. Deficits in grip force performance were correlated with clinical scores of both Parkinson-like motor disability and psychiatric symptom severity.

- **Methods**: Participants performed vertical arm movements with a handheld instrumented object and caught a weight dropped into a handheld cup, either expectedly from the opposite hand or unexpectedly from the experimenter's hand. The scaling of grip force and the temporospatial coupling between grip and load force profiles were analyzed. Psychiatric symptom severity was assessed by the positive and negative symptom score of schizophrenia and the brief psychiatric rating scale. Extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed by the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale.

- **Results**: Drug-naive subjects with schizophrenia performed similarly to healthy controls. In contrast, medicated subjects with schizophrenia exhibited excessive grip force scaling and impaired coupling between grip and load force profiles. These performance deficits were strongly correlated with the severity of both extrapyramidal side effects related to antipsychotic therapy and negative symptoms related to the underlying pathology.

### Molindone hydrochloride [^112VMyKv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The central nervous system (CNS) effects of molindone hydrochloride are significant. The most frequently occurring effect is initial drowsiness, which generally subsides with continued usage or lowering of the dose. Less frequently, patients may experience depression, hyperactivity, and euphoria.

- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Extrapyramidal symptoms may occur in susceptible individuals and are usually reversible with appropriate management.

	- **Akathisia**: Motor restlessness may occur early.

	- **Parkinson syndrome**: Akinesia is characterized by rigidity, immobility, reduction of voluntary movements, and tremor. This occurs less frequently than akathisia.

	- **Dystonia**: This is a class effect. Symptoms of dystonia, which are prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

### Pathophysiology of antipsychotic drug-induced movement disorders [^1163vzLk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Explaining the underlying mechanisms of antipsychotic drug-induced movement disorders remains a substantial challenge. The association of atypical antipsychotic agents with fewer drug-induced movement disorders than conventional agents has engendered several pathophysiologic hypotheses:

- **Hypothesis of serotonin vs. dopamine receptors**: Unlike conventional antipsychotic agents, atypical antipsychotics have greater activity in blocking serotonin-2A (5-HT(2A)) receptors than dopamine-2 (D(2)) receptors, which mitigates extrapyramidal symptoms.

- **D(2) receptor action duration hypothesis**: Atypical antipsychotics block D(2) receptors only long enough to cause an antipsychotic action, but not as long as conventional agents.

- **Tardive dyskinesia and dopamine sensitivity hypothesis**: In tardive dyskinesia, the nigrostriatal dopamine receptor system might develop increased sensitivity to dopamine due to treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs; this may not occur with atypical antipsychotics.

- **Genetic association in tardive dystonia hypothesis**: There might be a genetic association in tardive dystonia relating to the dopamine D(3) allele.

A number of factors contribute to the difficult task of gaining insight into the pathophysiologic processes of antipsychotic agents and why these agents may lead to drug-induced movement disorders.

### Update on treatments for nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease-an evidence-based medicine review [^115Qhydj]. Movement Disorders (2019). High credibility.

Dose reductions of antiparkinsonian drugs to a level that will lead to a resolution of psychotic symptoms while maintaining sufficient symptomatic motor control is not always feasible, and the start of antipsychotic therapy becomes necessary. Frequently, the treatment of psychosis in PD will include the addition of an antipsychotic agent.

Low-dosage quetiapine, although not formally established as efficacious in RCTs, can be considered a pragmatic first choice because of its improved safety profile when compared with clozapine. In countries where pimavanserin is available, this may be preferable for the treatment of psychosis in PD as it is considered "efficacious" in this instance. Clozapine is another antipsychotic agent with proven efficacy and should be used in all cases that fail following treatment with quetiapine or pimavanserin, but can also be considered a first-line option despite onerous weekly blood count monitoring. On the other hand, pimavanserin is a relatively new drug, and as such, there is a lack of long-term safety data. A very recent FDA analysis found no new or unexpected safety risks associated with pimavanserin.

All antipsychotics must be used with great caution in demented patients with psychosis because of the risk of adverse events that include falls, cognitive worsening, pneumonia, cardiovascular effects, stroke, and death. Recently, preliminary research has shown an increased risk of mortality and morbidity with antipsychotic use in PD patients, too, and not specific to dementia. Additional controlled research is needed to determine if a broader risk pattern exists.

### Perphenazine [^116k38hm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Not all of the following adverse reactions have been reported with this specific drug; however, pharmacological similarities among various phenothiazine derivatives require that each be considered. With the piperazine group (of which perphenazine is an example), extrapyramidal symptoms are more common, while others (e.g. sedative effects, jaundice, and blood dyscrasias) are less frequently seen.

- **CNS effects**: Extrapyramidal symptoms associated with perphenazine may include:
	- **Muscle and limb symptoms**: Opisthotonus, trismus, torticollis, retrocollis, aching and numbness of the limbs, aching and rounding of the tongue
	- **Face and throat symptoms**: Protrusion, discoloration, tonic spasm of the masticatory muscles, tight feeling in the throat, slurred speech, dysphagia
	- **General motor symptoms**: Motor restlessness, oculogyric crisis, hyperreflexia, dystonia, akathisia, dyskinesia, parkinsonism, ataxia

	Their incidence and severity usually increase with an increase in dosage; however, there is considerable individual variation in the tendency to develop such symptoms. Extrapyramidal symptoms can usually be controlled by the concomitant use of effective antiparkinsonian drugs, such as benztropine mesylate, and/or by a reduction in dosage. In some instances, these extrapyramidal reactions may persist after discontinuation of treatment with perphenazine.

- **Dystonia**: Class effect symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion.

### Fluphenazine hydrochloride [^116jWX87]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The side effects most frequently reported with phenothiazine compounds are extrapyramidal symptoms, including pseudoparkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia, akathisia, oculogyric crises, opisthotonos, and hyperreflexia. Most often, these extrapyramidal symptoms are reversible; however, they may be persistent. The incidence and severity of such reactions with any given phenothiazine derivative depend more on individual patient sensitivity than on other factors, although dosage level and patient age also play significant roles.

Extrapyramidal reactions may be alarming, and patients should be forewarned and reassured. These reactions can usually be controlled by administration of antiparkinsonian drugs, such as benztropine mesylate or intravenous caffeine and sodium benzoate injection, followed by a subsequent reduction in dosage.

- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Symptoms of dystonia, characterized by prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher doses and with high-potency first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

- **Tardive dyskinesia**: The syndrome is characterized by involuntary choreoathetoid movements. Please refer to the WARNINGS section for more details.

### Side effects of atypical antipsychotics: A brief overview [^117U3pwi]. World Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the available evidence concerning the side effects of atypical antipsychotics, including weight gain, type II diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, QTc interval prolongation, myocarditis, sexual side effects, extrapyramidal side effects, and cataracts. The paper also provides recommendations on how to prevent and manage these side effects. It concludes that atypical antipsychotics do not represent a homogeneous class and that differences in side effects should be taken into account by clinicians when choosing an antipsychotic for an individual patient.

### Assessing and maximizing the safety and tolerability of antipsychotics used in the treatment of children and adolescents [^113kLvMe]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

When taking antipsychotic medications, children and adolescents seem to have a higher risk than adults for experiencing adverse events such as extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin elevation, sedation, weight gain, and metabolic effects. Side effects may be predicted by the pharmacologic binding profiles of antipsychotics to certain neuroreceptors.

Data from seven recently completed randomized placebo-controlled trials in adolescent schizophrenia and pediatric bipolar disorder, which included a total of 1,480 patients, extend prior results and provide numbers-needed-to-harm as a clinically useful measure of risk. Results from these pediatric studies indicate that adverse effect profiles differ among commonly used antipsychotics. However, more detailed data are needed, as information is lacking regarding carryover or withdrawal effects from prior medications and regarding the masking of effects by adjunctive treatments used to treat agitation, insomnia, or extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia in these studies.

Moreover, randomized head-to-head trials and large-scale studies that investigate predictors of adverse effects, as well as the safety and efficacy of interventions aimed at preventing and reversing negative effects of antipsychotics with relevant impact on psychological, psychiatric, and physical functioning, are lacking. When choosing an antipsychotic treatment, patients and their families should be included in a careful risk-benefit assessment. Consideration of adverse effects, as well as dietary and lifestyle counseling, should be part of any antipsychotic treatment initiation.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine D receptors [^115WQQ5i]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Comparing kinetics and on-target side effects of APDs, historically, the link between APD D₂ receptor affinity and dissociation rate is based on the assumption that antipsychotic drugs (APDs) exhibit approximately the same kₒₙ for D₂ receptors. However, we observed an increased range in k_on values between the atypical APDs compared to a relatively small range in kₒff values. In contrast, for typical APDs, there was a much narrower variation in the value of k_on, and differences in affinity were driven instead by changes in k_off. Notably, the typical APD chlorpromazine exhibits k_off values similar to or indeed faster than atypical APDs.

We have correlated our kinetic binding data with clinical findings taken from a recent meta-analysis of multiple-treatment studies comparing side effect profiles across a diverse group of APDs. Both prolactin elevation and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are "on-target" adverse side effects related to D₂ receptor blockade, whereas adverse effects, such as QT interval prolongation and sedation, are generally considered "off-target" effects.

In contrast with the "rapid dissociation hypothesis", the kinetic k_on, but not k_off, was positively correlated with the incidence of EPS [Fig. 3a, b, Spearman's rₛ ≥ 0.68, P < 0.05 and rₛ ≥ −0.13, P = 0.68, respectively]. On the other hand, prolactin increases were correlated with the kinetic k_off but not the k_on [see Fig. 3d, c, Spearman's rₛ ≥ −0.82, P < 0.05 and rₛ ≥ 0.12, P = 0.78, respectively]. An obvious outlier is the atypical APD aripiprazole, which displays an extremely slow k_off but displays very little propensity to cause prolactin release.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine Dreceptors [^116S3nTx]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

The novel TR-FRET kinetic assay described herein has significantly improved throughput relative to more traditional radioligand binding assays. This advancement has enabled us to accurately quantify, for the first time, the kinetic rate constants of a large number of unlabeled dopamine D2 antagonists under identical test conditions. This has allowed us to investigate the role of kinetics in the side effect liability of clinically used antipsychotic drugs (APDs) more effectively.

It has been widely assumed that association rates for APDs are diffusion-limited and therefore comparable, meaning that the dissociation rate determines their affinity. Our TR-FRET data, however, revealed a surprisingly wide range of both association and dissociation rates across the ligands studied, demonstrating the importance of directly measuring rate constants. For example, the suggestion that the high-affinity atypical APDs olanzapine and risperidone should have k_off values similar to haloperidol is not supported by our kinetic data.

We correlated our new kinetic binding data with clinical data that quantified the level of extrapyramidal side effects and hyperprolactinemia associated with a diverse group of clinical APDs. The clinical data were taken from a recent and relatively comprehensive multiple-treatment meta-analysis of antipsychotic drug efficacies and a summary of the primary literature on studies of drug-free patients. While meta-analytic methods assure the best control for the quality of the data across studies, it is important to note that because their focus was efficacy, extrapyramidal side effects were often not a well-controlled outcome.

### New generation antipsychotics versus low-potency conventional antipsychotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Z5PSn]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

The clearest advantage of new generation, atypical antipsychotics is a reduced risk of extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) compared with conventional compounds. These findings might have been biased by the use of the high-potency antipsychotic haloperidol as a comparator in most of the trials. We aimed to establish whether the new drugs induce fewer EPS than low-potency conventional antipsychotics.

- **Methods**: We conducted a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials in which new generation antipsychotics were compared with low-potency (equivalent or less potent than chlorpromazine) conventional drugs. We included studies that met quality criteria A or B in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook and assessed quality with the Jadad scale. The primary outcome of interest was the number of patients who had at least one EPS. We used risk differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as measures of effect size.

- **Findings**: We identified 31 studies with a total of 2320 participants. Of the new generation drugs, only clozapine was associated with significantly fewer EPS (RD = -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.04, p = 0.008) and higher efficacy than low-potency conventional drugs. The reduced frequency of EPS seen with olanzapine was of borderline significance (-0.15, -0.31 to -0.01, p = 0.07). Only one inconclusive trial of amisulpride, quetiapine, and risperidone was identified, and no investigations of ziprasidone and sertindole were conducted. However, some evidence indicates that zotepine and remoxipride do not lead to fewer EPS than low-potency antipsychotics. Studies used mean doses of less than 600 mg/day of chlorpromazine or its equivalent.

### Benztropine mesylate [^113DbPPL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Benztropine mesylate is indicated for use as an adjunct in the therapy of all forms of parkinsonism. It is also useful in the control of extrapyramidal disorders, excluding tardive dyskinesia (refer to precautions), induced by neuroleptic drugs such as phenothiazines.
