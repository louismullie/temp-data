## Question

Pseudomonas risk factors

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection across populations and syndromes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where Pseudomonas risk matters most. Then, I should verify the highest-credibility sources and extract universal risk factors. Next, I will examine population-specific risks for COPD, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, immunocompromised hosts, and critical illness. After that, I should review resistance-related risk factors and their implications for empiric therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized list and note limitations and stewardship implications, ensuring I anchor each point to appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where Pseudomonas risk is most consequential, because I need to ensure I'm not mixing syndromes. The key scenarios are community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia, bloodstream infection, cystic fibrosis and non-CF bronchiectasis, immunocompromised hosts including HIV, and device-associated infections such as urinary tract infection and endophthalmitis, with resistance patterns further stratifying empiric choices [^b411b928] [^ee997461] [^23906d74] [^56d143bc] [^b4ad4521] [^ee023a33] [^c58e509f] [^c16348cc].

> I will now examine universal risk factors that recur across high-credibility guidelines and meta-analyses, and I should double-check that I'm not overgeneralizing. Prior respiratory isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the strongest and most consistent predictor across CAP, HAP/VAP, and COPD cohorts, with odds ratios often exceeding 10 in COPD meta-analyses, which is why guidelines prioritize prior isolation when deciding on empiric coverage [^b411b928] [^af0a592e] [^a87a887e]. Recent hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic exposure within 90 days are repeatedly cited as major risks, and in HAP/VAP, prior intravenous antibiotics within 90 days is the most predictive factor for multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas, which directly informs the need for dual antipseudomonal therapy in high-risk patients [^ee997461] [^21244f70] [^ae596b86]. Structural lung disease, particularly bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis, confers markedly elevated risk and is a reason to use two antipseudomonal agents up front in suspected pneumonia, while COPD itself carries a more modest but significant risk signal in several studies [^b411b928] [^af0a592e] [^47f19868]. Immunocompromise, including neutropenia and advanced HIV, is a consistent theme across BSI and pneumonia literature, and severity markers such as septic shock or high APACHE II correlate with worse outcomes and justify aggressive empiric therapy when Pseudomonas is plausible [^23906d74] [^ee023a33] [^e6399eb4].

> Next, I should review COPD-specific risk factors with quantitative estimates, and I need to check heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses. Meta-analyses consistently identify prior Pseudomonas isolation as the dominant risk, with pooled odds ratios around 16, and bronchiectasis coexisting with COPD roughly quadruples risk, while higher BODE index, worse exercise capacity, and higher CAT scores also associate with Pseudomonas isolation, reflecting disease severity and symptom burden [^af0a592e] [^a87a887e] [^20105315]. Prior systemic steroid therapy, prior antibiotic exposure, and hospitalizations in the previous year further increase risk, and hypoproteinemia appears as an independent predictor, plausibly via impaired immunity and altered drug disposition, though I should note heterogeneity in some pooled estimates [^af0a592e] [^20105315] [^9479d0cd]. Hold on, I should verify the ICS signal; some meta-analyses do not find a significant association between inhaled corticosteroids and Pseudomonas isolation, suggesting controversy and the need to interpret ICS data cautiously in COPD [^e979d9f3].

> For cystic fibrosis, let me consider both acquisition and chronic infection, and I should confirm whether modifiable exposures matter. CFTR genotype with minimal residual function accelerates age at first Pseudomonas acquisition, and once acquired, chronic colonization is common and drives lung function decline; interestingly, large cohorts have not shown modifiable environmental exposures like hot tubs or daycare to meaningfully shift acquisition timing, though cross-inmission transmission remains a concern in some settings [^b4e46441] [^56d143bc] [^b3930740]. I should double-check the lung function trajectory data; annual FEV1 decline accelerates after initial acquisition and again after chronic colonization, reinforcing the clinical imperative for early detection and eradication strategies in CF [^56d143bc].

> In non-CF bronchiectasis, I need to ensure I distinguish colonization from infection and account for confounding by disease severity. Longer duration of bronchiectasis and proton pump inhibitor use independently associate with Pseudomonas colonization, and colonization itself predicts more extensive lung disease, frequent exacerbations, and hospitalization; mechanistically, impaired mucociliary clearance and damaged airways likely facilitate persistent Pseudomonas presence and biofilm formation [^b4ad4521] [^fc78b3f0] [^6583e317]. Wait, let me verify the directionality; while some factors may be consequences rather than causes, the consistency across studies and the prognostic weight of Pseudomonas in bronchiectasis severity indices support its clinical relevance for risk stratification and follow-up [^b4ad4521].

> For immunocompromised hosts, I should confirm HIV-specific risks and the role of hospital exposure. Advanced HIV with CD4 less than 50 cells per mm³, neutropenia, severe malnutrition, recent hospitalization, residence in healthcare facilities, and chronic hemodialysis elevate Pseudomonas risk, and prior hospitalization and certain prophylactic antibiotics increase infection rates in observational cohorts, whereas azithromycin use has been associated with lower risk, though causality is uncertain [^ee023a33] [^3c362060]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these associations inform pretest probability but should be integrated with local epidemiology and patient-specific factors when choosing empiric therapy [^b411b928].

> In critical illness and mechanical ventilation, I should review colonization dynamics and the threshold for dual coverage. Prior Pseudomonas colonization increases the odds of ventilator-associated pneumonia by roughly eightfold, and in ICUs with higher gram-negative resistance rates, guidelines recommend two antipseudomonal agents from different classes when risk factors for resistance are present or when local resistance exceeds about 10% for the agent under consideration, balancing the need for initial activity with stewardship goals [^9e70ac28] [^dbf8454d] [^e589bb5c]. I need to ensure I note that late-onset VAP and prolonged ventilation further increase Pseudomonas risk, and that obtaining cultures to enable de-escalation remains essential to avoid prolonged broad-spectrum exposure [^dbf8454d] [^356fc99a].

> Turning to resistance-related risk factors, I should confirm which exposures most robustly predict multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas. Prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, particularly carbapenems, broad-spectrum cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones, is the strongest predictor of MDR Pseudomonas in HAP/VAP, and prior carbapenem exposure within 30 days markedly increases the risk of carbapenem-resistant or extensively beta-lactam resistant strains in hospitalized patients [^ae596b86] [^b3230398]. But wait, what if the prior exposure was remote? The signal attenuates with time, yet even distant prior resistance history remains informative, and local antibiograms should refine empiric choices further [^b3230398] [^e589bb5c].

> For community-onset bloodstream infection, I should verify the dominant comorbidities and the mortality impact of inappropriate therapy. Solid tumors, hematologic malignancy, and neutropenia are common predispositions, and inappropriate empiric antibiotic selection associates with higher 30-day mortality, underscoring the need to integrate host factors and local epidemiology when blood cultures are pending [^23906d74]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude; pooled analyses suggest an approximately 1.8-fold increase in mortality with inappropriate empiric therapy, which is clinically meaningful in septic patients [^23906d74].

> I need to check device-related and special-site risks to avoid gaps. Indwelling venous catheters, immunosuppression, diabetes, and disseminated infection increase the risk of endogenous endophthalmitis, and Pseudomonas is among recognized pathogens in that setting, guiding the need for vitreous cultures and targeted therapy when suspected [^c16348cc]. In children, Pseudomonas UTIs cluster in those with urinary tract anomalies, vesicoureteral reflux, and recent antibiotic exposure, and in adults with urolithiasis, Pseudomonas is a notable pathogen in staghorn calculi, which should raise suspicion in the right clinical context [^c58e509f] [^fd4287d1].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized list, and I should confirm I'm aligning with guideline strength. Tier 1, highest-yield risks that should trigger empiric Pseudomonas coverage when locally validated or when two generic risks are present, include prior respiratory isolation of Pseudomonas, recent hospitalization or parenteral antibiotics within 90 days, structural lung disease such as bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis, and immunocompromise including neutropenia or advanced HIV, with septic shock or high severity further lowering the threshold for dual coverage [^b411b928] [^ee997461] [^ee023a33]. Tier 2, supportive risks that increase suspicion, include severe COPD with high BODE or frequent exacerbations, prior Pseudomonas colonization at non-respiratory sites in burns or other high-risk populations, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and prior fluoroquinolone or carbapenem exposure when considering MDR risk, while remembering that COPD alone carries a modest signal and should be interpreted in aggregate with other factors [^af0a592e] [^64b2e95e] [^ae596b86] [^47f19868]. I should double-check that guidelines still advise obtaining cultures to enable timely de-escalation, which they do, and that no validated scoring system reliably replaces clinician judgment in CAP [^b411b928] [^356fc99a].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and stewardship trade-offs. Many risk estimates come from observational studies with heterogeneity, and the absence of a validated prediction score means clinicians must integrate local epidemiology, patient-specific risks, and severity to avoid both undertreatment and overuse of broad-spectrum agents. Local validation of risk factors and resistance patterns can reduce unnecessary extended-spectrum therapy while maintaining coverage for those truly at risk, which is a central principle in contemporary CAP and HAP/VAP guidance [^b411b928] [^415dba05] [^e589bb5c].

Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection risk is highest in **immunocompromised patients** [^205b2a7a], those with **structural lung disease** (bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, severe COPD) [^af0a592e] [^b4ad4521], and those exposed to healthcare settings with invasive devices or recent broad-spectrum antibiotics [^ae596b86] [^21244f70]. Additional risks include **mechanical ventilation** [^9e70ac28], **burns** [^64b2e95e], **indwelling catheters** [^c16348cc], and **prolonged hospitalization** [^21244f70]. Prior colonization or infection with P. aeruginosa [^a87a887e], neutropenia [^23906d74], diabetes, and chronic kidney disease further increase susceptibility [^notfound]. Environmental exposure to contaminated water or surfaces [^602a9af1] and prior antibiotic use — especially fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, or piperacillin-tazobactam [^ae596b86] — also raise risk [^b3230398]. Recognizing these factors enables early detection, targeted empiric therapy, and infection control to improve outcomes [^b411b928].

---

## Host-related risk factors

### Immunocompromised states

- **Neutropenia**: Strongly associated with invasive P. aeruginosa infections, including bacteremia and pneumonia [^23906d74] [^205b2a7a].
- **HIV/AIDS**: Advanced HIV (CD4 < 50 cells/mm³) [^ee023a33] and prolonged immunosuppression increase risk [^3c362060].
- **Malignancy**: Hematologic malignancies and solid tumors elevate risk, particularly with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia [^23906d74] [^ba036184].

---

### Chronic and structural lung diseases

- **Bronchiectasis**: Chronic airway damage and impaired mucociliary clearance promote colonization and infection [^b4ad4521] [^fc78b3f0].
- **Cystic fibrosis**: Lifelong risk due to abnormal mucus and impaired host defenses; early acquisition is common [^56d143bc] [^b3930740].
- **Severe COPD**: Frequent exacerbations, corticosteroid use, and repeated antibiotics increase risk [^af0a592e] [^68039395].

---

### Comorbidities and physiological factors

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Impaired immunity and vascular disease increase susceptibility [^bd4ff05b].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Associated with higher infection risk, including urinary tract infections [^notfound].
- **Malnutrition**: Weakens host defenses and correlates with worse outcomes [^ee023a33].

---

## Healthcare-related risk factors

### Hospitalization and intensive care

- **Prolonged hospitalization**: Longer stays increase exposure and colonization risk [^21244f70] [^7a38f558].
- **ICU admission**: Mechanical ventilation, invasive devices, and broad-spectrum antibiotics elevate risk [^9e70ac28] [^21244f70].
- **Mechanical ventilation**: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a major risk, especially with prolonged ventilation [^9e70ac28] [^941d8b1b].

---

### Invasive devices and procedures

- **Indwelling catheters**: Urinary and central venous catheters facilitate biofilm formation and infection [^c16348cc] [^36bc9fbd].
- **Surgical procedures**: Postoperative infections, including endophthalmitis, are linked to environmental contamination and device use [^e2f0b9bd] [^c16348cc].
- **Burn wounds**: Loss of skin barrier and environmental exposure increase risk [^64b2e95e] [^6a5f792a].

---

### Antibiotic exposure

Recent **broad-spectrum antibiotics** — especially fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and piperacillin-tazobactam — promote colonization and resistance [^ae596b86] [^b3230398]. A history of **multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa** colonization or infection strongly predicts future MDR infections [^b3230398].

---

## Environmental risk factors

Environmental exposure to **contaminated water** (e.g. hot tubs, pools, medical equipment) can cause community-acquired infections [^60f2a62c] [^602a9af1]. Contaminated surfaces and medical equipment in healthcare settings also contribute to transmission [^602a9af1].

---

## Population-specific risk factors

| **Population** | **Specific risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Cystic fibrosis patients | - CFTR mutations <br/> - Early colonization <br/> - Chronic infection [^56d143bc] [^b3930740] |
| Burn patients | - Large burn surface area <br/> - Prolonged hospitalization <br/> - Invasive procedures [^64b2e95e] [^6a5f792a] |
| ICU patients | - Mechanical ventilation <br/> - Indwelling devices <br/> - Broad-spectrum antibiotics [^9e70ac28] [^21244f70] |
| HIV patients | - Advanced immunosuppression <br/> - Hospitalization <br/> - Corticosteroid use [^ee023a33] [^3c362060] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Recognizing these risk factors guides **empiric therapy** — using antipseudomonal agents in high-risk patients [^b411b928] [^ee997461] — and supports **infection control** through hand hygiene, device care, and antimicrobial stewardship [^602a9af1] [^a83b0d6f]. Early identification and targeted therapy improve outcomes and reduce mortality [^e6399eb4] [^23906d74].

---

Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection risk is multifactorial, with the highest risk in **immunocompromised patients**, those with **structural lung disease**, and those exposed to healthcare settings with invasive devices or recent broad-spectrum antibiotics. Environmental exposure and prior colonization further increase susceptibility. Recognizing these risks enables timely diagnosis, appropriate empiric therapy, and infection control to improve outcomes.

### Pseudomonas acquisition in young patients with cystic fibrosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^195ebf16]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the pathophysiology of, risk factors for, and outcomes of early Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection in CF; to review the results of trials of early intervention and to describe treatment options for early Pa infection.

Recent Findings

Chronic lower airway Pa infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality among CF patients. However, first acquisition of Pa does not appear to cause an immediate and rapid decline in lung function. Early Pa isolates are generally non-mucoid, antibiotic-sensitive, and present at low density, suggesting a possible "window of opportunity" for early intervention.

Summary

Anti-pseudomonal therapy for early infection results in transient Pa eradication, but re-infection with Pa appears inevitable despite early aggressive treatment. There are no controlled trials demonstrating clinical benefit in young children. There is a critical need for further investigation of the clinical outcomes associated with early intervention, the long-term safety profile, and the optimal drug regimen.

### Host and pathogen biomarkers for severe Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections [^b98c0833]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is among the leading causes of severe nosocomial infections, particularly affecting critically ill and immunocompromised patients. Here we review the current knowledge on the factors underlying the outcome of P. aeruginosa nosocomial infections, including aspects related to the pathogen, the host, and treatment. Intestinal colonization and previous use of antibiotics are key risk factors for P. aeruginosa infections, whereas underlying disease, source of infection, and severity of acute presentation are key host factors modulating outcome; delayed adequate antimicrobial therapy is also independently associated with increased mortality. Among pathogen-related factors influencing the outcome of P. aeruginosa infections, antibiotic resistance, and particularly multidrug-resistant profiles, is certainly of paramount relevance, given its obvious effect on the chances of appropriate empirical therapy. However, the direct impact of antibiotic resistance in the severity and outcomes of P. aeruginosa infections is not yet well established. The interplay between antibiotic resistance, virulence, and the concerning international high-risk clones (such as ST111, ST175, and ST235) still needs to be further analyzed. On the other hand, differential presence or expression of virulence factors has been shown to significantly impact disease severity and mortality. The likely more deeply studied P. aeruginosa virulence determinant is the type III secretion system (T3SS); the production of T3SS cytotoxins, and particularly ExoU, has been well established to determine a worse outcome both in respiratory and bloodstream infections. Other relevant pathogen-related biomarkers of severe infections include the involvement of specific clones or O-antigen serotypes, the presence of certain horizontally acquired genomic islands, or the expression of other virulence traits, such as the elastase. Finally, recent data suggest that host genetic factors may also modulate the severity of P. aeruginosa infections.

### Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0f1db49b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by an injury in airway along with the impairment of respiratory function. Not only does COPD elevate the likelihood of future exacerbations, but it is also linked to the emergence of respiratory conditions like pneumonia and lung cancer, in addition to non-respiratory ailments. Bacterial infections are widely acknowledged as major contributors to morbidity, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), which was recognized as one of the common bacterial pathogens.

Research has indicated that PA, noted for its ability to easily colonize and exhibit drug resistance, can be identified in approximately 4–20% of individuals experiencing AECOPD. The presence of PA has been shown to complicate antibiotic treatment and is linked to worse clinical outcomes. Findings have suggested that infection with PA correlates to a heightened risk of readmission at 30 days post-discharge and hospitalization at two years. A study revealed that patients with PA detected in their sputum faced an adjusted risk of mortality that was three times higher compared to those without PA. Furthermore, a meta-analysis indicated that the overall mortality rate rises by 95% in patients with isolated strains of PA. Additionally, another investigation demonstrated that AECOPD patients suffering from multi-resistant PA infections had an increased risk of death, suggesting that the isolation of PA serves as an independent risk predictor for negative clinical outcomes.

The guidelines of the European Respiratory Society provide some recommendations for suspecting a PA isolation in certain patients and several studies have investigated the risk factors for PA isolation in patients with COPD, however the results were inconsistent. Our study aimed to gather findings from existing literature and assess the cumulative risk of factors associated with PA isolation in individuals diagnosed with COPD.

### Hospital-acquired pneumonia: risk factors, microbiology, and treatment [^985d6c1d]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumonia complicates hospitalization in 0.5 to 2.0% of patients and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) include mechanical ventilation for > 48 h, residence in an ICU, duration of ICU or hospital stay, severity of underlying illness, and presence of comorbidities. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter are the most common causes of HAP. Nearly half of HAP cases are polymicrobial. In patients receiving mechanical ventilation, P aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria assume increasing importance. Optimal therapy for HAP should take into account severity of illness, demographics, specific pathogens involved, and risk factors for antimicrobial resistance. When P aeruginosa is implicated, monotherapy, even with broad-spectrum antibiotics, is associated with rapid evolution of resistance and a high rate of clinical failures. For pseudomonal HAP, we advise combination therapy with an antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone (eg, ciprofloxacin).

### Infection control knowledge, beliefs and behaviours amongst cystic fibrosis patients with epidemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^344af8c3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Risk factors for ePA are poorly understood. One of the major limitations is lack of historical context to determine when infections have occurred as most ePA related studies are prospective and of short duration. As we were previously able to establish infections occur generally prior to adulthood we sought to determine what behaviours and exposures associated with ePA infection. Few studies have been conducted on patient beliefs and behaviours with respect to infection control. To date no published works have sought to determine if patients with transmissible pathogens in CF have different behaviours and beliefs that may explain their infection status and contribute to risk for spread. Accordingly we sought to prospectively assess attitudes, behaviours and beliefs amongst our clinic cohort regarding infection control to identify potential factors that may lead to lapses in infection control.

### Rates, predictors and mortality of community-onset bloodstream infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa: systematic review and meta-analysis [^23906d74]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is mostly a nosocomial pathogen affecting predisposed patients. However, community-onset bloodstream infections (CO-BSI) caused by this organism are not exceptional.

Objectives

To assess the predisposing factors for CO-BSI due to P. aeruginosa (CO-BSI-PA) and the impact in mortality of inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy.

Data Source

A systematic literature search was performed in the Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Study eligibility criteria and participants: Articles published between 1 January 2002 and 31 January 2018 reporting at least of 20 adult patients with CO-BSI due to P. aeruginosa were considered.

Intervention

Empiric antimicrobial therapy for CO-BSI-PA.

Methods

A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted for risk factors and to evaluate if inappropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy increased mortality in CO-BSI-PA using a Mantel-Haenszel effects model.

Results

Twelve studies assessing data of 1120 patients were included in the systematic review. Solid tumour (33.1%), haematologic malignancy (26.4%), neutropenia (31.7%) and previous antibiotic use (44.8%) were the most prevalent predisposing factors. Septic shock was present in 42.3% of cases, and 30-day crude mortality was 33.8%. Mortality in meta-analysis (four studies) was associated with septic shock at presentation (odds ratio, 22.31; 95% confidence interval, 3.52–141.35; p 0.001) and with inappropriate empiric antibiotic therapy (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.12–2.98l p 0.02).

Conclusions

CO-BSI-PA mostly occurred in patients with predisposing factors and had a 30-day mortality comparable to hospital-acquired cases. Inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was associated with increased mortality. Appropriate identification of patients at risk for CO-BSI-PA is needed for empirical treatment decisions.

### Predictors of multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa involvement in bloodstream infections [^36bc9fbd]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the last decades, there has been a worldwide worrisome spread of multidrug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment of these infections is challenging, in part due to the lack of therapeutic options, and the importance of prescribing an adequate empirical treatment. Bacteraemia is one of the most severe infections, with mortality rates ranging between 20 and 40%.

Recent Findings

It is key to understand which patients are at a higher risk of MDR P. aeruginosa bloodstream infection (BSI) to better direct empirical therapies and improve overall survival. Immunocompromised patients are among the most vulnerable for the worst outcomes. Environmental exposure, integrity of the microbiota, and host immunity are the key determinants for the initial colonization and expansion on mucosal surfaces and potential invasion afterwards by MDR P. aeruginosa.

Summary

Available data suggest that high colonization pressure (settings with high prevalence like intensive care units), disruption of healthy microbiota (prior use of antibiotics, in particular fluoroquinolones), immunosuppression (neutropenia) and breaking natural barriers (venous or urine catheters), are the main risk factors for MDR P. aeruginosa BSI.

### Community-acquired pneumonia due to Gram-Negative bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa… [^231827d9]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Incidence of causative gram-negative bacteria in community-acquired pneumonia according to the number of risk factors present. Independent risk factors identified in multivariate analyses were added as 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more. We used χ2 analysis for linear trends to assess differences relative to baseline. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are described in the "Results" section. To identify factors associated with the presence of CAP due to GNB, we used a logistic regression model with categorized variables. Variables were included in the multivariate model when univariate comparisons yielded a level of significance of P <.
10.

The following variables were tested: age, residence in a nursing home, comorbid illnesses, pulmonary comorbid illness, alcohol abuse, smoking, aspiration to the lower airways, previous hospital admission, previous antimicrobial treatment, oral corticosteroid medication, and medication with H2 blockers. Frequencies increased with increasing numbers of risk factors and reached 50% in patients with at least 3 risk factors. The ORs compared with the baseline value were 4. 2 for 1,
9. 1 for 2, and 39. 3 for 3 or more risk factors present on admission.

The main findings are that the incidence of these etiologic pathogens was 11%; independent risk factors included the presence of a pulmonary comorbidity, previous antimicrobial treatment, previous hospitalization, and probable aspiration to the lower airways; risk factors identified in multivariate analysis were additive and. the risk for gram-negative etiology increased with the increasing numbers of risk factors on admission; the associated mortality was 32% and significantly higher compared with that for other causes of CAP, and CAP due to GNB represented an independent risk factor for death; and the incidence of CAP due to P aeruginosa was 7% and the associated mortality was 28%. Independent predictors were pulmonary comorbidity and previous hospital admission.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^ee997461]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — empiric gram-negative coverage and number of anti-Pseudomonas agents: The evidence indicated that approximately 35% of HAP cases are caused by gram-negative bacilli, and the panel agreed this dictates that all empiric regimens target P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli; the recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence. Regarding whether to use one or 2 antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa, the panel concluded that HAP patients with factors increasing the likelihood of gram-negative infection, including Pseudomonas, or increased risk for mortality should receive antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa, whereas patients without these factors should receive only one such antibiotic. A high risk for mortality was defined as requiring ventilatory support due to pneumonia and having septic shock.

### Multidrug-resistant pathogens in patients with pneumonia coming from the community [^065ceb62]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Identification of patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens at initial diagnosis is essential for the appropriate selection of empiric treatment of patients with pneumonia coming from the community. The term Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia (HCAP) is controversial for this purpose. Our goal is to summarize and interpret the data addressing the association of MDR pathogens and community-onset pneumonia.

Recent Findings

Most recent clinical studies conclude that HCAP risk factor does not accurately identify resistant pathogens. Several risk factors related to MDR pathogens, including new ones that were not included in the original HCAP definition, have been described and different risk scores have been proposed. The present review focuses on the most recent literature assessing the importance of different risk factors for MDR pathogens in patients with pneumonia coming from the community. These included generally MDR risk factors, specific risk factors related to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and clinical scoring systems develop to assess the MDR risk factors and its application in clinical practice.

Summary

Different MDR risk factors and prediction scores have been recently developed. However, further research is needed in order to help clinicians in distinguishing between different MDR pathogens causing pneumonia.

### Risk factors for postoperative endophthalmitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa: possible role of environment [^e2f0b9bd]. American Journal of Infection Control (2013). Low credibility.

This article describes an investigation to identify risk factors for postoperative endophthalmitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A retrospective case-control study, including 8 cases and 24 controls operated from 2005 to 2009, was undertaken. The risk factors associated with P aeruginosa infection were a particular operating room (P = 0.003) and longer phacoemulsification duration (P = 0.001), suggesting that infection was not associated with patient characteristics but rather with the surgical environment and phacoemulsification duration.

### Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b0f87c03]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study identified nine risk factors associated with an increased risk of AP isolation in patients with COPD. These findings are significant for the early identification and better management of COPD patients at risk for PA isolation, which may help reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes.

### Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e979d9f3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

However, the evidence for an association between ICS and PA isolation is still controversial. ICS use was related with increased bacterial load in the airway and the long-term treatment of COPD patients with ICS might have blunted the normal response that is orchestrated by alveolar macrophages after PA infection. Most studies indicated that ICS use was related with a significant and dose-related of PA isolation in COPD, while some studies suggested that ICS dose, rather than its use, was associated with PA isolation among patients with COPD. Our study did not find an association between ICS therapy and PA isolation in patients with COPD, and the relationships need further investigation.

The limitations of our study are as follows: Heterogeneity was higher in our study due to different baseline populations, methodologies, and sample sizes. PA colonization and infection in the lower airways cannot be distinguished in included studies. The studies included in our analysis were published only in English or Chinese, potentially omitting relevant publications reporting PA isolation in COPD patients in other languages. Some risk factors cannot be analyzed for the limited number of included studies, and further studies are still essential to explore the risk factors for PA isolation.

### Global prospective epidemiologic and surveillance study of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^9e70ac28]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia and to describe risk factors for P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Design

Prospective, observational study.

Setting

ICUs at 56 sites in 11 countries across four regions: the United States (n = 502 patients), Europe (n = 495), Latin America (n = 500), and Asia Pacific (n = 376).

Patients

Adults intubated and mechanically ventilated for 48 hours to 7 days, inclusive.

Interventions

None (local standard of care).

Measurements and Main Results

Ventilator-associated pneumonia prevalence as defined by local investigators were 15.6% (293/1,873) globally, 13.5% in the United States, 19.4% in Europe, 13.8% in Latin America, and 16.0% in Asia Pacific (p = 0.04). Corresponding P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia prevalences were 4.1%, 3.4%, 4.8%, 4.6%, and 3.2% (p = 0.49). Of 50 patients with P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia who underwent surveillance testing, 19 (38%) had prior P. aeruginosa colonization and 31 (62%) did not (odds ratio, 7.99; 95% CI, 4.31–14.71). Of predefined risk factors for multidrug resistance (hereafter, risk factors), the most frequent in all patients were antimicrobial therapy within 90 days (51.9% of enrolled patients) and current hospitalization of more than or equal to 5 days (45.3%). None of these risk factors were significantly associated with P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia by multivariate logistic regression. Risk factors associated with prior P. aeruginosa colonization were antimicrobial therapy within 90 days (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29–0.73) and high proportion of antibiotic resistance in the community or hospital unit (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.14–2.82).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that ventilator-associated pneumonia remains a common ICU infection and that P. aeruginosa is one of the most common causative pathogens. The odds of developing P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia were eight times higher in patients with prior P. aeruginosa colonization than in uncolonized patients, which in turn was associated with local resistance.

### Risk factors for age at initial Pseudomonas acquisition in the cystic fibrosis epic observational cohort [^b4e46441]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Risk factors for initial Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) acquisition, particularly environmental exposures, are poorly understood. We aimed to identify such risk factors in order to inform prevention strategies and identify high-risk populations.

Methods

The study cohort included all participants in the U.S. EPIC Observational Study who had no prior Pa-positive respiratory cultures (N = 889). Cox proportional hazard models were used to test the effects of factors on age at first Pa-positive respiratory culture.

Results

Cystic fibrosis (CF) genotype functional class had an important effect on age at initial Pa acquisition (hazard ratio (HR) comparing minimal to residual CFTR function 2.87 (95% CI 1.88, 4.39)). None of the modifiable risk factors evaluated, including cigarette smoke, hot tub use, breastfeeding, or daycare, was associated with age at Pa acquisition. Similarly, newborn screening was not associated with age at Pa acquisition (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66, 1.09). Key associations were validated in a CF Foundation National Patient Registry replication cohort.

Conclusions

Given the ubiquitous presence of Pa in the environment, it may be that many imposed lifestyle changes will have less impact on age at initial Pa acquisition than genetic determinants.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management [^30247ffd]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of death. Risk factors include older age and medical comorbidities. Diagnosis is suggested by a history of cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, or acute functional or cognitive decline, with abnormal vital signs (e.g., fever, tachycardia) and lung examination findings. Diagnosis should be confirmed by chest radiography or ultrasonography. Validated prediction scores for pneumonia severity can guide the decision between outpatient and inpatient therapy. Using procalcitonin as a biomarker for severe infection may further assist with risk stratification. Most outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia do not require microbiologic testing of sputum or blood and can be treated empirically with a macrolide, doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Patients requiring hospitalization should be treated with a fluoroquinolone or a combination of beta-lactam plus macrolide antibiotics. Patients with severe infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit require dual antibiotic therapy including a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide alone or in combination with a fluoroquinolone. Treatment options for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas species include administration of an antipseudomonal antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, plus azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. Patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid, or ceftaroline in resistant cases. Administration of corticosteroids within 36 hours of hospital admission for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia decreases the risk of adult respiratory distress syndrome and length of treatment. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations are both recommended for adults 65 years and older to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia.

### Pathogen-host interactions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia [^205b2a7a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important pathogen causing a wide range of acute and chronic infections. P. aeruginosa rarely causes infection in the normal host, but is an efficient opportunistic pathogen causing serious infections in patients who are mechanically ventilated, individuals who are immunocompromised, and patients with malignancies or HIV infection. Among these risk groups, the most vulnerable hosts are neutropenic and patients who are mechanically ventilated. In addition, P. aeruginosa is the most prevalent chronic infection contributing to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. Because of the ubiquitous nature of P. aeruginosa and its ability to develop resistance to antibiotics, it continues to be problematic from a treatment perspective. The pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa is largely caused by multiple bacterial virulence factors and genetic flexibility enabling it to survive in varied environments. Lung injury associated with P. aeruginosa infection results from both the direct destructive effects of the organism on the lung parenchyma and exuberant host immune responses. This article focuses on the major bacterial virulence factors and important aspects of the host immunity that are involved in the pathogenesis of serious P. aeruginosa infection. In addition to antibiotic therapy, strategies directed toward enhancing host defense and/or limiting excessive inflammation could be important to improve outcome in P. aeruginosa lung infections.

### Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^af0a592e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) isolation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been associated with a poor prognosis. This meta-analysis aimed to determine significant risk factors for PA isolation among patients with COPD.

Methods

A systematic literature retrieval from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was conducted, including studies from January 2003 to September 2024. Case-control and cohort studies exploring the risk factors for PA isolation in patients with COPD were included in this analysis. A random-effects model was applied to estimate the pooled adjusted odds ratio (paOR) or hazard ratio (paHR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

Thirteen eligible studies with a total of 25,802 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Prior systemic steroid therapy (paOR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.29–5.53; P = 0.008), previous antibiotic treatment (paOR: 2.83; 95% CI: 1.14–6.97; P = 0.02), high "Body mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, Exercise capacity" (BODE) index (paOR: 4.13; 95% CI: 1.67–10.23; P = 0.002), 6-min walking distance (6MWD) < 250 m (paOR: 4.27; 95% CI: 2.59–7.01; P < 0.001), COPD assessment test (CAT) score > 20 points (paOR: 2.49; 95% CI: 1.46–4.23; P = 0.001), hypoproteinemia (paOR: 2.62; 95%CI: 1.32–5.19; P = 0.006), hospitalizations in the previous year (paOR: 3.74; 95%CI: 1.22–11.49; P = 0.021), Bronchiectasis (paOR = 4.81; 95% CI: 3.66–6.33; P < 0.001) and prior PA isolation (paOR: 16.39; 95% CI: 7.65–35.10; P < 0.001) were associated with PA isolation in patients with COPD.

Conclusions

Our study identified nine risk factors associated with an increased risk of PA isolation in COPD patients. These findings are significant for the early identification of patients at risk for PA isolation, which might contribute to reducing mortality and improving clinical outcomes.

### Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a1df6f1f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The studies were considered eligible when they met the following criteria: (1) case-control or cohort study design; (2) patients with confirmed COPD diagnosis in a stable state or with acute exacerbations; (3) PA isolation was defined as PA presence in sputum samples; and (4) exposure to factors examined in at least two studies. We excluded conference abstracts, case reports, animal studies, and republished researches.

Data extraction and literature quality evaluation

Two independent reviewers examined the titles and abstracts of all the studies retrieved, determined the eligible ones based on the criteria listed above, and extracted the basic information from selected studies, including the first author, country, study design, COPD diagnosis, study population and outcome definition. The adjusted estimated effects expressed as odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratios (HR), and the original data were both extracted for a more comprehensive evaluation of the relevant risk factors. The study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), comprising eight items from three different aspects (selection, comparability, and exposure/outcome). The study quality was judged as high (scores of 7–9), medium (4–6), or low (1–3). Any discrepancy in judgement was resolved by discussion.

Statistical analysis

Stata17.0 (Stata Corp LLC, College Station, TX, USA) was used to perform the statistical analysis. The studies were divided into groups based on the type of risk factors. Estimates that used the same effect measures (OR or HR) from at least two studies were included in the analysis. If the adjusted estimated effect was unavailable, the original data were used to calculate a crude estimated effect. We focused on the adjusted outcomes, and the crude outcomes were included as a sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 test: a high heterogeneity was expected, thus no threshold was formulated for the I 2 test, and we utilized a random-effects model to estimate the pooled effects. The data are presented graphically using forest plots. Publication bias was not assessed due to the limited number of eligible studies.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a rare cause of early-onset sepsis in neonates, even among infants with identifiable risk factors. Herein we describe the first case, to our knowledge, of P. aeruginosa early-onset sepsis in a term infant with no identifiable risk factor and propose that maternal healthcare occupation could predispose to gastrointestinal/genital colonization with this potential pathogen.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^ee023a33]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus — community-acquired pneumonia in people with HIV: The frequency of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and S. aureus as community-acquired pathogens is higher in individuals with HIV than in those without HIV based on studies in the early combination ART era. Patients with advanced HIV disease (CD4 count < 50 cells/mm3) or underlying neutropenia, as well as pre-existing lung disease such as bronchiectasis or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased risk of infection with P. aeruginosa, and other risk factors include the use of corticosteroids, severe malnutrition, hospitalization within the past 90 days, residence in a health care facility or nursing home, and chronic hemodialysis. S. aureus should be considered in patients with recent viral infection (particularly influenza), a history of injection drug use, or severe, bilateral, necrotizing pneumonia, and additional risk factors for S. aureus pneumonia in patients with HIV include receipt of antibiotics prior to hospital admission, comorbid illnesses, and recent healthcare contact. Community outbreaks of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection have also been seen among men who have sex with men.

### Infectious pulmonary diseases [^0f481abf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection caused by the inability to clear pathogens from the lower airway and alveoli. Cytokines and local inflammatory markers are released, causing further damage to the lungs through the accumulation of white blood cells and fluid congestion, leading to pus in the parenchyma. The Infectious Diseases Society of America defines pneumonia as the presence of new lung infiltrate with other clinical evidence supporting infection, including new fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and decline in oxygenation. Importantly, lower respiratory infections remain the most deadly communicable disease. Pneumonia is subdivided into three categories: (1) community acquired, (2) hospital acquired, and (3) ventilator associated. Therapy for each differs based on the severity of the disease and the presence of risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in presence of recent antibiotic exposure [^49035e00]. Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

To facilitate the decision-making process for therapy and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in patients undergoing recent antibiotic exposure, this study investigated whether the development of VAP episodes caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other pathogens are related to different risk factors, thereby distinguishing two risk population for this serious complication.

Methods

A 5-year retrospective case-control observational study was conducted. Cases of VAP caused by P. aeruginosa were compared with those caused by other pathogens. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed using SPSS 11.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

Results

Two groups were identified: P. aeruginosa (group P) was isolated in 58 (63.7%) episodes, and 33 episodes served as controls (group C), after a median of 12 days (interquartile range, 4–28 days) and 9 days (interquartile range, 3–12.5 days) of mechanical ventilation, respectively. P. aeruginosa was identified in 34.7% of episodes with early-onset pneumonia and in 73.5% with late-onset pneumonia. In a logistic regression analysis, P. aeruginosa was independently associated with duration of stay of 5 days or longer (relative risk = 3.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–12.35) and absence of coma (relative risk = 8.36; 95% confidence interval, 2.68–26.09). Risk for pathogens different from P. aeruginosa (group C) in early-onset pneumonia associated with coma was estimated to be 87.5%.

Conclusions

Risk factors in episodes under recent antibiotic treatment caused by P. aeruginosa or other microorganism are not the same, a fact that could have implications for preventive and therapeutic approaches for this infection.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^b411b928]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — risk assessment for MRSA and P. aeruginosa and local validation — The most consistently strong individual risk factors for respiratory infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these organisms, especially from the respiratory tract, and/or recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics; unfortunately, no validated scoring systems exist to identify patients with sufficiently high positive predictive value, and no scoring system has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We propose that clinicians need to obtain local data on whether MRSA or P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with CAP and what the risk factors for infection are at a local level and we recommend analyzing the frequency of MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen relative to the number of all cases of CAP; we refer to this process as "local validation". Finally, routine cultures in patients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is clinically improving at 48 hours, and deescalation of antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord with microbiological results that do not yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is described as safe and reduces duration of antibiotic treatment, length of hospitalization, and complications of broad-spectrum therapy. Our recommendation against using the former category of HCAP as a basis for selecting extended-spectrum therapy is based on high-quality studies of patient outcomes.

### Potential implications of using locally validated risk factors for drug-resistant pathogens in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in US hospitals: a cross-sectional study [^415dba05]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines recommend that clinicians prescribe empiric antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa only if locally validated risk factors (or 2 generic risk factors if local validation is not feasible) are present.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study that included adults hospitalized for CAP across 50 hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database from 2010 to 2015, we sought to describe how the use of extended-spectrum antibiotics (ESAs) and the coverage for patients with CAP due to restraint organisms would change under the 2 approaches described in the 2019 ATS/IDSA guidelines. The proportion of ESA use in patients with CAP and the proportion of ESA coverage among patients with infections resistant to recommended CAP therapy were measured.

Results

In the 50 hospitals, 19%-75% of patients received ESAs, and 42%-100% of patients with resistant organisms received ESAs. The median number of risk factors identified per hospital was 9 (interquartile range, 6–12). Overall, treatment according to local risk factors reduced the number of patients receiving ESAs by 38.8 percentage points and by 47.5 percentage points when using generic risk factors. However, the effect varied by hospital. The use of generic risk factors always resulted in less ESA use and less coverage for resistant organisms. Using locally validated risk factors resulted in a similar outcome in all but 1 hospital.

Conclusions

Future guidelines should explicitly define the optimal trade-off between adequate coverage for resistant organisms and ESA use.

### Risk factors for and impact of infection or colonization with aztreonam-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^e85e7ceb]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify risk factors for infection or colonization with aztreonam-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and examine the impact of this organism on mortality.

Design

A case-control study was performed to identify risk factors for infection or colonization with aztreonam-resistant P. aeruginosa. A cohort study was subsequently performed to examine the impact of aztreonam resistance on outcomes.

Setting

A tertiary referral center in southeastern Pennsylvania. Participants. Inpatients with a clinical culture positive for P. aeruginosa between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2000.

Results

Of 720 P. aeruginosa. isolates, 183 (25.4%) were aztreonam-resistant and 537 (74.6%) were aztreonam susceptible. In a multivariable model, prior fluoroquinolone use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.81 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.17–2.80]), prior use of an antianaerobic agent (aOR, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.06–2.29]), and renal insufficiency (aOR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.10–2.29]) were associated with infection or colonization with aztreonam-resistant P. aeruginosa, while older age (aOR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.97–0.99] per year of age) was negatively associated with infection or colonization with this organism. In-hospital mortality was higher among subjects infected or colonized with aztreonam-resistant P. aeruginosa, compared with those who were infected or colonized with aztreonam-susceptible P. aeruginosa (25.7% vs 16.8%; P = 0.009), but in multivariable analysis, no significant association was found between infection or colonization with aztreonam-resistant P. aeruginosa and mortality.

Conclusions

Curbing the use of fluoroquinolones and antimicrobials with antianaerobic activity may be an effective strategy to limit the emergence of aztreonam-resistant P. aeruginosa.

Risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens in VAP/HAP — Listed risk factors for MDR VAP are prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 d, septic shock at time of VAP, ARDS preceding VAP, five or more days of hospitalization prior to the occurrence of VAP, and acute renal replacement therapy prior to VAP onset. For MDR HAP, MRSA VAP/HAP, and MDR Pseudomonas VAP/HAP, the listed risk factor is prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 d.

### The categorization of prior antibiotic use: impact on the identification of risk factors for drug resistance in case control studies [^5e51068f]. American Journal of Infection Control (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Analytic approaches to the identification of risk factors for the development of drug resistance vary and may affect study results. Using fluroquinolone-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (FQRPA) and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa as models (IRPA), we aimed to examine the effect of different approaches to classification of prior antibiotic use (i.e., class versus spectrum) on the identification of risk factors for antibiotic resistance.

Methods

Case-control studies to identify risk factors for FQRPA and IRPA were performed. In each, two analytic models were utilized. In the first, prior antibiotic use was classified by class, and in the other, prior antibiotic use was classified by spectrum of activity. Risk factors identified by the two models were compared qualitatively for each resistant organism.

Results

879 isolates of P. aeruginosa were included in the case-control studies. Risk factors for FQRPA and IRPA identified in multivariable analyses differed based on which method of classification of prior antibiotic use was utilized.

Conclusions

The identification risk factors for the development of drug-resistant organisms could depend on the method of classification of prior antibiotic use. In studies of risk factors for resistant infections, the approach to classification of prior antibiotic use should be clearly stated and justified.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^81ce08b9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric antipseudomonal therapy — For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend prescribing antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For those with factors increasing the likelihood for Pseudomonas or other gram-negative infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days) or a high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), noting that risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. All other patients with HAP who are being treated empirically may be prescribed a single antibiotic with activity against P. aeruginosa, and we recommend not using an aminoglycoside as the sole antipseudomonal agent (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks add that if a patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended, and that the 20% threshold for deciding whether or not to target MRSA or MSSA may be modified by individual units.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^e589bb5c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric antibiotic coverage — scope and thresholds: When local resistance resembles surveillance benchmarks, "empiric coverage should include an agent active against MRSA and at least 2 agents active against gram-negative organisms, including P. aeruginosa", whereas if local data indicate "a low prevalence of MRSA and low antibiotic resistance rates among gram-negatives", "a single agent active against MSSA combined with one agent active against Pseudomonas and other gram-negatives is likely adequate". Empiric choices "should be informed by patient-specific risk factors" and "Not all patients require maximal empiric coverage", and "Narrower-spectrum coverage may be appropriate" when risk factors and local prevalence are low. For threshold guidance, "The panel suggests that ICU-level S. aureus methicillin resistance rates of > 10%–20% merit selecting a gram-positive agent active against MRSA, and that ICU-level gram-negative resistance rates of > 10% to an agent being considered for empiric gram-negative monotherapy merit using 2 gram-negative agents for empiric therapy of suspected VAP". If calculating local rates is difficult, "the resistance rate for Pseudomonas is a reasonable, albeit conservative, proxy because Pseudomonas is the most common gram-negative organism associated with VAP".

### Incidence and determinants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection among persons with HIV: association with hospital exposure [^3c362060]. American Journal of Infection Control (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Little information exists on risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in persons with HIV. We assessed the incidence and factors associated with P aeruginosa among persons with HIV enrolled in a large observational cohort study in Los Angeles.

Methods

Data were analyzed from 4825 persons aged ≥ 13 years with HIV infection enrolled from 4 outpatient facilities from 1990 to 1998. The association between P aeruginosa infection and demographic, risk behavior, and clinical factors was assessed.

Results

P aeruginosa was diagnosed in 72 (1.5%) patients representing a crude incidence rate of 0.74 per 100 person-years. The most frequent site of infection was pulmonary (47%). In multivariate analysis, prior hospitalization (adjusted rate ratio = 7.9, 95% CI, 3.8–16.2), and both dapsone (adjusted rate ratio = 4.0, 95% CI, 2.2–7.4) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (adjusted rate ratio = 2.5, 95% CI, 1.2–5.3) use were independently associated with higher rates of infection. Increasing days of inpatient stay (P < .01) and decreasing CD4(+) counts (P < .01) were strongly associated with P aeruginosa. Azithromycin use decreased the risk of infection by nearly 70%.

Conclusion

Although the overall observed incidence of P aeruginosa was low, hospital exposure, declining CD4(+) levels, and the use of dapsone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increased the risk of P aeruginosa disease, and azithromycin use was protective in this population. These findings may assist in the early recognition and diagnosis of persons likely to be at increased risk of P aeruginosa infection.

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia: risk factors for mortality and influence of delayed receipt of effective antimicrobial therapy on clinical outcome [^e6399eb4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Among the nosocomial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Data on 136 patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate risk factors for mortality. The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 15–85 years), 78.7% of the cases were hospital-acquired, and the 30-day mortality rate was 39% (53 of 136 patients). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that risk factors for mortality included severe sepsis, pneumonia, delay in starting effective antimicrobial therapy, and an increasing APACHE II score (all P values < .05). In 123 of the 136 patients (excluding 13 patients treated with inadequate definitive antibiotics), 30-day mortality was 27.7% (13 of 47 patients) in the group of patients who received initially effective empirical antimicrobial therapy, and 43.4% (33 of 76) in the group of patients who received delayed effective antimicrobial therapy (P = 0.079). There was a trend toward higher mortality as the length of delay increased. Delay in starting effective antimicrobial therapy for P. aeruginosa bacteremia tended to be associated with higher mortality.

### Development and assessment of risk scores for carbapenem and extensive β-lactam resistance among adult hospitalized patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [^b3230398]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Treatment of patients with infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been complicated by increased antibiotic resistance rates, which contribute to delayed appropriate treatment and deleterious outcomes.

Objective

To develop 2 clinical risk scores based on variables available at clinical presentation to estimate the risk of carbapenem resistance (CR) or extensive β-lactam resistance (EBR) among hospitalized, adult patients with P aeruginosa infections.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study included adult (age, ≥ 18 years) members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) with a P aeruginosa infection during hospitalization from September 1, 2011, through August 31, 2016, who received antibiotic therapy within 2 days of the culture date. Data were analyzed from July 2, 2017, through August 15, 2018.

Exposures

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory covariates 1 year before the index culture date were evaluated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Pseudomonas aeruginosa was categorized as antibiotic susceptible, CR, or EBR (nonsusceptibility to carbapenems, ceftazidime, and combined piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium). Patients were randomly split (1:1) into training and validation data sets. The training data set was used to develop 2 prediction models using high-performance logistic regression with variable selection by Schwarz-Bayesian criterion. The models were translated into risk scores, with risk score points equaling the weighted sums of regression coefficients from the prediction model. The patient's risk was estimated as the inverse logit of the risk score.

Results

Of the 7775 patients with 11 502 P aeruginosa infections included in the analysis, most were male (4308 [55.4%]) and non-Hispanic white (3927 [50.5%]). The mean (SD) age was 70.3 (15.5) years. Among 11 502 P aeruginosa infections, 2324 (20.2%) were CR, 9178 (79.8%) were non-CR, 1033 (9.0%) were EBR, and 10 469 were non-EBR (91.0%). The strongest predictors of resistance in the CR and EBR models were history of CR P aeruginosa infection (odds ratios [ORs],8.80 [95% CI, 6.74–11.49] and5.04 [95% CI, 3.88–6.54], respectively), tracheostomy (ORs,3.49 [95% CI, 2.92–4.16] and3.13 [95% CI, 2.50–3.91], respectively), and carbapenem use in the prior 30 days (ORs,4.18 [95% CI, 3.29–5.31] and 2.26 [95% CI, 1.74–2.93], respectively). The models for CR and EBR performed well, with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.81 or greater for the training and validation data sets.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that parsimonious risk scores can aid physicians in appropriate treatment selection during the critical period when P aeruginosa infection is suspected but antibiotic susceptibility results are not yet available.

Empiric Pseudomonas aeruginosa treatment — CAP with risk factors: "If risk factors for Pseudomonas infection are present, an antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus either ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin (750-mg dose) should be used (AI)". Preferred beta-lactams are "piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, or meropenem". Alternatives include "an antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin (BII) or an antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside and an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone (BII)". For penicillin allergy, "aztreonam is recommended to be used in place of the beta-lactam (BII)".

### Application of multiple event analysis as an alternative approach to studying pulmonary exacerbations as an outcome measure [^fdb694ac]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are important contributors to morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Understanding risk factors for PEx is critical to improve treatment; pulmonary exacerbations also serve as an important outcome in CF clinical trials. Current risk estimates generally only evaluate time to the first PEx. Methods accounting for multiple exacerbations during the observation period could provide more power to detect significant risk factors.

Methods

The Early Pseudomonas Infection Control (EPIC) Observational Study enrolled participants between 2004 and 2006 who were ≤ 12 years of age and negative for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. First and multiple event analyses were used to investigate risk factors for pulmonary exacerbations.

Results

We evaluated a total of 5129 PEx from 1734 CF patients in the EPIC study. Multiple event analysis identified 2 more factors associated with occurrence of PEx compared to first event analysis. After adjusting for multiple factors, the following were associated with higher occurrence of PExs: female gender, older age at enrollment, household cigarette smoke exposure, increased cough at the most recent encounter, having used antibiotics since the previous encounter, a positive culture for any CF organism at the most recent encounter, and having had a PEx in the last 30 days.

Conclusions

Multiple event analyses use all PEx events and may identify more risk factors for PEx than analysis of time to first PEx. We have provided an example of how to apply this type of analysis and how to interpret estimates in the context of the EPIC study.

Risk factors

Are there modifiable risk factors for the development of NTM-PD in individuals with CF?

Recommendation 1: The CF Foundation and the ECFS recommend that the potential for cross-infection of NTM (particularly MABSC) between individuals with CF should be minimised by following national infection control guidelines. CF-related lung disease is a clear risk factor for the development of NTM-PD and is presumed to relate to the presence of structural lung damage, impaired mucociliary clearance and inflamed airways; all of which are thought to favour the development of chronic NTM infection. Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) dysfunction may, of itself, predispose to NTM infection (although the pathophysiology is unknown), since rates of heterozygosity for CFTR mutations within the non-CF population with pulmonary NTM disease are high (30–50%).

However, other risk factors that predispose specific individuals with CF to acquire NTM or to develop NTM-PD are, for the most part, poorly understood, with many studies presenting conflicting results. Potential risk factors for NTM acquisition are listed below.

Lung function

There have been conflicting reports on whether an individual's spirometry results are related to the likelihood of finding NTM-positive samples, with some studies suggesting no association with lung function, a positive association of NTM acquisition with higher FEV 1% predictedor, conversely, with worse lung function. Support for the possibility that NTM acquisition is more likely in CF individuals with severe lung disease comes from observations that the prevalence of NTM-positive sputum samples in patients referred for lung transplantation has been reported to be as high as 19.7%.

Lung infection with specific pathogens

In some studies, individuals with CF with NTM-positive samples are more likely to have Staphylococcus aureus infection and less likely to have Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic pulmonary infection. Other studies, however, have reported NTM positivity associated with higher rates of P. aeruginosa infection, and variably associated with S. maltophilia infection. In contrast, Aspergillus fumigatus has consistently been associated with the presence of NTM-positive cultures, with some reports indicating an association with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.

### Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection and lung function decline in children with cystic fibrosis [^56d143bc]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterised by recurrent Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infections, leading to structural lung damage and decreased survival. The epidemiology of Pa infection and its impact on lung function in people with CF (pwCF), especially in recent birth cohorts, remain uncertain. Methods We included 1,231 French pwCF under 18 years of age. Age at initial acquisition (Pa-IA), chronic colonisation (Pa-CC), and duration from Pa-IA to Pa-CC were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Demographic, clinical, and genetic characteristics were analysed as risk factors for Pa infection using Cox regression models. Lung function decline was assessed by modelling percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1) before Pa infection, after Pa-IA, and after Pa-CC. Results Among the 1,231 pwCF, 50% had Pa-IA by the age of 5.1 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.8–6.2] and 25% had Pa-CC by the age of 14.7 years (95% CI 12.1 to ∞). We observed that CF-related diabetes and liver disease were risk factors for Pa, while gender, CFTR variants, and CF centre size were not. Genetic variants of TNF, DCTN4, SLC9A3, and CAV2 were confirmed to be associated with Pa. The annual rate of ppFEV1 decline before Pa was -0.38% predicted/year (95% CI -0.59 to -0.18), which decreased significantly after Pa-IA to -0.93% predicted/year (95% CI -1.14 to -0.71) and after Pa-CC to -1.51% predicted/year (95% CI -1.86 to -1.16). Conclusions We identified and replicated several risk factors associated with Pa infection and showed its deleterious impact on lung function in young pwCF. This large-scale study confirmed that Pa airway infection is a major determinant of lung disease severity.

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary tract infection in children: risk factors and outcomes [^c58e509f]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an unusual uropathogen that is mostly responsible for nosocomial or catheter associated urinary tract infections in adults. Data about P. aeruginosa urinary tract infections in children are scarce. We investigated P. aeruginosa urinary tract infections in children in a well-defined area.

Materials and Methods

Clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of all children with P. aeruginosa urinary tract infections were compared to those of gender matched children with community acquired Escherichia coli urinary tract infections during a 12-year period.

Results

A total of 35 children with 43 P. aeruginosa urinary tract infection episodes representing 6.7% of total urinary tract infection cases during the study period were compared to 70 children with E. coli urinary tract infections. Children with P. aeruginosa more often presented with a history of at least 1 previous urinary tract infection episode (p < 0.0001), hospitalization (p = 0.0001), use of antibiotics (p = 0.0001), malformations predisposing to urinary tract infections (p = 0.004), vesicoureteral reflux (p < 0.0001), abnormal dimercapto-succinic acid scan (p = 0.0003), longer hospitalization and surgery. Use of antibiotics either as prophylaxis or as treatment within the preceding 2 months was demonstrated by multivariate logistic regression analysis as the single independent risk factor for P. aeruginosa urinary tract infections (odds ratio 21.6, 95% CI 4.65–100, p = 0.0001). P. aeruginosa isolates were often resistant to gentamicin (27.9%) and ceftazidime (13.9%) but remained sensitive to carbapenems and ciprofloxacin.

Conclusions

P. aeruginosa urinary tract infection is associated with distinct risk factors and outcomes, and should be considered in predisposed children with symptoms of urinary tract infection who are on prophylaxis or have a history of a recent course of antibiotics.

### Airway infections as a risk factor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa acquisition and chronic colonisation in children with cystic fibrosis [^4475a6c0]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection is detrimental to people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Several clinical and genetic factors predispose to early Pa infections. However, the role of earlier infections with other pathogens on the risk of Pa infection in paediatric pwCF remains unknown.

Methods

Using Kaplan-Meier method, we computed the cumulative incidences of bacterial and fungal initial acquisition (IA) and chronic colonisation (CC) in 1,231 French pwCF under 18 years of age for methicillin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and Aspergillus species. Previous infections were analysed as Pa-IA and Pa-CC risk factors using Cox regression models.

Results

By 2 years of age, 65.5% pwCF had experienced at least one bacterial or fungal IA, and 27.9% had experienced at least one CC. The median age of Pa-IA was 5.1 years, and Pa-CC was present in 25% pwCF by 14.7 years. While 50% acquired MSSA at 2.1 years, 50% progressed to chronic MSSA colonisation at 8.4 years. At 7.9 and 9.7 years, 25% pwCF were infected by S. maltophilia and Aspergillus spp., respectively. The risk of Pa-IA and Pa-CC increased with IAs of all other species, with hazard ratios (HR) up to 2.19 (95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.18–4.07). The risk of Pa-IA increased with the number of previous bacterial/fungal IAs (HR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.57–2.28), with a 16% increase per additional pathogen; same trend was noted for Pa-CC.

Conclusions

This study establishes that the microbial community in CF airways can modulate Pa occurrence. At the dawn of targeted therapies, it paves the way for characterizing future trends and evolution of infections.

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia in burns patients: risk factors and outcomes [^64b2e95e]. Burns (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

We aimed to identify the risk factors for, and outcomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia in adult burns patients.

Method

All adult burns patients who developed a Gram-negative bacteraemia over a period of 7 years were included. Retrospective data analysed included patient demographics, organisms cultured, antibiotic susceptibility patterns, isolation of P. aeruginosa in non-blood isolates, treatment, length of stay and mortality.

Results

Forty-three patients developed a Gram-negative bacteraemia over the study period, 12 of whom had Pseudomonas bacteraemia during the course of their admission. In eight patients (18.6%) P. aeruginosa was the first Gram-negative isolated. The only factor predicting P. aeruginosa bacteraemia as a first episode (compared to another Gram-negative) was prior isolation of Pseudomonas at other sites (wound sites, urine or sputum). Overall length of stay was less in patients who developed P. aeruginosa as a first episode, mainly because of increased mortality in this group. Prior non-blood isolates of P. aeruginosa could have correctly predicted the sensitivity pattern of the strain of P. aeruginosa organism in 75% of patients who did not receive appropriate initial antibiotics.

Conclusion

Prior colonisation with P. aeruginosa predicts P. aeruginosa in blood cultures, as opposed to other Gram-negative bacteria. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for P. aeruginosa bacteraemia where a septic burns patient has a prior history of non-blood P. aeruginosa cultures. Empirical antibiotic regimes based on the antibiotic-sensitivity patterns of previous non-blood P. aeruginosa isolates in each patient should be given at the time blood cultures are taken.

### Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and clinical implications [^0dce103e]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this single center study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest bacteria colonizing the airways of patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. Our study identified that, other than previously reported risk factors, longer duration of bronchiectasis and PPI use were independent risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, which have important clinical implications. While advanced age is a known poor prognostic factor, those who had longer duration of bronchiectasis had disease onset at younger age. These patients did not only have symptoms for longer duration and worse quality of life, they were also at increased risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, which was associated with worse prognosis in bronchiectasis. Patients have Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization at young age, it would be important to consider Pseudomonas aeruginosa eradication once it is isolated in sputum, as once Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized the airway, the chance of successful eradication will be low. The European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines suggested eradication of new Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa can prevent the consequences from Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, which are greater decline in lung function and more frequent exacerbations, especially in younger patients. It would also be essential to monitor and follow up these patients more closely and regularly.

Experience of the French national surveillance of nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit, rea-raisin [^3b7e0d57]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Individual and ward risk factors for P. aeruginosa-induced urinary tract infection in the case of nosocomial urinary tract infection in the intensive care unit were determined with hierarchical (multilevel) logistic regression. The 2004–2006 prospective French national intensive care unit nosocomial infection surveillance dataset was used and 3252 patients with urinary tract infection were included; 16% were infected by P. aeruginosa. Individual risk factors were male sex, duration of stay, antibiotics at admission and transfer from another intensive care unit. Ward risk factors were patient turnover and incidence of P. aeruginosa-infected patients.

### Risk factor evaluation for methicillin-resistantandin community-acquired pneumonia [^47f19868]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2019 community-acquired pneumonia guidelines recommend using recent respiratory cultures and locally validated epidemiology plus risk factor assessment to determine empirical coverage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Objective

To develop a methodology for evaluating local epidemiology and validating local risk factors for P aeruginosa and MRSA.

Methods

This multicenter, retrospective cohort evaluated adult patients admitted for pneumonia. Risk factors for MRSA and P aeruginosa were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression and reported as adjusted odds ratios (aORs).

Results

There were 10 723 cases evaluated. Lung abscess/empyema had the highest odds associated with MRSA (aOR = 4.24; P < 0.0001), followed by influenza (aOR = 2.34; P = 0.01), end-stage renal disease (ESRD; aOR = 2.09; P = 0.006), illicit substance use (aOR = 1.7; P = 0.007), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; aOR = 1.26; P = 0.04). For P aeruginosa, the highest odds were in bronchiectasis (aOR = 6.13; P < 0.0001), lung abscess/empyema (aOR = 3.36; P = 0.005), and COPD (aOR = 1.84; P < 0.0001). Isolated COPD without other risk factors did not pose an increased risk of either organism.

Conclusion and Relevance

Influenza, ESRD, lung abscess/empyema, and illicit substance use were local risk factors for MRSA. Bronchiectasis and lung abscess/empyema were risk factors for Pseudomonas. COPD was associated with MRSA and Pseudomonas. However, isolated COPD had similar rates of MRSA and Pseudomonas pneumonia compared with the total population. This study established a feasible methodology for evaluating local risk factors.

### Cystic fibrosis lung environment and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [^b3930740]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

There is still little clarity concerning acquisition of Pseudomonas in CF. Earlier studies pointed to clinical exposures and social interaction as zones for the acquisition of P. aeruginosa. These studies suggested that P. aeruginosa spreads by cross-infection. The other identified risk factors in the acquisition of P. aeruginosa include gender, with females having more predilection than males, while F508del homozygous genotype and co-infection with other pathogens such as S. aureus and B. cenocepacia are also independent risk factors.

Despite having a low acquisition rate of just 1–2% per year, about 80% of patients are chronically colonized by P. aeruginosa by the age of 20. In one study, the 8-year risk of death was found to be 2.6 times higher in patients having P. aeruginosa than in those without it. Koch suggested a "continuum for P. aeruginosa colonization" where the numbers of P. aeruginosa goes on increasing until there is "a point of no return". The phase is marked by expression of biofilm forming genes in P. aeruginosa and appearance of host biomarkers such as antibodies against P. aeruginosa, an increase in polymorphonuclear leucocytes [PMN] and increased serine proteinases.

### Risk stratification for selecting empiric antibiotherapy during and after COVID-19 [^941d8b1b]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

SARS-CoV-2 deeply modified the risk of bacterial infection, bacterial resistance, and antibiotic strategies. This review summarized what we have learned.

Recent Findings

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed an increase in healthcare-acquired infection and multidrug-resistant organism-related infection, triggered by several factors: structural factors, such as increased workload and ongoing outbreaks, underlying illnesses, invasive procedures, and treatment-induced immunosuppression. The two most frequently healthcare-acquired infections described in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were bloodstream infection, related or not to catheters, health-acquired pneumonia (in ventilated or nonventilated patients). The most frequent species involved in bacteremia were Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli in health-acquired pneumonia. The rate of Gram-negative bacilli is particularly high in late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the specific risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa- related pneumonia increased when the duration of ventilation was longer than 7 days. A specificity that remains unexplained so far is the increase in enterococci bacteremia.

Summary

The choice of empiric antibiotimicrobials depends on several factors such as the site of the infection, time of onset and previous length of stay, previous antibiotic therapy, and known multidrug-resistant organism colonization. Pharmacokinetics of antimicrobials could be markedly altered during SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory failure, which should encourage to perform therapeutic drug monitoring.

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: characterization and risk factors [^68039395]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious exacerbations are the most important cause of hospital admission and mortality in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPMs) such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and viruses are the leading causative agents of these acute episodes, but P. aeruginosa accounts for 5–10% of COPD exacerbations in these patients and has been associated with increased mortality.

It is widely accepted that the probability of bacterial infection is higher in exacerbations appearing in severe COPD patients. Two studies have shown that individuals with a FEV1 below 50% of the reference level have a six-fold higher risk of suffering exacerbations due to H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa than patients with mild or moderate COPD. Likewise, P. aeruginosa infection in COPD has also been related to risk factors such as previous hospital admissions and use of oral corticosteroids or antibiotics but the importance of these individual determinants has not been elucidated. Moreover, the role of other potential factors such as bronchiectasis, as a risk factor of P. aeruginosa in cursive infection-a factor associated with severe airflow obstruction in COPD, has been addressed only marginally. In the context of COPD exacerbation, the majority of guidelines recommend specific treatment against P. aeruginosa in patients reporting hospital admissions and/or recurrent use of antibiotics or corticosteroids; but the management of patients with repeated isolates of this PPM is not well established. Recent studies based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and polymerase chain reaction have shown that most clones are cleared over time and that only a minority persist. In some patients a pattern of chronic colonization by P. aeruginosa has been reported, closely resembling those seen in cystic fibrosis. Unfortunately, the relationship between chronic colonization by P. aeruginosa, the pattern of clonal carriage and bronchiectasis has not been evaluated to date.

The objectives of our study were to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for, P. aeruginosa isolation in sputum samples from outpatients with severe COPD, characterizing P. aeruginosa isolates in these patients with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and focusing on the influence of bronchiectasis and other risk factors, on bronchial colonization in these patients.

### Change in Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence in cystic fibrosis adults over time [^615eead9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Knowledge about the factors associated with chronic Pa can improve care in CF adults. Identifying risk factors for development of chronic Pa can tailor care and ultimately improve quality of life. In a prospective cohort study, CFTR genotype, female gender, age of diagnosis, and pancreatic enzyme use were identified as risk factors for initial Pa acquisition in children. Predictors of chronic Pa, however, have not been well described in the literature. The limited literature may in part be due to no universally agreed upon definition for chronic Pa. A variable amount of time may lapse between first acquisition of Pa and chronic Pa status, and aggressive attempts to eradicate newly acquired Pa from the airways have lengthened the time between new acquisition and chronic Pa. This may limit our ability to extrapolate risk factors from newly acquired Pa to chronic Pa. The mucoid phenotype of Pa has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in CF and has been associated with onset of chronic Pa. In children, gender, lower baseline lung function, genotype and absence of MRSA in sputum culture are risk factors associated with acquisition of the mucoid Pa in respiratory culture. Our study is the first to describe independent predictors of chronic and mucoid Pa infection in the adult CF population in the post-pediatric inhaled tobramycin era. Of the predictors, baseline lung function and being diagnosed with CF as an adult appear to be the predominant predictors not being infected with mucoid or chronic Pa. Being diagnosed with CF as an adult is likely reflective of having a milder phenotype, which may correlate with degree of functional CFTR. Whether the predictors found in our study translate to risk factors for the development of chronic and mucoid Pa still needs to be determined.

### Pseudomonas bacteremia in children: clinical and microbiologic features and risk factors of mortality: a retrospective cohort study [^b534c0bf]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas bacteremia is most commonly acquired in hospital. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility, mortality rate and risk factors of mortality in children with Pseudomonas bacteremia.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study that included children 18 years of age or younger admitted to a tertiary hospital with Pseudomonas bacteremia between 2005 and 2020.

Results

A total of 196 patients with Pseudomonas bacteremia were identified. The proportional rate of Pseudomonas bacteremia was 33.9/100,000 hospital days. Underlying disease was documented in 81.1% of patients, 61% had hemato-oncological disease. Pseudomonas bacteremia was healthcare related in 180 (91.8%) episodes. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas accounted for 16 (8.2%) and difficult-to-treat organism to 3 (1.5%) of all isolates. Thirty-day mortality was reported in 27 (13.8%) patients, all had Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In multivariate regression analysis, the first model showed that younger age [P = 0.038, odds ratio (OR) = 1.095, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.005–1.192] and inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment (P = 0.004, OR = 3.584, 95% CI: 1.490–8.621) were significantly associated with higher mortality. The second model also showed higher morality in younger age (P = 0.021, OR = 1.114, 95% CI: 1.016–1.221) and MDR isolates (P = 0.001, OR = 9.725, 95% CI: 2.486–38.039).

Conclusions

Significant morbidity and mortality due to Pseudomonas bacteremia, but relatively lower mortality than previously published. Although young age, MDR isolates and inappropriate antibiotic treatment have been associated with increased mortality, these factors, especially with low prevalence of MDR isolates, may reflect the baseline mortality rate in vulnerable hosts with continuous contact with healthcare facilities facing such severe infection, and more efforts should be made to emphasize infection control practices to prevent such severe infection.

### Emerging bacterial pathogens and changing concepts of bacterial pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis [^9f560957]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative lower airway infection is a hallmark feature of cystic fibrosis (CF). Decades of experience in clinical microbiology have enabled the development of improved technologies and approaches for the cultivation and identification of microorganisms from sputum. It is increasingly apparent that the microbial constituents of the lower airways in CF exist in a dynamic state. Indeed, while changes in prevalence of various pathogens occur through ageing, differences exist in successive cohorts of patients and between clinics, regions and countries. Classical pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex and Staphylococcus aureus are increasingly being supplemented with new and emerging organisms rarely observed in other areas of medicine. Moreover, it is now recognized that common oropharyngeal organisms, previously presumed to be benign colonizers may contribute to disease progression. As infection remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in CF, an understanding of the epidemiology, risk factors for acquisition and natural history of infection including interactions between colonizing bacteria is required. Unified approaches to the study and determination of pathogen status are similarly needed. Furthermore, experienced and evidence-based treatment data is necessary to optimize outcomes for individuals with CF.

### Risk factors for lung function decline in a large cohort of young cystic fibrosis patients [^33d31d8b]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify novel risk factors and corroborate previously identified risk factors for mean annual decline in FEV1% predicted in a large, contemporary, United States cohort of young cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.

Methods

Retrospective observational study of participants in the EPIC Observational Study, who were Pseudomonas-negative and ≤ 12 years of age at enrollment in 2004–2006. The associations between potential demographic, clinical, and environmental risk factors evaluated during the baseline year and subsequent mean annual decline in FEV1 percent predicted were evaluated using generalized estimating equations.

Results

The 946 participants in the current analysis were followed for a mean of 6.2 (SD 1.3) years. Mean annual decline in FEV1% predicted was 1.01% (95%CI 0.85–1.17%). Children with one or no F508del mutations had a significantly smaller annual decline in FEV1 compared to F508del homozygotes. In a multivariable model, risk factors during the baseline year associated with a larger subsequent mean annual lung function decline included female gender, frequent or productive cough, low BMI (< 66th percentile, median in the cohort), ≥ 1 pulmonary exacerbation, high FEV1 (≥ 115% predicted, in the top quartile), and respiratory culture positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

Conclusions

We have identified a range of risk factors for FEV1 decline in a large cohort of young, CF patients who were Pa negative at enrollment, including novel as well as previously identified characteristics. These results could inform the design of a clinical trial in which rate of FEV1 decline is the primary endpoint and identify high-risk groups that may benefit from closer monitoring.

### Management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia: one size does not fit all [^5b551aab]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In view of the mortality associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the frequency of inadequate initial empiric therapy, recent findings underscore the need for a different management paradigm with effective anti-pseudomonal vaccines for prophylaxis of patients at risk. The association of virulence factors is a variable that splits PSA in two phenotypes, with the possibility of adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy for management of virulent strains. We comment on recent advances in and the state of the art of PSA-VAP management and discuss a new paradigm for tailored and optimal management.

### Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9479d0cd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study indicated that hypoproteinemia is a significant risk factor for PA isolation. Hypoproteinemia can lead to metabolic disorders in tissue cells and associated enzymes, as well as impaired immunity, thereby increasing the likelihood of infections, particularly those caused by PA. Furthermore, patients with hypoproteinemia experience alterations in the pharmacokinetics of antimicrobial agents. The reduction in plasma colloid osmotic pressure in these patients enhance fluid leakage, consequently decreasing the local drug concentration at the site of infection, which diminishes the effectiveness of anti-infection treatments. Additionally, hypoproteinemia can disrupt both cellular and humoral immunity, resulting in reduced lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin (IL)-6 release, as well as causing dysfunction in granulocytes.

Our results revealed that hospitalizations in previous years were also related with the increased risk of PA isolation. The number of hospitalizations in the previous years was closely related with the readmission of COPD patients. PA infection was common in that population.

Our results also indicated that COPD patients combined with Bronchiectasis were more intended to increase the risk of PA isolation. Bronchiectasis is a structural lung disease. Combined with Bronchiectasis in COPD patients (Bronchiectasis-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome, BCOS), the lung structure and internal environment were more complex. Research has indicated that PA is the most common pathogen of BCOS. It has strong pathogenicity by secreting exotoxins and pathogenic factors that combine with specific sites in the host body and are able to form biofilms and related quorum-sensing systems, form protective barriers of bacteria, and participate in antimicrobial resistance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is more susceptible to colonize and become chronic infection in that environment.

Our results also revealed that prior PA isolation as one of the risk factors for PA isolation. PA infection often induced the death of lung epithelial cells, caused the host inflammatory response, and triggered serious damage to the respiratory system, which increased the risk of PA reinfection. Additionally, the overuse of antibiotics during treatment accelerates the development of multidrug-resistant PA strains, resulting in ineffective empirical antibiotic treatment against this organism. The bacteria were more likely to be isolated from sputum of patients who had been priorly infected with PA.

### Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and clinical implications [^b4ad4521]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As a common suppurative respiratory disease among Chinese population, non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis is characterized by having micro-organism colonization as well as exacerbation. Both bacteria and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can commonly colonize the airway in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis.

Among all bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the commonest colonizers in non-CF bronchiectasis. It was estimated around 25% of patients with non-CF bronchiectasis had chronic colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization was associated with poor outcome in patients with bronchiectasis, which encompassed more extensive and severe bronchiectatic changes on imaging, rapid decline in lung function, increased frequency of exacerbation and hospitalization. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization is also one of the components within the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) and FACED scores, which predict prognosis and future hospitalization. BSI consists of clinical (hospitalization and exacerbation history, body mass index, MMRC dyspnea score), spirometric (percentage FEV 1 predicted), imaging and microbiological components. It reflects the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization as an important predictive factor for poor prognosis, further contributing to the risk of hospitalization and mortality. The FACED score entails the combination of FEV 1, age, Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, radiological extension and dyspnea in predicting mortality; with the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization associated with higher mortality. Among these different predictive factors, Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization could be a preventable or modifiable factor. As such, if factors that determine or contribute to Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization could be identified, this may be an opportunity to intervene so as to reduce the chance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, and hence, to reduce the risk of hospitalization or mortality in non-CF bronchiectasis subjects. To date, the reported factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization are related to the severity of bronchiectasis, which are high sputum output, moderately severe airflow obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC < 60%), older age (> 55 years), use of hypertonic saline for sputum induction, use of inhalation antibiotics, presence of primary ciliary dyskinesia and post-infectious etiology. Whether these reported factors represent risk factors associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization or they are the consequences of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization or they predict Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization is doubtful. This study aimed to assess the risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis as well as its clinical and prognostic implications.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^47ffae50]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli coverage emphasizes initial antipseudomonal activity and stratified breadth. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend prescribing antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have factors increasing the likelihood for Pseudomonas or other gram-negative infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days; also see Remarks) or a high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). All other patients with HAP who are being treated empirically may be prescribed a single antibiotic with activity against P. aeruginosa. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend not using an aminoglycoside as the sole antipseudomonal agent (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). If patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended.

Three cases of skin infection, two with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one with Staphylococcus aureus in three adolescents with acute leukaemia are described. In all cases the infection was clearly related to the latest fashion in shoes. This report underline the fact that factors related to everyday life and less frequently considered than those related to the underlying illness can also put increase the risk of developing severe infections in immunocompromised patients.

### What is the most effective antibiotic monotherapy for severe Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a057115a]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Severe infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients. Determining the optimal definitive monotherapy for these infections is critical. The main objective was to compile the evidence of subgroups of patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection from randomized control trials (RCTs) evaluating different definite antipseudomonal monotherapies for severe P. aeruginosa infection.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs that assessed monotherapy with an antipseudomonal drug versus another antipseudomonal for definite treatment, and reported on the subgroup of patients with P. aeruginosa infection. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, LILACS and the reference lists of included trials. Eligibility criteria included RCTs enrolling hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years) with microbiologically confirmed severe P. aeruginosa infections. Studies were excluded if they included > 20% of patients receiving combination therapy or if patients had resistant P. aeruginosa strains at recruitment. Antipseudomonal drugs evaluated included cephalosporins, carbapenems, penicillins, quinolones and aztreonam. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. Results were pooled using fixed-effects and random-effects models as appropriate. Relative risk (RR) and 95% CIs were calculated. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were performed when data were available.

Results

A total of 76 RCTs and 1681 patients with pseudomonal infection were included. Due to the low number of studies which reported our outcomes of interest, all subgroup analyses were underpowered. No difference in all-cause mortality was found for any direct antibiotic comparison. Higher clinical failure rates of carbapenems versus piperacillin-tazobactam were observed for pneumonia in two RCTs (RR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.29–5.03; I² = 0%, n = 2), and higher microbiological failure rates with carbapenems versus other comparators (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02–1.51; I² = 0%, n = 23). Patients treated with imipenem were more likely to develop resistance to the study drug versus comparators (RR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.61–3.38; I² = 0%, n = 7).

Conclusions

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of definite antipseudomonal monotherapy for P. aeruginosa infection, we found no evidence of clinical benefit differences among direct antibiotic comparisons, but all subgroup analyses were underpowered to detect significant differences.

### Nationwide study of invasive Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in Norway: importance of underlying disease [^ba036184]. The Journal of Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that may cause invasive disease. We describe the epidemiology of invasive P. aeruginosa infection in Norway and identify associated clinical factors.

Methods

All patients with invasive P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas not identified at the species level (Pseudomonas spp.) in Norway 1992–2002 were included. Detailed information was collected for all cases during 1999–2002. Population and health institution statistics were obtained from national databases.

Results

In 1999–2002 the incidence rate was 3.16 per 100 000 person-years at risk or 0.20 per 1000 hospital stays. For hospital-acquired infection the rate was 671 per 100 000 person-years as compared with 1.13 for community-acquired infection, and 37 in nursing homes. The highest risk for invasive Pseudomonas disease was found in patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphoid and haematopoietic tissue (risk per 1000 hospital stays 1.9; 95% CI 1.5–2.3) and other diseases of blood and blood-forming organs (2.2; 95% CI 1.2–3.7). The case fatality rate was 35%.

Conclusions

The incidence of invasive P. aeruginosa infection in this population-based study was much lower than in most single-hospital studies. The nationwide study design and prudent antibiotic use may explain some of the difference. Infection risk is strongly associated with certain underlying diseases.

### Risk factors and outcome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia among adults visiting the ED [^6cb6cc58]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics of, antibiotic therapy for, and clinical outcome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection among bacteremic adults who visit the emergency department (ED).

Methods

Bacteremic adults who visited the ED were identified retrospectively from January 2007 to December 2007. Demographic characteristics, underlying illnesses, severity, bacteremic pathogens, antimicrobial agents, and outcome were determined from chart records.

Results

The records of 340 eligible bacteremic adults were analyzed; their mean age was 66.2 years, and major comorbidities included hypertension (175 patients, or 51.5%), diabetes mellitus (124, or 36.5%), and malignancy (87, or 25.6%). Among the 379 bacteremic isolates, Escherichia coli (139 isolates, or 6.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (63, or 16.6%) were the major pathogens, whereas P aeruginosa (15, or 4.0%) was the third-leading gram-negative isolate. Of note, both 30-day mortality (33.3% vs 8.9%, P = 0.01) and the proportion of empirically inappropriate antibiotics (86.7% vs 31.4%, P < .001) were higher in bacteremia caused by P aeruginosa than in bacteremia not caused by P aeruginosa in univariate analysis. Moreover, multivariate analysis identified 3 independent factors related to P aeruginosa bacteremia: surgery during the 4 weeks before ED arrival (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 12.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.68–95.7; P = 0.01), malignancy (AOR, 4.57; 95% CI, 1.27–16.3; P = 0.02), and community onset (AOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04–0.47; P = 0.002).

Conclusions

For bacteremic adults who visited the ED, P aeruginosa was associated with a high mortality rate and a high proportion of empirically inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Identification of clinical predictors of P aeruginosa bacteremia would improve the quality of care and the use of appropriate antibiotics in the ED.

### Cefepime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^a3dc190f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins complicates treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. To elucidate risk factors for cefepime-resistant P. aeruginosa and determine its association with patient death, we conducted a case-control study in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Among 2,529 patients hospitalized during 2001–2006, a total of 213 (8.4%) had cefepime-resistant P. aeruginosa infection. Independent risk factors were prior use of an extended-spectrum cephalosphorin (p < 0.001), prior use of an extended-spectrum penicillin (p = 0.005), prior use of a quinolone (p < 0.001), and transfer from an outside facility (p = 0.01). Among those hospitalized at least 30 days, mortality rates were higher for those with cefepime-resistant than with cefepime-susceptible P. aeruginosa infection (20.2% vs. 13.2%, p = 0.007). Cefepime-resistant P. aeruginosa was an independent risk factor for death only for patients for whom it could be isolated from blood (p = 0.001). Strategies to counter its emergence should focus on optimizing use of antipseudomonal drugs.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^990c32f7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage and HCAP category — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the inpatient setting: we recommend abandoning use of the prior categorization of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to guide selection of extended antibiotic coverage in adults with CAP (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and we recommend clinicians only cover empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in adults with CAP if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence); empiric treatment options for MRSA include vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 h, adjust based on levels) or linezolid (600 mg every 12 h), and for P. aeruginosa include piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h), cefepime (2 g every 8 h), ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h), aztreonam (2 g every 8 h), meropenem (1 g every 8 h), or imipenem (500 mg every 6 h); if clinicians are currently covering empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa on the basis of published risk factors but do not have local etiologic data, we recommend continuing empiric coverage while obtaining culture data to justify continued treatment after the first few days of empiric treatment (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in the intensive care unit: prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes [^7a38f558]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization on intensive care unit (ICU) admission, risk factors for P. aeruginosa colonization, and the incidence of subsequent clinical culture with P. aeruginosa among those colonized and not colonized.

Methods

We conducted a cohort study of patients admitted to a medical or surgical intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. Patients had admission perirectal surveillance cultures performed. Risk factors analyzed included comorbidities at admission, age, sex, antibiotics received during current hospitalization before ICU admission, and type of ICU.

Results

Of 1,840 patients, 213 (11.6%) were colonized with P. aeruginosa on ICU admission. Significant risk factors in the multivariable analysis for colonization were age (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01–1.03]), anemia (1.90 [1.05–3.42]), and neurologic disorder (1.80 [1.27–2.54]). Of the 213 patients colonized with P. aeruginosa on admission, 41 (19.2%) had a subsequent clinical culture positive for P. aeruginosa on ICU admission and 60 (28.2%) had a subsequent clinical culture positive for P. aeruginosa in the current hospitalization (ICU period and post-ICU period). Of these 60 patients, 49 (81.7%) had clinical infections. Of the 1,627 patients not colonized on admission, only 68 (4.2%) had a subsequent clinical culture positive for P. aeruginosa in the current hospitalization. Patients colonized with P. aeruginosa were more likely to have a subsequent positive clinical culture than patients not colonized (incidence rate ratio, 6.74 [95% CI, 4.91–9.25]).

Conclusions

Prediction rules or rapid diagnostic testing will help clinicians more appropriately choose empirical antibiotic therapy for subsequent infections.

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: characterization and risk factors [^c0091824]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our study suggests a high prevalence of P. aeruginosa isolations in severe COPD patients. The extent of bronchiectasis and the number of antibiotic treatment regimens received were the main independent risk factors for the recovery of this PPM. Moreover, over one tenth of COPD patients met criteria for chronic colonization by P. aeruginosa and showed clonal persistence of this PPM regardless of the extent of bronchiectasis.

These findings have clinical implications for the management of severe COPD patients with frequent exacerbations, who may need the performance of CT scans and repeated sputum cultures for the identification of bronchiectasis and bronchial colonization by this PPM. P. aeruginosa must be considered a common causative agent in these patients, especially in those with a high extent in their bronchiectasis and receiving frequent antibiotic treatment. According to our data, a close follow-up may be recommended when P. aeruginosa is isolated in sputum cultures, for an early identification of chronic colonization, a situation which will require an approach similar to that applied in cystic fibrosis.

### About Pseudomonas aeruginosa… [^602a9af1]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections typically occur in healthcare settings.
- Good hand hygiene and infection prevention and control can help reduce the risk of infection. P. aeruginosacan be resistant to antibiotics, making these infections difficult to treat. Overview Pseudomonas is a group of bacteria commonly found in the environment, like in soil and water. The most common type causing infections among humans is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa can cause infections in the blood, lungs, urinary tract, or other parts of the body after surgery. Antimicrobial resistance Some types are resistant to nearly all antibiotics, including carbapenems, known as multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. In 2017, MDR P. aeruginosa caused an estimated 32, 600 infections among hospitalized patients and 2, 700 estimated deaths in the United States.

At-risk populations Patients in healthcare settings are at highest risk, especially those who:

- Are on breathing machines.
- Have devices such as catheters.
- Have open wounds from surgery or burns. How it spreads
- Contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment.
- Exposure in the soil or water.
- Person-to-person contact, like from contaminated hands. Reducing risk Patients and caregivers
- Keep their hands clean, particularly before and after caring for wounds or touching a medical device.
- Remind people to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices.
- Allow healthcare staff to clean their room daily when in a healthcare setting. Healthcare settings
- Always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
- Have water management plans in place. Testing To determine if someone has a P.

aeruginosa infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. CDC provides data that can be used for setting breakpoints for interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Treatment and recovery Treatment generally includes antibiotics. Unfortunately, treatment options are limited for MDR P. aeruginosa.

### Skin manifestations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections [^59884702]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen with considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable hosts. Skin manifestations are common, either representing local inoculation or secondary skin seeding following bloodstream infections. As patients with various predisposing conditions are expanding, we sought to review the most recent published evidence regarding epidemiology, risk factors and diagnosis of skin manifestations of P. aeruginosa.

Recent Findings

New data exist on epidemiology and diagnosis of skin infections; systemic infections are impacted by multidrug-resistance issues and host immune status.

Summary

Green nail syndrome, toe web infection, hot tub folliculitis, hot hand-foot infection and external otitis are the most common infections originating from the skin per se. Local treatments are the cornerstone and prognosis is favorable in immunocompetent hosts. Ecthyma gangrenosum and P. aeruginosa subcutaneous nodules are usually associated with bloodstream infections and occur primarily in immunocompromised hosts. Necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections occur in diabetic, alcoholic and immunocompromised patients; management requires a multidisciplinary team with surgical approach. Burn wound infections may also be challenging, requiring a specialized team. In all the four latter types of P. aeruginosa skin infections portending significant morbidity and mortality, systemic antibiotics are an integral part of the treatment.

### A new strategy for healthcare-associated pneumonia: a 2-year prospective multicenter cohort study using risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens to select initial empiric therapy [^b09f00f4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal empiric therapy for hospitalized patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is uncertain.

Methods

We prospectively applied a therapeutic algorithm, based on the presence of risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens in a multicenter cohort study of 445 pneumonia patients, including both community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; n = 124) and HCAP (n = 321).

Results

MDR pathogens were more common (15.3% vs 0.8%, P < .001) in HCAP patients than in CAP patients, including Staphylococcus aureus (11.5% vs 0.8%, P < .001); methicillin-resistant S. aureus (6.9% vs 0%, P = 0.003); Enterobacteriaceae (7.8% vs 2.4%, P = 0.037); and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9% vs 0.8%, P = 0.01). Using the proposed algorithm, HCAP patients with ≥ 2 MDR risk factors, one of which was severity of illness (n = 170), vs HCAP patients with 0–1 risk factor (n = 151) had a significantly higher frequency of MDR pathogens (27.1% vs 2%, P < .001). In total, 93.1% of HCAP patients were treated according to the therapy algorithm, with only 53% receiving broad-spectrum empiric therapy, yet 92.9% received appropriate therapy for the identified pathogen. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher for HCAP than for CAP (13.7% vs 5.6%, P = 0.017), but among HCAP patients with 0–1 MDR risk factor, mortality was lower than with ≥ 2 MDR risk factors (8.6% vs 18.2%, P = 0.012). In multivariate analysis, initial treatment failure, but not inappropriate empiric antibiotic therapy, was a mortality risk factor (odds ratio, 72.0).

Conclusions

Basing empiric HCAP therapy on its severity and the presence of risk factors for MDR pathogens is a potentially useful approach that achieves good outcomes without excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^2ad13ca5]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Infections and immune-related factors relevant to COPD include that a history of severe childhood respiratory infections has been associated with reduced lung function and increased respiratory symptoms in adulthood, and a national cohort documented a synergistic interaction between smoking and infant respiratory infections as well as early life home overcrowding with lung function at age 43. Chronic bronchial infection, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been associated with accelerated FEV1 decline. Tuberculosis (TB) is a risk factor for COPD with 23 studies reporting a pooled odds ratio 2.59 (95% CI 2.12,3.15), and the pooled prevalence of COPD in patients with prior pulmonary TB was 21% (95% CI: 16–25%); TB is both a differential diagnosis for COPD and a potential comorbidity. HIV patients are at increased risk of COPD compared to HIV negative controls across 11 studies with a pooled odds ratio for 1.14 (95% CI 1.05,1.25), and IgG subclass deficiency in hospitalized patients with COPD was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric therapy — antipseudomonal strategy and agents to avoid: We suggest prescribing 2 antipseudomonal antibiotics from different classes for the empiric treatment of suspected VAP only in patients with any of the following: a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance (Table 2), patients in units where > 10% of gram-negative isolates are resistant to an agent being considered for monotherapy, and patients in an ICU where local antimicrobial susceptibility rates are not available (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest prescribing one antibiotic active against P. aeruginosa for the empiric treatment of suspected VAP in patients without risk factors for antimicrobial resistance who are being treated in ICUs where < 10% of gram-negative isolates are resistant to the agent being considered for monotherapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In patients with suspected VAP, we suggest avoiding aminoglycosides if alternative agents with adequate gram-negative activity are available (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and we suggest avoiding colistin if alternative agents with adequate gram-negative activity are available (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). If patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended.

Besides, we did separate analysis of patients with staghorn stone in comparison with non-staghorn stone, and we found the results were almost the same. However, there are two differences.

The first difference is that age does not have a statistically significant relationship to UTI in staghorn stone group (P = 0.2150), however, age does have a statistically significant relationship to UTI in non-staghorn stone group (P = 0.0215). (see Tables 4 and 5). We guess the reason may be that the number of patients with staghorn stone is a little small.

The second difference is that the first three gram-negative bacteria in staghorn stone are Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the first three gram-negative bacteria in non-staghorn stone are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. (see Tables 6 and 7).

### Community-acquired pneumonia due to multidrug-and non-multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^9a4452ea]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not a frequent pathogen in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, in patients with severe CAP, P aeruginosa can be the etiology in 1.8% to 8.3% of patients, with a case-fatality rate of 50% to 100%. We describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors associated with CAP resulting from multidrug-resistant (MDR) and non-MDR P aeruginosa.

Methods

Prospective observational study of 2,023 consecutive adult patients with CAP with definitive etiology.

Results

P aeruginosa was found in 77 (4%) of the 2,023 cases with microbial etiology. In 22 (32%) of the 68 cases of P aeruginosa with antibiogram data, the isolates were MDR. Inappropriate therapy was present in 49 (64%) cases of P aeruginosa CAP, including 17/22 (77%) cases of MDR P aeruginosa CAP. Male sex, chronic respiratory disease, C-reactive protein < 12.35 mg/dL, and pneumonia severity index risk class IV to V were independently associated with P aeruginosa CAP. Prior antibiotic treatment was more frequent in MDR P aeruginosa CAP compared with non-MDR P aeruginosa (58% vs 29%, P = 0.029), and was the only risk factor associated with CAP resulting from MDR P aeruginosa. In the multivariate analysis, age ≥ 65 years, CAP resulting from P aeruginosa, chronic liver disease, neurologic disease, nursing home, criteria of ARDS, acute renal failure, ICU admission, and inappropriate empiric treatment were the factors associated with 30-day mortality.

Conclusions

P aeruginosa is an individual risk factor associated with mortality in CAP. The risk factors described can help clinicians to suspect P aeruginosa and MDR P aeruginosa.

### Aspiration pneumonia in older adults [^c984b17f]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspiration pneumonia refers to an infection of the lung parenchyma in an individual that has inhaled a bolus of endogenous flora that overwhelms the natural defenses of the respiratory system. While there are not universally agreed upon criteria, the diagnosis can be made in patients with the appropriate risk factors and clinical scenario, in addition to a radiographic or an ultrasonographic image of pneumonia in the typical dependent lung segment. Treatment options for aspiration pneumonia vary based on the site of acquisition (community-acquired aspiration pneumonia [CAAP] versus healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia [HCAAP]), the risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, and severity of illness. Hospitalized CAAP patients without severe illness and with no risk for MDR organisms or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) can be treated with standard inpatient community-acquired pneumonia therapy covering anaerobes. Patients with CAAP and either of the following-risk factors for MDR pathogens, septic shock, need for an intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or mechanical ventilation-can be considered for broader coverage against anaerobes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and PA. Severe aspiration pneumonia that originates in a long-term care facility or HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms should be considered for similar treatment. HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms or PA, plus septic shock, need for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation should receive double coverage for PA in addition to coverage for MRSA and anaerobes. Multiple gaps in current understanding and management of aspiration pneumonia require future research, with a particular focus on antibiotic stewardship.

### Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and clinical implications [^fc78b3f0]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the commonest bacteria colonizing the airway in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization is associated with poor outcomes in patients with bronchiectasis, including rapid decline in lung function, exacerbation frequency and hospitalization.

Methods

A cross-sectional study in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong that included 350 Chinese patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis to investigate the risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization and clinical implications on disease outcomes.

Discussions

Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization was more commonly found in patients with longer duration of bronchiectasis and those on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) with adjusted ORs of 1.066 (95% CI = 1.036–1.096, p < 0.001) and 2.815 (95% CI = 1.307–6.064, p = 0.008) respectively. Patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization have more extensive lung involvement and higher risks of exacerbation requiring hospitalization with adjusted ORs of 2.445 (95% CI = 1.283–4.657, p = 0.007) and 2.745 (95% CI = 1.012–7.449, p = 0.047) respectively. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization is more common among patients with longer duration of bronchiectasis and those on PPI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization is associated with more extensive lung involvement and higher risks of exacerbation requiring hospitalization.

### A screening tool to identify risk for bronchiectasis progression in children with cystic fibrosis [^6f38fcb3]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

In our analysis, due to the low prevalence of pseudomonas in the first 3 years of life pseudomonas infections were considered in the total number of proinflammatory pathogens from BAL and not included as a separate variable. Our data show that in this very young age group, the presence of proinflammatory pathogens (not uniquely pseudomonas), contribute to the development of lung damage, as has also been recently reported. This suggests that early proinflammatory infections should be a target for early intervention.

Our data also support the relevance of recurrent pulmonary exacerbations as a predictor of worse lung disease and suggest that even in infancy the need for IV treatment is associated with worse structural lung damage at least up to 5–6 years of age.

As expected, we found CT bronchiectasis score at 3 years to be highly predictive of bronchiectasis at the age of 5–6 years. We also show that air trapping CT score at 3 years is predictive of later bronchiectasis, independent of concomitant CT bronchiectasis score, supporting the hypothesis that air trapping is an early consequence of inflammation and obstruction of the smaller airways, eventually leading to irreversible structural lung damage. The association between structural lung damage at 3 years and structural disease at 5 or 6 years is obvious. However, our data show that markers of both inflammation and infection outweigh the effect size of early structural lung disease on predicted bronchiectasis at 5‐6 years. On the basis of our model, a child with pancreatic insufficiency, high BAL neutrophils, and recurrent infections (positive BAL cultures and recurrent IV courses) is expected to have twice as much progression until the age of 5–6, regardless of pre‐existing structural abnormalities on CT scan. This implies that an effective intervention in a selected group of high‐risk patients could be used to improve lung disease outcomes regardless of the presence or absence of early structural abnormalities at baseline.

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa community-acquired pneumonia in previously healthy adults: case report and review of the literature [^60f2a62c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

We report a case of rapidly fatal Pseudomonas aeruginosa community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a previously healthy 67-year-old woman. Eleven published case reports of P. aeruginosa CAP in previously healthy adults are reviewed. According to our review, the mean age of affected patients is 45.3 years. Five patients described in the literature were smokers with a mean smoking history of 40 pack-years. The clinical presentation is nonspecific, and although the pneumonia can be rapidly fatal, only 33% of the patients who were reported died. However, mortality may be independent of treatment within the first 36 hours of presentation. Exposure to aerosols of contaminated water is a risk factor for P. aeruginosa CAP in this population. Pseudomonas CAP should be considered in the differential diagnosis for anyone with a smoking history who presents with rapidly progressive pneumonia. We discuss treatment recommendations that are based on evidence in the currently available literature on the subject.

### Advances in the management of pneumonia in the intensive care unit: review of current thinking [^a83b0d6f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Interventions to prevent pneumonia in the intensive care unit should combine multiple measures targeting the invasive devices, microorganisms and protection of the patient. Microbiological investigation is useful for evaluating the quality of the respiratory sample, and permits early modification of the regimen in light of the microbiological findings. Once pneumonia develops, the appropriateness of the initial antibiotic regimen is a vital determinant of outcome. Three questions should be formulated: (1) is the patient at risk of acquiring methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, (2) is Acinetobacter baumannii a problem in the institution, and (3) is the patient at risk of acquiring Pseudomonas aeruginosa? Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately and must circumvent any pathogen resistance mechanisms developed after previous antibiotic exposure. Therefore, antibiotic choice should be institution-specific and patient-oriented.

### A protein subunit vaccine elicits a balanced immune response that protects against Pseudomonas pulmonary infection [^5ccc69bf]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), is a significant cause of nosocomial infections in health care settings. Immunocompromised individuals, burn victims, cystic fibrosis patients, and cancer patients are at a further elevated risk of infection by Pa. A wide range of virulence factors are used by this opportunistic pathogen to initiate infection and subsequently adapt to its environment leading to chronic biofilm formation and acquisition of drug-resistance. Recent reports have also acknowledged a significant increase in the identification of Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) Pa strains and Extremely Drug Resistant (XDR) Pa strains. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated attributable healthcare costs of $757 M with nearly 32,600 cases of MDR Pa infection in 2017. Furthermore, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pa is a common occurrence in 3–5% of adults ventilated for more than 2 days. Likewise, Pa infection was the most common infection in military troops in 2016. Although certain diseases and occupational health hazards increase the risking for Pa infection, aging is the most common factor responsible for a lethal Pa infection.

### Risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and clinical implications [^e9669963]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization is more common among patients with longer duration of bronchiectasis and those on PPI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization is associated with more extensive lung involvement and higher risks of exacerbation requiring hospitalization, despite more intense regular treatment for bronchiectasis.

### Epidemiology of microbial keratitis at a tertiary care hospital in Southern Thailand [^bd4ff05b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to ascertain the microbial profiles and predisposing risk factors for microbial keratitis and to analyze the trend of mixed microbial infection cases over 8 years.

Patients and Methods

In this retrospective analysis, we reviewed the electronic medical records of inpatients diagnosed with microbial keratitis between January 2012 and December 2019. Data on demographics, risk factors, and causative pathogens were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to identify risk factors associated with pathogens.

Results

This study included 640 eyes of 638 patients. Trauma was the most common predisposing risk factor (57.2%), followed by a combination of factors (14.4%). Among diagnostic test results, bacteria, fungi, and mixed pathogens were identified in 46.72%, 46.56%, and 21.41% of cases, respectively. Positive culture results were obtained in 324 eyes (53.6%), with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.1%) and Fusarium spp. (17.4%) being the most prevalent pathogens. In the multivariate logistic regression model, contact lens use, presence of diabetes mellitus, and HIV infection were statistically significant risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (p = 0.001, p = 0.046, and p = 0.04, respectively). Trauma was associated with Fusarium spp. infection (p = 0.001). An increase in the percentage of mixed microbial infection cases was observed when comparing the periods of 2016–2019 with 2012–2015 (p = 0.023).

Conclusion

Bacteria and fungi are equally common causes of microbial keratitis, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Fusarium spp. being the predominant pathogens causing bacterial and fungal infections. Trauma is the primary predisposing risk factor for microbial keratitis. There was a notable increase in mixed infection cases over the study period.

### Airway Pseudomonas aeruginosa density in mechanically ventilated patients: clinical impact and relation to therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics [^5be52a79]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Airway PA density was associated with the clinical course and therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics used for patients on MV. The strict control of risk factors for high-PA identified in this study and the use of targeted antibiotic therapy for patients with VAT, particularly when high densities of PA are detected, may be useful to prevent ineffective antibiotic therapy and reduce antibiotic use. Further randomized controlled studies comparing aggressive risk factor modification with usual care, or antibiotics with placebo are required to confirm these findings.

Endogenous endophthalmitis — definition, risk factors, causative agents, and diagnostics are noted: it is the result of hematogenous seeding of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites; risk factors include indwelling venous catheters, immunosuppression, intravenous drug use, diabetes, and a history of disseminated infection; causative agents mirror bloodstream infections, including Candida albicans and related yeasts, endemic fungi, S. aureus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacterales, and mycobacteria including M. tuberculosis; symptoms and signs should be evaluated for current or prior systemic infection, and although prior systemic infection increases the likelihood of the same organism, definitive identification necessitates culture, molecular, or serologic analysis of vitreous fluid.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric therapy — antipseudomonal selection and avoidance guidance: For patients without risk factors for antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units (ICUs) where ≤ 10% of gram-negative isolates are resistant to the agent considered for monotherapy, we suggest prescribing one antibiotic active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In suspected VAP, we suggest avoiding aminoglycosides if alternative gram-negative agents are available (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence) and we suggest avoiding colistin if alternatives with adequate gram-negative activity are available (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). The panel selected a 10%–20% threshold for deciding whether to target methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a 10% threshold for choosing 1 vs 2 antipseudomonal agents with the goal to assure that ≥ 95% of patient receive active empiric therapy; individual ICUs may modify these thresholds, and if the patient has structural lung disease increasing risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended.

### Risk factors for nosocomial infection and mortality in burn patients: 10 years of experience at a university hospital [^6a5f792a]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

To evaluate the risk factors for nosocomial infection (NI) and mortality in a university hospital, 10-year data of burn patients were assessed retrospectively. The study was conducted at Erciyes University's Burn Center during 2000 and 2009. The records of 1190 patients were obtained. Overall, 131 (11%) patients had 206 NIs with an incidence density of 14.7 infections/1000 patient days. Burn wound infection (n = 109, 53%) was the most common NI. High (%TBSA burned) and late excision were found to be the most significant risk factors for the development of NI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent causative microorganism. However, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has increased in recent years with a prevalence of 47% in 2009. The carbapenem resistance of P. aeruginosa has decreased in recent years, whereas that of A. baumannii increased and it had a prevalence of 94% in the last year. Conversely, the most important risk factors for mortality were advanced age, high %TBSA and having an underlying disease. Prevention of NI is an important issue in burn units to reduce mortality rates. Early excision and wound closure are important therapeutic approaches for the prevention of burn wound infection.

### Risk factors for pneumonia in the intubated patient [^53262922]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The information gathered here helps to explain why risk factors in the development of VAP vary from series to series. It also explains why different investigators have found opposite effects when evaluating the antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy has a bimodal effect in the development of VAP. Antibiotics protect against pneumonia development within the first days of MV, especially against types caused by endogenous flora, but they are responsible for selection of a set of resistant pathogens that are associated with significant attributable mortality, such as P aeruginosa and MRSA. These observations suggest that risk factors vary depending on the exposure to risk (ie, length of stay or MV). This variable should be considered when stratifying patients for risk factor analysis and also in the design of clinical trials for VAP prophylaxis.

Sputum Gram stain and culture in CAP — We recommend obtaining sputum for Gram stain and culture in situations when risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa are present, both when initial empiric therapy is expanded to cover these pathogens and when it is not expanded, and patients who have severe CAP requiring intubation should have lower respiratory tract samples, such as endotracheal aspirates, sent for Gram stain and culture promptly after intubation. The most consistently strong risk factor to consider is prior infection with either MRSA or P. aeruginosa, and hospitalization and treatment with parenteral antibiotics in the last 90 days is associated with an increased risk of these pathogens, and so we recommend sputum culture in this situation.
