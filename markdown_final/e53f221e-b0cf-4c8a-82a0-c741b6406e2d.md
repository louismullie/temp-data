## Question

Examples of inhaled corticosteroids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for examples of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and how to contextualize them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which ICS molecules are consistently cited across the literature. Then, I should verify which agents are most commonly used and which are more historical or less emphasized. Next, I will consider pharmacologic and device-related factors that influence selection. Finally, I should align the examples with contemporary guideline usage patterns to ensure clinical relevance and accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the core ICS molecules that repeatedly appear in comparative pharmacology and clinical reviews; the agents most consistently referenced include beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, fluticasone furoate, mometasone furoate, ciclesonide, and triamcinolone acetonide, with flunisolide also appearing in some comparative discussions, so these should anchor the list of examples [^111qAC7M] [^113WyrJe] [^113T3HQ2].

> Wait, let me verify the relative prominence of each agent in contemporary practice and guidelines. Fluticasone propionate and fluticasone furoate are frequently used in modern combination inhalers and are emphasized in recent effectiveness literature, budesonide remains widely used and is notable for nebulized pediatric formulations and SMART/MART strategies, beclomethasone dipropionate remains a foundational ICS with long-standing clinical experience, mometasone and ciclesonide are often highlighted for favorable pharmacokinetics and once-daily potential, whereas triamcinolone and flunisolide are less commonly emphasized in current-era guidance and are more historical in many formularies [^111BYoGs] [^113Waoay] [^113T3HQ2].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacologic distinctions that matter clinically. Budesonide's airway esterification prolongs local residence and may enhance therapeutic index, ciclesonide is a prodrug activated in the lung with minimal oral bioavailability, and fluticasone agents have high receptor affinity with extensive first-pass metabolism, all of which can influence potency, systemic exposure, and dosing frequency, though equipotent clinical dosing may still yield similar outcomes across molecules when properly matched [^111qAC7M] [^111RBQ9i] [^117VdEg6].

> I need to ensure device and formulation context is not overlooked. Budesonide is available as a nebulized suspension and in DPIs, which supports pediatric use and certain reliever strategies, fluticasone propionate and furoate are commonly paired with LABAs in DPI or pMDI combinations, and ciclesonide and mometasone are often positioned for once-daily regimens, while device selection and technique materially affect lung deposition and clinical effectiveness, reinforcing that molecule choice must be integrated with device suitability and patient capability [^113T3HQ2] [^11165Bpn] [^113QQF5C].

> Let me consider how guidelines frame ICS use so I don't overstate any single agent. GINA positions ICS-containing therapy as foundational across age groups, with low-dose ICS often sufficient and escalation tailored to control and risk, while BTS/NICE/SIGN endorse as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol for mild asthma and structured MART approaches, and GOLD restricts ICS in COPD to patients with frequent exacerbations or elevated eosinophils due to pneumonia risk, underscoring that the same molecules are used differently by indication and phenotype [^111m7ANZ] [^113Waoay] [^116YUKKk].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include a table of "equipotent doses" across ICS to standardize examples, but I should double-check that impulse. GINA explicitly warns that dose-category tables do not imply potency equivalence across different ICS, so any attempt to equate "medium" doses across molecules risks misdosing, and I should instead emphasize that dose adjustments should follow product-specific labeling and clinical response rather than cross-molecule dose tables [^113buLnB].

> Putting this together, the clinically representative examples of inhaled corticosteroids, with context for modern use, include beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, fluticasone furoate, mometasone furoate, and ciclesonide, with triamcinolone acetonide and flunisolide as additional agents that appear in the literature but are less central in current practice. Selection among these should integrate molecule pharmacology, device/formulation, patient age and phenotype, and guideline-directed indications to optimize efficacy and safety [^111qAC7M] [^113WyrJe] [^111m7ANZ] [^113Waoay].

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the cornerstone of asthma therapy and are used selectively in COPD [^111m7ANZ] [^116YUKKk]. The main ICS agents are **beclomethasone dipropionate**, **budesonide**, **fluticasone propionate**, **fluticasone furoate**, **mometasone furoate**, and **ciclesonide** [^111qAC7M] [^113WyrJe]. These agents reduce airway inflammation, improve lung function, and lower exacerbation risk; however, they can cause local effects (dysphonia, oral candidiasis) and, at high doses, systemic effects (adrenal suppression, osteoporosis) [^112ptBcq] [^115wqr3E] [^115Fv8K4]. Dosing is individualized to the lowest effective dose, with device selection and technique critical to minimize adverse effects [^114Fb7SW] [^111CTPna].

## Clinical indications

ICS are indicated for **asthma** — as first-line controller therapy for persistent asthma in adults and children [^1144behQ] — and for **COPD** [^113JXYmd], where they are reserved for patients with frequent exacerbations or high eosinophil counts, given the increased pneumonia risk [^116YUKKk].

---

## Mechanism of action

ICS exert their effects through **genomic and non-genomic pathways**: genomic effects include transrepression of pro-inflammatory genes and transactivation of anti-inflammatory genes, while non-genomic effects involve rapid modulation of signaling pathways [^notfound].

---

## Clinical efficacy

ICS improve lung function, reduce symptoms, and lower exacerbation risk in asthma [^112ptBcq]; in COPD, they reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life but do not slow FEV1 decline [^115wqr3E].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Local effects**: Dysphonia, oral candidiasis, throat irritation [^115wqr3E].
- **Systemic effects**: Adrenal suppression, osteoporosis, cataracts, growth suppression in children at high doses [^115Fv8K4] [^115Cyffd].
- **Pneumonia risk**: Increased in COPD patients on ICS [^116YUKKk].

---

## Dosing and administration

Dosing is individualized to the lowest effective dose; **categories (low, medium, high)** vary by agent and age [^113buLnB]. Device selection and technique are critical to optimize deposition and minimize adverse effects [^111qAC7M].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Budesonide is preferred (Category B) [^113T3HQ2].
- **Children**: Growth monitoring is essential; fluticasone may have less growth impact than beclomethasone or budesonide [^115Cyffd].
- **COPD**: Use cautiously; consider withdrawal if no benefit or high pneumonia risk [^113T4ogD].

---

Inhaled corticosteroids are essential for asthma control and are used selectively in COPD; **individualized dosing, device selection, and monitoring** optimize outcomes and minimize adverse effects [^111m7ANZ] [^113JXYmd].

Lastly, we provide a practical guide to appropriate ICS prescribing, to help primary care providers identify those patients for whom the benefits of ICS are likely to outweigh the risks. In doing so, we hope to enable and encourage evidence-based use of ICS in COPD.

The 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group (NAEPP [2020 Focused Asthma Update]) guidelines and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2021 strategy report are compared in this Rostrum article. The methodologies of each publication are described. Subsequently, 4 different selected pharmacological recommendations are compared in the 2 documents: step 1 for children 0 to 4 years of age with viral-induced wheezing, step 2 in ages 12 years and older with the intermittent use of inhaled corticosteroid, steps 3 and 4 with single-inhaler maintenance and reliever therapy with inhaled corticosteroids-formoterol (SMART), and steps 3, 4, and 5 with add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonist therapy. Nonpharmacological recommendations are also considered and contrasted, including for exhaled nitric oxide, environmental control, immunotherapy, and bronchial thermoplasty. Similarities and differences in these 2 documents are highlighted, and recommendations are made about harmonizing the approaches where possible.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in obstructive airway disease [^114pHVQC]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids play an important role in the management of obstructive airway disease, by suppressing airway inflammation that is central to the pathophysiology of these conditions. In asthma there is strong clinical evidence supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids in mild, moderate, and severe persistent asthma to improve lung function, reduce exacerbations, and prevent death. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inhaled corticosteroids improve symptoms, reduce frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations, and should be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation who have persistent symptoms despite optimal bronchodilator therapy. Though the adverse effects of corticosteroids are less when given via inhalation than when given systemically, nevertheless, the adverse effects are important and need to be considered. Newer inhaled corticosteroids with better pharmacologic properties are being developed and will probably be available in the near future.

### Adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroid therapy… [^115Fv8K4]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids is currently considered first-line anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with asthma. Even though adverse effects are not commonly associated with inhaled corticosteroids, the trend toward higher dosing has led to a greater awareness of possible dose-related systemic adverse effects. The comparative risks and benefits of newer and older agents continue to be debated, with the realization that long-acting beta. Marked adrenal suppression occurs with dosages of inhaled corticosteroids greater than 1. 5 mg per day, although there is a significant degree of interindividual susceptibility. Meta-analysis of 21 studies of urinary cortisol levels and 13 studies of suppression of 8 a. m. plasma cortisol levels revealed that fluticasone demonstrated significantly steeper dose-related systemic bioactivity than beclomethasone, budesonide or triamcinolone. The effects were most apparent at dosages above 0.

8 mg per day, because of the differences in slope gradients between fluticasone and the other drugs. One concern associated with the long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids is the potential adverse effects on bone metabolism, particularly osteoporosis and fracture. Inhaled corticosteroids have been shown to be associated with dose-related effects on biochemical bone markers that occur less frequently than with oral corticosteroids. Bone markers should not be used as a surrogate for bone density to predict risk of development of osteoporosis. Decreases in bone density have been associated with long-term daily corticosteroid therapy. Supplemental estrogen may have a protective effect against osteoporosis. Supplemental estrogen should be recommended for use in postmenopausal women with asthma, as it guards against bone loss. Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids appears to affect the eyes and the skin.

The risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts is increased, and a small but significant risk for ocular hypertension and open-angle glaucoma is associated with regular use of high-dose corticosteroids. There is also evidence of a dose-response effect of inhaled corticosteroids on bruising and thinning of the skin, especially in older women. The author concludes that fluticasone propionate exhibits greater dose-related adrenal suppression than other available inhaled corticosteroids, particularly at dosages above 0. 8 mg per day. Because the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids vary by individual, it is difficult to predict whether systemic effects will develop in a patient at a given dosage. Therefore, patients on long-term inhaled corticosteroid therapy should undergo regular examinations.

### Initial corticosteroid therapy for asthma [^116QL7X4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the commencement of maintenance pharmacotherapy for asthma: inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with long-acting beta2 agonists.

Recent Findings

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials has examined the starting dose of inhaled corticosteroids (high, moderate, low) and the dose regimen (step down versus constant) in asthma. There was no significant difference in key asthma outcomes for step down compared with a constant inhaled corticosteroid dose. There was no significant difference between high or moderate dose inhaled corticosteroid groups (n = 11) for morning peak expiratory flow, symptoms and rescue medication use. There may be a benefit from high-dose inhaled corticosteroids for airway hyperresponsiveness. There was a significant improvement in peak expiratory flow and nocturnal symptoms in favour of a moderate inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with low-dose treatment. Long-acting beta2 agonists combined with inhaled corticosteroids as initial asthma therapy has been examined in a systematic review of nine randomized controlled trials. Inhaled corticosteroids combined with long-acting beta2 agonists led to significant improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 s, morning peak expiratory flow, symptom score and symptom-free days but no difference in exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids. A randomized controlled trial of patients with uncontrolled asthma found a benefit of escalating doses of salmeterol/fluticasone compared with fluticasone on asthma control.

Summary

Initial inhaled corticosteroid therapy should begin with a constant, moderate dose. Initial therapy with long-acting beta2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids achieves superior improvement in symptoms and lung function, and at a quicker rate than inhaled corticosteroids alone. There is no benefit in terms of reduced exacerbations unless an escalating inhaled corticosteroid dose strategy is used.

### Effect of corticosteroids on exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116YxUPz]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Periodic exacerbations of disease severity, which may lead to hospitalization, are a characteristic feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), becoming more prevalent as disease severity increases. Oral corticosteroids increase the rate of resolution of these episodes in both diseases. Inhaled corticosteroids are much less effective at conventional doses and are not recommended as a primary treatment for exacerbations of either disease. Maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids significantly reduces the chance that a further exacerbation will occur in asthma. In general, increasing doses of inhaled corticosteroids are more effective than placebo therapy in preventing exacerbations, at least until patients become persistently symptomatic and regular users of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Thereafter, the gains from doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy are modest and generally inferior to those that result from adding other antiinflammatory or bronchodilator agents to the treatment regime. The reduction in the incidence of exacerbations with inhaled corticosteroids, compared with placebo, ranges from 15 to 20% in COPD versus almost 50% in severe asthma. However, given the impact of exacerbations on overall quality of life in COPD, even this modest reduction is likely to be clinically important.

### Inhaled corticosteroid treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): boon or bane? [^11396TKY]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-based therapy is often used for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, this approach is under scrutiny because of ICS overuse in patients for whom it is not recommended and because of concerns about adverse events, particularly pneumonia, with long-term ICS use. Evidence suggests ICS may be beneficial in specific patients, namely, those with high blood eosinophil counts (eg, ≥ 300 cells/µL) or who are at a high risk of exacerbations. According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2020 ABCD assessment tool, these patients belong in group D. For these patients, recommended initial treatment includes ICS in combination with long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) when blood eosinophil counts are ≥ 300 cells/µL or LABA + long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) when patients are highly symptomatic, that is, with greater dyspnea and/or exercise limitation. Follow-up treatments for patients with persistent dyspnea and/or exacerbations may include LABA + ICS, LABA + LAMA, or LABA + LAMA + ICS, with use of ICS being guided by blood eosinophil counts. In this review, differences in the inflammatory mechanism underlying COPD and asthma and the role of ICS treatment in COPD are summarized. Furthermore, findings from recent clinical trials where use of ICS-based dual or triple therapy in COPD was compared with LABA + LAMA therapy and trials in which ICS withdrawal was evaluated in patients with COPD are reviewed. Finally, a step-by-step guide for ICS withdrawal in patients who are unlikely to benefit from this treatment is proposed.

### Can inhaled corticosteroids prevent asthma exacerbations? [^112xBPT5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

asthma exacerbations occur unpredictably, are a cause of morbidity and mortality, and contribute significantly to increased healthcare costs. Inhaled corticosteroids reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life.

Recent Findings

the aetiopathology of asthma exacerbations is heterogeneous. Attempts to phenotype the heterogeneity of the pattern of airway inflammation by noninvasive monitoring of airway inflammation has identified a subgroup of patients with eosinophilic inflammation who are most likely to respond to steroid therapy. Strategies directed to normalize eosinophilic airway inflammation with corticosteroids have consistently led to a marked reduction in exacerbations. In contrast, their role in modulating the natural history of disease is less certain.

Summary

in the near future, improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms of exacerbations may identify therapeutic targets. While we await these developments, inhaled corticosteroids remain the first choice anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma.

### Inhaled corticosteroids should be initiated before discharge from the emergency department in patients with persistent asthma [^114QQrr4]. The Journal of Asthma (2009). Low credibility.

National and International Guidelines concur that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the preferred long-term maintenance drug therapy for mild persistent asthma for all ages. For moderate and severe persistent asthma, ICS are essential to optimal management, often concurrent with other key therapies. Despite strong evidence and consensus guidelines, ICS are still underused. While some patients who are treated in the emergency department (ED) have intermittent asthma, most have persistent asthma and need ICS for optimum outcomes. Failure to initiate ICS at this critical juncture often results in subsequent lack of ICS therapy. Along with a short course of oral corticosteroids, ICS should be initiated before discharge from the ED in patients with persistent asthma. Although the NIH/NAEPP Expert Panel Report 3 suggests considering the prescription of ICS on discharge from the ED, The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2008 guidelines recommend initiation or continuation of ICS before patients are discharged from the ED. The initiation of ICS therapy by ED physicians is also encouraged in the emergency medicine literature over the past decade. Misdiagnosis of intermittent asthma is common; therefore, ICS therapy should be considered for ED patients with this diagnosis with reassessment in follow-up office visits. To help ensure adherence to ICS therapy, patient education regarding both airway inflammation (show airway models/colored pictures) and the strong evidence of efficacy is vital. Teaching ICS inhaler technique, environmental control, and giving a written action plan are essential. Lack of initiation of ICS with appropriate patient education before discharge from the ED in patients with persistent asthma is common but unfortunately associated with continued poor patient outcomes.

### Relative receptor affinity comparisons among inhaled / intranasal corticosteroids: perspectives on clinical relevance [^113WyrJe]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids, such as beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, ciclesonide, mometasone furoate (MF), fluticasone propionate (FP), and fluticasone furoate (FF) are first-line treatments for upper respiratory allergic conditions such as asthma and seasonal/perennial rhinitis, as they provide local efficacy and, thereby, reduce systemic glucocorticoid exposure. In recent literature, comparative relative receptor affinity (RRA) values for glucocorticoid receptors in nasal/lung tissue are increasingly used to differentiate among topical corticosteroids. In many instances, the presentation of RRA data and rank ordering of compounds is accompanied by overt or subtle implications of clinical efficacy ramifications. While RRA has a rightful place in the comparison of in vitro potency of corticosteroids, practicing clinicians need to understand the limitations of such data when they are used as arguments for the clinical efficacy of a given glucocorticoid.

### Interventions to improve adherence to inhaled steroids for asthma [^1166zNBb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Despite its proven efficacy in improving symptoms and reducing exacerbations, many patients with asthma are not fully adherent to their steroid inhaler. Suboptimal adherence leads to poorer clinical outcomes and increased health service utilisation, and has been identified as a contributing factor to a third of asthma deaths in the UK. Reasons for non-adherence vary, and a variety of interventions have been proposed to help people improve treatment adherence.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions intended to improve adherence to inhaled corticosteroids among people with asthma.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted the most recent searches on 18 November 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cluster randomised controlled trials of any duration conducted in any setting. We included studies reported as full-text articles, those published as abstracts only and unpublished data. We included trials of adults and children with asthma and a current prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (as monotherapy or in combination with a long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA)). Eligible trials compared an intervention primarily aimed at improving adherence to ICS versus usual care or an alternative intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the searches, extracted study characteristics and outcome data from included studies and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were adherence to ICS, exacerbations requiring at least oral corticosteroids and asthma control. We graded results and presented evidence in 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios, and continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences, all using a random-effects model. We described skewed data narratively. We made no a priori assumptions about how trials would be categorised but conducted meta-analyses only if treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense.

Main Results

We included 39 parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults and children with asthma, 28 of which (n = 16,303) contributed data to at least one meta-analysis. Follow-up ranged from two months to two years (median six months), and trials were conducted mainly in high-income countries. Most studies reported some measure of adherence to ICS and a variety of other outcomes such as quality of life and asthma control. Studies generally were at low or unclear risk of selection bias and at high risk of biases associated with blinding. We considered around half the studies to be at high risk for attrition bias and selective outcome reporting. We classified studies into four comparisons: adherence education versus control (20 studies); electronic trackers or reminders versus control (11 studies); simplified drug regimens versus usual drug regimens (four studies); and school-based directly observed therapy (three studies). Two studies are described separately. All pooled results for adherence education, electronic trackers or reminders and simplified regimens showed better adherence than controls. Analyses limited to studies using objective measures revealed that adherence education showed a benefit of 20 percentage points over control (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.52 to 32.74; five studies; low-quality evidence); electronic trackers or reminders led to better adherence of 19 percentage points (95% CI 14.47 to 25.26; six studies; moderate-quality evidence); and simplified regimens led to better adherence of 4 percentage points (95% CI 1.88 to 6.16; three studies; moderate-quality evidence). Our confidence in the evidence was reduced by risk of bias and inconsistency. Improvements in adherence were not consistently translated into observable benefit for clinical outcomes in our pooled analyses. None of the intervention types showed clear benefit for our primary clinical outcomes - exacerbations requiring an oral corticosteroid (OCS) (evidence of very low to low quality) and asthma control (evidence of low to moderate quality); nor for our secondary outcomes - unscheduled visits (evidence of very low to moderate quality) and quality of life (evidence of low to moderate quality). However, some individual studies reported observed benefits for OCS and use of healthcare services. Most school or work absence data were skewed and were difficult to interpret (evidence of low quality, when graded), and most studies did not specifically measure or report adverse events. Studies investigating the possible benefit of administering ICS at school did not measure adherence, exacerbations requiring OCS, asthma control or adverse events. One study showed fewer unscheduled visits, and another found no differences; data could not be combined.

Authors' Conclusions

Pooled results suggest that a variety of interventions can improve adherence. The clinical relevance of this improvement, highlighted by uncertain and inconsistent impact on clinical outcomes such as quality of life and asthma control, is less clear. We have low to moderate confidence in these findings owing to concerns about risk of bias and inconsistency. Future studies would benefit from predefining an evidence-based 'cut-off' for acceptable adherence and using objective adherence measures and validated tools and questionnaires. When possible, covert monitoring and some form of blinding or active control may help disentangle effects of the intervention from effects of inclusion in an adherence trial.

### Asthma treatment in the 21st century: what's next? [^113RNHYo]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma treatment is evolving as we enter the 21st century. This review focuses on several different areas of asthma treatment now in evolution. These include: (1) the proper role of various asthma controllers — either already approved or under investigation — besides inhaled corticosteriods in asthma therapy; (2) the potential role for immune and cytokine modulation for asthma therapy; (3) the potential role for pharmacogenetics in asthma therapy; and (4) whether single-inhaler therapy with a combination of an inhaled corticosteriod and a long-acted beta-agonist could be used for both maintenance and rescue in patients with asthma.

check inhaler technique and adherence
check whether there is an environmental source of their symptoms (for example mould in the home, cold housing, smokers or indoor air pollution)
review whether an alternative diagnosis is likely. If none of these explain the failure to respond to treatment, refer the child to a. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1143Qyyd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pharmacotherapy — long-acting beta agonist/inhaled corticosteroid (LABA/ICS), long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and LABA/LAMA combinations: The LABA/ICS combination improves health-related quality of life and reduces the risk of a COPD exacerbation, reduces the rate of lung function decline when compared with placebo but not when compared with a LABA alone or ICS alone, may have a modest effect on overall mortality, and has an increased risk of pneumonia. The LABA/ICS combination is equivalent to a LAMA in exacerbation prevention, and adding a LAMA to LABA/ICS appears to reduce the rate of severe exacerbations and improve symptoms in patients with moderate or severe COPD. LABA/LAMA combinations appear to increase lung function to a greater degree than a LAMA alone, but their effect on the frequency of COPD exacerbations is less certain. Criteria for adding and withdrawing medications are uncertain; a trial suggested that withdrawal of ICS may not increase the risk of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations, there is an overall paucity of evidence about when COPD medications can be safely withdrawn, and tools are needed to facilitate objective assessment of medication effects. Adherence to inhaled medications has a significant impact on patient-centered outcomes, administrative database analysis suggests that less frequent dosing is a way to improve adherence, other strategies such as method of administration and behavioral approaches have not been confirmed due to insufficient study, a high proportion of patients have poor inhaler technique which appears to negatively affect outcomes, and choosing the right device, educating on inhaler technique, and regularly checking inhaler use are important components of COPD management.

### Balancing benefits and risks: Do inhaled corticosteroids modify the lung microbiome? [^116YUKKk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are common and powerful antiinflammatory medications. Because of their myriad effects on the immune system, they are capable of both facilitating infections and ameliorating their outcomes. In pulmonary medicine, chronic oral glucocorticoid therapy is a well-recognized risk factor for infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia. However, glucocorticoids also serve as adjunctive treatment for severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. The appropriate use of inhaled glucocorticoids in chronic inflammatory lung diseases is similarly complex. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the first line of therapy for asthma, for which they improve outcomes, but their use in COPD is much more complicated. Current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines recommend restricting ICS use to patients with a significant history of COPD exacerbations or peripheral eosinophilia because of the increased risk of pneumonia seen with these drugs in COPD. Thus, in COPD, we recognize that although glucocorticoids prevent and treat COPD exacerbations, they also increase the risk of pulmonary infection.

### Should you recommend inhaled corticosteroids for this patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113anPoX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 12 million adults in the United States receive a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) each year, and it is the fourth leading cause of death. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease refers to a group of diseases that cause airflow obstruction and a constellation of symptoms, including cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath. The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoke, but other environmental exposures also may contribute. The GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) 2020 Report aims to provide a nonbiased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with COPD. To date, no conclusive evidence exists that any existing medications for COPD modify mortality. The mainstay of treatment for COPD is inhaled bronchodilators, whereas the role of inhaled corticosteroids is less clear. Inhaled corticosteroids have substantial risks, including an increased risk for pneumonia. Here, 2 experts, both pulmonologists, reflect on the care of a woman with severe COPD, a 50-pack-year smoking history, frequent COPD exacerbations, and recurrent pneumonia. They consider the indications for inhaled corticosteroids in COPD, when inhaled corticosteroids should be withdrawn, and what other treatments are available.

### Increased versus stable dose of inhaled corticosteroids for asthma exacerbations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113qm9Eq]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is commonly used at early signs of loss of asthma control. However, the potential benefits and harms of this strategy remain unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare increased dose with stable dose of ICS among adults and children with asthma.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to August 02, 2018. Randomized clinical trials comparing increased doses vs stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations in adults or children were included.

Results

The analyses included 8 trials totalling 3866 patients. Four trials were judged as low risk of bias, three were unclear risk, and one was ranked as high risk. Increased dose of ICS was associated with a significantly reduced risk of treatment failure compared with stable dose (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70–0.97, I² = 6%; 314 (281 to 351) vs 358 events per 1000 patients; moderate-quality evidence). There was no significant difference in unscheduled physician visits or hospital admission between increased or stable dose of ICS. However, increased dose of ICS increased the risk of non-serious adverse events (OR 3.50, 95% CI 1.93–6.35, I² = 0%) but not serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Current evidence of moderate quality supports increasing the dose of ICS as part of a self-initiated action plan to reduce risk of requiring a course of systemic corticosteroids in people with an asthma exacerbation. However, we did not find evidence for an impact on hospital admissions or unscheduled physician visits, and increased ICS dose increased risk of non-serious adverse events.

### Can medicines development improve outcomes in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management by driving effectiveness? [^111BYoGs]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of treatment guidelines and inhaled medications for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), much remains to be done to lessen the burden of these respiratory diseases for patients. The challenge of selecting effective and efficacious drugs for patients is a key focus area for healthcare professionals. Here we discuss the concept of "drivers of effectiveness"- features of a medicine which may increase or decrease its effectiveness in the presence of real-world factors - and highlight the importance of considering these drivers in the early stages of drug development, and exploring their impact in carefully designed pragmatic trials. Using the Salford Lung Studies (SLS) in asthma and COPD as an illustrative example, we discuss various features of the inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β 2 -agonist combination, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI), as potential drivers of effectiveness that may have contributed to the improved patient outcomes observed with initiation of FF/VI versus continuation of usual care in the UK primary care setting.

### The dose-response of inhaled corticosteroids in combination inhaled corticosteroid / long acting beta-agonist maintenance therapy for asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113bGxRR]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

High doses of maintenance inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in asthma may achieve only modest additional clinical benefit beyond low-to-medium doses and are associated with an increased risk of adverse systemic effects. The ICS dose-response relationship when administered as maintenance combination ICS/long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA) therapy is uncertain.

Research Question

What is the ICS dose-response of maintenance ICS/LABA therapy?

Methods

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) allocating participants to > 1 ICS dose category, per Global Initiative for Asthma categorization, administered in combination ICS/LABA inhalers was conducted. Meta-analysis compared outcomes of high-dose (HD) and medium-dose (MD), HD and low-dose (LD), and MD and LD ICS/LABA. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with ≥ 1 severe asthma exacerbation; secondary outcomes were patient reported outcome measures of asthma control, spirometry and serious adverse events. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations domains.

Results

We identified 12 RCTs (6373 participants), seven comparing HD versus MD ICS/LABA, one HD versus LD ICS/LABA, and four MD versus LD ICS/LABA. HD versus MD ICS/LABA reduced the odds of a severe asthma exacerbation: Peto's Odds Ratio 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.98) with high certainty. There were no other clinically important differences in efficacy or safety outcomes of HD versus MD ICS/LABA. There was no difference in all outcomes comparing HD with LD or MD with LD ICS/LABA.

Interpretation

Maintenance HD ICS/LABA reduces the odds of a severe exacerbation by about 20% compared to MD ICS/LABA. The absolute reduction in severe exacerbation risk with HD ICS/LABA is determined by patients' exacerbation risk, and this effect size may be clinically relevant for patients if this risk is high. Comparisons of other doses of ICS/LABA were limited by the number of identified studies although no large difference in effect sizes were observed.

### Addition of long-acting beta2 agonists or long-acting muscarinic antagonists versus doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in adolescents and adults with uncontrolled asthma with medium dose ICS: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115gixr5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay treatment for persistent asthma. Escalating treatment is required when asthma is not controlled with ICS therapy alone, which would include, but is not limited to, adding a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) or a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or doubling the dose of ICS.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of adding a LABA or LAMA to ICS therapy versus doubling the dose of ICS in adolescents and adults whose asthma is not well controlled on medium-dose (MD)-ICS using a network meta-analysis (NMA), and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization ICTRP for pre-registered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from January 2008 to 19 December 2022.

Selection Criteria

We searched for studies including adolescents and adults with uncontrolled asthma who had been treated with or were eligible for MD-ICS, comparing it to high-dose (HD)-ICS, ICS/LAMA, or ICS/LABA. We excluded cluster- and cross-over RCTs. Studies were of at least 12 weeks duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis according to a previously published protocol. We used Cochrane's Screen4ME workflow to assess search results. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the certainty of evidence. The primary outcome is asthma exacerbations (moderate and severe).

Main Results

We included 38,276 participants from 35 studies (median duration 24 weeks (range 12 to 78); mean age 44.1; 38% male; 69% white; mean forced expiratory volume in one second 2.1 litres and 68% of predicted). MD- and HD-ICS/LABA likely reduce and MD-ICS/LAMA possibly reduces moderate to severe asthma exacerbations compared to MD-ICS (hazard ratio (HR) 0.70, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.59 to 0.82; moderate certainty; HR 0.59, 95% CrI 0.46 to 0.76; moderate certainty; and HR 0.56, 95% CrI 0.38 to 0.82; low certainty, respectively), whereas HD-ICS probably does not (HR 0.94, 95% CrI 0.70 to 1.24; moderate certainty). There is no clear evidence to suggest that any combination therapy or HD-ICS reduces severe asthma exacerbations compared to MD-ICS (low to moderate certainty). This study suggests no clinically meaningful differences in the symptom or quality of life score between dual combinations and monotherapy (low to high certainty). MD- and HD-ICS/LABA increase or likely increase the odds of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) responders at 6 and 12 months compared to MD-ICS (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% CrI 1.23 to 1.76; high certainty; and OR 1.59, 95% CrI 1.31 to 1.94; high certainty at 6 months; and OR 1.61, 95% CrI 1.22 to 2.13; moderate certainty and OR 1.55, 95% CrI 1.20 to 2.00; high certainty at 12 months, respectively). MD-ICS/LAMA probably increases the odds of ACQ responders at 6 months (OR 1.32, 95% CrI 1.11 to 1.57; moderate certainty). No data were available at 12 months. There is no clear evidence to suggest that HD-ICS increases the odds of ACQ responders or improves the symptom or qualify of life score compared to MD-ICS (very low to high certainty). There is no evidence to suggest that ICS/LABA or ICS/LAMA reduces asthma-related or all-cause serious adverse events (SAEs) compared to MD-ICS (very low to high certainty). HD-ICS results in or likely results in little or no difference in the included safety outcomes compared to MD-ICS as well as HD-ICS/LABA compared to MD-ICS/LABA. The pairwise meta-analysis shows that MD-ICS/LAMA likely reduces all-cause adverse events (AEs) and results in a slight reduction in treatment discontinuation due to AEs compared to MD-ICS (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.96; 4 studies, 2238 participants; moderate certainty; and RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.99; 4 studies, 2239 participants; absolute risk reduction 10 fewer per 1000 participants; moderate certainty, respectively). The NMA evidence is in agreement with the pairwise evidence on treatment discontinuation due to AEs, but very uncertain on all-cause AEs, due to imprecision and heterogeneity.

Authors' Conclusions

The review findings suggest that MD- or HD-ICS/LABA and MD-ICS/LAMA reduce moderate to severe asthma exacerbations and increase the odds of ACQ responders compared to MD-ICS whereas HD-ICS probably does not. The evidence is generally stronger for MD- and HD-ICS/LABA than for MD-ICS/LAMA primarily due to a larger evidence base. There is no evidence to suggest that ICS/LABA, ICS/LAMA, or HD-ICS/LABA reduces severe asthma exacerbations or SAEs compared to MD-ICS. MD-ICS/LAMA likely reduces all-cause AEs and results in a slight reduction in treatment discontinuation due to AEs compared to MD-ICS. The above findings may assist in deciding on a treatment option during the stepwise approach of asthma management. Longer-term safety of higher than medium-dose ICS needs to be addressed in phase 4 or observational studies given that the median duration of included studies was six months.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111437LB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

### Initial starting dose of inhaled corticosteroids in adults with asthma: a systematic review [^113c4Np1]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma guidelines vary in their recommendations for the initial dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in asthma. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to establish the optimal starting dose of ICS for asthma in adults.

Methods

Randomised controlled trials comparing two doses of the same ICS in adults with asthma and no concomitant inhaled or oral corticosteroid were assessed. Included trials were analysed according to the following ICS dose comparisons: high (≥ 800 microg/day beclomethasone (BDP)) versus moderate (400 < 800 microg/day BDP) (n = 7); moderate versus low (< 400 microg/day BDP) (n = 6); step down versus constant dose (n = 4).

Results

Fourteen publications describing 13 trials were included in the review. Studies (n = 4) that compared a step down approach with a constant moderate/low dose of ICS found no difference in lung function, symptoms, or rescue medications between the two treatment approaches (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the change in morning peak flow after treatment with high compared with moderate dose ICS. When compared with low dose ICS, moderate dose ICS significantly improved morning peak flow (change from baseline WMD 11.14 l/min, 95% CI 1.34 to 20.93) and nocturnal symptoms (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.06).

Conclusions

For patients with asthma who require ICS, starting with a moderate dose is equivalent to starting with a high dose and stepping down. The small non-significant benefits of starting with a high ICS dose are not of sufficient clinical benefit to warrant its use. Initial moderate ICS doses appear to be more effective than an initial low ICS dose.

### Inhaled corticosteroids and adult asthma [^111gkW85]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The best way to show an ICS dose response and compare ICS products is therefore not to use unselected patients but, rather, to choose patients with either high sputum eosinophils or high F NO and then perform dose escalation studies. Furthermore, ICS dose response also depends on the outcome measured, with airway hyperresponsiveness showing the best dose-dependent improvement over time.

As stated in all guidelines, we should always consider using the lowest possible dose of ICS (or oral corticosteroids [OCS], and ideally no OCS) to control asthma while avoiding the risks for adverse effects. Doses of ICS may be minimized by various measures, including environmental control, use of adjunct therapies such as long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, and in the more severe patient, by the early introduction of biologics. However, prevention of OCS use and related exacerbations should be a priority, which could be avoided in some patients by using high doses of ICS. In this regard, in a study over a median period of 10 years (maximum, 30 yr), we showed that when the dose of ICS/prednisone was adjusted to keep sputum eosinophils under control, exacerbations and the rate of decline of lung function were significantly reduced, although at a price of adverse effects, mainly when OCS was needed. Adverse effects of high doses of ICS have been confounded by methodologic issues and intercurrent OCS use, and there is probably also a variation in susceptibility to those effects from one patient to another.

We therefore agree with Beasley and colleagues that we should prevent overdosing with ICS when not necessary, and that in this regard, there is a significant care gap in asthma management with an underutilization of noninvasive measurements of airway inflammation, particularly in moderate to severe asthma. We endorse the need for rigorous dose–response studies of ICS to be conducted in patients who are well characterized on the basis of their inflammatory endotypes.

### GINA 2020: what's new and why? [^113mgoAr]. The Journal of Asthma (2021). Medium credibility.

The Global initiative against asthma (GINA) 2020 strategy has been released with some changes and updates. GINA recommends the continuation of medications, avoidance of nebulization and spirometry, and ensuring a written asthma action plan in COVID-19 times. GINA 2020 specifies which step of management is to be followed according to the patient's symptoms in an easy flowchart. Clinicians need to be aware of the changes and the evidence behind them.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in asthma management [^114dCynX]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is a disorder of the lower airways, characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airflow limitation, the pathogenesis of which is yet to be fully understood. Regardless of its triggers, asthma's hallmark is a state of inflammation that, when uncontrolled, results in persistence of symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids are established as the mainstay of asthma therapy. This paper examines what is currently available among this class of drugs, features of the ideal inhaled corticosteroid, the delivery systems, dose-response relationships, adverse effects, combination with long-acting beta agonists, equipotent doses among the different types, and several special scenarios that involve the apparent incomplete or lack of response to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids among certain subgroups of patients, such as smokers and obese individuals, and we will discuss the scientific basis of such resistance and suggest alternative approaches to therapy.

### Quick reference guide for clinicians: systematic review of the evidence regarding potential complications of inhaled steroid use in asthma [^112MvXwK]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Systematic review of evidence supports a conclusion that the proven effectiveness of ICS treatment of asthma symptoms decidedly outweighs the proven risks. Clinicians may use this evidence-based review in making decisions regarding selection of treatment of asthma symptoms in individual patients.

### Pharmaceutical characteristics that influence the clinical efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids [^111qAC7M]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the most effective therapy for the management of persistent asthma. The aim of ICS therapy is to achieve a high anti-inflammatory effect in the airways with a concomitant low risk of unwanted local and systemic effects. Direct estimates of clinical efficacy and potency based on studies in humans are difficult to interpret.

Objective

To examine the challenges of using alternative estimates of ICS efficacy and potency, including pharmaceutical characteristics.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Articles published from 1990 to 2002 on the potency, efficacy, and tolerability of ICSs were identified using MEDLINE and in-house databases and were then reviewed. Search terms included inhaled corticosteroid, budesonide, fluticasone, beclomethasone, mometasone, and potency.

Results

Differences among ICSs can be readily shown using preclinical measures, such as glucocorticoid receptor binding or skin blanching tests. However, pharmaceutical (delivery and pharmacokinetic) differences of ICSs can have a greater impact on clinical efficacy than in vitro potency differences. For example, the unique esterification of budesonide in the airways prolongs its local activity and may contribute positively to its efficacy and therapeutic index. Although comparative clinical trials suggest 6-fold differences in potencies among ICSs, there is currently no evidence to support differences in efficacy when they are administered at equipotent dosages.

Conclusions

Greater preclinical potency of an ICS does not imply greater clinical efficacy. Pharmacokinetic factors can have a significant impact on relative clinical efficacy.

### Long-acting beta2-agonists for chronic asthma in adults and children where background therapy contains varied or no inhaled corticosteroid [^113VaRBz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common respiratory disease among both adults and children and short acting inhaled beta-2 agonists are used widely for 'reliever' bronchodilator therapy. Long acting beta-2 agonists (LABA) were introduced as prospective 'symptom controllers' in addition to inhaled corticosteroid 'preventer' therapy (ICS). In this updated review we have included studies in which patients were either not on ICS as a group, or in which some patients, but not all, were on ICS to complement previous systematic reviews of studies where LABA was given in patients uniformly receiving ICS. We have focussed particularly on serious adverse events, given previous concerns about potential risks, especially of death, from regular beta-2 agonist use.

Objectives

This review aimed to determine the benefit or detriment on the primary outcome of asthma control with the regular use of LABA compared with placebo, in mixed populations in which only some were taking ICS and in populations not using ICS therapy.

Search Strategy

We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group trial register, most recently in October 2005. We searched bibliographies of identified RCTs for additional relevant RCTs and contacted authors of identified RCTs for other published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised studies of at least four weeks duration, comparing a LABA given twice daily with a placebo, in chronic asthma. Selection criteria to this updated review have been altered to accommodate recently published Cochrane reviews on combination and addition of LABA to ICS therapy. Studies in which all individuals were uniformly taking ICS were excluded from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers performed data extraction and study quality assessment independently. We contacted authors of studies for missing data.

Main Results

Sixty-seven studies (representing 68 experimental comparisons) randomising 42,333 participants met the inclusion criteria. Salmeterol was used as long-acting agent in 50 studies and formoterol fumarate in 17. The treatment period was four to nine weeks in 29 studies, and 12 to 52 weeks in 38 studies. Twenty-four studies did not permit the use of ICS, and forty permitted either inhaled corticosteroid or cromones (in three studies this was unclear). In these studies between 22% and 92% were taking ICS, with a median of 62%. There were significant advantages to LABA treatment compared to placebo for a variety of measurements of airway calibre including morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), evening PEF and FEV1. They were associated with significantly fewer symptoms, less use of rescue medication and higher quality of life scores. This was true whether patients were taking LABA in combination with ICS or not. Findings from SMART (a recently published surveillance study) indicated significant increases in asthma related deaths, respiratory related deaths and combined asthma related deaths and life threatening experiences. The absolute increase in asthma-related mortality was consistent with an increase of around one per 1250 patients treated with LABA for six months, but the confidence intervals are wide (from 700 to 10,000). Post-hoc exploratory subgroups suggested that African-Americans and those not on inhaled corticosteroids were at particular risk for the primary end-point of death or life-threatening asthma event. There was also a suggestion of an increase in exacerbation rate in children. Pharmacologically predicted side effects such as headache, throat irritation, tremor and nervousness were more frequent with LABA treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

LABA are effective in the control of chronic asthma in the "real-life" subject groups included. However there are potential safety issues which call into question the safety of LABA, particularly in those asthmatics who are not taking ICS, and it is not clear why African-Americans were found to have significant differences in comparison to Caucasians for combined respiratory-related death and life threatening experiences, but not for asthma-related death.

### Long-acting beta2-agonists versus anti-leukotrienes as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids for chronic asthma [^115u3Yc9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms despite taking regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) represent a management challenge. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) agents may both be considered as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

Objectives

We compare the efficacy and safety profile of adding either daily LABA or LTRA in asthmatic patients with asthma who remained symptomatic on ICS.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL databases were searched for randomised controlled trials up to and including January 2004. Reference lists of all included studies and reviews were screened to identify potentially relevant citations. Inquiries regarding other published or unpublished studies supported by the authors of the included studies or pharmaceutical companies who manufacture these agents were made. Conference proceedings of major respiratory meetings were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials conducted in adults or children with recurrent asthma where a LABA (for example, salmeterol or formoterol) or LTRA (for example, montelukast, pranlukast, zafirlukast) was added to ICS for a minimum of 28 days were considered for inclusion. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists and short courses of oral steroids were permitted as rescue medications. Other daily asthma treatments were permitted, providing the dose remained constant during the intervention period. Two reviewers independently reviewed the literature searches.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and trial quality assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. Whenever possible, primary study authors were requested to confirm methodology and data extraction and to provide additional information and clarification when needed. Where necessary, expansion of graphic reproductions and estimation from other data presented in the paper was performed.

Main Results

Twelve randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria; only eight trials including 5,895 patients, provided data in sufficient details to allow aggregation. All eight trials pertained to adults with moderate airway obstruction (% predicted FEV1 66–76%) at baseline. Montelukast (n = 6) or Zafirlukast (n = 2) was compared to Salmeterol (n = 7) or Formoterol (n = 1) as add-on therapy to 400–565 mcg of beclomethasone or equivalent. Risk of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids was significantly lower with LABA+ICS when compared to LTRA+ICS (RR = 0.83, 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI): 0.71, 0.97): the number needed to treat with LABA compared to LTRA, to prevent one exacerbation over 48 weeks, was 38 (95% CI: 23 to 247). The following outcomes also improved significantly with the addition of LABA compared to LTRA to inhaled steroids (Weighted Mean Difference; 95%CI): morning PEFR (16 L/min; 13 to 18), evening PEFR (12 L/min; 9 to 15), FEV(1) (80 mL; 60 to 100), rescue-free days (9%; 4 to 14), symptom-free days (6%; 2 to 11), rescue beta2-agonists (-0.4 puffs/day; -0.2 to -0.5), quality of life (0.1; 0.05 to 0.2), symptom score (Standard Mean Difference -0.2; -0.1 to -0.3), night awakenings (-0.1/week; -0.06 to -0.2) and patient satisfaction (RR 1.12; 1.07 to 1.16). Risk of withdrawals due to any reason was significantly lower with LABA+ICS compared to LTRA+ICS (Relative Risk 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96). Withdrawals due to adverse events or due to poor asthma control, hospitalisation, osteopenia, serious adverse events, overall adverse events, headache or cardiovascular events were not significantly different between the two study groups.

Authors' Conclusions

In asthmatic adults inadequately controlled on low doses of inhaled steroids, the addition of LABA is superior to LTRA for preventing exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, and for improving lung function, symptoms, and use of rescue beta2-agonists.

### Real-world perceptions of inhaled corticosteroid / long-acting β ₂-agonist combinations in the treatment of asthma [^112uCp1S]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Prescribing data for Europe show a shift from inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) prescribed alone or in free combination with long-acting β(2)-agonists (LABAs) to fixed-dose single-inhaler combinations of these agents. However, existing guidelines provide little advice on selecting a specific ICS/LABA combination therapy for the treatment of asthma. European survey data indicate that the factors physicians take into account when making prescribing decisions are broadly in line with those considered to be important by experts in a Delphi process: the availability of a range of doses, the efficacy of the combination, the long-term safety and tolerability of the ICS and LABA components, the potency of the ICS and the speed of onset of the LABA. Further research is needed to help inform physician choice of ICS/LABA combinations for patients with asthma.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^115Qbc6X]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

6. Expanded indications for starting regular controller (preventer) treatment

The GINA report now includes a new table with evidence-based recommendations for initiating controller treatment. The most important change is a recommendation for earlier initiation of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids; for example, in patients with symptoms twice or more a month and/or risk factors for exacerbations, such as a need for oral corticosteroids in the last year. The aim is to reduce asthma risk, even if day-to-day symptoms are not frequent enough to be burdensome.

7. Tailoring asthma treatment for individual patients

The GINA report now describes a framework for personalised asthma management. While national guidelines provide recommendations about the treatment that may be most cost-effective across the whole population, patient-level decisions should also take into account any characteristics or phenotypes that predict the patient's risk or likely treatment response (e.g. smoking status, blood eosinophilia, admission to hospital for asthma in the previous year) together with patient goals and concerns and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence and cost to the patient.

8. Patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

A new feature in GINA relates to the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome. Past guidelines for asthma and COPD have been separate, and most regulatory studies have excluded patients with both conditions. However, many patients have features of both asthma and COPD, including symptomatic smokers with a history of childhood asthma, and patients with asthma and fixed airflow limitation. In collaboration with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA 2014 included a new chapter outlining a syndromic approach to diagnosis in primary care, with pragmatic advice about safety considerations in choice of initial treatment (avoidance of long-acting β 2 -agonist alone if the features suggest asthma, and avoiding inhaled corticosteroid-only treatment if the features suggest COPD). Therefore, it is important that asthma (or asthma–COPD overlap syndrome) should remain in the patient's list of diagnoses, even if they develop fixed airflow limitation.

### Is low dose inhaled corticosteroid therapy as effective for inflammation and remodeling in asthma? A randomized, parallel group study [^115WDQS4]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

While most of the clinical benefits of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy may occur at low doses, results of dose-ranging studies are inconsistent. Although symptom/lung function response to low and high dose ICS medication is comparable, it is uncertain whether low dose ICSs are as effective as high dose in the treatment of inflammation and remodeling.

Methods

22 mild or moderate asthmatic adult subjects (corticosteroid free for > 2 months) participated in a randomized, parallel group study to compare effects of fluticasone propionate (FP) 200 mcg/day and 1000 mcg/day. Alveolar macrophage (AM)-derived cytokines and basement membrane thickness (BMT) were measured at baseline and after 7 weeks treatment while symptoms, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to mannitol at baseline and 6 weeks.

Results

FP improved spirometry, eNO, symptoms and AHR with no difference between low and high dose FP. Both high and low dose FP reduced GM-CSF, TNF-alpha and IL-1ra, with no change in BMT and with no differences between low and high dose FP.

Conclusions

200 μg/day of FP was as effective as 1000 μg/day in improving asthma control, airway inflammation, lung function and AHR in adults in the short term. Future studies should examine potential differential effects between low and high dose combination therapy (ICS/long acting beta agonist) on inflammation and airway remodeling over longer treatment periods.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113miNTi]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–containing treatment in adults, adolescents, and children 6–11 years — GINA recommends that all adults and adolescents and all children 6–11 years should receive ICS-containing medication, incorporated in their maintenance and/or anti-inflammatory reliever treatment as part of personalized asthma management. Clinicians should check local eligibility and payer criteria before prescribing.

### Inhaled corticosteroid therapy in adult asthma. time for a new therapeutic dose terminology [^1173Nt1m]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines use the traditional terminology of "low", "medium", and "high" doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to define daily maintenance doses of 100 to 250 μg, > 250 to 500 μg, and > 500 μg, respectively, of fluticasone propionate or equivalent for adults with asthma. This concise clinical review proposes that this terminology is not evidence based and that prescribing practice based on this terminology may lead to the use of inappropriately excessive doses of ICS. Specifically, the ICS dose that achieves 80–90% of the maximum obtainable benefit is currently classified as a low dose, with the description of two higher dose levels of medium and high, which are associated with significant risk of systemic adverse effects. Asthma guidelines and clinician prescribing practice need to be modified in accordance with the currently available evidence of the dose-response relationship of ICS in adult asthma. We propose a reclassification of ICS doses based on a "standard daily dose", which is defined as 200–250 μg of fluticasone propionate or equivalent, representing the dose at which approximately 80–90% of the maximum achievable therapeutic benefit of ICS is obtained in adult asthma across the spectrum of severity. It is recommended that ICS treatment be started at these standard doses, which then represent the doses at which maintenance ICS are prescribed at step 2 and within ICS/long-acting β-agonist combination therapy at step 3. The opportunity is available to prescribe higher doses within ICS/long-acting β-agonist maintenance therapy in accordance with the stepwise approach to asthma treatment at step 4.

### Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) plus long-acting β-agonist (LABA) versus LABA plus inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111fUVUx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are inhaled medications used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When two classes of medications are required, a LAMA plus an ICS (LABA+ICS) were previously recommended within a single inhaler as the first-line treatment for managing stable COPD in people in high-risk categories. However, updated international guidance recommends a LAMA plus a LABA (LAMA+LABA). This systematic review is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2017.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of LAMA+LABA versus LABA+ICS for treatment of people with stable COPD.

Search Methods

We performed an electronic search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal, followed by handsearches. Two review authors screened the selected articles. The most recent search was run on 10 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel or cross-over randomised controlled trials of at least one month's duration, comparing LAMA+LABA and LABA+ICS for stable COPD. We included studies conducted in an outpatient setting and irrespective of blinding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs), and continuous data as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Review Manager 5. Primary outcomes were: participants with one or more exacerbations of COPD; serious adverse events; quality of life, as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score change from baseline; and trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁). We used the GRADE framework to rate our certainty of the evidence in each meta-analysis as high, moderate, low or very low. MAIN RESULTS: This review updates the first version of the review, published in 2017, and increases the number of included studies from 11 to 19 (22,354 participants). The median number of participants per study was 700. In each study, between 54% and 91% (median 70%) of participants were males. Study participants had an average age of 64 years and percentage predicted FEV 1 of 51.5% (medians of study means). Included studies had a generally low risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting biases. All but two studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, which had varying levels of involvement in study design, conduct, and data analysis. Primary outcomes The odds of having an exacerbation were similar for LAMA+LABA compared with LABA+ICS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; I² = 61%; 13 studies, 20,960 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The odds of having a serious adverse event were also similar (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.15; I² = 20%; 18 studies, 23,183 participants; high-certainty evidence). Participants receiving LAMA+LABA had a similar improvement in quality of life, as measured by the SGRQ, to those receiving LABA+ICS (MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.36 to 0.21; I² = 78%; 9 studies, 14,437 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) but showed a greater improvement in trough FEV₁ (MD 0.07, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.08; I² = 73%; 12 studies, 14,681 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes LAMA+LABA decreased the odds of pneumonia compared with LABA+ICS from 5% to 3% (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.72; I² = 0%; 14 studies, 21,829 participants; high-certainty evidence) but increased the odds of all-cause death from 1% to 1.4% (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.75; I² = 0%; 15 studies, 21,510 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The odds of achieving a minimal clinically important difference of four or more points on the SGRQ were similar between LAMA+LABA and LABA+ICS (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.25; I² = 77%; 4 studies, 13,614 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Combination LAMA+LABA therapy probably holds similar benefits to LABA+ICS for exacerbations and quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, for people with moderate to severe COPD, but offers a larger improvement in FEV 1 and a slightly lower risk of pneumonia. There is little to no difference between LAMA+LABA and LAMA+ICS in the odds of having a serious adverse event. Whilst all-cause death may be lower with LABA+ICS, there was a very small number of events in the analysis, translating to a low absolute risk. Findings are based on moderate- to high-certainty evidence from heterogeneous trials with an observation period of less than one year. This review should be updated again in a few years.

### COVID-19 in COPD: a growing concern [^116PgoGS]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Another consideration is pharmacotherapy. COPD patients are often prescribed inhaled medications such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Provocatively, in the paper by Attaway et al. they showed that those patients who tested positively for SARS-CoV-2 were 2.4 times less likely to have used corticosteroids at the time of testing than those who tested negatively (18.3% vs 44.8%, p < 0.001). Although these data cannot be considered definitive owing to important methodological limitations such as confounding by indication and severity, they raise the possibility that corticosteroids may offer some protection against COVID-19. Thus, during this pandemic, patients with COPD should be encouraged to use their prescribed inhalers as they did prior to the pandemic. Long-acting bronchodilators are first line therapies for COPD, followed by the addition of ICS for those who are frequent exacerbators and during significant exacerbations, they should be managed with antibiotics and oral corticosteroids. For exacerbations directly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, they should be treated with systemic dexamethasone, especially if they require supplemental oxygenation or invasive mechanical ventilation. Under these settings, the use of dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality by 18% to 36%. As illustrated by Attaway et al. COVID-19 is a growing concern in patients with COPD. However, with proper mitigation efforts and appropriate inhaler therapy, COPD patients may be "protected" from the severe consequences of SARS-CoV-2 during this pandemic.

### Inhaled corticosteroids with combination inhaled long-acting β-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115VBEpb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly involves long-acting bronchodilators including beta-agonists (LABA) and muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). In individuals with persistent symptoms or frequent exacerbations, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are also used. LABA and LAMA bronchodilators are now available in single combination inhalers. However, the benefits and risks of adding ICS to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of adding an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to combination long-acting beta₂-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) inhalers for the treatment of stable COPD.

Search Methods

We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials (searched 20 September 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 15 December 2015) and MEDLINE (searched 15 December 2015). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organisation (WHO) trials portal and pharmaceutical company clinical trials' databases up to 7 Janurary 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-group, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of three weeks' duration or longer which compared treatment of stable COPD with ICS in addition to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers against combination LABA/LAMA inhalers alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified a total of 586 records in our search. Following removal of duplicates, 386 abstracts were assessed for inclusion. Six studies were identified as potentially relevant; however, all failed to meet the inclusion criteria on full-text assessment or after contacting the corresponding author to clarify study characteristics.

Authors' Conclusions

There are currently no studies published assessing the effect of ICS in addition to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers for the treatment of stable COPD. As combination LABA/LAMA inhalers are now widely available, there is a need for well-designed RCTs to investigate whether ICS provides any added therapeutic benefit.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^115VU3KH]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Risk factors for cataract in adults — including non-modifiable and associated exposures — are summarized with examples from Table 1. Non-modifiable risk factors for cataract formation include increasing age, female gender, and family history, and numerous risk factors have been linked with cataract development, the most common of which are listed in Table 1; most studies on risk factors are observational and strongly suggest an association with cataract formation, but they fail to prove causation. Under the header TABLE 1 FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK OF CATARACT DEVELOPMENT, listed examples include family history, ionizing radiation (low and high dose), myopia (> 1 D), systemic corticosteroid use, ultraviolet-B light exposure, Prior PPV, tobacco (smokeless), and corticosteroids (inhaled orally).

### Prescription of inhalers in asthma and COPD: towards a rational, rapid and effective approach [^11165Bpn]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Inhaled medication is the cornerstone of the pharmacological treatment of patients with asthma and COPD. The major two classes of inhaled medication include corticosteroids (ICS) and bronchodilators. There is a wide diversity in molecules in both classes. Moreover, there is a wide variation in delivery systems. The correct use of inhalers is not granted and patients often incur in many mistakes when using pMDIs and DPIs, despite repeated instructions. A better matching between patient and device could be accomplished if the physician is aware of: (1) the patient characteristics (disease, severity, fluctuation in airflow obstruction, etc); (2) what class of medication is indicated; (3) where in the lung the medication should be delivered; and, (4) how this can be best achieved by a given device in this specific patient. We focus on the prescription of pMDIs and DPIs at the GP office or at the outpatient clinic of the hospital, and we propose an evidence based approach enabling the caregiver to make a rational choice in only a few minutes by just considering the following four simple questions: Who?, What? Where? and How? (the so-called 3W-H approach).

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and "ICS-formoterol" indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

"Quick-relief" therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations. In this section, "as-needed" dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient's decision (Figs 2–4).

The definitions of "low-", "medium-", and "high-dose" ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term "puff" refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

"Recurrent wheezing" as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

### Evidence-based selection of inhaled corticosteroid for treatment of chronic asthma [^113T3HQ2]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

Published literature relevant to comparison of various inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) was reviewed. Marked heterogeneity was found in the reported results. The efficacy and side effects of ICSs depend on their formulation, dosing and device used, and the subjects' age, severity of asthma, and inhaler technique. All these factors have not been included uniformly in most study designs. Notwithstanding this limitation, it appears that fluticasone is generally very effective and safe in low-to-medium doses and may be used for most patients. Budesonide is the only Pregnancy Category B ICSs, all others being Category C, and it is available as nebulizer suspension suitable for use in children over 6 months of age. Budesonide, also available as dry powder inhaler, and beclomethasone, available as metered-dose inhaler, are equal in efficacy, and side effects and may be chosen according to the patient's ability to handle the device. Flunisolide causes fewer side effects but is also relatively less effective. Triamcinolone is generally less effective and causes more side effects than most of the other ICSs. Mometasone may be preferred if once-daily dosing is desired. Ciclesonide has been found highly effective in once-daily dose and without side effects even in high doses. Further studies comparing it with other ICSs over longer periods of use will determine its place in treatment of chronic asthma.

### The effects of inhaled corticosteroids on healthy airways [^113y24cR]. Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the cornerstone of asthma treatment. They attenuate eosinophilic airway inflammation, improve lung function, and reduce asthma symptoms, exacerbations, and mortality. However, their use is also associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. Corticosteroids modulate the expression of many molecular pathways at the level of gene transcription, through direct upregulation of anti-inflammatory molecules and β-adrenoceptors (transactivation), and suppression of pro-inflammatory genes, either through direct DNA-binding or via inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factor binding (transrepression). In people with severe asthma, ICS are relatively ineffective even at high doses, but the mechanisms behind this corticosteroid insensitivity are poorly understood and likely multi-factorial.

When considering the underlying molecular pathways driving both severe asthma and relative corticosteroid insensitivity, it is unclear to what extent this is driven by pathways that are not responsive to corticosteroids, as opposed to inhibition of corticosteroid signalling. Gene expression profiling in asthmatic epithelial bronchial brushings and bronchial biopsies has identified several molecular pathways present in subgroups of patients with mild, moderate and severe asthma. Approximately 50–80% of people with steroid-naïve "mild" asthma demonstrate evidence of blood or airway eosinophilia, with a concomitant increase in the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). This phenotype is characterised by increased expression of an airway gene expression signature driven by IL-4 and IL-13; tissue eosinophilia is also dependent on IL-5. Together these cytokines are described as Th2 or type-2 cytokines (T2). T2 expression and the accompanying eosinophilia are suppressed by ICS in mild asthma. In severe asthma, a persistent T2 gene signature is evident in about 25% of patients, suggesting corticosteroid insensitivity. In addition, in severe asthma, about 25% of patients have evidence of an IL-17-dependent gene signature, which is seen only in people on ICS, and mutually exclusive with the T2 signature. It is therefore not clear whether this IL-17 activity represents an independent corticosteroid-insensitive pathway driving severe asthma or a consequence of ICS therapy. Approximately 50% of people with severe asthma have neither a T2- or IL-17-dependent airway gene signature, and the mechanisms driving their persistent disordered airway physiology remains unknown. So, while gene expression profiling provides insight into the abnormalities present in severe asthmatic airways, the multiple effects of ICS on airway gene expression make it difficult to disentangle the changes due to the disease as opposed to the treatment, and whether corticosteroid activity is inhibited or not.

### Once-daily long-acting beta ₂-agonists / inhaled corticosteroids combined inhalers versus inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117S2z39]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Three classes of inhaler medication are used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): long-acting beta₂-agonists (LABA); long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA); and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). To encourage patient adherence, two classes of medication are often combined in a single medication device; it seems that once-daily dosing offers greatest convenience to patients and may markedly influence adherence.

Objectives

To compare a once-daily combination of inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta₂-agonist inhalers (ICS/LABA) versus inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists alone (LAMA) for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Search Methods

We performed an electronic search of the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Airways Group (14 May 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (14 May 2018), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (20 September 2017), then a search of other resources, including reference lists of included studies and manufacturers' trial registers (10 October 2017). Two pairs of review authors screened and scrutinised selected articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing once-daily administered ICS/LABA and LAMA in adults with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in each study. We analysed dichotomous data as random-effects odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs), both with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), using Review Manager 5.

Main Results

We included two studies with 880 participants. We identified one ongoing trial with planned recruitment of 80 participants. Included studies enrolled participants with both partially reversible and non-reversible COPD and baseline mean per cent predicted (%pred) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) of 43.4 to 49.6. Both studies lasted 12 weeks. Both studies used the same combination of inhaled ICS/LABA (fluticasone furoate and vilanterol 100/25 mcg once daily; FF/VI) versus LAMA (18 mcg tiotropium; TIO). They were published as full articles, and neither study was at low risk of bias in all domains. Compared to the TIO arm, results for pooled primary outcomes for the FF/VI arm were as follows: mortality: OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.73, 880 participants (deaths reported only in the TIO arm), very low-quality evidence; COPD exacerbation (requiring short-burst oral corticosteroids or antibiotics, or both): OR 0.72, 95% Cl 0.35 to 1.50, 880 participants, very low-quality evidence; pneumonia: reported in both studies only during treatment with FF/VI: OR 6.12, 95% Cl 0.73 to 51.24, 880 participants, very low-quality evidence; and total serious adverse events: OR 0.96, 95% Cl 0.50 to 1.83, 880 participants, very low-quality evidence. None of the pneumonias were fatal. Compared to the TIO arm, we found no statistically significant difference for pooled secondary outcomes, including St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) mean total score change; hospital admissions (all-cause); disease-specific adverse events; mean weekly rescue medication use (results available from only one of the studies); and mean weekly percentage of rescue-free days for FF/VI. We found no statistically significant differences between ICS/LABA and LAMA for improvement in symptoms measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT score) nor for FEV₁ (change from baseline trough in 24-hour weighted mean on treatment day 84). Many pooled estimates lacked precision. Data for other endpoints such as exacerbations leading to intubation and physical activity measures were not available in included trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on analysis of primary and secondary outcomes, we are uncertain whether once-daily ICS/LABA, combined in one inhaler, has a different efficacy or adverse effect profile compared to LAMA for treatment of people with COPD. However, the current review is based on only two trials with the main focus on primary outcomes other than those considered in this review. The short follow-up period and the very low quality of evidence limit our confidence in the result and increase uncertainty. Further trials of longer duration are needed. Current evidence is not strong enough to demonstrate important differences between inhalers in terms of effects, nor to establish that once-daily fluticasone/vilanterol 100/25 mcg and tiotropium 18 mcg are equivalent.

### Inhaled corticosteroids and adult asthma [^1123Kg2x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the concise review by Beasley and colleagues on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in adult asthma. We agree that the definition of low, moderate, and high doses of ICS is arbitrary, as stated in the Global Initiative for Asthma report, although the Global Initiative for Asthma makes clear that it is simply an assessment of estimated clinical comparability based on available studies and product information, and that a large number of patients with asthma need only a low dose of ICS.

However, with regard to the statement that the maximum obtainable patient benefit is with low-dose ICS, we would like to emphasize that the evidence provided to support this statement is from studies on nonphenotyped asthma, a significant proportion of which probably have no or low levels of airway eosinophilia. The main therapeutic target of ICS is the eosinophil, and the degree of airway eosinophilia varies significantly from one patient to another, so that the dose of ICS needed to reduce such eosinophilia significantly varies greatly. It is likely that the "classical" benefit/systemic effects curve differs significantly in eosinophilic asthma, and that the observed plateau is shifted to the right in this population. The reason for the reported lack of efficacy of doubling and quadrupling of doses of ICS is likely that the nature of airway inflammation was not considered in those clinical trials. Furthermore, studies that have looked at sputum eosinophils have demonstrated that high doses of corticosteroids are as effective as prednisone in moderate to severe exacerbations. Another study showed that high-dose ICS is also effective in treating exacerbations of asthma.

### Effects of corticosteroids on lung function in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116c2buF]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Both oral and inhaled corticosteroids have clinically significant effects on symptoms, exacerbations, health status, and lung function in asthma, and to a lesser extent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Change in FEV(1) does not correlate well with functional tests in COPD and may not be the best measure of response to treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids may be beneficial when added to a beta-agonist for treatment of acute asthma, and the efficacy of oral corticosteroids in this setting is well established. Oral corticosteroids inconsistently improve lung function in stable outpatients with COPD. Individual inhaled corticosteroids do not have a marked effect, but the combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol and the combination of budesonide plus formoterol seem to improve FEV(1) over treatment with the individual components. In addition, there is convincing evidence for the use of systemic corticosteroids during acute exacerbations of COPD. Some evidence suggests that patients with COPD who respond to corticosteroids have eosinophilic inflammation and other attributes of an asthma phenotype.

### Dangers of under-treatment and over-treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma [^112aKPga]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

The above discussion illustrates the high complexity of asthma management on national and international levels, with multiple ICS, multiple formulations of those ICS, multiple regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA), multiple LABA combined with ICS, prescription to OTC transitions, patent expirations and removal of ICS from the market, multiple insurance companies, and multiple asthma guidelines with different ranges for low, medium, and high doses (Table 6). Moreover, ICS and formulations can be available in some countries, but not others.

Asthma in school‐age children must be diagnosed carefully using spirometry. Likewise, persistent pediatric asthma should be carefully treated using ICS, the gold standard, considering both disease severity and ICS benefits and risks. ICS can be prescribed safely in children by following recommendations in asthma guidelines and FDA‐approved package labels. However, our responsibilities extend beyond the prescription to include proactive monitoring and accurate and timely recognition of systemic side effects when they develop. More education about guidelines, package labels, and side effects is needed for prescribers. The benefits and risks of INCS for concurrent allergic rhinitis symptoms must also be carefully weighed. It is vital to discuss ICS/INCS benefits and risks with patients and their guardians and stress the importance of using a symptom diary to monitor treatment response and detect side effects. Children are different from adults because they are growing and developing rapidly.

Moreover, children are more vulnerable than adults because they rely completely on adult caregivers to detect their side effects. The need to follow guidelines for treating acute asthma exacerbations should be stressed more in outpatient settings, such as urgent care and primary care clinics, in addition to acute care facilities. There are dangers of both under‐treating and over‐treating pediatric asthma. Any child with asthma is at risk for these dangers, but the risk will be mitigated by using the lessons learned from these two cases.

In summary, Case 1 supports more use of ICS monotherapy and less use of non‐ICS monotherapies. Case 2 merely supports the more careful use of ICS. These case presentations and reviews also advocate for the adoption of a single set of asthma guidelines that will be used globally, updated regularly to reflect recent advances, and sensitive to the many nuances of asthma management in different countries.

### BTS / NICE / SIGN joint guideline on asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024)-summary of recommendations [^113Waoay]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial management of newly diagnosed asthma in people aged 12 and over

Offer a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken as needed for symptom relief (as-needed) to people aged 12 and over with newly diagnosed asthma. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

In November 2024, only certain budesonide/formoterol inhalers were licensed for as-needed AIR therapy in mild asthma. The use of any other ICS/formoterol inhalers would therefore be off-label. The current evidence supporting the use of budesonide/formoterol is based on the use of a dry powder inhaler. Seeor.

If the person needing asthma treatment presents highly symptomatic (for example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation, start treatment with low-dose MART in addition to treating the acute symptoms as indicated (that is, a course of oral corticosteroids may be needed). Consider stepping down to as-needed AIR therapy using a low-dose ICS/formoterol inhaler at a later date if their asthma is controlled. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

### Interventions to improve inhaler technique for people with asthma [^111CTPna]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common chronic disease worldwide. Inhalers are often prescribed to help control asthma symptoms, improve quality of life and reduce the risk of exacerbations or flare-ups. However, evidence suggests that many people with asthma do not use their inhaler correctly. It is therefore important to evaluate whether interventions aimed specifically at improving technique are effective and safe, and whether use of these interventions translates into improved clinical outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the impact of interventions to improve inhaler technique on clinical outcomes and safety in adults and children with asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains records compiled from multiple electronic and handsearched resources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted the most recent search on 23 November 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included studies comparing a group of adults or children with asthma receiving an inhaler technique intervention versus a group receiving a control or alternative intervention. We included parallel and cluster-randomised trials of any duration conducted in any setting, and planned to include only the first phase of any cross-over trials identified. We included studies reported as full-text articles, those published as abstracts only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the search results for eligible studies. We extracted outcome data, assessed risk of bias in duplicate and resolved discrepancies by involving another review author. We grouped studies making similar comparisons by consensus (e.g. all those comparing enhanced inhaler technique education vs usual care) and conducted meta-analyses only if treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios, and continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences, all with random-effects models. We described skewed data narratively. We graded the results and presented evidence in 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison. Primary outcomes were inhaler technique, asthma control and exacerbations requiring at least oral corticosteroids (OCS).

Main Results

This review includes 29 parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 2210), although not all reported relevant or useable data. All participants had asthma, and follow-up ranged from 2 to 26 weeks. Most studies were at low or unclear risk of selection and attrition biases and at high risk for biases associated with blinding. We considered most of the evidence to be of low quality owing to these biases and to imprecision in the estimates of effect. We classified studies into three comparisons: enhanced face-to-face training session(s), multi-media-delivered inhaler training (e.g. DVD, computer app or game) and technique feedback devices. Differences between interventions, populations and outcome measures limited quantitative analyses, particularly for exacerbations, adverse events, unscheduled visits to a healthcare provider and absenteeism from work or school. Enhanced inhaler technique education and multi-media training improved technique in most studies immediately after the intervention and at follow-up, although the variety of checklists used meant that this was difficult to assess reliably. For both adults and children, how and when inhaler technique was assessed appeared to affect whether inhaler technique improved and by how much. Analyses of the numbers of people who demonstrated correct or 'good enough' technique were generally more useful than checklist scores. Adult studies of enhanced education showed benefit when this metric was used at 2 to 26 weeks' follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 5.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 13.65; 258 participants; three studies; 31 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 69 (95% CI 45 to 86) in the education group; moderate-quality evidence). A similar result was seen in studies looking at feedback devices at four weeks' follow-up (OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.87 to 12.33; 97 participants; one study; 51 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 83 (95% CI 66 to 93) in the feedback group; low-quality evidence). However, the benefit of multi-media training for adults even immediately after the intervention was uncertain (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 5.50; 164 participants; two studies; I² = 49%; 30 per 100 in the control group with correct technique compared with 47 (95% CI 26 to 70) in the multi-media group; moderate-quality evidence). Evidence tended to be less clear for children, usually because results were based on fewer and smaller studies. Some studies did not report exacerbations in a way that allowed meta-analysis; others provided inconclusive results. Inhaler technique interventions provided some benefit for asthma control and quality of life but generally did not lead to consistent or important clinical benefits for adults or children. Confidence intervals included no difference or did not reach a threshold that could be considered clinically important. Responder analyses sometimes showed improvement among more people in the intervention groups, even though the mean difference between groups was small. We found no evidence about harms.

Authors' Conclusions

Although interventions to improve inhaler technique may work in some circumstances, the variety of interventions and measurement methods used hampered our ability to perform meta-analyses and led to low to moderate confidence in our findings. Most included studies did not report important improvement in clinical outcomes. Guidelines consistently recommend that clinicians check regularly the inhaler technique of their patients; what is not clear is how clinicians can most effectively intervene if they find a patient's technique to be inadequate, and whether such interventions will have a discernible impact on clinical outcomes.

### High dose versus low dose inhaled corticosteroid as initial starting dose for asthma in adults and children [^116wnuXC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) form the basis of maintenance therapy in asthma and their efficacy is well established. However, the optimal starting dose of ICS is not clearly established. Recent reviews demonstrate a relatively flat efficacy curve for ICS and increasing side effects with increasing ICS doses. High doses are frequently prescribed and there are now reports of significant side effects occurring with high dose ICS use. These issues demonstrate the need to establish the optimal starting dose of ICS in asthma.

Objectives

To establish the optimal starting dose of ICS by evaluating the efficacy of initial high dose ICS with low dose ICS in subjects with asthma, not currently on ICS.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reference lists of articles. Date of last search: January 2003

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of two different doses of the same ICS in adults and children with asthma with no concomitant ICS or OCS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted for confirmation. Trials were analysed according to the following ICS dose comparisons: step down vs constant dose ICS (n = 7); high vs moderate (n = 11); high vs low (n = 9); moderate vs low (n = 11); fold change in dose (all studies).

Main Results

31 papers reporting the results of 26 trials were included in the review. For studies that compared a step down approach to a constant moderate/low ICS dose, there were no significant differences in lung function, symptoms, rescue medications or asthma control between the two treatment approaches. Significant but clinically small improvements in percent predicted FEV(1) (WMD 5.32, 95% CI 0.65 to 9.99) and non significant improvements in the change in morning PEF were found for high dose ICS compared to moderate dose ICS. There were no significant differences in efficacy between high and low dose ICS. For moderate dose ICS, compared to low dose ICS, there were significant improvements in the change in morning PEF l/min from baseline (WMD 11.14, 95% CI 1.34 to 20.93) and nocturnal symptoms (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.06). Commencing ICS at double or quadruple a base moderate or low dose had no greater effect than commencing with the base dose. Several studies reported greater improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness for high dose ICS.

Reviewers' Conclusions

For patients with asthma who require ICS, commencing with a moderate dose ICS is equivalent to commencing with a high dose ICS and down-titrating. The small significant benefits of commencing with a high ICS dose are not of sufficient clinical benefit to warrant its use when compared to moderate or low dose ICS. Initial moderate ICS dose appears to be more effective than initial low ICS dose. High dose ICS may be more effective than moderate or low dose ICS for airway hyperresponsiveness. There is no benefit in doubling or quadrupling ICS in subjects with stable asthma.

### Corticosteroid therapy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114Ri8jT]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized in part by a chronic inflammatory state in the airways (largely from chronic noxious stimuli such as tobacco smoke), punctuated with acute inflammatory exacerbations, which are often infectious. Although pathologically and biochemically different from the inflammation of asthma, the chronic inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in subgroups with asthma-like features and especially during exacerbations, might be expected to respond to corticosteroid therapy, as does asthma. Complications from long-term corticosteroid use are important, but they appear less when the corticosteroid is given via the inhaled route. Clinical evidence is particularly strong supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids to prevent exacerbations and oral corticosteroids to reduce the duration and impact of exacerbations.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: is there a long-term benefit? [^116szEuu]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The use of inhaled corticosteroids is one of the most controversial issues in COPD pharmacotherapy. Experts disagree about the benefits and harms of ICS for patients with COPD, yet a majority of patients with COPD are being treated with inhaled corticosteroids. This is a review of the most recent literature on this subject.

Recent Findings

Evidence suggests that ICS, with or without a long-acting beta2-agonist, are cost-effective in reducing exacerbation rates and retarding the decline in health status of COPD patients, although they do not significantly modify the rate of decline in FEV1 or change mortality. This discrepancy is likely related to the differences in pathology of COPD when compared with asthma. Evidence also suggests that ICS may be safe regarding the effects on adrenals and bone mineral density. We have yet to identify reliable criteria for predicting a response to ICS in COPD, but it has become clear that in mild disease, no beneficial effect has been demonstrated.

Summary

In contrast to asthma, inhaled corticosteroids should not be used as a first-line medication in patients with COPD. Identification of patients with COPD who might benefit from long-term treatment with ICS remains paramount.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115wqr3E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been the subject of much controversy. Major international guidelines recommend selective use of ICS. Recently published meta-analyses have reported conflicting findings on the effects of inhaled steroid therapy in COPD.

Objectives

The objective of the review is to determine the efficacy of regular use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with stable COPD.

Search Strategy

A pre-defined search strategy was used to search the Cochrane Airways Group specialised register for relevant literature. Searches are current as of October 2006.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised trials comparing any dose of any type of inhaled steroid with a placebo control in patients with COPD. Acute bronchodilator reversibility to short term beta2-agonists and bronchial hyperresponsiveness were not exclusion criteria. The a priori primary outcome was change in lung function. Data on mortality, exacerbations, quality of life and symptoms, rescue bronchodilator use, exercise capacity, biomarkers and safety were also analysed.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.

Main Results

Forty-seven primary studies with 13,139 participants met the inclusion criteria. Medium term use of ICS (> two months and up to six months) resulted in a small improvement in FEV1 in some studies. Long term use of ICS (> six months) did not significantly reduce the rate of decline in FEV1 in COPD patients (weighted mean difference (WMD) 5.80 ml/year with ICS over placebo, 95% CI -0.28 to 11.88, 2333 participants). There was no statistically significant effect on mortality in COPD patients (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 8390 participants). Long term use of ICS reduced the mean rate of exacerbations in those studies where pooling of data was possible (WMD -0.26 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.14, 2586 participants). ICS slowed the rate of decline in quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (WMD -1.22 units/year, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.60, 2507 participants). Response to ICS was not predicted by oral steroid response, bronchodilator reversibility or bronchial hyper-responsiveness in COPD patients. There was an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.49, 4380 participants) and hoarseness. The few long term studies that measured bone effects generally showed no major effect on fractures and bone mineral density over 3 years.

Authors' Conclusions

Patients and clinicians should balance the potential benefits of inhaled steroids in COPD (reduced rate of exacerbations, reduced rate of decline in quality of life), against the known increase in local side effects (oropharyngeal candidiasis and hoarseness). The risk of long term adverse effects is unknown.

### Designing corticosteroid drugs for pulmonary selectivity [^111RBQ9i]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids have become indispensable for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Significant progress has been made toward minimizing side effects through the use of increasingly selective molecules, and through a variety of lung targeting strategies. Many of these developments have occurred in advance of a greatly improved understanding of corticosteroid biology at the molecular and pharmacologic level, and it has become clear that additional opportunities exist for the further enhancement of therapeutic index. This article discusses significant recent developments in the chemistry, biology, and pharmacology of corticosteroids, and considers the implications for the future use of inhaled corticosteroids.

### Effects of inhaled corticosteroids on growth in children… [^1138bQXf]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Do different inhaled corticosteroids have different impacts on growth in children with asthma. Evidence-Based Answer Inhaled fluticasone is associated with a greater linear growth velocity when compared with beclomethasone. Fluticasone via Diskus inhaler is associated with a greater increase in height over 20 weeks to 12 months compared with budesonide via turbuhaler.

1 The review included six randomized trials of children four to 12 years of age with persistent asthma who were using an inhaled corticosteroid; 1, 008 of the children completed their respective studies without major protocol deviations. The per-protocol population was used instead of the intention-to-treat population because the authors were trying to assess the impact of inhaled corticosteroid therapy on growth. The 2007 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Expert Panel Report 3 recommends the use of inhaled corticosteroids in all patients with persistent asthma. 7 The more recent GINA guidelines echo this recommendation but also provide that a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid may be taken as a daily controller medication in those with intermittent symptoms or as an on-demand addition whenever a short-acting beta agonist is used.

4 There is a slowing of growth with inhaled corticosteroid use, but the magnitude of slowing is small and the harms of uncontrolled asthma are worse. Family physicians should review the risks and benefits of inhaled corticosteroids with patients and their families, noting that although there may be, on average, a 1. 2-cm loss in final adult height, uncontrolled severe asthma can be associated with profound morbidity, hospitalization, and even death. Among the medications studied, fluticasone seems to be associated with the best growth outcomes.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in children with persistent asthma: effects of different drugs and delivery devices on growth [^115Cyffd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective treatment for children with persistent asthma. Although treatment with ICS is generally considered to be safe in children, the potential adverse effects of these drugs on growth remains a matter of concern for parents and physicians.

Objectives

To assess the impact of different inhaled corticosteroid drugs and delivery devices on the linear growth of children with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO. We handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and manufacturers' clinical trial databases, or contacted the manufacturer, to search for potential relevant unpublished studies. The literature search was initially conducted in September 2014, and updated in November 2015, September 2018, and April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We selected parallel-group randomized controlled trials of at least three months' duration. To be included, trials had to compare linear growth between different inhaled corticosteroid molecules at equivalent doses, delivered by the same type of device, or between different devices used to deliver the same inhaled corticosteroid molecule at the same dose, in children up to 18 years of age with persistent asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected studies and assessed risk of bias in included studies. The data were extracted by one author and checked by another. The primary outcome was linear growth velocity. We conducted meta-analyses using Review Manager 5.3 software. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the metrics for treatment effects, and the random-effects model for meta-analyses. We did not perform planned subgroup analyses due to there being too few included trials.

Main Results

We included six randomized trials involving 1199 children aged from 4 to 12 years (per-protocol population: 1008), with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. Two trials were from single hospitals, and the remaining four trials were multicentre studies. The duration of trials varied from six to 20 months. One trial with 23 participants compared fluticasone with beclomethasone, and showed that fluticasone given at an equivalent dose was associated with a significant greater linear growth velocity (MD 0.81 cm/year, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.16, low certainty evidence). Three trials compared fluticasone with budesonide. Fluticasone given at an equivalent dose had a less suppressive effect than budesonide on growth, as measured by change in height over a period from 20 weeks to 12 months (MD 0.97 cm, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.32; 2 trials, 359 participants; moderate certainty evidence). However, we observed no significant difference in linear growth velocity between fluticasone and budesonide at equivalent doses (MD 0.39 cm/year, 95% CI -0.94 to 1.73; 2 trials, 236 participants; very low certainty evidence). Two trials compared inhalation devices. One trial with 212 participants revealed a comparable linear growth velocity between beclomethasone administered via hydrofluoroalkane-metered dose inhaler (HFA-MDI) and beclomethasone administered via chlorofluorocarbon-metered dose inhaler (CFC-MDI) at an equivalent dose (MD -0.44 cm/year, 95% CI -1.00 to 0.12; low certainty evidence). Another trial with 229 participants showed a small but statistically significant greater increase in height over a period of six months in favour of budesonide via Easyhaler, compared to budesonide given at the same dose via Turbuhaler (MD 0.37 cm, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.62; low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggests that the drug molecule and delivery device may impact the effect size of ICS on growth in children with persistent asthma. Fluticasone at an equivalent dose seems to inhibit growth less than beclomethasone and budesonide. Easyhaler is likely to have less adverse effect on growth than Turbuhaler when used for delivery of budesonide. However, the evidence from this systematic review of head-to-head trials is not certain enough to inform the selection of inhaled corticosteroid or inhalation device for the treatment of children with persistent asthma. Further studies are needed, and pragmatic trials and real-life observational studies seem more attractive and feasible.

### Stable COPD and the role of inhaled corticosteroids… [^1145GLka]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy improve exacerbation outcomes in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evidence-Based Answer ICS monotherapy decreases the likelihood of exacerbations in patients with stable COPD compared with placebo.

1. Practice Pointers COPD is a pulmonary inflammatory condition characterized by airway obstruction. 2 COPD affects more than 15 million people in the United States, causing more than 150, 000 deaths per year. 3 Primary care physicians need to recognize COPD and provide treatment to reduce exacerbations because of the related morbidity and socioeconomic burden. ICS monotherapy can benefit patients with COPD; however, its role is uncertain because recommendations have favored using ICS therapy in combination with long-acting bronchodilators.

The authors of this Cochrane review assessed studies published up to October 2022 that compared ICS monotherapy vs. placebo in patients with stable COPD. 1 Primary outcomes included COPD exacerbations, quality of life using the validated St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, all-cause mortality, lung function, use of rescue bronchodilators, exercise capacity, pneumonia, and thrush. Outcomes were measured by rates of hospitalization and oral corticosteroid and antibiotic use. This review included 36 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with 23, 139 participants. Most studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Africa in multicenter/hospital outpatient clinics. Outcomes were consistent among studies. The duration of follow-up was three to six months or more than six months to three years.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for cystic fibrosis [^112xSJmS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The reduction of lung inflammation is one of the goals of cystic fibrosis therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are often used in this respect to treat children and adults with cystic fibrosis. The rationale for this is their potential to reduce lung damage arising from inflammation, as well as their effect on symptomatic wheezing. It is important to establish the current level of evidence for the risks and benefits of inhaled corticosteroids, especially in the light of their known adverse effects on growth. This is an update of a previously published review; however, due to the lack of research in this area, we do not envisage undertaking any further updates.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of taking regular inhaled corticosteroids compared to not taking them in children and adults with cystic fibrosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We requested information from pharmaceutical companies manufacturing inhaled corticosteroids and authors of identified trials. Date of most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 19 November 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials, published and unpublished, comparing inhaled corticosteroids to placebo or standard treatment in individuals with cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors assessed methodological quality and risk of bias in trials using established criteria and extracted data using standard pro formas. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

The searches identified 35 citations, of which 27 (representing 13 trials) were eligible for inclusion. These 13 trials reported the use of inhaled corticosteroids in 525 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 6 and 55 years. One was a withdrawal trial in 171 individuals who were already taking inhaled corticosteroids. Methodological quality and risk of bias were difficult to assess from published information. Objective measures of airway function were reported in most trials but were often incomplete and reported at different time points. We found no difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) or forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted in any of the trials, although the quality of the evidence was low due to risks of bias within the included trials and low participant numbers. We are uncertain whether inhaled corticosteroids result in an improvement in exercise tolerance, bronchial hyperreactivity or exacerbations as the quality of the evidence was very low. Data from one trial suggested that inhaled corticosteroids may make little or no difference to quality of life (low-quality evidence). Three trials reported adverse effects, but the quality of the evidence is low and so we are uncertain whether inhaled corticosteroids increase the risk of adverse effects. However, one study did show that growth was adversely affected by high doses of inhaled corticosteroids.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from these trials is of low to very low quality and insufficient to establish whether inhaled corticosteroids are beneficial in cystic fibrosis, but withdrawal in those already taking them has been shown to be safe. There is some evidence they may cause harm in terms of growth. It has not been established whether long-term use is beneficial in reducing lung inflammation, which should improve survival, but it is unlikely this will be proven conclusively in a randomised controlled trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors assessed methodological quality and risk of bias in trials using established criteria and extracted data using standard pro formas.

Main Results

The searches identified 34 citations, of which 26 (representing 13 trials) were eligible for inclusion. These 13 trials reported the use of inhaled corticosteroids in 506 people with cystic fibrosis aged between six and 55 years. One was a withdrawal trial in individuals who were already taking inhaled corticosteroids. Methodological quality and risk of bias were difficult to assess from published information. Many of the risk of bias judgements were unclear due to a lack of available information. Only two trials specified how participants were randomised and less than half of the included trials gave details on how allocation was concealed. Trials were generally judged to have a low risk of bias from blinding, except for two which were open label or did not use a placebo. There were some concerns that a number of trials had not been published in peer-reviewed journals, but the risk of bias from this was unclear. Inclusion criteria varied between trials, as did type and duration of treatment and timing of outcome assessments. Objective measures of airway function were reported in most trials but were often incomplete. Significant benefit has not been conclusively demonstrated. Four trials systematically documented adverse effects and growth was significantly affected in one study using high doses.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from these trials is insufficient to establish whether inhaled corticosteroids are beneficial in cystic fibrosis, but withdrawal in those already taking them has been shown to be safe. There is some evidence they may cause harm in terms of growth. It has not been established whether long-term use is beneficial in reducing lung inflammation, which should improve survival, but it is unlikely this will be proven conclusively in a randomised controlled trial.

### Regular treatment with formoterol and an inhaled corticosteroid versus regular treatment with salmeterol and an inhaled corticosteroid for chronic asthma: serious adverse events [^112hT7Pi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

An increase in serious adverse events with both regular formoterol and regular salmeterol in chronic asthma has been demonstrated in comparison with placebo in previous Cochrane reviews. This increase was significant in trials that did not randomise participants to an inhaled corticosteroid, but less certain in the smaller numbers of participants in trials that included an inhaled corticosteroid in the randomised treatment regimen.

Objectives

We set out to compare the risks of mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events in trials which have randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular formoterol versus regular salmeterol, when each are used with an inhaled corticosteroid as part of the randomised treatment.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Manufacturers' web sites of clinical trial registers were checked for unpublished trial data and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to formoterol and salmeterol were also checked. The date of the most recent search was July 2009.

Selection Criteria

Controlled clinical trials with a parallel design, recruiting patients of any age and severity of asthma were included if they randomised patients to treatment with regular formoterol versus regular salmeterol (each with a randomised inhaled corticosteroid), and were of at least 12 weeks duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review and extracted outcome data. Unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events were sought from the sponsors and authors.

Main Results

Eight studies met the eligibility criteria of the review recruiting 6,163 adults and adolescents. There were seven studies (involving 5,935 adults and adolescents) comparing formoterol and budesonide to salmeterol and fluticasone. All but one study administered the products as a combined inhaler, and most used formoterol 50 mcg and budesonide 400 mcg twice daily versus salmeterol 50 mcg and fluticasone 250 mcg twice daily. There were two deaths overall (one on each combination) and neither were thought to be related to asthma. There was no significant difference between treatment groups for non-fatal serious adverse events, either all-cause (Peto OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.59, I(2) = 26%) or asthma-related (Peto OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.26, I(2) = 33%). Over 23 weeks the rates for all-cause serious adverse events were 2.6% on formoterol and budesonide and 2.3% on salmeterol and fluticasone, and for asthma-related serious adverse events, 0.6% and 0.8% respectively. There was one study (228 adults) comparing formoterol and beclomethasone to salmeterol and fluticasone, but there were no deaths or hospital admissions. No studies were found in children.

Authors' Conclusions

The seven identified studies in adults did not show any significant difference in safety between formoterol and budesonide in comparison with salmeterol and fluticasone. Asthma-related serious adverse events were rare, and there were no reported asthma-related deaths. There was a single small study comparing formoterol and beclomethasone to salmeterol and fluticasone in adults, but no serious adverse events occurred in this study. No studies were found in children. Overall there is insufficient evidence to decide whether regular formoterol and budesonide or beclomethasone have equivalent or different safety profiles from salmeterol and fluticasone.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111asRpC]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and lung cancer incidence in COPD — evidence is mixed: "Several retrospective analyses of large databases or observational cohorts have suggested a reduction in lung cancer risk with the use of ICS but confounding factors have not been consistently controlled for in all studies". Reported protective effects were "more pronounced" in former versus current smokers, in those with a concurrent diagnosis of asthma, and in those "prescribed a higher dose of ICS". A systematic review that included "two observational studies and 4 RCTs" found a protective effect in observational high-dose ICS studies but "no benefit in the RCTs". By contrast, analyses designed to avoid immortal time bias and an observational study "(> 65,000 patients) reported no effect of ICS use on lung cancer incidence", while "one database study reported an increased risk of lung cancer in patients prescribed ICS compared to those not prescribed ICS". Large prospective RCTs with endpoint adjudication reported "no difference in cancer deaths in patients randomized to ICS versus non-ICS use".

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115mUwa7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Inhaled vs. systemic corticosteroids in asthma… [^1136w8kt]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for the treatment of severe asthma exacerbations that require hospitalization call for the use of systemic corticosteroids. The use of inhaled corticosteroids in emergency department treatment of asthma has been examined and has been proved effective. The use of inhaled corticosteroids could reduce the need for systemic corticosteroids and the side effects of these medications. Lee-Wong and associates hypothesized that the use of high-dosage, inhaled corticosteroids after an initial period of intravenous corticosteroids in hospitalized asthma patients could be as well tolerated and effective as oral corticosteroids. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adult patients with severe asthma exacerbation who were admitted to the hospital for treatment. Admitted patients met criteria for hospitalization, and the decision to admit was made by a physician who was not involved in the study.

All patients were treated with inhaled beta agonists every four hours as needed and with 40 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone every six hours for 48 hours. Participants were randomized to receive eight puffs of flunisolide via a spacer twice daily or placebo. This therapy was initiated within 12 hours of admission. After 48 hours, the intravenous corticosteroid was discontinued, and patients began a course of therapy with oral prednisone or placebo. Patients who had received flunisolide were given placebo instead of prednisone. A follow-up visit was scheduled on day 7 of the study. Outcomes, which were measured on days 1 and 7, included peak expiratory flow rates, forced expiratory volume in one second, and symptom scores. Secondary outcome measures included hospital readmissions, emergency department revisits, and length of hospital stay.

There was no difference in demographics or baseline pulmonary studies between the group that received inhaled corticosteroids and the group that received oral prednisone. The results of improved peak expiratory flow rates and FEV. 1 were similar between the two groups. In addition, symptom scores were improved in both groups, with no difference noted. There were no hospital readmissions in either treatment group, and there was no difference between the groups with regard to length of hospital stay. The authors conclude that high-dosage inhaled corticosteroids are as effective as systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with severe asthma. The use of inhaled corticosteroids can reduce the adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids. In addition, the use of high-dosage inhaled corticosteroids appears to be well tolerated when delivered via a spacer unit.

Intermittent inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dosing — operational definitions for this section are as follows: Intermittent ICS dosing includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), and does not refer to a single regimen with its definition specified in each recommendation; controller therapy refers to medications taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma; the terms ICS-LABA and ICS-formoterol indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler; quick-relief therapy refers to medications such as an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations, and in this section as-needed dosing is intermittent and based on the patient's decision; the definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICS are based on EPR-3; a puff refers to a single actuation and inhalation; and recurrent wheezing is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

Inhaled corticosteroid dose categories and monitoring: The table of low, medium and high doses of various inhaled corticosteroids, alone or in combination with LABA, does not imply potency equivalence; if switching from a 'medium' dose of one inhaled corticosteroid to a 'medium' dose of another, this may represent a decrease or increase in potency with risks of instability or adverse effects, and after any change of treatment or inhaler device, patients should be monitored to ensure stability.

### Inhaled corticosteroids versus long-acting beta (2)-agonists for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111pwwFW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting beta(2)-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids can be used as maintenance therapy by patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These interventions are often taken together in a combination inhaler. However, the relative added value of the two individual components is unclear.

Objectives

To determine the relative effects of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) compared to long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABA) on clinical outcomes in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (latest search August 2011) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta(2)-agonists in the treatment of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and then extracted data on trial quality, study outcomes and adverse events. We also contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

We identified seven randomised trials (5997 participants) of good quality with a duration of six months to three years. All of the trials compared ICS/LABA combination inhalers with LABA and ICS as individual components. Four of these trials included fluticasone and salmeterol monocomponents and the remaining three included budesonide and formoterol monocomponents. There was no statistically significant difference in our primary outcome, the number of patients experiencing exacerbations (odds ratio (OR) 1.22; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67), or the rate of exacerbations per patient year (rate ratio (RR) 0.96; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.02) between inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta(2)-agonists. The incidence of pneumonia, our co-primary outcome, was significantly higher among patients on inhaled corticosteroids than on long-acting beta(2)-agonists whether classified as an adverse event (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.73) or serious adverse event (Peto OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.93). Results of the secondary outcomes analysis were as follows. Mortality was higher in patients on inhaled corticosteroids compared to patients on long-acting beta(2)-agonists (Peto OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.42), although the difference was not statistically significant. Patients treated with beta(2)-agonists showed greater improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV₁ compared to those treated with inhaled corticosteroids (mean difference (MD) 18.99 mL; 95% CI 0.52 to 37.46), whilst greater improvements in health-related quality of life were observed in patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids compared to those receiving long-acting beta(2)-agonists (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) MD -0.74; 95% CI -1.42 to -0.06). In both cases the differences were statistically significant but rather small in magnitude. There were no statistically significant differences between ICS and LABA in the number of hospitalisations due to exacerbations, number of mild exacerbations, peak expiratory flow, dyspnoea, symptoms scores, use of rescue medication, adverse events, all cause hospitalisations, or withdrawals from studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Placebo-controlled trials have established the benefits of both long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy for COPD patients as individual therapies. This review, which included trials allowing comparisons between LABA and ICS, has shown that the two therapies confer similar benefits across the majority of outcomes, including the frequency of exacerbations and mortality. Use of long-acting beta-agonists appears to confer a small additional benefit in terms of improvements in lung function compared to inhaled corticosteroids. On the other hand, inhaled corticosteroid therapy shows a small advantage over long-acting beta-agonist therapy in terms of health-related quality of life, but inhaled corticosteroids also increase the risk of pneumonia. This review supports current guidelines advocating long-acting beta-agonists as frontline therapy for COPD, with regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy as an adjunct in patients experiencing frequent exacerbations.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for asthma: common clinical quandaries [^113K8Ar4]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

This narrative review provides evidence-based explanations to some of the common clinical concerns regarding inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for a newly diagnosed asthmatic patient. Better results are obtained when treatment is initiated as soon as the diagnosis is made. Asthma control can be achieved and maintained in most patients with a low or moderate dose of inhaled corticosteroid administered in two daily doses. Longer duration of treatment provides more sustained benefits than treatment that is intermittent and for short periods of time. The clinical benefits can be observed within 24 hours of commencing treatment and may be more pronounced in patients with an eosinophilic bronchitis. Inhaled corticosteroids provide additional benefit when used in conjunction with prednisone in acute severe asthma. Low doses do not have clinically deleterious side effects on the bones, growth, eye, or hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis. However, they do not normalize lung function and prevent structural changes in the airway wall in all asthmatic patients.

### The dose-response characteristics of inhaled corticosteroids when used to treat asthma: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^111TEgUF]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids form the cornerstone of treatment for most patients with asthma. A range of compounds are available with a wide range of prescribable doses. In this overview, we summarize the findings from a number of Cochrane systematic reviews that have examined the relative benefits of different doses of beclometasone dipropionate, budesonide and fluticasone propionate when used to treat children and adults. The key findings are that all inhaled corticosteroids demonstrate a dose-response relationship for efficacy measures, but most of the benefit in mild-to-moderate severity disease is gained in the low-to-moderate dose range of each drug. In this group, high doses of fluticasone lead to small improvements in measures of control at the expense of a steep increase in the incidence of oral side-effects. In patients with severe disease who are dependent on oral steroids, there may be appreciable benefit in reducing oral steroids from very high compared with high doses of fluticasone.

### The effect of adding inhaled corticosteroids to tiotropium and long-acting beta (2)-agonists for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116RSxew]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting bronchodilators comprising long-acting beta(2)-agonists and the anticholinergic agent tiotropium are commonly used, either on their own or in combination, for managing persistent symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are symptomatic and who suffer repeated exacerbations are recommended to add inhaled corticosteroids to their bronchodilator treatment. However, the benefits and risks of adding inhaled corticosteroid to tiotropium and long-acting beta(2)-agonists for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are unclear.

Objectives

To assess the relative effects of adding inhaled corticosteroids to tiotropium and long-acting beta(2)-agonists treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (February 2011) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel group, randomised controlled trials of three months or longer comparing inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta(2)-agonist combination therapy in addition to inhaled tiotropium against tiotropium and long-acting beta(2)-agonist treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and then extracted data on trial quality and the outcome results. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

Main Results

One trial (293 patients) was identified comparing tiotropium in addition to inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta(2)-agonist combination therapy to tiotropium plus long-acting beta(2)-agonist. The study was of good methodological quality, however it suffered from high and uneven withdrawal rates between the treatment arms. There is currently insufficient evidence to know how much difference the addition of inhaled corticosteroids makes to people who are taking tiotropium and a long-acting beta(2)-agonist for COPD.

Authors' Conclusions

The relative efficacy and safety of adding inhaled corticosteroid to tiotropium and a long-acting beta(2)-agonist for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients remains uncertain and additional trials are required to answer this question.

### Comparing clinical features of the nebulizer, metered-dose inhaler, and dry powder inhaler [^113QQF5C]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Topically inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These medications are delivered via jet or ultrasonic nebulizer, metered-dose inhaler (MDI), or dry powder inhaler (DPI). While the number of devices may be confusing to patients and clinicians, each device has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Most clinical evidence shows that any of these devices will work for most situations, including exacerbations and in the stable outpatient setting. There is a high rate of errors in device use with all these devices, especially the MDI. In choosing a drug/device combination for a patient, the clinician must take into account several factors, including the cognitive and physical ability of the patient, ease of use, convenience, costs, and patient preferences. Clinicians should also have a rudimentary understanding of aerosol principles in order to be able to teach appropriate use of aerosol devices to their patients.

### Inhaled glucocorticoids and adrenal function: an update [^116S18pM]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

For the vast majority of asthmatic children, treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids is safe and effective. Mild impairment of adrenal function of doubtful clinical significance is known to occur in some children inhaling ≥ 400 micro g/day budesonide and beclomethasone or ≥ 200 micro g fluticasone. Recent reports of life-threatening adrenal failure in asthmatic children inhaling glucocorticoids, some of whom were prescribed licensed doses, have prompted the recommendation that the use of high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids, particularly fluticasone, should be avoided. However, the importance of correctly diagnosing asthma, of using the minimum dose of inhaled glucocorticoid required for symptom control and of regular growth-velocity assessment cannot be over-emphasised. Appropriate asthma management including the early introduction of steroid-sparing agents such as a long-acting beta-agonist or leukotriene antagonist may reduce the morbidity associated with inhaled glucocorticoid use but some children, for reasons as yet unknown, may exhibit increased sensitivity to the systemic effects of inhaled glucocorticoid treatment. Possible explanations for this, with reference to the pharmacology and molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid action, are accompanied in this review by a summary of the recent case reports and discussion of assessment of adrenal function.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111MY3VB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial treatment for safety and clinical efficacy — For asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are essential, either alone or in combination with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not treat with LABA and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without ICS. For patients with features of both asthma and COPD, treat as asthma; ICS-containing therapy is important to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not give LABA and/or LAMA alone without ICS. For COPD, treat according to current recommendations from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), i.e., initial treatment with LAMA and LABA, plus as-needed SABA.

### Bringing asthma care into the twenty-first century [^111ww9tM]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Our current understanding is that asthma is a common and potentially life-threatening chronic inflammatory airway disease, with different phenotypes, characterised by variable airflow obstruction and, even in mild cases, with unpredictable, recurrent episodes of worsening symptoms. Typical symptoms include wheeze, cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness that can vary in intensity over time, spontaneously or with pharmacological treatment. Periods of symptom breakthroughs, commonly due to fluctuating inflammatory activity, can develop into exacerbations that may require urgent healthcare and, in some cases, may even be fatal – (Fig. 1). Although exacerbations are more common and of greater severity in patients whose asthma is poorly controlled or more severe, even patients with mild asthma are at risk of breakthrough symptoms and exacerbations.

Fig. 1
Variability of inflammation and symptoms.

Hypothetical illustration of asthma: a disease of chronic inflammation, with episodes of worsening inflammation associated with increased (breakthrough) symptoms and/or exacerbations.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were first introduced as an anti-inflammatory treatment in the 1970s, and despite subsequent advances in our understanding of asthma and its various phenotypes, new medications and inhaler devices, and evidence-based management guidelines, asthma-related morbidity (i.e. uncontrolled asthma and exacerbations) are still a widespread problem although mortality rates have declined.

In this review, we aim to address key issues, review recent evidence and provide practical answers to the question of how we can optimise current management of asthma and bring the care of this common disease into the twenty-first century.

### Dangers of under-treatment and over-treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma [^111cFjoE]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Asthma exacerbations and asthma medication side effects are well‐described. However, they rarely cause death or near death in children. Asthma guidelines represent a comprehensive encyclopedia of information for asthma diagnosis and treatment and recommendations that, if followed, are expected to prevent mortality. We describe two illustrative cases in children and explore the possibility that care driven by recommendations in asthma guidelines and FDA package labels would have prevented such outcomes.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in lung diseases [^112ptBcq]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are used extensively in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to their broad antiinflammatory effects. They improve lung function, symptoms, and quality of life and reduce exacerbations in both conditions but do not alter the progression of disease. They decrease mortality in asthma but not COPD. The available ICSs vary in their therapeutic index and potency. Although ICSs are used in all age groups, younger and smaller children may be at a greater risk for adverse systemic effects because they can receive higher mg/kg doses of ICSs compared with older children. Most of the benefit from ICSs occurs in the low to medium dose range. Minimal additional improvement is seen with higher doses, although some patients may benefit from higher doses. Although ICSs are the preferred agents for managing persistent asthma in all ages, their benefit in COPD is more controversial. When used appropriately, ICSs have few adverse events at low to medium doses, but risk increases with high-dose ICSs. Although several new drugs are being developed and evaluated, it is unlikely that any of these new medications will replace ICSs as the preferred initial long-term controller therapy for asthma, but more effective initial controller therapy could be developed for COPD.

### Update on glucocorticoid action and resistance [^116uBHnc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Extensive development of inhaled and oral glucocorticoids has resulted in highly potent molecules that have been optimized to target activity to the lung and minimize systemic exposure. These have proved highly effective for most asthmatic subjects, but despite these developments, there are a number of subjects with asthma who fail to respond to even high doses of inhaled or even oral glucocorticoids. Advances in delineating the fundamental mechanisms of glucocorticoid pharmacology, especially the concepts of transactivation and transrepression and cofactor recruitment, have resulted in better understanding of the molecular mechanisms whereby glucocorticoids suppress inflammation. The existence of multiple mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid insensitivity raises the possibility that this might indeed reflect different diseases with a common phenotype, and studies examining the efficacy of potential new agents should be targeted toward subgroups of patients with severe corticosteroid-resistant asthma who clearly require effective new drugs and other approaches to improved asthma control.

### Stepping down the dose of inhaled corticosteroids for adults with asthma [^114Fb7SW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a condition of the airways affecting more than 300 million adults and children worldwide. National and international guidelines recommend titrating up the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to gain symptom control at the lowest possible dose because long-term use of higher doses of ICS carries a risk of systemic adverse events. For patients whose asthma symptoms are controlled on moderate or higher doses of ICS, it may be possible to reduce the dose of ICS without compromising symptom control.

Objectives

To evaluate the evidence for stepping down ICS treatment in adults with well-controlled asthma who are already receiving a moderate or high dose of ICS.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Airways Group and conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/). We searched all databases from their inception with no restriction on language. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We performed the most recent search in July 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration and excluded cross-over trials. We looked for studies of adults (aged ≥ 18 years) whose asthma had been well controlled for a minimum of three months on at least a moderate dose of ICS. We excluded studies that enrolled participants with any other respiratory comorbidity. We included trials comparing a reduction in the dose of ICS versus no change in the dose of ICS in people with well-controlled asthma who a) were not taking a concomitant long-acting beta agonist (LABA; comparison 1), and b) were taking a concomitant LABA (comparison 2).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included studies, extracted data on prespecified outcomes of interest and assessed the risk of bias of included studies; we resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) using study participants as the unit of analysis and analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included six studies, which randomised a total of 1654 participants (ICS dose reduction, no concomitant LABA (comparison 1): n = 892 participants, three RCTs; ICS dose reduction, concomitant LABA (comparison 2): n = 762 participants, three RCTs). All included studies were RCTs with a parallel design that compared a fixed dose of ICS versus a 50% to 60% reduction in the dose of ICS in adult participants with well-controlled asthma. The duration of the treatment period ranged from 12 to 52 weeks (mean duration 21 weeks; median duration 14 weeks). Two studies were performed in the setting of primary care, two were performed in the secondary care setting and two reported no information on setting. Meta-analysis was hampered by the small number of studies contributing to each comparison, combined with heterogeneity among outcomes reported in the included studies. We found the quality of synthesised evidence to be low or very low for most outcomes considered because of a risk of bias (principally, selective reporting), imprecision and indirectness. Although we found no statistically significant or clinically relevant differences between groups with respect to any of the primary or secondary outcomes considered in this review, the data were insufficient to rule out benefit or harm.

Authors' Conclusions

The strength of the evidence is not sufficient to determine whether stepping down the dose of ICS is of net benefit (in terms of fewer adverse effects) or harm (in terms of reduced effectiveness of treatment) for adult patients with well-controlled asthma. A small number of relevant studies and varied outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Additional well-designed RCTs of longer duration are needed to inform clinical practice regarding use of a 'stepping down ICS' strategy for patients with well-controlled asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1157R5if]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 9–5 — discharge medications after acute care for asthma advises to initiate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment if not already being taken; for adults/adolescents, maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS–formoterol (MART) is preferred and, for adults/adolescents, start MART at Step 4 on discharge; if prescribing an ICS regimen with short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever, step the maintenance dose up for 2–4 weeks and emphasize adherence and inhaler technique. To reduce relapse risk, prescribe at least a 5–7 day course of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for adults (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and 3–5 days for children (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) (Evidence A); review progress before ceasing OCS, and if the OCS is dexamethasone, treatment is only for total 1–2 days, with switching to prednisolone considered if there is failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

### Expected characteristics of an ideal, all-purpose inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma [^117VdEg6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are well established as the mainstay of asthma therapy. A number of ICSs are now available, each with unique pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and physical characteristics.

Objective

This article reviews the key characteristics of an ideal ICS and uses examples of existing agents to indicate the extent to which therapies reach these goals.

Results

Improved therapeutic efficacy in an ICS may be offset by an increase in systemic effects. The ideal characteristics of an ICS include optimal clinical efficacy and no toxicity in combination with a convenient and easy-to-use inhaler device. To achieve this optimal profile, an ICS should have the following: a high affinity for and potency at the glucocorticoid receptor; prolonged retention in the lung; minimal or no oral bioavailability (ie, high first-pass inactivation); and rapid, complete systemic inactivation. The formulation and type of inhaler device are also important considerations: they should provide deposition in the lung in both large and small airways with no absorption effects outside the lung. ICSs should be evaluated for administration with several different delivery devices to ensure ease of use by patients of all ages with different asthma severities. An ICS that can be administered QD is also likely to improve patient adherence by simplifying the treatment regimen.

Conclusion

An ideal ICS should have a large therapeutic margin, be used safely and effectively for long periods, be administered QD, be suitable for use in patients of all ages and asthma severities, and offer both control and prevention of asthma symptoms and exacerbations.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115z1egX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations or "attacks" during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans may advocate doubling the dose of inhaled steroids in the early stages of an asthma exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of a patient-initiated action plan for home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to March 2016. We handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared increased versus stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies of children or adults with persistent asthma who were receiving daily maintenance ICS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

Main Results

This review update added three new studies including 419 participants to the review. In total, we identified eight RCTs, most of which were at low risk of bias, involving 1669 participants with mild to moderate asthma. We included three paediatric (n = 422) and five adult (n = 1247) studies; six were parallel-group trials and two had a cross-over design. All but one study followed participants for six months to one year. Allowed maintenance doses of ICS varied in adult and paediatric studies, as did use of concomitant medications and doses of ICS initiated during exacerbations. Investigators gave participants a study inhaler containing additional ICS or placebo to be started as part of an action plan for treatment of exacerbations. The odds of treatment failure, defined as the need for oral corticosteroids, were not significantly reduced among those randomised to increased ICS compared with those taking their usual stable maintenance dose (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.18; participants = 1520; studies = 7). When we analysed only people who actually took their study inhaler for an exacerbation, we found much variation between study results but the evidence did not show a significant benefit of increasing ICS dose (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; participants = 766; studies = 7). The odds of having an unscheduled physician visit (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.41; participants = 931; studies = 3) or acute visit (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.98; participants = 450; studies = 3) were not significantly reduced by an increased versus stable dose of ICS, and evidence was insufficient to permit assessment of impact on the duration of exacerbation; our ability to draw conclusions from these outcomes was limited by the number of studies reporting these events and by the number of events included in the analyses. The odds of serious events (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; participants = 394; studies = 2) and non-serious events, such as oral irritation, headaches and changes in appetite (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; participants = 142; studies = 2), were neither increased nor decreased significantly by increased versus stable doses of ICS during an exacerbation. Too few studies are available to allow firm conclusions on the basis of subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, doses used, smoking history and the fold increase of ICS on the magnitude of effect; yet, effect size appears similar in children and adults.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support increasing the dose of ICS as part of a self initiated action plan to treat exacerbations in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma. Increased ICS dose is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids for the exacerbation, or of having adverse events, compared with a stable ICS dose. Wide confidence intervals for several outcomes mean we cannot rule out possible benefits of this approach.

### Corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma [^112MC3M8]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterised by reversible airflow obstruction in response to a variety of stimuli. Exacerbations in response to airway irritants are part of the natural history of asthma, but often they also represent a failure in chronic treatment. Presentations to emergency departments and other acute care settings are common and frequently lead to hospitalisation and other complications. After treatment, however, most patients are discharged to the care of their primary care physician for further management. This review highlights the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids as mainstays of treatment in the acute and sub-acute phase of an exacerbation. These agents form the basis of most current clinical practice guidelines, yet their use is not universal. We will review the evidence for the use of these agents that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews contained in the Cochrane Library.

### Stopping long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) for adults with asthma well controlled by LABA and inhaled corticosteroids [^115yhppk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Poorly controlled asthma often leads to preventable exacerbations that require additional medications, as well as unscheduled hospital and clinic visits. Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) are commonly given to adults with asthma whose symptoms are not well controlled by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). US and UK regulators have issued warnings for LABA in asthma, and now recommend they be used "for the shortest duration of time required to achieve control of asthma symptoms and discontinued, if possible, once asthma control is achieved".

Objectives

To compare cessation of long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) versus continued use of LABA/inhaled corticosteroids (LABA/ICS) for adults whose asthma is well controlled, and to determine whether stopping LABA:1. results in loss of asthma control or deterioration in quality of life;2. increases the likelihood of asthma attacks or 'exacerbations'; or3. increases or decreases the likelihood of serious adverse events of any cause.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), www. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.who.int/ictrp/en/, reference lists of primary studies and existing reviews and manufacturers' trial registries (GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and AstraZeneca). We searched all databases from their inception to April 2015, and we imposed no restriction on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We looked for parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least eight weeks' duration, in which adults whose asthma was well controlled by any dose of ICS+LABA combination therapy were randomly assigned to (1) step-down therapy to ICS alone versus (2) continuation of ICS and LABA.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all records identified by the search strategy. We used an Excel extraction tool to manage searches, document reasons for inclusion and exclusion and extract descriptive and numerical data from trials meeting inclusion criteria. Prespecified primary outcomes were (1) exacerbations requiring oral steroids, (2) asthma control and (3) all-cause serious adverse events.

Main Results

Six randomised, double-blind studies between 12 and 24 weeks' long met the inclusion criteria. Five studies contributed data to the meta-analysis, assigning 2781 people with stable asthma to the comparison of interest. The definition of stable asthma and inclusion criteria varied across studies, and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria were not used. Risk of bias across studies was generally low, and most evidence was rated as moderate quality. Stopping LABA might increase the number of people having exacerbations and requiring oral corticosteroids (odds ratio (OR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 3.65; participants = 1257; studies = 4), although the confidence intervals did not exclude the possibility that stopping LABA was beneficial; over 17 weeks, 19 people per 1000 who continued their LABA had an exacerbation, compared with 32 per 1000 when LABA were stopped (13 more per 1000, 95% CI 3 fewer to 46 more). People who stopped LABA had worse scores on the Asthma Control Questionnaire (mean difference (MD) 0.24, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.35; participants = 645; studies = 3) and on measures of asthma-related quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57; participants = 359; studies = 2) than those who continued LABA, but the effects were not clinically relevant. Too few events occurred for investigators to tell whether stopping LABA has a greater effect on serious adverse events compared with continuing LABA+ICS (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.42; participants = 1342; studies = 5), and no study reported exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation as a separate outcome. Stopping LABA may result in fewer adverse events of any kind compared with continuing, although the effect was not statistically significant (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05; participants = 1339; studies = 5), and stopping LABA made people more likely to withdraw from participation in research studies (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.58; participants = 1352; studies = 5).

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggests that stopping LABA in adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and ICS inhalers may increase the likelihood of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with oral corticosteroids, but this is not certain. Stopping LABA may slightly reduce asthma control and quality of life, but evidence was insufficient to show whether this had an effect on important outcomes such as serious adverse events and exacerbations requiring hospital admission, and longer trials are warranted. Trialists should include patient-important outcomes such as asthma control and quality of life and should use validated measurement tools. Definitions of exacerbations should be provided.

### Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists as potential anti-inflammatory agents in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1141q9Xr]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2006). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective therapy for chronic persistent asthma and have a role in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, corticosteroids have reduced efficacy in some patients with asthma and fail to halt the progressive deterioration in lung function characteristic of COPD. Additional or alternative drug treatments to corticosteroids are required to improve control of inflammation in patients with therapy resistant airway disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists have displayed potent anti-inflammatory properties in experimental models of asthma and other airway diseases and as a result have the potential to become an additional treatment for asthma and COPD. We review the evidence from these experimental models and their applicability to asthma and COPD and the requirements for future clinical and experimental research.

### Inhaled corticosteroids with combination inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117XoVDs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly involves a combination of long-acting bronchodilators including beta2-agonists (LABA) and muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). LABA and LAMA bronchodilators are now available in single-combination inhalers. In individuals with persistent symptoms or frequent exacerbations, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are also used with combination LABA and LAMA inhalers. However, the benefits and risks of adding ICS to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers as a triple therapy remain unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of adding an ICS to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers for the treatment of stable COPD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase up to 30 November 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP up to 30 November 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials of three weeks' duration or longer that compared the treatment of stable COPD with ICS in addition to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers against combination LABA/LAMA inhalers alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were acute exacerbations of COPD, respiratory health-related quality of life, pneumonia and other serious adverse events. The secondary outcomes were symptom scores, lung function, physical capacity, and mortality. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for studies that contributed data to our prespecified outcomes.

Main Results

Four studies with a total of 15,412 participants met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of study participants ranged from 64.4 to 65.3 years; the proportion of female participants ranged from 28% to 40%. Most participants had symptomatic COPD (COPD Assessment Test Score ≥ 10) with severe to very severe airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) < 50% predicted) and one or more moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations in the last 12 months. Trial medications differed amongst studies. The duration of follow-up was 52 weeks in three studies and 24 weeks in one study. We assessed the risk of selection, performance, and detection bias to be low in the included studies; one study was at high risk of attrition bias, and one study was at high risk of reporting bias. Triple therapy may reduce rates of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations compared to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers (rate ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.81; n = 15,397; low-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis stratifying by blood eosinophil counts showed there may be a greater reduction in rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations with triple therapy in participants with high-eosinophils (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.75) compared to low-eosinophils (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.93) (test for subgroup differences: P < 0.01) (high/low cut-offs: 150 eosinophils/µL in three studies; 200 eosinophils/µL in one study). However, moderate-to-substantial heterogeneity was observed in both high- and low-eosinophil subgroups. These subgroup analyses are observational by nature and thus results should be interpreted with caution. Triple therapy may be associated with reduced rates of severe COPD exacerbations (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.84; n = 14,131; low-certainty evidence). Triple therapy improved health-related quality of life assessed using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) by the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) threshold (4-point decrease) (35.3% versus 42.4%, odds ratio (OR) 1.35, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.45; n = 14,070; high-certainty evidence). Triple therapy may result in fewer symptoms measured using the Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.57; n = 3044; moderate-certainty evidence) and improved lung function as measured by change in trough FEV1 (mean difference 38.68 mL, 95% CI 22.58 to 54.77; n = 11,352; low-certainty evidence). However, these benefits fell below MCID thresholds for TDI (1-unit decrease) and trough FEV1 (100 mL), respectively. Triple therapy is probably associated with a higher risk of pneumonia as a serious adverse event compared to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers (3.3% versus 1.9%, OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.18; n = 15,412; moderate-certainty evidence). In contrast, all-cause serious adverse events may be similar between groups (19.7% versus 19.7%, OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; n = 15,412; low-certainty evidence). All-cause mortality may be lower with triple therapy (1.4% versus 2.0%, OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90; n = 15,397; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that triple therapy may reduce rates of COPD exacerbations (low-certainty evidence) and results in an improvement in health-related quality of life (high-certainty evidence) compared to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers, but probably confers an increased pneumonia risk as a serious adverse event (moderate-certainty evidence). Triple therapy probably improves respiratory symptoms and may improve lung function (moderate- and low-certainty evidence, respectively); however, these benefits do not appear to be clinically significant. Triple therapy may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality compared to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers (low-certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was downgraded most frequently for inconsistency or indirectness. Across the four included studies, there were important differences in inclusion criteria, trial medications, and duration of follow-up. Investigation of heterogeneity was limited due to the small number of included studies. We found limited data on the effects of triple therapy compared to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers in patients with mild-moderate COPD and those without a recent exacerbation history.

### Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) plus long-acting β-agonist (LABA) versus LABA plus inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^112p64Qh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Three classes of inhaler medications are used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): long-acting beta-agonists (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). When two classes of medications are required, LAMA plus LABA (LAMA+LABA) and LABA plus ICS (LABA+ICS) are often selected because these combinations can be administered via a single medication device. The previous Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidance recommended LABA+ICS as the first-line treatment for managing stable COPD in high-risk people of categories C and D. However, the updated GOLD 2017 guidance recommends LAMA+LABA over LABA+ICS.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of LAMA+LABA versus LABA+ICS for treatment of people with stable COPD.

Search Methods

We performed an electronic search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (2 February 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (4 June 2016), and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal (4 June 2016), followed by a handsearch (5 June 2016). Two review authors screened and scrutinised the selected articles.

Selection Criteria

We included individual randomised controlled trials, parallel-group trials, and cross-over trials comparing LAMA+LABA and LABA+ICS for stable COPD. The minimum accepted trial duration was one month and trials should have been conducted in an outpatient setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (OR), and continuous data as mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI) using Review Manager 5. Exacerbations were measured by counting the number of people experiencing one or more exacerbation.

Main Results

We included 11 studies comprising 9839 participants in our quantitative analysis. Most studies included people with moderate to severe COPD, without recent exacerbations. One pharmaceutical sponsored trial that included only people with recent exacerbations was the largest study and accounted for 37% of participants. All but one study were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, thus we rated them as having a high risk of 'other bias'. The unsponsored study was at high risk of performance and detection bias, and possible selective reporting. Five studies recruited GOLD Category B participants, one study recruited Category D participants, two studies recruited Category A/B participants, and three studies recruited participants regardless of category. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 52 weeks. Compared to the LABA+ICS arm, the results for the pooled primary outcomes for the LAMA+LABA arm were as follows: exacerbations, OR 0.82 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.96, P = 0.01, I² = 17%, low quality evidence); serious adverse events (SAE), OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.05, P = 0.18, I² = 0, moderate quality evidence); St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score change from the baseline, MD -1.22 (95% CI -2.52 to 0.07, P = 0.06, I² = 71%, low quality evidence); and trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) change from the baseline, MD 0.08 L (95% CI 0.06 to 0.09, P < 0.0001, I² = 50%, moderate quality evidence). Compared to the LABA+ICS arm, the results for the pooled secondary outcomes for the LAMA+LABA arm were as follows: pneumonia, OR 0.57 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79, P = 0.0006, I² = 0%, low quality evidence); all-cause death, OR 1.01 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.67, P = 0.88, I² = 0%, low quality evidence); and SGRQ total score change from the baseline of 4 points or greater (the minimal clinically important difference for the SGRQ is 4 points), OR 1.25 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.44, P = 0.002, I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

For the treatment of COPD, LAMA+LABA has fewer exacerbations, a larger improvement of FEV 1, a lower risk of pneumonia, and more frequent improvement in quality of life as measured by an increase over 4 units or more of the SGRQ. These data were supported by low or moderate quality evidence generated from mainly participants with moderate to severe COPD in heterogeneous trials with an observation period of less than one year. Our findings support the recently updated GOLD guidance.

### Comparative effectiveness of long term drug treatment strategies to prevent asthma exacerbations: network meta-analysis [^116Gi1Qf]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Our approach is novel in that it includes all published treatment options in a single analysis, allowing quantitative ranking of all the available evidence. Our findings confirm and extend previous focused studies based on direct pairwise comparisons of treatments. Two meta-analyses, a Cochrane reviewand an industry sponsored analysis, favoured combined maintenance and reliever treatment over specific comparators in reducing severe exacerbations, including combined fixed dose treatment. In the more extensive analysis of the present study, apart from combined maintenance and reliever treatment and combined fixed dose treatment, treatment strategies involving an inhaled corticosteroid and another agent, whether in one device or two devices, did not perform statistically significantly better than our reference strategy, low dose inhaled corticosteroids. The combined strategies performed equally well in preventing severe exacerbations, an observation challenging a previous meta-analysis of six studies, four of which were of 4–12 weeks' duration. The meta-analysis concluded that the addition of long acting β agonists to inhaled corticosteroids was favoured over the addition of leukotriene receptor antagonists. In our network meta-analysis, in which inhaled corticosteroid doses were classified as either low or moderate or high, we were unable to confirm the previously reported positive effects of increasing doses of inhaled corticosteroids in preventing exacerbations. This is probably because in the included studies the intervention of inhaled corticosteroid dose was typically double that of the control inhaled corticosteroid dose, but both doses may still have fallen within either our low dose or moderate or high dose inhaled corticosteroid categories. Another explanation may be underlying differences in the original patient populations. For example, there were differences in baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (%) predicted between patients in trials using high dose inhaled corticosteroids (median 72.2%, range 64.0–95.5%, interquartile range 69.0–75.4%) and those using low dose inhaled corticosteroids (median 82.3%, range 65.6–102.0%, interquartile range 75.4–88.8%). For severe exacerbations as well as the composite of moderate or severe exacerbations, low dose inhaled corticosteroids seemed to be superior to regular short or long acting β agonists or to leukotriene receptor antagonists alone, a finding that has been observed previously.
