Discoid lupus er

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and wants a synthesis that preserves the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining DLE and situating it within cutaneous lupus. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and risk of progression to SLE. Next, I will review clinical morphology and diagnostic criteria, including histopathology and ancillary tools. After that, I need to examine pathophysiology and biomarkers. Then, I will appraise treatment options and their evidence base, including special populations. Finally, I should outline monitoring, prognosis, and unmet needs, making sure I double-check any conflicting data points along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification. DLE is the most common subtype of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE), characterized by chronic, inflammatory, often photosensitive plaques that heal with atrophy, scarring, and dyspigmentation; importantly, it can occur as skin-limited disease or in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), so I need to ensure I keep systemic screening in mind from the outset [^117VGYnK] [^112GUqZ3].

> I should confirm epidemiology and progression risk. Wait, let me verify the adult progression estimates before I overstate them: classic teaching cites roughly 5–20% risk of progression from isolated DLE to SLE, but more recent cohorts suggest faster progression in some groups, with a median time to SLE of about 1.2 years in one series, which is substantially shorter than older means of ~8 years; pediatric cohorts show higher baseline SLE prevalence and progression, with 37–41% meeting SLE criteria at baseline in large multicenter series, so I need to be cautious about applying adult risk uniformly to children [^1163niu1] [^1121NKKc] [^112GUqZ3].

> Next, I should review clinical morphology and diagnostic features. DLE typically presents as well-demarcated, erythematous to violaceous, scaly plaques with follicular hyperkeratosis/plugging, often on the scalp, face, and ears; lesions evolve into atrophic scars with dyspigmentation and can cause permanent alopecia when the scalp is involved, so I need to check for scarring and pigment alteration carefully on exam [^117VGYnK] [^117J3GA5]. Hold on, I should verify the validated classification items that help distinguish DLE from mimickers: the JAMA Dermatology criteria include atrophic scarring, conchal bowl location, head/neck predilection, dyspigmentation, follicular hyperkeratosis/plugging, and erythematous/violaceous color, with a score ≥ 5 providing good discrimination, which I should apply when uncertain [^1131vg8v].

> I will now examine histopathology and ancillary diagnostics. The classic pattern is interface dermatitis with vacuolar degeneration, dermal mucin, and perivascular and periadnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate; direct immunofluorescence can show a "lumpy-bumpy" IgG/IgM at the dermal–epidermal junction, but I should confirm that DIF is not required for diagnosis and can be negative in some cases [^111RAZUn] [^117J3GA5]. Let me consider noninvasive tools: dermoscopy can reveal perifollicular whitish halos, follicular keratotic plugs, and telangiectasias correlating with histology, and reflectance confocal microscopy can visualize interface change and pigment incontinence, which may aid diagnosis and monitoring in select settings [^113q7qEZ] [^113y5mEj].

> Now, pathophysiology and biomarkers. I should double-check the interferon signature data: both SCLE and DLE show elevated type I interferon–regulated gene expression correlating with cutaneous disease activity, supporting a shared axis with SLE even in skin-limited disease; single-cell studies show expanded T, B, and NK cell subsets and enriched inflammatory fibroblast and keratinocyte programs in DLE lesions, reinforcing local immune activation [^113GxAxA] [^116NNPJW]. But wait, what if plasmacytoid dendritic cells are not the main IFN source in CLE? Recent multiplexed immunoprofiling suggests pDCs may not be the dominant IFN-1 producers in DLE/SCLE, so I should be cautious in attributing the IFN signature solely to pDCs and consider broader networks including keratinocytes and other myeloid cells [^117E1ne5].

> Let me think about treatment principles and first-line therapy. Photoprotection is mandatory for all patients; for localized disease, potent topical corticosteroids or intralesional triamcinolone are first-line, with topical calcineurin inhibitors as steroid-sparing options on sensitive areas; for widespread or refractory disease, systemic antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine are standard, with typical adult dosing of 200–400 mg daily, and I should confirm ophthalmologic screening protocols before prescribing [^113dWqyA] [^111furz6] [^117LdGu1]. Hold on, I should verify the evidence base: randomized data support potent topical steroids over low-potency agents, and a head-to-head RCT suggests hydroxychloroquine and acitretin have similar complete response rates, though acitretin has more adverse effects, which aligns with clinical experience favoring antimalarials first [^116KCnnU] [^1161rsGu].

> Next, I should review second-line and refractory options. Methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine are reasonable steroid-sparing immunosuppressants for recalcitrant disease; thalidomide and lenalidomide can induce dramatic responses but carry teratogenic and neuropathy risks, so I need to ensure strict REMS compliance and counseling if considered; case series and reports suggest sirolimus, apremilast, and TYK2/JAK inhibitors may help selected refractory cases, though high-quality data are limited [^113dWqyA] [^111gr5YA] [^114k1MBE] [^114BmuvM] [^112YgZVq]. Wait, let me verify the targeted biologic signal: anifrolumab, a type I IFN receptor antibody approved for SLE, has shown marked improvement in refractory DLE in adolescents and adults with SLE, with CLASI reductions documented in case series, indicating a promising pathway for IFN-high phenotypes [^1177cjTH] [^112zhXiU] [^114W2mCu].

> I need to ensure I address pediatric nuances. Children with DLE have higher rates of SLE at baseline and progression than adults, so baseline and longitudinal screening with CBC, urinalysis, ANA, ESR/CRP, complements, and liver/renal function is prudent; pediatric specialists converge on hydroxychloroquine as first-line systemic therapy, but consensus weakens beyond that, so I should individualize second-line choices and maintain close rheumatology co-management [^1121NKKc] [^116zuUfV]. Hold on, I should verify early progression risk: pediatric cohorts show greatest risk in the first year after DLE diagnosis, which supports tighter follow-up intervals initially [^115ERR86].

> Monitoring and prognosis come next. I should confirm that all patients with CLE warrant periodic screening for systemic involvement, typically at least annually with history, exam, and basic labs, with closer intervals in high-risk groups; risk factors for progression include young age at DLE onset, darker skin phototypes, generalized lesions, arthralgias, cytopenias, and high-titer ANA, and a simple scoring system incorporating age < 25, phototype V–VI, and ANA ≥ 1:320 stratifies severe SLE risk, which can guide counseling and surveillance intensity [^117VGYnK] [^113vt4zD] [^1111eiwq]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that DLE portends less severe SLE overall; some SLE cohorts with DLE show fewer renal manifestations, but I should avoid overgeneralization because population and selection effects vary, so I will frame this as a risk signal rather than a rule [^112u4Loj].

> Finally, I should review unmet needs and research directions. There are no FDA-approved therapies specifically for CLE/DLE beyond hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids grandfathered under older regulations, so high-quality randomized trials and validated outcome measures like CLASI are essential; stratified trials leveraging IFN signatures, lesion thickness, and scarring propensity may improve signal detection, and master protocol designs could accelerate evaluation of targeted agents such as IFN pathway inhibitors and TYK2/JAK blockers [^112vF3Rg] [^1165nhy2] [^117NgNwq]. Hold on, I should verify that current guidance still reflects this gap: yes, contemporary reviews emphasize the lack of modern approvals and the need for subtype-specific, biomarker-driven strategies to close the evidence gap [^113dWqyA].

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic, scarring form of cutaneous lupus characterized by **well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with adherent scale and central atrophy** [^117VGYnK], most often on the scalp, face, and ears [^117J3GA5]. Diagnosis is **clinical plus histopathology** [^111RAZUn], with interface dermatitis, follicular plugging, and dermal mucin as key features [^114LSp1C]; direct immunofluorescence can show a lumpy-bumpy IgM pattern but is not required [^117J3GA5]. First-line treatment is **topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors** [^116KCnnU] with strict photoprotection [^113dWqyA]; for widespread or refractory disease, antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine are used [^111furz6], with methotrexate, mycophenolate, thalidomide, or anifrolumab for refractory cases [^111RAZUn] [^1177cjTH]. DLE can cause permanent scarring and alopecia [^117J3GA5], and about 5–10% of patients progress to SLE, warranting periodic systemic screening [^112vF3Rg].

---

## Clinical features

- **Lesion morphology**: Well-demarcated, erythematous, scaly plaques with central atrophy, hypopigmentation, and hyperpigmented borders [^117J3GA5]; follicular plugging and telangiectasias are common [^113q7qEZ].

- **Common sites**: Scalp, face, ears, and sun-exposed areas; scalp lesions often cause scarring alopecia [^117J3GA5].

- **Variants**: Hypertrophic, verrucous, and mucosal forms occur [^1145UgqD] [^116oUsG3].

- **Symptoms**: Pruritus, pain, and cosmetic disfigurement are frequent [^116oUsG3].

---

## Histopathology

Histopathology shows **interface dermatitis** with vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, follicular plugging, and a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate [^114LSp1C]; dermal mucin is characteristic [^114LSp1C]. Direct immunofluorescence may reveal a **lumpy-bumpy IgM pattern** along the basement membrane, but it is not specific or required for diagnosis [^111RTVxC].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by histopathology when uncertain [^111RAZUn]. Classification criteria include atrophic scarring, conchal bowl involvement, head and neck predilection, dyspigmentation, follicular hyperkeratosis/plugging, and erythematous-violaceous color [^1131vg8v]. Laboratory tests may show positive ANA, anti-dsDNA, or anti-SSA in some patients, but serology is often negative [^115VRnwo] [^112GUqZ3].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE)**: Annular or papulosquamous lesions that heal without scarring [^114qeKyy].

- **Psoriasis**: Silvery scales, no atrophy or scarring [^notfound].

- **Lichen planus**: Violaceous, flat-topped papules with Wickham striae [^notfound].

- **Sarcoidosis**: Firm, infiltrated plaques with noncaseating granulomas on biopsy [^notfound].

---

## Treatment

### Topical therapies

- **First-line**: High-potency topical corticosteroids (e.g. clobetasol) [^113dWqyA] or calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) [^1172y1tM].

- **Adjunctive**: Intralesional corticosteroids for localized lesions [^117Pjfv5].

- **Photoprotection**: Strict sun protection is essential [^113dWqyA].

---

### Systemic therapies

- **Antimalarials**: Hydroxychloroquine is first-line for widespread or refractory disease [^116xqv2T]; monitor ophthalmologic toxicity [^notfound].

- **Methotrexate**: Effective for refractory cases [^111RTVxC].

- **Mycophenolate mofetil**: Used for severe or refractory disease [^111RAZUn].

- **Thalidomide/lenalidomide**: Effective but limited by teratogenicity and neuropathy [^117XmgAs].

- **Anifrolumab**: Type I interferon receptor antagonist showing promise in refractory DLE [^114W2mCu].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is chronic and relapsing; **early treatment reduces scarring** [^111RAZUn]. Complications include permanent scarring, dyspigmentation, scarring alopecia [^117J3GA5], and a 5–10% risk of progression to SLE, which warrants periodic systemic screening [^1163niu1].

---

## Patient education and self-care

Patient education and self-care should emphasize **strict sun protection** with regular sunscreen use and protective clothing [^113dWqyA]. Smoking cessation is recommended because smoking worsens disease and reduces treatment response [^112vF3Rg]. Patients should be taught to recognize lesions early and seek prompt treatment, and scheduled follow-up should monitor for scarring, dyspigmentation, and systemic involvement [^117VGYnK].

---

Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic, scarring cutaneous lupus with **distinctive clinical and histologic features** [^117VGYnK]. Management centers on topical therapy and photoprotection, with antimalarials and immunosuppressants for refractory disease; ongoing monitoring is needed for scarring and systemic progression [^113dWqyA].

### Development of classification criteria for discoid lupus erythematosus: results of a Delphi exercise [^115Enoq2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

No classification criteria currently exist for discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), which has led to problematic heterogeneity in both observational and interventional research efforts.

Objectives

We sought to develop DLE classification criteria based on consensus of international expert opinion of relevant stakeholders in the field.

Methods

Using a Delphi consensus process and nominal group techniques, potential items for classification criteria were generated. Experts ranked items in terms of their appropriateness and ability to discriminate DLE from other diagnoses, and items were subsequently eliminated using consensus exercises.

Results

A final list of 12 clinical and histopathologic items was generated for potential inclusion into a set of DLE classification criteria through a formal ongoing validation process.

Limitations

The participants are predominantly composed of DLE experts in North America and Europe.

Conclusion

This work represents a key step toward the development of formal DLE classification criteria.

### Review of treatment for discoid lupus erythematosus [^112q2PVb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic cutaneous disease characterized by inflammatory plaques that, in the absence of prompt diagnosis and treatment, may lead to disfiguring scarring and skin atrophy. However, there is limited evidence for which treatments are most effective. Currently, no medications have been approved specifically for the treatment of DLE. Many of the drugs described in the literature were developed for use in other immune disorders. This review will summarize current therapeutic options for DLE and their supporting evidence with discussion of prevention, topical measures, physical modalities, and systemic therapies, including newer potential therapies.

### Time to progression from discoid lupus erythematosus to systemic lupus erythematosus: a retrospective cohort study [^1163niu1]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Determining the risk of progression to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) among patients diagnosed with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), and the time frame of this risk, are important clinical questions. Past reports have demonstrated a wide time frame of progression from DLE to SLE, with mean time to progression of approximately 8 years. Using data obtained from an academic lupus centre, we identified 32 patients who progressed from DLE to SLE. In our cohort, we found that the median time to progression from DLE to SLE was 453 days, much sooner than previously reported. We believe this information can help inform clinicians on monitoring visit intervals and how best to counsel patients on SLE progression.

### Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus [^116KCnnU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic form of cutaneous lupus, which can cause scarring. Many drugs have been used to treat this disease and some (such as thalidomide, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) are potentially toxic. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2009. We wanted to update the review to assess whether any new information was available to treat DLE, as we were still unsure of the effectiveness of available drugs and how to select the most appropriate treatment for an individual with DLE.

Objectives

To assess the effects of drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to 22 September 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials databases, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant trials. Index Medicus (1956 to 1966) was handsearched and we approached authors for information about unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of drugs to treat people with DLE in any population group and of either gender. Comparisons included any drug used for DLE against either another drug or against placebo cream. We excluded laser treatment, surgery, phototherapy, other forms of physical therapy, and photoprotection as we did not consider them drug treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers independently extracted data onto a data extraction sheet, resolving disagreements by discussion. We used standard methods to assess risk of bias, as expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Five trials involving 197 participants were included. Three new trials were included in this update. None of the five trials were of high quality'. isk of bias' assessments identified potential sources of bias in each study. One study used an inappropriate randomisation method, and incomplete outcome data were a concern in another as 15 people did not complete the trial. We found most of the trials to be at low risk in terms of blinding, but three of the five did not describe allocation concealment. The included trials inadequately addressed the primary outcome measures of this review (percentage with complete resolution of skin lesions, percentage with clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions, and improvement in patient satisfaction/quality of life measures). One study of fluocinonide cream 0.05% (potent steroid) compared with hydrocortisone cream 1% (low-potency steroid) in 78 people reported complete resolution of skin lesions in 27% (10/37) of participants in the fluocinonide cream group and in 10% (4/41) in the hydrocortisone group, giving a 17% absolute benefit in favour of fluocinonide (risk ratio (RR) 2.77, 95% CI 0.95 to 8.08, 1 study, n = 78, low-quality evidence). The other primary outcome measures were not reported. Adverse events did not require discontinuation of the drug. Skin irritation occurred in three people using hydrocortisone, and one person developed acne. Burning occurred in two people using fluocinonide (moderate-quality evidence). A comparative trial of two oral agents, acitretin (50 mg daily) and hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily), reported two of the outcomes of interest: complete resolution was seen in 13 of 28 participants (46%) on acitretin and 15 of 30 participants (50%) on hydoxychloroquine (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.59, 1 study, n = 58, low-quality evidence). Clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions was reported in 10 of 24 participants (42%) on acitretin and 17 of 25 (68%) on hydroxychloroquine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.06, 1 study, n = 49, low-quality evidence). This comparison did not assess improvement in patient satisfaction/quality of life measures. Participants taking acitretin showed a small increase in serum triglyceride, not sufficient to require withdrawal of the drug. The main adverse effects were dry lips (93% of the acitretin group and 20% of the hydroxychloroquine group) and gastrointestinal disturbance (11% of the acitretin group and 17% of the hydroxychloroquine group). Four participants on acitretin withdrew due to gastrointestinal events or dry lips (moderate-quality evidence). One trial randomised 10 people with DLE to apply a calcineurin inhibitor, pimecrolimus 1% cream, or a potent steroid, betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream, for eight weeks. The study reported none of the primary outcome measures, nor did it present data on adverse events. A trial of calcineurin inhibitors compared tacrolimus cream 0.1% with placebo (vehicle) over 12 weeks in 14 people, but reported none of our primary outcome measures. In the tacrolimus group, five participants complained of slight burning and itching, and for one participant, a herpes simplex infection was reactivated (moderate-quality evidence). Topical R-salbutamol 0.5% cream was compared with placebo (vehicle) over eight weeks in one trial of 37 people with DLE. There was a significant improvement in pain and itch in the salbutamol group at two, four, six, and eight weeks compared to placebo, but the trial did not record a formal measure of quality of life. None of the primary outcome measures were reported. Changes in erythema did not show benefit of salbutamol over placebo, but we could not obtain from the trial report the number of participants with clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions. There were 15 events in the placebo group (experienced by 12 participants) and 24 in the salbutamol group (experienced by nine participants). None of the adverse events were considered serious (moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Fluocinonide cream may be more effective than hydrocortisone in clearing DLE skin lesions. Hydroxychloroquine and acitretin appear to be of equal efficacy in terms of complete resolution, although adverse effects might be more frequent with acitretin, and clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions occurred less often in participants applying acitretin. Moderate-quality evidence found adverse events were minor on the whole. There is not enough reliable evidence about other drugs used to treat DLE. Overall, the quality of the trials and levels of uncertainty were such that there is a need for further trials of sufficient duration comparing, in particular, topical steroids with other agents.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and discoid lupus erythematosus [^1166bhRb]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The management of a patient with SLE presents the OMS with a challenging array of decisions to make in regards to treatment sequencing. Careful reviews of the patient's medical history, the presentation of the illness, and the medication profile, and an open discourse with medical colleagues are necessary to ensure the safety of patients. By becoming comfortable with the medical treatment the patient is undergoing as well as having a firm understanding of where the patient is along the cascade of disease severity (see Fig. 7), appropriate decisions can be made in regards to the patient's outcome and prognosis. Proceeding into surgical treatment without following these guidelines could potentially result in catastrophic consequences for the patient.

### Determining risk factors for developing systemic lupus erythematosus in patients with discoid lupus erythematosus [^113vt4zD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Up to 28% of patients with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) are susceptible to developing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To better characterize patients with DLE who have a higher potential of developing SLE, we reviewed studies contrasting, firstly, DLE-only patients (i.e. patients with DLE without SLE) and SLE patients with DLE (i.e. patients who are diagnosed with SLE and DLE simultaneously, and patients with SLE who later develop DLE), and secondly, DLE-only patients and patients with DLE who progress to SLE. These studies have commonly identified various clinical and laboratory indicators, such as widespread DLE lesions, arthralgias/arthritis, nail changes, anaemia, leucopenia, high erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs) and high titres of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), which are associated with progression to SLE in patients with DLE, and SLE patients with DLE. Limitations of these studies include inadequate follow-up time, small numbers of patients with DLE converting to SLE, outdated criteria for SLE diagnosis and retrospective study designs. However, because of the risk of SLE development in patients with DLE, complete skin examinations, joint assessments and laboratory tests including ANA, ESR and full blood counts should be performed regularly for patients with DLE. A prospective study following patients with DLE who do or do not develop SLE is currently underway through the Cutaneous Lupus Registry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. It will seek to identify clinical features and biomarkers that improve our assessment of risk of systemic spread in these patients.

### Creation and validation of classification criteria for discoid lupus erythematosus [^1131vg8v]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Classification criteria are the standardized definitions that are used to enroll uniform cohorts for research studies. They emphasize high specificity and are distinct from diagnostic criteria. No universally recognized classification criteria currently exist for discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), which has led to problematic heterogeneity in observational and interventional clinical studies across the field.

Objective

To create and validate classification criteria for DLE using 12 previously defined candidate criteria items.

Design, Setting, and Participants

For this diagnostic study, candidate criteria items were prospectively applied by dermatologists and dermatopathologists at clinical visits of patients with DLE or a condition that could be confused for DLE, termed a DLE mimicker, at academic dermatology practices across the United States, Poland, Japan, and South Korea. Data were collected from December 1, 2017, to February 1, 2019, and analyzed from March 1 to September 19, 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical features among these 2 groups were calculated and compared with χ2 or Fisher exact tests. Candidate models were identified using best subsets logistic regression analysis. Improvement tests, fit statistics, and discrimination were considered to choose a final model.

Results

Nine sites contributed 215 patients, 15 of whom had missing or incomplete data. The final model for DLE classification criteria includes only clinical variables: atrophic scarring (3 points), location in the conchal bowl (2 points), preference for the head and neck (2 points), dyspigmentation (1 point), follicular hyperkeratosis and/or plugging (1 point), and erythematous to violaceous in color (1 point), with an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87–0.95). A score of at least 5 points yields a sensitivity of 84.1% and a specificity of 75.9% in the classification of DLE, with increasing scores yielding higher specificity.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings provide the initial validation of classification criteria for DLE for use in observational and clinical trials.

### Early diagnosis and treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus [^111RAZUn]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic dermatological disease that can lead to scarring, hair loss, and hyperpigmentation changes in skin if it is not treated early and promptly. It has a prolonged course and can have a considerable effect on quality of life. Early recognition and treatment improves the prognosis. The diagnosis is usually made by clinical examination. In some cases histopathology may be required to confirm the diagnosis. The histology is that of an inflammatory interface dermatosis. There is insufficient evidence for which treatment is most effective. Because lesions are induced or exacerbated by ultraviolet exposure, photoprotective measures are important. Potent topical steroids and antimalarials are the mainstay of treatment. Some cases of discoid lupus erythematosus can be refractory to standard therapy; in these cases retinoids, thalidomide, and topical tacrolimus offer alternatives, as do immunosuppressives like azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate.

### Practice-based differences in paediatric discoid lupus erythematosus [^116zuUfV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Children with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) are at risk for disfigurement and progression to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Consensus is lacking regarding optimal care for children with DLE.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare practice patterns among paediatric dermatologists/rheumatologists treating paediatric DLE.

Methods

An online survey was sent to 292 paediatric rheumatologists in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance and 200 paediatric dermatologists in the Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance. Consensus was defined as ≥ 70% agreement.

Results

Survey response rates were 38% (76 of 200) for dermatology and 21% (60 of 292) for rheumatology. Both specialties agreed that screening labs should include complete blood counts with differential, urinalysis, complement levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody and other autoantibodies, hepatic function and renal function/electrolytes. Both specialties agreed that arthritis or nephritis should prompt intensified evaluation for SLE. No other patient features achieved consensus as disease-modifying risk factors. Hydroxychloroquine was agreed upon as first-line systemic therapy, but consensus was lacking for second- or third-line treatment.

Conclusions

We found few areas of consensus and significant practice differences between paediatric dermatologists and rheumatologists treating DLE. Knowledge gaps include risk factors for SLE, optimal screening and treatment of refractory skin disease.

### Innovative management of lupus erythematosus [^112o1KdV]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

This article focuses on the management of discoid lupus erythematosus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and systemic lupus erythematosus when the usual therapeutic arsenal such as oral antimalarial drugs and topical/oral steroids fail or provide insufficient treatment efficacy. Many of the treatments listed are the same or similar to each other because of similarities in the pathogenesis of various subtypes of cutaneous lupus. The clinical challenge is to determine the indications for topical versus systemic therapy, and to also identify the scenarios when combined therapy is necessary.

### The natural history of pediatric-onset discoid lupus erythematosus [^115ERR86]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pediatric discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is rare. The risk of progression to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is uncertain.

Objective

We sought to determine the risk of progression of pediatric DLE to SLE and to characterize its phenotype.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of 40 patients with DLE.

Results

Six (15%) of 40 patients presented with DLE as a manifestation of concurrent SLE. Of the remaining 34, 9 (26%) eventually met SLE criteria and 15 (44%) developed laboratory abnormalities without meeting SLE criteria. Only 10 (29%) maintained skin-limited disease. The average age at progression to SLE was 11 years, with greatest risk in the first year after DLE diagnosis. Most (89%) patients with SLE met diagnostic criteria with mucocutaneous disease (discoid lesions, malar rash, oral and nasal ulcers, photosensitivity), positive antibodies, and/or cytopenia without developing end-organ damage over 5 years of median follow-up.

Limitations

The study was retrospective.

Conclusions

In pediatric patients, DLE carries a significant risk of progression to SLE but may predict a milder phenotype of systemic disease. All patients require careful monitoring for SLE, particularly within the first year of diagnosis.

### Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus [^1161rsGu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic form of cutaneous (skin) lupus which can cause permanent scarring if treatment is inadequate. Many drugs have been used to treat this disease and some of these are potentially very toxic.

Objectives

To assess the effects of drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (December 1999), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 1999), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2000), and the reference lists of relevant reviews. Index Medicus (1956 to 1966) was handsearched and 7 experts in the field were approached for information about unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of drugs to treat people with discoid lupus erythematosus. Drugs included in the search were azathioprine, chloroquine, clofazimine, corticosteroids, (oral and topical), dapsone, gold, interferon alpha-2a, methotrexate, phenytoin, retinoids, sulphasalazine and thalidomide.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently examined each retrieved study for eligibility.

Main Results

Two trials involving 136 participants were included. In a cross-over study of twelve weeks duration fluocinonide 0.05% cream (a potent topical corticosteroid), appeared to be markedly better than hydrocortisone 1% cream (a mild corticosteroid). Clearing or excellent improvement was seen in 27% of people using fluocinonide and in 10% of those using hydrocortisone, giving a 17% absolute benefit in favour of fluocinonide (95% CI 4.5 to 29.5% and NNT 6). In the second trial, hydroxychloroquine was compared with acitretin in 58 people. There was marked improvement or clearing in 46% of people using acitretin and in 50% of those on hydroxychloroquine, a nonsignificant 4% absolute gain with hydroxychloroquine (95%CI -23% to 30%). The adverse effects were more frequent and more severe in the acitretin group.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Fluocinonide cream may be more effective than hydrocortisone in treating people with discoid lupus erythematosus. Hydroxychloroquine and acitretin appear to be of equal efficacy, although adverse effects are more frequent and more severe with acitretin. There is not enough reliable evidence about other drugs used to treat discoid lupus erythematosus.

### Lupus community panel proposals for optimising clinical trials: 2018 [^115ZdLUv]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Addressing the severe shortage of patients for trials

A significant impediment to treatment development for lupus is the lack of qualified trial sites and qualified patients to participate in studies. To expand the population of suitable patients with lupus, an important first step might be to reach a more rational consensus about how to define the disease. Lupus can have myriad manifestations, with unpredictable impacts on various organs of the body. Two different classification criteria are currently in wide use, promulgated by projects from the American College of Rheumatologyand the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics. These criteria overlap, but each includes certain subsets of patients that the other does not. Each includes some patients with very severe disease, and each includes some with minimal disease, the latter being questionable candidates for clinical trials. Both classification criteria exclude many patients with single organ lupus who may have moderate to severe manifestations. These patients might benefit from new treatments, but would be excluded from clinical trials and any subsequent treatment approvals.

Although the science of prognostic markers is not well advanced, there is evidence that certain autoantibodies or immunological pathways may be more relevant to some manifestations such as nephritis. Because of this, many consider lupus to be multiple different diseases, distinguished by the organs that become involved. Although an acknowledgement that 'one immunologic intervention does not fit all' has merit in optimising advanced treatment development, attempts to distinguish patients and choose treatments based simply on which organs are involved have not been very useful. For example, different pathologically distinct rashes can occur in patients who have nephritis, and not all kidney disease is identical. Thus, it seems most likely that lupus is a complex spectrum disorder where clinical manifestations and pathology may vary along a three-dimensional continuum from patient to patient.

Why the organs and/or pathologies vary from patient to patient remains obscure, but once focus is drawn to specific immunological disorders, there is some predictability across patients regardless of the organs involved. There is no evidence to suggest that discoid lesions in a patient who also has nephritis are at all different from a discoid rash in a person who only has cutaneous involvement. The availability of patients for clinical trials would be significantly increased by including those with lupus spectrum manifestations who may not meet classification criteria for SLE. This is particularly true for patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), since, in the age of the ubiquitous punch biopsy, they represent a large population of patients with objectively confirmable lupus and measurable clinical findings.

### Long-term response to hydroxychloroquine in patients with discoid lupus erythematosus [^116xqv2T]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The recommended first-line oral therapy for discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published information regarding the long-term (i.e. > 6 months) response of DLE to hydroxychloroquine in clinical practice.

Objectives

To describe the long-term clinical response of DLE to hydroxychloroquine after 6 months of use.

Methods

A multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with DLE who had received treatment with hydroxychloroquine. All patients were recruited and interviewed by a single investigator and response to hydroxychloroquine assessed by the same individual through a retrospective review of case notes using a specified protocol.

Results

A total of 200 patients with DLE were recruited (F:M = 4: 1) with a median age at diagnosis of 40 years (range 16–81) and median follow-up of 8 years (range 0.5–37). An adequate clinical response to hydroxychloroquine was recorded in 91 patients (45.5%) but nonresponse occurred in 85 patients (42.5%). The remainder of patients either had partial response or withdrew from therapy due to toxicity or were unclassifiable. Importantly, of those individuals that did respond to hydroxychloroquine within the first 6 months of use, almost one in five eventually lost their response, despite continued administration, after a median interval of 2 years. These patients often regained disease control if treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and mepacrine. Of those that did not respond to hydroxychloroquine within the first 6 months of use, almost one in 10 became eventual responders either after continued administration for up to 2 years or when rechallenged on hydroxychloroquine. The remaining nonresponders relied frequently on oral corticosteroid.

Conclusions

In this cohort of patients with DLE, long-term clinical response to hydroxychloroquine occurred in less than 50% of patients. Nonresponders to hydroxychloroquine frequently required oral steroid to achieve disease control. These findings merit further investigation through a multicentre prospective study using a validated disease activity measure.

### Clinical and pharmacogenetic influences on response to hydroxychloroquine in discoid lupus erythematosus: a retrospective cohort study [^112zqzbk]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The recommended systemic therapy of choice for discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is the 4-aminoquinolone antimalarial hydroxychloroquine. There is limited published information on the likelihood of clinical response and, in particular, what factors influence outcome. We conducted a multicenter observational and pharmacogenetic study of 200 patients with DLE treated with hydroxychloroquine. The primary outcome was clinical response to hydroxychloroquine. We investigated the effects of disease attributes and metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) polymorphisms on clinical outcome. Although the majority of patients responded to hydroxychloroquine, a significant proportion (39%) either failed to respond or was intolerant of the drug. Cigarette smoking and CYP genotype did not have any significant influence on response to hydroxychloroquine. Moreover, multivariate analysis indicated that disseminated disease (odds ratio (OR): 0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08–0.52; P < 0.001) and concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; OR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01–0.49; P = 0.009) were significantly associated with lack of response to hydroxychloroquine. These findings suggest that baseline lupus severity and SLE are predictors of response to hydroxychloroquine. A prospective study is now required to further investigate the relationship between disease activity and response to hydroxychloroquine. This will have the potential to further inform the clinical management of this disfiguring photosensitive disease.

### Cross-sectional characteristics of pediatric-onset discoid lupus erythematosus: results of a multicenter, retrospective cohort study [^1121NKKc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of systemic lupus in children with discoid lupus is unknown.

Objective

This study assessed the baseline characteristics of patients with pediatric discoid lupus erythematosus (pDLE).

Methods

Medical records at 17 sites were reviewed for pediatric dermatology and rheumatology patients with discoid lupus erythematosus. The inclusion criteria were clinical and/or histopathologic diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus with an age at onset of < 18 years. Baseline data were collected at the first documented visit. Outcomes included diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) at the baseline visit using the 1997 American College of Rheumatology (primary) and the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (secondary) criteria.

Results

Of the > 1500 charts reviewed, 438 patients met the inclusion criteria. The cohort was predominantly female (72%) and racially/ethnically diverse. A diagnosis of SLE at the baseline visit (pDLE + SLE) was rendered in 162 (37%) patients using the American College of Rheumatology and in 181 (41%) patients using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria. Patients with pDLE + SLE were older at the time of rash onset (median, 12.9 vs 8.9 years; P < .001), with shorter time from discoid lupus erythematosus onset to diagnosis, compared with patients with pDLE-only (median, 2 vs 7 months; P < .001). Patients with pDLE + SLE were more likely to be female (P = 0.004), with generalized discoid lupus erythematosus and clinically aggressive disease, including end-organ involvement, positive serologies, and higher- titer levels of antinuclear antibodies (P < .001).

Limitations

Retrospective study.

Conclusion

A diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus in adolescence should prompt thorough screening for SLE.

### Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus versus discoid lupus erythematosus: a challenging diagnosis [^117FgeKE]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune skin disease that can occur with or without systemic involvement. CLE can be classified into 3 main subtypes: acute CLE, subacute CLE (SCLE), and chronic CLE. The most common type of chronic CLE is discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Each subtype has distinctive morphology, and diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical features, laboratory studies, histology, and antibody serology.

Current treatment options for CLE are limited. Furthermore, CLE can be refractory to treatments with variable and unpredictable response, with only a 50% response to first-line therapy hydroxychloroquine. Numerous CLE-specific clinical trials are currently in progress; however, they sometimes require patients have a specific subtype of CLE, most often DLE. Classifying patients by subtype can be challenging because there can be many overlapping features and at least 20% of patients have more than 1 CLE subtype. Although efforts have been made to improve classification criteria for DLE, it can still be difficult to distinguish DLE from other subtypes. In this report, we present 2 patients with a challenging diagnosis of DLE versus SCLE.

### A rare case of unilateral discoid lupus erythematosus mimicking lupus vulgaris [^116rQKN1]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discoidlupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic type of cutaneous lupus erythematosus which can present in various morphologies, and the diagnosis can be rather confounding. Prompt evaluation and treatment is necessary to prevent disfigurement and systemic involvement associated with DLE. The following case presented a diagnostic dilemma as the lesion mimicked lupus vulgaris.

### Alopecias in lupus erythematosus [^111taGQr]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Overview of alopecias in LE

LE-specific alopecia is classically exemplified by scalp discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), which is typically scarring. Several non-scarring forms of hair loss such as lupus hair, alopecia areata and telogen/anagen effluvium do not display biopsy features of LE and are considered either LE non-specific or just coincidental with LE. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), tumid LE and acute LE display histopathological features consistent with LE and are lupus-specific alopecias. However, attribution is not always straightforward because LE-specific alopecias can coexist with the more common causes of hair loss and can possess similar clinical features. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that certain cutaneous findings on the scalp (DLE, SCLE, diffuse non-scarring hair loss due to acute LE) are distinct items in the classification criteria for SLE and may count as separate items in fulfilling the criteria (table 1).

### Association of discoid lupus erythematosus with other clinical manifestations among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^112u4Loj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cutaneous discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be associated with less severe disease and with low frequency of nephritis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Objective

We sought to investigate associations between confirmed DLE and other SLE manifestations, adjusting for confounders.

Methods

We identified patients with rheumatologist confirmation, according to 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) SLE classification criteria, more than 2 visits, longer than 3 months of follow-up, and documented year of SLE diagnosis. DLE was confirmed by a dermatologist, supported by histopathology and images. SLE manifestations, medications, and serologies were collected. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses tested for associations between DLE and each of the ACR SLE criteria, and ESRD.

Results

A total of 1043 patients with SLE (117 with DLE and 926 without DLE) were included in the study. After multivariable adjustment, DLE in SLE was significantly associated with photosensitivity (odds ratio [OR] 1.63), leukopenia (OR 1.55), and anti-Smith antibodies (OR 2.41). DLE was significantly associated with reduced risks of arthritis (OR 0.49) and pleuritis (OR 0.56). We found no significant associations between DLE and nephritis or ESRD.

Limitations

Cross-sectional data collection with risk of data not captured from visits outside system was a limitation.

Conclusions

In our SLE cohort, DLE was confirmed by a dermatologist and we adjusted for possible confounding by medication use, in particular hydroxychloroquine. We found increased risks of photosensitivity, leukopenia, and anti-Smith antibodies and decreased risks of pleuritis and arthritis in patients with SLE and DLE. DLE was not related to anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, lupus nephritis, or ESRD. These findings have implications for prognosis among patients with SLE.

### Discoid lupus erythematosus in children – a retrospective study of 34 patients [^111sEjMH]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Discoid lupus erythematosus is much less frequent and studied in children. We undertook a retrospective study of 34 children less than 16 years of age with this disease, seen over a period of 9 years. A female predominance of 2:1 was found. An association between discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus was observed in 23.5% of patients, a higher proportion compared to adult discoid lupus erythematosus. Disseminated lesions were much more frequent in patients with criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (87.5% vs 34%), suggesting that it could be associated with a worse prognosis. Histologic findings were similar to those observed in adult discoid lupus erythematosus.

### Cicatricial alopecia: discoid lupus erythematosus [^116evArd]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus consists of three major dermatologic diseases: discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), lupus panniculitis/lupus profundus, and lupus tumidus (Table 1). DLE is estimated to be responsible for 50–85% of patients with chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Scalp involvement is most often the presenting symptom. The clinical features and diagnosis of DLE, its pathophysiology and treatment, are reviewed.

### Risk factors of progression from discoid lupus to severe systemic lupus erythematosus: a registry-based cohort study of 164 patients [^1111eiwq]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

No study has assessed the risk factors of progression from discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (sSLE) (defined as requiring hospitalization and specific treatment).

Objective

To identify the risks factors of and generate a predicting score for progression to sSLE among patients with isolated DLE or associated with systemic lupus erythematosus with mild biological abnormalities.

Methods

In this registry-based cohort study, multivariable analysis was performed using risk factors identified from literature and pruned by backward selection to identify relevant variables. The number of points was weighted proportionally to the odds ratio (OR).

Results

We included 30 patients with DLE who developed sSLE and 134 patients who did not. In multivariable analysis, among 12 selected variables, an age of < 25 years at the time of DLE diagnosis (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1–7.0; 1 point), phototype V to VI (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1–7.0; 1 point), and antinuclear antibody titers of ≥ 1:320 (OR, 15; 95% CI, 3.3–67.3; 5 points) were selected to generate the score. Among the 54 patients with a score of 0 at baseline, none progressed to sSLE, whereas a score of ≥ 6 was associated with a risk of approximately 40%.

Limitations

Retrospective design.

Conclusion

In our cohort, an age of < 25 years at the time of DLE diagnosis, phototype V to VI, and antinuclear antibody titers of ≥ 1:320 were risk factors for developing sSLE.

### Discoid lupus erythematosus skin lesion distribution and characteristics in black patients: a retrospective cohort study [^117Nu19i]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Epidemiological studies have shown that discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) has a higher incidence and prevalence in racial/ethnic minority groups, particularly Black individuals. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to identify the differences in DLE lesion distribution and characteristics in Black individuals compared with non-Black individuals.

Methods

183 patients with DLE (112 Black patients and 71 non-Black patients) with a reported race/ethnicity and Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) scores were included in this retrospective cohort study. Univariate analysis was performed to determine significant differences in demographic data, clinical characteristics, DLE lesion distribution and DLE lesion characteristics in Black and non-Black patients with DLE. Multivariable logistic regression was preformed to determine significant predictors of DLE lesion location and characteristics.

Results

Black patients with DLE had worse baseline CLASI damage scores compared with non-Black patients with DLE (median (IQR): 10.0 (6.0–14.5) vs 6.0 (3.0–10.0), p < 0.001) and had 48.9 greater odds of dyspigmentation in any anatomical location (p < 0.001). Black patients had 2.54 greater odds of having scalp involvement (p = 0.015) and 1.97 greater odds of having ear involvement (p = 0.032) compared with non-Black patients. Black patients also had greater odds of scalp dyspigmentation (OR = 5.85, p < 0.001), ear dyspigmentation (OR = 2.89, p = 0.001) and scarring alopecia (OR = 3.00, p = 0.001) compared with non-Black patients.

Conclusions

Signs of disease damage, particularly ear dyspigmentation, scalp dyspigmentation and scarring alopecia, can more frequently affect Black patients with DLE. Recognising differences in clinical presentation of DLE among Black patients can assist future efforts with understanding biological, cultural, psychosocial and systemic factors that influence DLE presentation and outcomes in Black patients and may guide clinicians when counselling Black patients.

### What are the topics you care about making trials in lupus more effective? Results of an open space meeting of international lupus experts [^117NgNwq]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient/disease subsets — patient stratification

The heterogeneity of disease expression in SLE is generally seen as a major challenge for all trials. Classification criteria were developed as the first step to recruit a more homogenous population. The group discussed and recommended exploring alternative stratification methods like lupus nephritis versus non-renal SLE, based on single organ involvement or on disease patterns (eg, according to flares), on biomarkers (eg, conventional or interferon (IFN) signature), on baseline or historic characteristics, or on comorbidities and disease manifestations. Stratification should also consider background therapy.

To bring together all these aspects of stratification, the challenge will be to design several studies within the framework of one big trial. New, valid and reliable biomarkers would be a prerequisite for improved stratification methods. In such a master protocol, in addition to the conventional stratification to renal or extrarenal lupus, extended lupus nephritis strata categories could include new disease manifestation versus lupus nephritis flare versus refractory lupus nephritis, renal chronicity, ethnicity and potentially move away from the focus on just Class III and IV nephritis. Stratification of extrarenal lupus should be domain-specific. For example, there should be a differentiation between acute, subacute and discoid lupus skin manifestations and non-erosive, erosive and Jaccoud's arthropathy for arthritis. Other relevant parameters might be overall disease activity, disease duration or geographical region. In addition, creative approaches might include molecular signatures and biomarkers based on pathophysiology.

At this point in the discussion, concerns were expressed that such novel designs would not fit into current conservative regulatory policies and that insufficient stratification was the real problem of the past trial failures. To further explore this issue, a query of study databases (both failed and successful) is necessary, in which single organ domain trials and single organ parts of other studies should be analysed. In addition, the proposed master protocol needs discussion with regulatory authorities and (commercial) sponsors. For a better acceptance of such a protocol, it would be helpful to declare the subtypes of lupus, for example, lupus nephritis, as an orphan disease to minimise the burden of trials. Probably, the term 'rare and complex disease' would be helpful as successfully used in the European Reference Networks (ERN). Furthermore, an expert consent on reclassification of more homogeneous subsets of lupus would be quite beneficial.

The still pending issue from this discussion was whether sponsors would be willing to invest the necessary budget to develop drugs for rare diseases or for life-threatening cases to facilitate the approval process.

### Is chronic cutaneous discoid lupus protective against severe renal disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus? [^115VRnwo]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to assess the level of systemic involvement and character of renal disease in patients with chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus of the discoid lupus variety (hereafter referred to as 'discoid lupus') and features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Clinical confusion with other types of cutaneous lupus erythematosus complicates interpretation of some previously reported studies.

Methods

Over three years, sixteen patients met the diagnostic criteria of discoid lupus, positive anti-nuclear-antibody, and at least one extracutaneous manifestation.

Results

Most patients (14/16) were female, between 26 to 66 years old. Arthritis was the most common extracutaneous manifestation followed by Raynaud's phenomenon. The anti-nuclear-antibody was speckled in ten patients with titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:1280 IU/mL. Elevated levels of double-stranded-DNA in low titers were found in four patients, anti-Smith-antibody in four; anti-Sjogren-syndrome-A-antibody in seven, and anti-ribonucleoprotein-antibody in seven. Renal function markers were transiently high in some patients but normalized over time. Hematuria and/or proteinuria were present at some time in seven patients. The highest BUN and creatinine levels were 42 mg/dL and 1.5 mg/dL, respectively. One patient had membranous glomerulonephropathy class 5; however, discoid lupus developed well after the onset of renal disease during a time when renal function had returned to normal.

Conclusion

Our observational data supports previous reports suggesting that patients with active discoid lupus rarely have progressive renal insufficiency. The mechanism for the development of discoid lupus may involve an immunologic mechanism that differs from that which produces severe organ involvement, especially advanced immune-complex-mediated renal disease. Patients with discoid lupus rarely have sustained high levels of antibodies to double-stranded-DNA. Discoid lupus appears to be a marker for a more benign lupus course. This clinical observation lays the groundwork for a larger prospective, longitudinal cohort study for further validation.

### Rapamycin for refractory discoid lupus erythematosus [^114k1MBE]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Generalized discoid lupus erythematosus can pose a therapeutic challenge for dermatologists. Current treatment emphasizes photoprotection, topical and systemic steroids, and steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents if necessary. Rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, selectively inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin, a regulatory kinase responsible for multiple signal transduction pathways. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition reduces cell division, lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine release, and downstream pathways unique from other classes of immunomodulatory drugs. Herein, we present a case of generalized discoid lupus erythematosus resistant to topical steroids, prednisone, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, and thalidomide. The addition of rapamycin led to a positive treatment response within 6 weeks, with good tolerance of the medication and no adverse effects. The current literature supporting the use of rapamycin in the treatment of autoimmune connective tissue diseases is also briefly reviewed. For patients with severe or generalized discoid lupus erythematosus refractory to conventional treatment, rapamycin may be a useful therapeutic consideration.

### Apremilast for discoid lupus erythematosus: results of a phase 2, open-label, single-arm, pilot study [^114BmuvM]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic inflammatory disorder mediated by Th1 cells. Apremilast is a novel oral PDE4 enzyme inhibitor capable of blocking leukocyte production of IL-12, IL-23, TNF-a, INF- with subsequent suppression of Th1 and Th17-mediated immune responses, and proven clinical efficacy for psoriasis as well as rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis.

Observations

Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) showed a significant (P < 0.05) decrease after 85 days of treatment with apremilast 20 mg twice daily in 8 patients with active discoid lupus. The adverse events related to the drug were mild and transient.

Conclusions

This is the first open label study to use apremilast as a treatment modality for discoid lupus. Our observations indicate that apremilast may constitute a safe and effective therapeutic option for DLE.

### The circulating lymphocyte profiles in patients with discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus suggest a pathogenetic relationship [^111PHJ4e]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are chronic inflammatory diseases of unknown aetiology; the relationship of DLE with SLE has been a subject of debate for many years. OBJECTIVES; To find evidence for systemic immune activation in DLE by analysis of the immunophenotypic profiles of circulating lymphocytes, and to compare these changes with those in patients with SLE.

Methods

The immunophenotypic profile of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets from 23 DLE patients without clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic disease, 25 SLE patients and 38 healthy donors was characterized by two-colour immunofluorescence flow cytometry analysis. None of the patients was receiving corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatment.

Results

Patients with DLE had increased numbers of circulating HLA-DR+ CD3+ T cells and HLA-DR+ CD4+ T cells, indicating systemic T-cell activation, and an expansion of CD5+ CD19+ B cells. Decreased numbers of T-cell subsets expressing the differentiation markers CD11b and CD16/56, and of CD16/56+ natural killer cells were also found. In SLE, the changes were similar but more pronounced. In addition, a profound CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia and an increase of HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells were found only in SLE.

Conclusions

Our data provide evidence for systemic activation of the cellular immune system in patients with purely cutaneous DLE. Similarities in the lymphocyte immunophenotypic profiles in patients with DLE compared with SLE suggest that there are common immunopathological processes in these two conditions.

### Single-cell sequencing shows cellular heterogeneity of cutaneous lesions in lupus erythematosus [^116NNPJW]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are both types of lupus, yet the characteristics, and differences between them are not fully understood. Here we show single-cell RNA sequencing data of cutaneous lesions from DLE and SLE patients and skin tissues from healthy controls (HCs). We find significantly higher proportions of T cells, B cells and NK cells in DLE than in SLE. Expanded CCL20 + keratinocyte, CXCL1 + fibroblast, ISG hi CD4/CD8 T cell, ISG hi plasma cell, pDC, and NK subclusters are identified in DLE and SLE compared to HC. In addition, we observe higher cell communication scores between cell types such as fibroblasts and macrophage/dendritic cells in cutaneous lesions of DLE and SLE compared to HC. In summary, we clarify the heterogeneous characteristics in cutaneous lesions between DLE and SLE, and discover some specific cell subtypes and ligand-receptor pairs that indicate possible therapeutic targets of lupus erythematosus.

### Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus versus discoid lupus erythematosus: a challenging diagnosis [^117AeS2j]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

In both patients, there were overlapping features of SCLE and DLE. Furthermore, neither patient can be classified as SCLE or DLE alone. Although treatment recommendations for SCLE and DLE are similar, uncertainty in diagnosis between both subtypes can create difficulty when enrolling for clinical trials. Some CLE trials will allow both patients with SCLE and DLE to participate, whereas others require that patients have DLE. As seen in our patients, even after many years with a diagnosis of CLE and features of DLE, the diagnosis is not always clear. This could be because of an overlap of DLE and SCLE in these patients or, alternatively, the patients have not fully developed a specific subtype yet. In trials that require a diagnosis of DLE, it may be challenging to properly assign patients to one diagnosis, and this may result in the exclusion of patients who would otherwise be willing and eligible to enroll. Further, this may eventually exclude patients from valuable treatment options approved specifically for patients with DLE.

### Discoid lupus erythematosus presenting with disfiguring acneiform plaques: a diagnostic challenge [^1145UgqD]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hypertrophic and acneiform forms are very rare variants of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), which can suppose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We present a South American woman with facial disfiguring lesions of 7 years of evolution with clinical and histopathological characteristic of both hypertrophic and acneiform DLE. No criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus were present in the patient. To the best of our knowledge, no patients with concomitant hypertrophic and acneiform DLE have been previously reported in the literature.

### Adjunctive anifrolumab for recalcitrant discoid lupus erythematosus in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report [^114W2mCu]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a subtype of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The characteristic scarring and depigmentation of DLE adds to the disease burden brought on by SLE and is known to substantially impact the quality of life of patients. Current accepted therapies for DLE include topical and intralesional corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, antimalarials, immunosuppressants, systemic corticosteroids, thalidomide, and topical retinoids. However, recalcitrant cases of CLE have shown variable responses to traditional treatment options and targeted, nonsteroidal alternatives, such as biological agents, have been suggested in recent years. Anifrolumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against the type I interferon (IFN-1) receptor subunit 1 that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for SLE in 2021. The IFN-1 pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE and CLE with some patients demonstrating elevated serum IFN-1 levels. The second phase 3 trial on anifrolumab for SLE (type I interferon inhibitor anifrolumab in active systemic lupus erythematosus [TULIP-2]) demonstrated higher rates in reduction of glucocorticoid use and decreased severity of skin disease when compared with placebo. We present the case of a patient with severe refractory DLE who achieved significant clearance of skin disease after treatment with adjunctive anifrolumab.

### Pimecrolimus 1% cream versus betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream in the treatment of facial discoid lupus erythematosus: a double-blind, randomized pilot study [^1172y1tM]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is commonly treated with topical agents, the most important of which are glucocorticosteroids. However, prolonged use of these agents, especially on sensitive areas such as the face, may result in side-effects (e.g. atrophy and telangiectases) by altering collagen synthesis. Therefore, alternative treatments are needed for these patients.

Aim

To investigate and compare the efficacy of topical pimecrolimus 1% cream and topical betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream on facial lesions of DLE.

Methods

This was a randomized double-blind pilot study, performed in outpatient clinics of two major referral hospitals. Ten patients aged 20–53 years with moderate to severe DLE of the face were randomized into two groups for 8 weeks of treatment and 8 weeks of follow-up after treatment. In this double-blind study, one group applied pimecrolimus 1% cream twice daily and the other group applied betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream twice daily to facial lesions. Efficacy end-points included a combined score based on evaluation of erythema, infiltration and presence of scale.

Results

Efficacy end-points showed significant improvement in both groups. A decrease of 86% and 73% in clinical severity scores was obtained for pimecrolimus and betamethasone, respectively (P = 0.043). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of efficacy (P = 0.1). No adverse effect was found at the end of the 8-week trial in any of our patients.

Conclusions

The efficacy of pimecrolimus 1% cream is comparable with that of betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream in treating facial DLE.

### A case of discoid lupus erythematosus of the eyelid [^113EAdtG]. The Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

A 39-year-old man was first evaluated 12 years ago for erosive erythema of the left lower eyelid. The response to topical therapy was poor. The eyelid lesion was excised on the patient's demand 6 years ago and blepharoplasty was performed. However, recurrence of erythematous plaques at the same site prompted referral to our department. Examination clinically revealed atrophic erythematous plaques and several white papules on the left lower eyelid, in addition to an atrophic erythema of the upper back. The histopathological findings of both plaques and papules were typical of discoid lupus erythematosus. Immunoserological findings suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus were absent. The lesions improved with administration of low-dose corticosteroids. Discoid lupus erythematosus involving the eyelid is rare, and definitive diagnosis often takes considerable period of time. In patients with lesions of the eyelid such as erythema or papules that are refractory to treatment, skin biopsy and careful physical examination of the entire body for similar lesions are important.

### Concentrated growth factor therapy as cosmetic treatment in discoid lupus erythematosus [^111ozJ6x]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a disfigurement disease. The atrophic scar and hair loss of this disease are followed by cosmetic defects and profoundly impact psychological health. Concentrated growth factor (CGF) has been widely adopted in medical cosmetology. Here we report a 36-year-old female systemic lupus erythematosus patient with a 5-year history of alopecia in DLE, who was recommended for CGF therapy and experienced hair regrowth. We suggest that CGF may be an effective cosmetic treatment for DLE.

### Successful treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus with tapinarof 1% cream monotherapy [^111t3NEJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a common type of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. It is an autoimmune condition that presents as erythematous, scaly plaque(s) that are typically photodistributed; it can progress to permanent scarring and hyper and hypopigmentation. Treatment options include ultrapotent topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical Janus-Kinase inhibitors, antimalarial agents, and other immunosuppressants. We present a case of a patient with recalcitrant DLE who was successfully treated with tapinarof 1% cream monotherapy.

### IgG and IgM autoantibody differences in discoid and systemic lupus patients [^112yZVFW]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) were reported to have milder disease. To test this observation, we used sandwich arrays containing 98 autoantigens to compare autoantibody profiles of SLE subjects without DLE (DLE-SLE+) (N = 9), SLE subjects with DLE (DLE+SLE+) (N = 10), DLE subjects without SLE (DLE+SLE-) (N = 11), and healthy controls (N = 11). We validated differentially expressed autoantibodies using immunoassays in DLE-SLE+ (N = 18), DLE+SLE+ (N = 17), DLE+SLE- (N = 23), and healthy subjects (N = 22). Arrays showed 15 IgG autoantibodies (10 against nuclear antigens) and 4 IgM autoantibodies that were differentially expressed (q-value < 0.05). DLE-SLE+ subjects had higher IgG autoantibodies against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), histone H2A and H2B, and SS-A (52 kDa) compared with all other groups including DLE+SLE+ subjects (P < 0.05). Immunoassays measuring anti-dsDNA, -ssDNA, and -SS-A (52 kDa) IgG autoantibodies showed similar trends (P < 0.05). Healthy and DLE+SLE- subjects expressed higher IgM autoantibodies against alpha beta crystallin, lipopolysaccharide, heat-shock cognate 70, and desmoglein-3 compared with DLE+SLE+ and DLE-SLE+ subjects. IgG:IgM ratios of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens progressively rose from healthy to DLE-SLE+ subjects. In conclusion, lower IgG autoantibodies against nuclear antigens in DLE+SLE+ versus DLE-SLE+ subjects suggest that DLE indicates lower disease severity. Higher IgM autoantibodies against selected antigens in healthy and DLE+SLE- subjects may be nonpathogenic.

### Late-onset systemic lupus erythematosus associated with inverse discoid lupus erythematosus on the buttock [^115dj8kq]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is important to diagnose early, as treatment is critical for preventing permanent scarring and for identifying possible systemic involvement. Diagnosis is frequently aided by the presence of photosensitive lesions of the head and neck; however, in rare cases, photosensitive lesions may not be present, thus clouding the diagnosis. Importantly, more research is needed to highlight these atypical cases, since they can be associated with greater morbidity.

### Dermoscopy of discoid lupus erythematosus [^113q7qEZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Dermoscopy is useful in evaluating skin tumours, but its applicability also extends into the field of inflammatory skin disorders. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) represents the most common subtype of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. While dermoscopy and videodermoscopy have been shown to aid the differentiation of scalp DLE from other causes of scarring alopecia, limited data exist concerning dermoscopic criteria of DLE in other locations, such as the face, trunk and extremities.

Objective

To describe the dermoscopic criteria observed in a series of patients with DLE located on areas other than the scalp, and to correlate them to the underlying histopathological alterations.

Methods

DLE lesions located on the face, trunk and extremities were dermoscopically and histopathologically examined. Selection of the dermoscopic variables included in the evaluation process was based on data in the available literature on DLE of the scalp and on our preliminary observations. Analysis of data was done with SPSS analysis software.

Results

Fifty-five lesions from 37 patients with DLE were included in the study. Perifollicular whitish halo, follicular keratotic plugs and telangiectasias were the most common dermoscopic criteria. Statistical analysis revealed excellent correlation between dermoscopic and histopathological findings. Notably, a time-related alteration of dermoscopic features was observed.

Conclusions

The present study provides new insights into the dermoscopic variability of DLE located on the face, trunk and extremities.

### In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy features of discoid lupus erythematosus [^113y5mEj]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is an inflammatory condition characterized by round demarcated lesions with varying amounts of erythema, telangiectasia, scaling, follicular plugging, dyspigmentation, atrophy, and scarring. Clinical diagnosis can be confirmed through biopsy samples; reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is also emerging as an accurate diagnostic tool.

Objective and Methods

Our objective was to examine the features of discoid lupus erythematosus on reflectance confocal microscopy. Two patients presenting with discoid lupus erythematosus were imaged using RCM. Features seen in RCM were correlated with those seen in histopathology.

Results

Reflectance confocal microscopy images of discoid lupus erythematosus yielded features characteristically seen in histopathological samples including inflammatory cells, inflammation at the dermo-epidermal junction, pigment incontinence, and vacuolar degeneration.

Conclusion

Reflectance confocal microscopy is a useful tool in the diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus. Features described in these two cases as well as prior research have yielded sufficient data to allow for the formulation of useful RCM diagnostic algorithms. Further studies with a larger patient population will help in confirming and describing new features of DLE on RCM.

### Intravenous immunoglobulins as a new opportunity to treat discoid lupus erythematosus: a case report and review of the literature [^114F1E8Z]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic dermatological disease that can lead to scarring, alopecia and dyspigmentation, if not properly treated. Actually, no drugs are specifically approved for the treatment of CLE, although the first-line therapy usually consists of photoprotection associated to topical or oral steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In cases of DLE refractory to these medications, many other agents have been employed, such as dapsone, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, biologic drugs and Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG). We described the case of a DLE patient resistant to combination therapy with steroid and HCQ who was successfully treated with cyclical IVIG therapy. The treatment with IVIG resulted rapidly effective with persistent efficacy and low rates of relapses, although more cycles of IVIG are needed to achieve a stable clinical remission. We also discussed the beneficial and promising effects of IVIG in patients with Cutaneous Lupus reporting the previously published data.

### Successful treatment with topical tacrolimus in four cases of discoid lupus erythematosus [^111fnfUL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), a cutaneous form of lupus erythematosus, is characterized as atrophic and scaly erythema and the lesions are often refractory to a wide range of topical or systemic therapies. Herein, we present four cases of DLE that were successfully treated with topical tacrolimus. Tacrolimus ointment (0.1%) was applied to DLE lesions twice daily and the erythematous plaques readily diminished after 4–8 weeks. Adverse effects, such as burning sensation or irritations, were not observed. These results indicate that topical tacrolimus might be an effective and alternative treatment to control DLE.

### The interferon-regulated gene signature is elevated in subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and discoid lupus erythematosus and correlates with the cutaneous lupus area and severity index score [^113GxAxA]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is increased expression of type I interferon (IFN)-regulated proteins in the blood and target tissues of patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients with SLE have increased IFN-regulated gene expression pointing towards a possible underlying genetic defect.

Objectives

To determine expression levels of five type I IFN-regulated genes that are highly expressed in SLE in the peripheral blood of patients with CLE and to correlate the expression levels with cutaneous disease activity.

Methods

Peripheral blood was obtained from 10 healthy controls and 30 patients with CLE, including eight with concomitant SLE. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into complementary DNA. Gene expression levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH, standardized to healthy controls and then summed to calculate an IFN score for each patient. Disease activity was assessed with the Cutaneous Lupus Area and Severity Index (CLASI).

Results

Patients with subacute CLE (SCLE) and discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) had elevated IFN scores compared with healthy controls regardless of concomitant SLE (P < 0.01 with SLE and P < 0.05 without SLE). There was no difference between patients with tumid lupus erythematosus (TLE) and healthy controls. The IFN score correlated with CLASI scores (Spearman's rho = 0.55, P = 0.0017).

Conclusions

Patients with SCLE and DLE have an IFN signature, as seen in SLE. The level of gene expression correlates with cutaneous disease activity. These findings support a shared pathogenesis between SLE and some subtypes of CLE.

### Differential expression of BAFF and its receptors in discoid lupus erythematosus patients [^115F9Z8T]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2014). Low credibility.

Background

B-cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) promotes the maturation and survival of B cells. Because BAFF levels are elevated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, BAFF has been the target of emerging therapies for SLE, such as belimumab. Levels of BAFF and its receptors in discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) patients are unknown.

Objective

To compare skin and blood mRNA and protein levels of BAFF and its receptors BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA in DLE subjects with (DLE+/SLE+ (N = 28)) and without SLE (DLE+/SLE- (N = 35)), psoriasis subjects (N = 11), and normal subjects (N = 42).

Methods

We used quantitative real-time PCR to measure blood and skin BAFF, BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA mRNA, sandwich ELISAs to measure sera BAFF, and immunohistochemistry to evaluate BAFF and BAFF-R skin protein expression.

Results

BAFF mRNA and protein levels were highest in DLE+/SLE+blood, followed by DLE+/SLE-, psoriasis, and normal blood. BAFF protein also correlated with anti-nuclear antibodies, and autoantibodies against double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, and ribonucleoprotein, and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index scores in DLE patients. While showing no difference between DLE+/SLE+ and DLE+/SLE- skin, BAFF and its receptors mRNA were up-regulated in DLE skin vs. normal and psoriasis skin. DLE skin had higher percentages of BAFF-R⁺ inflammatory cells, likely T cells and macrophages, than psoriasis and normal skin.

Conclusions

BAFF may be a serologic marker of systemic disease in DLE patients. BAFF and its receptors are elevated in DLE skin, suggesting that targeted therapies against these proteins could treat refractory DLE patients.

### Autoimmune collagen vascular diseases: kids are not just little people [^115j9qQ9]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Morphea, dermatomyositis (DM), and discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) are autoimmune collagen vascular diseases that can present at any age. In all three of these diseases, the tenants of diagnosis and treatment are largely the same in both children and adults, with a few notable differences. Children with morphea are more likely to present with the linear subtype and have a higher incidence of extracutaneous manifestations. Children often need early aggressive systemic treatment to try to prevent long-term sequelae of morphea. In DM, adult disease has a clear association with malignancy that is not seen in children. Adults have a higher rate of pulmonary involvement and increased mortality, whereas calcinosis is more common in juvenile DM. DLE in adults is generally considered to have a low rate of progression from discoid lesions alone to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). DLE is less common in children, but several studies have suggested a higher rate of progression from DLE to SLE in children compared with adults.

### Treatment of scarring alopecia in discoid variant of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus with tacrolimus lotion, 0.3 [^114tVi1z]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic variant of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the skin. Lesions are often localized to the scalp and can result in permanent scarring, disfiguration, and irreversible alopecia. Although DLE usually responds to topical or intralesional corticosteroids and/or oral antimalarials, some DLE is resistant to these treatments or adverse effects limit their effectiveness.

Observations

Three patients with treatment-refractory, biopsy-proved DLE were prescribed a novel, off-label preparation of tacrolimus lotion, 0.3%, in an alcohol base as an adjunct to oral antimalarial therapy. All 3 patients demonstrated improvement in lesion severity and hair regrowth with the use of this regimen after 3 months and continued improvement thereafter. We report a retrospective analysis of these 3 cases.

Conclusions and Relevance

This report is, to our knowledge, the first mention of tacrolimus being used in a lotion formulation to treat DLE lesions, resulting in hair regrowth. Topical tacrolimus lotion, 0.3%, in an alcohol base may be a potential therapeutic option for patients with DLE that is refractory to first-line therapies and who risk late-stage disease with permanent scarring alopecia.

### Pathogenesis of cutaneous lupus erythema associated with and without systemic lupus erythema [^111zSkNk]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) can be an individual disease only involving skin, or presents as part of the manifestations of SLE. A small proportion of CLE may progress into SLE, however, the underlying pathogenic mediators remain elusive. By only including researches that clearly described if the subtypes of CLE presented by enrolled subjects was associated with or without SLE, we provided an overview of antibodies, inflammatory cells and inflammatory molecular mediators identified in blood and skin that were possibly involved in lupus skin damages. IgG autoantibodies are crucial for the development of CLE associated with SLE, but the circulating inflammatory cells and molecular mediators require further studies to provide definitive proof for their association with skin damages. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is the most common subtype of CLE. For DLE without associated with SLE (CDLE), it is lack of evidences if autoantibodies and circulating inflammatory cells are involved in the pathogenesis or not, but is clear that the cutaneous inflammatory infiltrates are dominated by Th1, but not Th17 cells in contrast to the various complex profile in SLE. As the major target cells in skin, keratinocytes may participate the pathophysiological process by increase cell apoptosis and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in SLE and CDLE. Insights into the similarities and differences of the pathogenesis of CLE and CLE associated with SLE will also improve our therapeutic strategies for CLE that is currently adopted from SLE, and prevent the progression of CLE to SLE by providing interventions within an appropriate window of disease development.

### Discoid lupus erythematosus of the eyelids associated with staphylococcal blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction [^113Sqi4Q]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Lower eyelid involvement occurs in 6% of patients with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Eyelid lesions are rarely the initial manifestation of DLE. We describe a 25-year-old woman presenting with discoid lesions of the lower eyelids, staphylococcal blepharitis and Meibomian gland dysfunction, who later developed a discoid lesion on the chin. Histopathological and immunofluorescence studies of a biopsy specimen from this lesion established the diagnosis of DLE. We are unaware of any previously reported cases of DLE presenting with discoid eyelid lesions associated with staphylococcal blepharitis and Meibomian gland dysfunction. DLE should be considered as a differential diagnosis in chronic blepharitis that persists despite usual medical management and eyelid hygiene. Misdiagnosis may lead to eyelid margin deformities, necessitate a complicated full-thickness biopsy, and delay diagnosis of systemic lupus.

### Impressive resolution of refractory hypertrophic discoid lupus erythematosus with anifrolumab [^112zhXiU]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Hypertrophic discoid lupus erythematosus is a rare variant of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus and is often challenging to treat. A male in his early 60s presented with diffuse erythematous, crusty, pruritic plaques on his upper and lower extremities, face, upper back, dorsal aspect of the hands and chest. He also described prolonged morning stiffness, swelling of his fingers and wrists, oral sores and Raynaud's phenomenon. He was positive for antinuclear antibody and anti-SSA antibody and had low C3 and C4 proteins. The skin biopsy was consistent with hypertrophic discoid lupus erythematosus. He was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus. Skin lesions were refractory to treatment with topical corticosteroids, topical acitretin, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine or mycophenolate. Anifrolumab infusions were initiated with a near-complete resolution of cutaneous symptoms within 3months.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: an update on pathogenesis and future therapeutic directions [^112GUqZ3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lupus erythematosus comprises a spectrum of autoimmune diseases that may affect various organs (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) or the skin only (cutaneous lupus erythematosus [CLE]). The latter has traditionally been grouped from a clinical perspective with regard to the onset and course of symptoms, into acute, subacute, intermittent and chronic CLE (Table 1). Typical combinations of clinical, histological and serological findings define these subtypes (Fig. 1), yet there is high interindividual variation. Disease manifestations with more acute onset (malar rash, exanthematic CLE, and bullous LE) segregate from chronic cutaneous manifestations (e.g. discoid CLE), with a declining tendency for systemic disease and detectable circulating antibodies. Excluding organ involvement is important in all newly diagnosed CLE patients and skin symptoms are a commonly expected finding in SLE patients. Unspecific skin findings and vasculopathic reactions such as livedo racemosa, Raynaud phenomenon, and urticarial vasculitis may accompany any type of CLE but are more frequently seen in patients with SLE. Alopecia is also a common finding and discoid scarring lesions must be separated from unspecific diffuse non-scarring alopecia. Overlap between CLE and other cutaneous inflammatory diseases is possible. For example, an overlap between CLE and lichen planus ('lichenoid CLE) harboring clinical and histological features of both diseases with or without serologic markers is mentioned repeatedly in the literature, which may cause diagnostic confusion. Progression from CLE to SLE may occur but the reported numbers vary greatly in the literature between 5 and 25%, which largely depends on the patient characteristics and clinical risk factors in the study populations. Furthermore, different clinical subtypes of CLE are accompanied with varying risk for development of systemic disease. In a Swedish association study for example, progression from initially isolated skin disease to systemic disease occurred in up to 18% of patients, most commonly in patients with subacute CLE. In summary, risk for development of systemic disease is highest in patients presenting with acute CLE (ACLE), and lowest in chronic discoid LE (CDLE). Noteworthy, sociocultural factors (ethnicity, sex, social income, education level) are increasingly recognized to have a major impact on the severity of disease, which is comparable with other chronic inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa. The overall incidence of SLE and CLE is comparable and female patients far outnumber males in both groups.

### Discoid lupus erythematosus successfully treated with deucravacitinib [^112YgZVq]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a scarring form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) characterized by inflammation, dyspigmentation, and alopecia. Given the degree of disfigurement it causes, there is significant negative impact on quality of life. Management of DLE has largely consisted of antimalarials and topical/intralesional corticosteroids. Mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and thalidomide/lenalidomide have been utilized as second and/or third line agents with more recent studies supporting the use of anifrolumab in recalcitrant DLE cases. Deucravacitinib is an oral, first-in-class, selective tyrosine kinase-2 (TYK-2) inhibitor and member of the Janus kinase family approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and, in Japan, also for pustular and erythrodermic psoriasis. A recent phase II clinical trial demonstrated promise for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)while few case reports have shown improvement in tumid lupusand subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. We report a case of a patient with concomitant DLE and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis who had rapid improvement of her DLE on deucravacitinib.

### Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are not major producers of type 1 IFN in cutaneous lupus: an in-depth immunoprofile of subacute and discoid lupus [^117E1ne5]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The immunologic drivers of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and its clinical subtypes remain poorly understood. We sought to characterize the immune landscape of discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute CLE using multiplexed immunophenotyping. We found no significant differences in immune cell percentages between discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute CLE (P > .05) with the exception of an increase in TBK1 in discoid lupus erythematosus (P < .05). Unbiased clustering grouped subjects into 2 major clusters without respect to clinical subtype. Subjects with a history of smoking had increased percentages of neutrophils, disease activity, and endothelial granzyme B compared with nonsmokers. Despite previous assumptions, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) did not stain for IFN-1. Skin-eluted and circulating pDCs from subjects with CLE expressed significantly less IFNα than healthy control pDCs upon toll-like receptor 7 stimulation ex vivo (P < .0001). These data suggest that discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute CLE have similar immune microenvironments in a multiplexed investigation. Our aggregated analysis of CLE revealed that smoking may modulate disease activity in CLE through neutrophils and endothelial granzyme B. Notably, our data suggest that pDCs are not the major producers of IFN-1 in CLE. Future in vitro studies to investigate the role of pDCs in CLE are needed.

Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a severe autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of many abnormal immune cells and a large number of autoantibodies and immune complexes, all of which lead to damage to multiple organs, such as the skin, kidney, and brain. Clinically, LE is mainly divided into two types. One type is known as cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), which mainly presents as dermatological injuries and does not involve systemic damage. The other type of LE involves systemic manifestations, including cutaneous, respiratory, renal, cardiovascular and other symptoms, and is called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) accounts for > 80% of cases of CLE and is the most common type of CLE. On the one hand, approximately 5% of CLE patients will convert to SLE; on the other hand, ~20% of SLE patients exhibit CLE lesions at the time of diagnosis or in the years after diagnosis. Although the manifestations of cutaneous lesions are distinct between DLE and SLE, the cell composition and the underlying molecular events in cutaneous lesions of DLE and SLE remain unclear.

### Scar classification in cutaneous lupus erythematosus: morphological description [^116oUsG3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Scarring represents the single most debilitating aspect of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) in patients with cutaneous lesions alone. Despite this, there have been no studies which have attempted to classify the types of scars seen in this chronic disease.

Objectives

The aim was to classify the types of scars based on morphological description.

Patients and Methods

Forty-five patients with histologically confirmed DLE were included in the study. In the assessment of the types of scars, the scars were scored initially according to their anatomical localization. Each anatomical area was assessed for the types of scars which occurred in these areas.

Results

Scars in patients with DLE were initially classified morphologically into six types according to the site of the scar and then each type was classified into subtypes according to the morphology of the scar. Scars were seen in the majority of the patients and scarring affected mostly areas including the scalp, other hairy areas such as the eyebrows, nonhairy areas, mucosa, fatty layers of the skin and the nails. This study demonstrated that scars may not only produce textural changes but may also produce pigmentary changes. It is possible that other types of scars may yet occur in DLE but have not so far been detected.

Conclusions

Early classification and identification of the types of scars in these patients may change management towards more aggressive therapy in those with continued disease activity, and it is possible that different types of scarring require different therapies.

Background: Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is rare in children. Prior studies suggest 25–30% of children with skin-limited DLE are diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) over time. Biomarkers and risk factors to identify those at highest risk are unknown. This multicenter, retrospective study aims to characterize baseline features and outcomes in pediatric patients with skin-limited DLE, as well as risk factors for the progression of DLE to SLE. Baseline characteristics of all patients with DLE and initial study findings are presented in this interim analysis.

Methods: Nine of 18 committed clinical sites, including pediatric dermatologists and rheumatologists, retrospectively reviewed all medical records of patients = / < 18 years of age with clinical and/or histopathologic findings consistent with DLE. Baseline data were collected on all patients, including demographics, dates of DLE onset and diagnosis, distribution of DLE, and family history of SLE. For patients with skin-limited DLE, rates of progression to SLE based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification criteria were evaluated.

Results: Clinical records for 205 patients have been reviewed to date, with 50% of participating sites reporting. Baseline data are presented in Table 1. African-American females were most commonly affected. Median age at DLE diagnosis was 11.8 years and median time from DLE onset to DLE diagnosis was 0.5 years. Most patients (76%) had localized disease (i.e. head/neck only); 20% had a family history of SLE in a 1st degree relative. Most patients had skin-limited DLE at baseline, with only a minority exhibiting ≥ 4 ACR classification criteria (n = 56; 27%) or ≥ 4 SLICC classification criteria (n = 46; 22%). Initial treatments are presented in Table 2. Patients with skin-limited DLE and at least one follow-up visit (n = 115) had median follow up of 3.1 years (range 0.1–12.5 years, 393 total patient-years). During this period, a minority met criteria for SLE diagnosis, utilizing ≥ 4 ACR classification criteria (n = 16; 14%) and ≥ 4 SLICC classification criteria (n = 24; 22%).

### Concentrated growth factor therapy as cosmetic treatment in discoid lupus erythematosus [^115GtPQz]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Up to 60% of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) patients have scalp involvement. The lymphocytic inflammatory process replaces the hair follicle units with fibrous tissue to destroy them, rendering conventional therapies ineffective. Concentrated growth factor (CGF), a novel autologous plasma extract, plays a distinct role in modulating the inflammatory response and fibroblast differentiation, inducing angiogenesis, skin regeneration, and even new hair follicle. Here, we reported a 36‐year‐old female with scarring alopecia secondary to DLE who experienced partial hair regrowth after treatment with intralesional CGF injections.

### Dyspigmentation and scarring in cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^1151j11m]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease marked by skin lesions that can vary in appearance and severity. Subacute cutaneous erythematosus (SCLE), acute cutaneous erythematosus (ACLE) and chronic cutaneous erythematosus (CCLE) make up the CLE categories, and CCLE may be further subtyped (table 1). ACLE lesions may be transient and are typified by malar or photodistributed erythema, while SCLE is characterised by photosensitive erythematous psoriasiform or annular/polycyclic lesions. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) makes up the largest portion of the CCLE category with lesions that are intensely inflammatory and lead to disfiguring scars. While permanent dyspigmentation and scarring are recognised as complications of DLE, no studies have investigated the incidence and correlation of scarring and dyspigmentation across all the CLE categories and subtypes. With DLE being one of the more common forms of CLE, many non-dermatologists may assume that scarring and dyspigmentation go hand-in-hand in CLE as a whole. However, in our clinic, we have seen that this might not always be the case, with most patients having more dyspigmentation than scarring or vice versa, depending on the CLE category and subtype. Previous studies have shown that symptoms such as dyspigmentation and scarring may impact quality of life. As better characterisation of such symptoms may impact how clinicians document disease damage as well as manage patients' expectations on their disease course, we set out to investigate the relationship between dyspigmentation and scarring in CLE further.

### Papulonodular mucinosis with features of discoid lupus erythematosus [^117ENLA7]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Papulonodular mucinosis is a cutaneous dermal subtype that comprises a small percentage of lupus erythematosus (LE) cases, with an estimated 80% of these cases occurring in the setting of systemic LE (SLE). In a review of the literature, approximately 76% and 20% of papulonodular mucinosis cases were noted to be associated with SLE and discoid LE (DLE), respectively. Substantial dermal mucin deposition leads to the characteristic clinical and histopathological manifestations, which are usually readily distinguishable from other cutaneous LE (CLE) subtypes. We describe a patient with papulonodular mucinosis with concurrent features of DLE.

### Filgotinib or lanraplenib in moderate to severe cutaneous lupus erythematosus: a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^1165nhy2]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a multifactorial, heterogeneous autoimmune disease with broad clinical manifestations, from cutaneous LE (CLE) to SLE, potentially involving multiple organ systems. CLE may present in isolation or as a clinical manifestation in the setting of SLE. CLE-specific skin lesions present with varied morphology and histopathology, including acute, subacute (SCLE) and chronic (CCLE). CCLE is categorized further into several subtypes, of which discoid is the most common. Treatments for CLE are adapted from SLE, as there is no US Food and Drug Administration–approved CLE therapy at present. The current treatment strategy of CLE includes topical corticosteroids, antimalarials, retinoids, dapsone, immunosuppressants and immunomodulatory agents, all with highly variable levels of effectiveness or with dose-limiting toxicities. Thus there is an unmet need for safe and effective therapy for the cutaneous manifestations of LE.

Activation of the IFN pathway, a key driver of CLE disease activity, occurs through the chronic production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably type I IFN (IFN-I) and an increased expression of IFN-I-regulated genes. IFN-I is produced by a variety of cells, primarily dendritic cells and keratinocytes, and drives an inflammatory autoimmune process resulting in possible tissue damage, particularly in the skin and joints. Antibody blockade of IFN-I signalling through the IFN receptor reduced disease activity in SLE in a phase 2b trial and phase 3 trials. Treatment with a monoclonal antibody targeting blood dendritic cell antigen 2 on plasmacytoid dendritic cells reduced the expression of IFN-I response biomarkers in blood and skin and was associated with reduced skin disease activity in a phase 1 study that enrolled SLE patients with active cutaneous disease and a phase 2 study in CLE.

### Classification of lupus erythematosus based upon Japanese patients [^11297pPS]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

The two dimensional classification system for lupus erythematosus (LE) is proposed. The terms for diagnoses and those for eruptions should be used separately. The terms for diagnoses are cutaneous-limited LE (CLE), intermediate LE (ILE) and systemic LE (SLE). CLE is an entity which has only cutaneous manifestations, and ILE has mild systemic manifestations. On the other hand, the terms for skin manifestations are chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE) and acute cutaneous LE (ACLE). CCLE includes discoid LE (DLE), chilblain LE and LE profundus. SCLE includes annular SCLE and papulosquamous SCLE. In this classification system, the condition of each LE patient is estimated integratedly both in systemic and cutaneous standpoints. Analyzing Japanese LE patients by this classification system, the usefulness of this system and the features of Japanese LE patients are discussed.

### Discoid chronic lupus erythematosus at the site of a previously healed cutaneous leishmaniasis: an example of isotopic response [^116VRZ5D]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

The term "isotopic response" describes the occurrence of a new skin disorder at the site of another, unrelated and already healed one. We report here the case of a 38-year-old woman who referred to us for an infiltrated, red-brownish plaque localized on her left cheek. The patient had been treated for a cutaneous leishmaniasis, confirmed by the histologic examination, localized at the same site. She was completely healed after an appropriate local and systemic treatment. She experienced the occurrence of the new plaque at the site of the previously healed cutaneous leishmaniasis three month later. Histologic examination and laboratory tests were consistent with a diagnosis of discoid cutaneous chronic lupus erythematosus. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine, topical clobetasol and topical tretinoin resulted in flattening and clearing of the lesion. Our case is the first case of isotopic response where a discoid chronic lupus erythematosus had occurred at the site of an already healed cutaneous leishmaniasis. We speculate that the activation of type-1 interferon system may be involved in the pathogenesis of our case.

### Late-onset systemic lupus erythematosus associated with inverse discoid lupus erythematosus on the buttock [^114X3Gd4]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Overall, our case represents an unusual case of SLE in association with DLE. The patient presented with an isolated discoid lesion on the photo-protected area of her lower portion of the back and buttock and subsequently went on to develop lupus cerebritis, a severe manifestation of systemic lupus. SLE can be difficult to diagnose given its frequent nonspecific and overlapping symptoms with many other different conditions. Photosensitive lesions can be a helpful clue to assess the diagnosis; however, our case demonstrates that overreliance on this identifying feature can lead to a situation where more insidious cases are missed. Hence, our case emphasizes the importance of high clinical suspicion and critical thinking in the absence of photosensitive lesions. Notably, given our patient's age, she technically qualifies as having late-onset SLE, which is when the disease develops after the age of 50. Late-onset SLE has been known to present with atypical SLE symptoms, and this may explain the unusual features of this case. Lastly, previous studies have highlighted that, although there is extensive data on patients with isolated DLE, there are few studies that have analyzed the clinical characteristics of SLE associated with DLE. Of the few studies that do exist, the largest study found that these patients are at particularly increased risk of developing serious manifestations such as vasculitis and chronic seizures. For this reason, identifying and surveilling these patients is critical, and more research is needed to further characterize this susceptible population.

1 CLINICAL LANDSCAPE

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune skin disease with dermatologic manifestations that can occur with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). CLE lesions typically involve sun‐exposed areas secondary to photosensitivity. Disease chronicity coupled with the potential for long‐lasting secondary sequelae can significantly impact quality of life for affected individuals. CLE patients are screened at diagnosis with clinical and laboratory tests and continue to be monitored at least annually.

The Gilliam and Sontheimer classification system for CLE was established in 1982 and describes three major subtypes as umbrella categories for more specific categorizations: acute CLE (ACLE), subacute CLE (SCLE), and chronic CLE (CCLE) which includes discoid LE (DLE). While subtypes are often distinguishable by clinical features, absolute subtype criteria can be challenging due to overlap in presentation and difficulty in distinguishing morphology. Distinguishing features, such as atrophy and scarring in DLE, may present later in the disease course and can be difficult to discern clinically.

Despite the clinical variation among different subtypes, the strategies for management often overlap. Existing treatments target disease through prevention, topical therapies, and systemic measures. Preventative strategies primarily focus on avoidance of common triggers through SPF sun protection greater than 70, smoking cessation, and minimizing exposure to photosensitizing medications. For cases with limited dermatologic involvement, topical therapies such as topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors directly target active lesions with minimal risk for systemic effects.

Remarkably, there have been no new US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved systemic treatments for CLE in over 60 years. The only FDA‐approved medications for CLE are hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids, which were accepted under previous regulations before implementation of the current standards for clinical trials. Off‐label therapies include other antimalarials such as chloroquine and quinacrine as well as immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil. Additional treatment options include dapsone, retinoids (acitretin, isotretinoin, and alitretinoin), thalidomide, and lenalidomide. Treatments approved for SLE are sometimes used for CLE treatment. Because they are considered off‐label treatments, these medications are not usually covered by insurance companies, placing a significant burden on the patient. This category includes medications such as rituximab, belimumab, and anifrolumab.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: an update on pathogenesis and future therapeutic directions [^113dWqyA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment and Future Directions

Based on the aforementioned pathophysiology of CLE, treatment mainly relies on the avoidance of typical triggers and dampening of the effects of key immunologic reactions. We briefly recapitulate commonly used substances and reflect on developments that are more recent.

Conventional Treatments

A variety of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs are in use for CLE (see Table 2 for an overview). There is a striking lack of licensed drugs both in Europe and the United States (US). Being a chronic-relapsing inflammatory skin disease, long-term remissions are rare in CLE and many patients require continued treatment. In a longitudinal cohort study, factors associated with a lower chance of long-term remission were smoking and discoid CLE.

Topical Treatment

Optimal broad-spectrum sunscreen is mandatory for all patients. Topical corticosteroids (TCS), especially more potent agents such as fluocinonide, are the first-line options for circumscribed CLE. Intralesional application with triamcinolone suspension may also be suitable in specific localizations such as the scalp. However, use is limited by typical adverse effects (skin atrophy) and lack of efficiency in widespread disease. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI; pimecrolimus, tacrolimus) may be used (off-label) for sustaining remissions, especially in facial lesions, but they often fail to control flares of the disease. The response varies among clinical subtypes. Some authors argue for off-label use of topical retinoids (tazarotene, tretinoin) in hypertrophic lesions. Topical treatment is also a mainstay as adjunct to systemic treatments.

### Discoid lupus erythematosus of the nail treated with thalidomide [^112UATd3]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 59-year-old woman with a 13-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with discoid and tumid lupus erythematosus of the face and scalp presented in October 2016 for an evaluation of recalcitrant onychodystrophy. A punch biopsy of the fifth fingernail of the left limb was performed earlier that month, which revealed basal layer squamatization, vacuolar interface change, basement membrane zone thickening, superficial and deep dermal perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate, and diffuse hyalinized, hypocellular change with necrosis involving the reticular dermis, consistent with the connective tissue disease presumed to be DLE.

At the time of presentation, her systemic and cutaneous lupus were mostly controlled with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily), methotrexate (20 mg weekly), and aspirin (325 mg daily). However, the patient had a few newly developed erythematous plaques on the scalp (responsive to topical halobetasol 0.05% cream) and uncontrolled nail disease of the third, fourth, and fifth digits of the left hand. Dermatologic examination at the time of presentation revealed active DLE at the proximal nailfold with resultant onychodystrophy, subungual thickening, onychauxis, and atrophic scarring on the third, fourth, and fifth digits (Fig 1). The patient's nail disease had previously failed to respond to multiple other medications, including mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, azathioprine, and epratuzumab (SLE clinical trial).

### Successful treatment of facial localized discoid lupus erythematosus with intralesional betamethasone: a report of three cases [^117Pjfv5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic autoimmune skin disease that usually causes disfiguring scarring, dyspigmentation, and atrophy. Despite a range of available topical and systemic therapies, the treatment of DLE remains a therapeutic challenge, especially in some refractory cases. Here, we reported three male patients with long-term chronic lesions of unilateral facial localized DLE, who failed to have their disease controlled with many previous topical/systemic treatments, showed rapid and well response to intralesional injections of betamethasone (2 mg/mL, 0.2 mL/site) monotherapy once every 2weeks for two, two, and four times of treatment, respectively. Intralesional betamethasone may provide a safe and effective alternative in the management of refractory localized DLE skin lesions.

Introduction

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a common type of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. It is an autoimmune condition that presents as erythematous, scaly plaque(s) that can progress to permanent scarring and hyper and hypopigmentation; it is typically photodistributed. Treatment options include aggressive ultrapotent topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical Janus kinase inhibitors, antimalarial agents, and other aggressive immunosuppressants. We present a case of recalcitrant DLE who improved with roflumilast 0.3% cream after a suboptimal response to anifrolumab infusion.

### Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus versus discoid lupus erythematosus: a challenging diagnosis [^114qeKyy]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Another helpful characteristic in distinguishing SCLE from DLE is the morphology of active lesions. The 2 morphologic variants of SCLE include annular and papulosquamous, with approximately 42% of patients with SCLE having annular, 39% with papulosquamous, and 16% with features of both. As these lesions typically involve a superficial dermal inflammatory infiltrate, they are usually minimally palpable. This differs from DLE, which more frequently involves a denser infiltrate that extends to the reticular dermis as well.DLE lesions are characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous, scaly papules that can develop into infiltrated discoid plaques, less commonly, they can be hypertrophic or verrucous.DLE commonly involves follicular plugging. Patient 1 had erythematous, scaly papules and plaques on her arms and face as well as well-demarcated, indurated, discoid lesions on her ears and upper portion of the back. Patient 2 had areas on her back and arms with papules coalescing into plaques, with some hypertrophic scales. On her face, she had well-demarcated, indurated, discoid lesions. Both patients had morphologic features of papulosquamous SCLE, but also with discoid lesions consistent with DLE. Additionally, many of patient 2's lesions had hyperkeratotic scale, which would be more consistent with DLE.

Damage after lesion resolution can be particularly helpful in distinguishing SCLE from DLE. SCLE typically resolves without scarring, but dyspigmentation may occur. In DLE, lesions typically lead to scarring and atrophy, in addition to dyspigmentation. Early lesions can be difficult to distinguish from SCLE, before a pattern of damage can be appreciated. Patient 1 had some mild hypopigmented macules on her arms and face, but also presented with areas of atrophy and scarring on her upper portion of the back and ears. Patient 2 presented with extensive areas of damage. On her arms and back, lesions resolved with diffuse hypopigmentation and atrophy, but with intact skin markings. Her face had areas of atrophic scarring and other areas of hypopigmentation. Despite both patients having CLE for many years, a consistent and clear picture of scarring after active lesion resolution could not be appreciated, as resolution both with and without scarring could be appreciated.

### Brief report: pharmacodynamics, safety, and clinical efficacy of AMG 811, a human anti-interferon-γ antibody, in patients with discoid lupus erythematosus [^111NxCL4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Cutaneous lupus, including DLE, is the result of aberrant autoimmune activation in the skin 14. Patients with DLE have an elevated IFN signature in the blood, suggesting that the pathogenic mechanisms are similar in patients with SLE and those with cutaneous lupus 15. AMG 811 is a monoclonal antibody that blocks IFNγ. In this study of patients with DLE, treatment with AMG 811 demonstrated clear pharmacologic activity in both the blood and lesional skin, as measured using the IGBS score. Notably, after treatment, the IGBS score did not reach the levels seen in nonlesional skin, suggesting that either incomplete blockade of the pathway or partial activation by other cytokines may occur.

When IFNγ activity was measured using the keratinocyte IFNγ RNA score, DLE lesional skin, DLE nonlesional skin, and normal skin from healthy volunteers were shown to have correspondingly varying levels of IFNγ activity, with the scores in DLE nonlesional skin being intermediate to those in lesional and normal skin. Treatment with AMG 811 did not significantly impact the keratinocyte IFNγ RNA score in the skin.

Given the pharmacologic responses to AMG 811 in both the blood and skin as measured by the IGBS and keratinocyte IFNγ RNA scores, the single dose of AMG 811 administered to patients with DLE possibly did not provide sufficient coverage to elicit a clinical response that could be measured by the CLASI‐A. The 180‐mg subcutaneous dose of AMG 811 covered the target adequately as assessed on the basis of changes in the serum CXCL10 levels over ≥ 56 days — a duration of treatment consistent with the measurement of efficacy in other DLE studies 8, 16, 17 — but the dose level of AMG 811 required to penetrate the skin and overcome local production of IFNγ may be higher. Alternatively, despite coverage of the IFNγ pathway, possibly other pathways, including the type I IFN pathways, may need to be inhibited concurrently to impact clinical disease. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of this population and the role of several interdependent and independent pathways may preclude the use of blockade of a single IFN pathway as an effective treatment for the majority of patients with SLE and DLE. Overall, these results do not provide a clear answer to the role of IFNγ in the pathogenesis of DLE. While differences in gene expression profiles in the blood and skin indicate dysregulation of the IFNγ pathway, conclusions about causality cannot be drawn given the possible incomplete blockade of the pathway in the tissue and the lack of discernible clinical impact.

### Diffuse hair loss in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus [^114LSp1C]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA)
B. Alopecia Areata
C. Lupus hair
D. Fibrosing alopecia with a pattern distribution (FAPD)
E. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE)

Answers:

A. FFA – Incorrect. The clinical presentation does not support this diagnosis. Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is a lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia characterized by frontotemporal and eyebrow hairloss.FFA is also associated with facial papules. FFA has been reported to occur rarely in both discoid lupus and systemic lupus erythematosus.
B. Alopecia Areata – Incorrect. Diffuse alopecia areata may be a mimicker clinically, however the classic histopathology would not show a scarring alopecia. There would be absence of perifollicular fibrosis and there would be a lymphocytic cell infiltrate around the anagen bulb.
C. Lupus hair – Incorrect. Lupus hair is characterized by dry and fragile short hairs on the frontal hair-line in patients with SLE, giving the appearance of vellus hairs on the anterior scalp.
D. FAPD – Correct. FAPD is a lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia that has been recently described and has overlapping clinical and histopathologic features of FFA and androgenetic alopecia. Our patient has hair loss in a frontoparietal distribution with histopathology showing lymphocytic infiltrate around the infundibular region of the hair follicle, perifollicular lamellar fibrosis, and miniaturized hair follicles which makes FAPD most likely.FAPD occurs more frequently in postmenopausal women than men. White patients are more commonly affected, but FAPD has been reported in Hispanic individuals and those of African descent.
E. DLE – Incorrect. Discoid lupus can cause a scarring alopecia characterized by violaceous atrophic plaques with follicular plugging and dyspigmentation. Histopathology shows interface dermatitis, basement membrane thickening, lymphohistiocytic infiltration around vessels and appendages, mucin deposition, and follicular keratotic plugs.

### Hydroxychloroquine [^115ubUfU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Malaria

Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial [see Microbiology (12.4)] and antirheumatic agent.

Rheumatoid Arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Chronic Discoid Lupus Erythematosus

The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus are not fully known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine have not been fully characterized.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Following oral administration, the whole blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine at steady state is dose proportional over a dose range from 200 mg daily to 400 mg daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus patients.

Absorption

Following a single 200 mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to healthy male volunteers, whole blood hydroxychloroquine Cmaxwas 129.6 ng/mL (plasma Cmaxwas 50.3 ng/mL) with Tmaxof 3.3 hours (plasma Tmax3.7 hours). Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine. Mean absolute oral bioavailability is 79% (SD: 12%) in fasting conditions.

Peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following a single dose of 155 mg intravenous infusion and from 2290 ng/mL to 4211 ng/mL (mean 3312 ng/mL) following a single dose of 310 mg intravenous infusion in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity.

### Discoid lupus erythematosus with dystrophic calcinosis cutis [^11252wDj]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Calcinosis cutis (CC) is a rare disorder known to occur commonly in association with underlying autoimmune connective tissue diseases. CC primarily occurs in patients with dermatomyositis, systemic scleroderma, and mixed connective tissue disease. It is only rarely associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and even more rarely with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE).

### Dyspigmentation and scarring in cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^115ZCrHi]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

No studies have investigated the incidence and correlation of scarring and dyspigmentation across all cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) categories and subtypes. As better characterisation of such symptoms may impact how clinicians document disease damage as well as manage patients' expectations on their disease course, we set out to investigate the relationship between dyspigmentation and scarring in CLE further.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional review of our IRB-approved CLE database at the University of Pennsylvania. Patients were divided by category and chronic CLE (CCLE) subtype. Dyspigmentation and scarring were quantified using the CLE Disease Area and Severity Index damage score. Data on dyspigmentation and scarring were captured from the patient visit where dyspigmentation was highest.

Results

Dyspigmentation and scarring significantly differed between CLE categories and CCLE subtypes. Across categories, CCLE had the highest medians for dyspigmentation and scarring. Across CCLE subtypes, discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) had the highest medians for dyspigmentation and scarring. Positive correlations for dyspigmentation and scarring were seen in CCLE, DLE and LE panniculitis.

Conclusions

Dyspigmentation and scarring correlation differences highlight the importance of accurate assessment and documentation of both elements of damage as well as classification of CLE category and subtype. Our results reflect important differences in the CLE categories and CCLE subtypes which may be helpful for clinicians and patients as they navigate the course of the disease.

Discussion

DLE is the most common clinical variant (50%) of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus and disproportionately affects those with skin of color. Since DLE can lead to scarring and dyspigmentation, it is critical to diagnose the condition early to prevent morbidity. DLE has a strong tendency to appear in photosensitive areas, such as the face, ears, and scalp; a feature that frequently aids in the diagnosis. DLE that occurs on photo-protected sites is rare and, when present, is most often associated with lesions concurrently present on photosensitive sites. This variant of discoid lesions appearing both above and below the neck is otherwise known as generalized/disseminated DLE and represents roughly 20% of all DLE cases. In contrast, localized DLE is commonly accepted as the presence of lesions confined to the head and neck. While there is no established classification for DLE lesions solely below the neck, our patient's presentation of an isolated lesion on the trunk might be best categorized as an atypical generalized DLE without head or neck involvement.

Another rare feature of this case is that our patient, with an isolated discoid lesion, went on to develop systemic lupus. Systemic lupus in association with DLE is uncommon; only approximately 50% of patients with discoid lupus are positive for antinuclear antibody, and only 5% to 20% develop systemic features of SLE. Those with DLE who do go on to develop systemic lupus mostly have mild, predominantly musculoskeletal, symptoms. Additionally, most patients with DLE who develop systemic symptoms have multiple discoid lesions located throughout the body. This patient, with an isolated lesion, developed systemic lupus in the form of lupus cerebritis, a more severe manifestation of systemic lupus. Lupus cerebritis describes the neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE and most commonly manifests as headaches, cognitive dysfunction, and psychiatric disorders. Vision problems are less common and are considered a more severe symptom. Associated abducens-nerve palsy has been described in the literature, though rarely so.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus… [^117VGYnK]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is lupus affecting the skin. In this autoimmune disease, the body's immune system attacks healthy skin. There are 3 main types: Acute cutaneous lupus; Subacute cutaneous lupus; and Chronic cutaneous lupus. All patients with skin lupus need to be monitored for disease inside of the body, which can affect the joints, kidneys, lungs, and other organs. Acute skin lupus almost always involves more than just the skin, whereas both subacute and discoid lupus often occur only in the skin. This is important because while all patients with skin lupus need to be monitored, many patients with either subacute lupus or discoid lupus go through life without significant disease inside their bodies.

Lupus most often appears between the ages of 20 and 50 years; it affects women more than men; and it may happen more in patients with a family history of lupus or other autoimmune diseases. Symptoms. Each type of skin lupus can be triggered and worsened by sunlight. Acute skin lupus most often involves a prominent rash on the cheeks and nose. Subacute lupus most often presents with a red, raised, scaly rash on sun-exposed areas of the body. It tends to have circular skin lesions or lesions that can look like psoriasis on sun-exposed skin. Discoid lupus starts out as a red to purple scaly rash on the scalp, face, ears, and other sun-exposed areas. Over time, discoid lupus may heal with discolored scarring and even hair loss when the scalp is involved. Sometimes patients may feel pain or itch. Diagnosis. Your physician will look at all of your skin, ask questions about your medical and family history, take blood and urine samples, and may do a skin biopsy.

Yearly blood and urine testing is needed to screen for lupus affecting the joints or internal organs. Your physician may recommend seeing a rheumatologist if there is concern that your lupus may affect the joints or organs.

### Lenalidomide for the treatment of resistant discoid lupus erythematosus… [^111gr5YA]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Background Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic, disfiguring disease that is characterized by scaly, erythematous, disk-shaped patches and plaques followed by atrophy, scarring, and dyspigmentation. It is refractory to standard therapies in a small population of patients. We investigated the use of lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, as a novel alternative therapy in 2 cases of refractory DLE and report our results. Discoid lupus erythematosus is a clinical subtype of cutaneous LE that typically presents as scaly, erythematous, disk-shaped patches and plaques followed by atrophy, scarring, and dyspigmentation. 1 The lesions are chronic, disfiguring, and sometimes refractory to treatment. Its potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties may be via the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine secretion such as TNF, T-cell costimulation, and antiangiogenic activity.

7 In comparison to thalidomide, it is 2000-fold more potent as an inhibitor of TNF. 8, 9 Also, lenalidomide has a lower frequency of many of thalidomide's common adverse effects, and preclinical studies have failed to show teratogenicity or mutagenesis in animals. Report of cases Case 1 A 43-year-old African American woman presented with a 9-year history of refractory, generalized DLE and a 10-year history of systemic LE with lesions characterized by erythematous and dyspigmented macules and papules, some with erosions and scale, on her face, scalp, back, and bilateral upper and lower extremities. However, the rapid initial improvement was followed by some worsening of skin disease, although not back to the level seen before initiation of therapy. A 40-year old African American woman presented with a 10-year history of severe refractory generalized DLE and SLE.

Her lesions were characterized by erythema, scale, dyspigmentation, and scarring of her face, scalp, back, and extremities. Baseline laboratory tests demonstrated a positive antinuclear antibody titer, anti–double-stranded DNA antibody, and a low C4 level.

### Discoid lupus erythematosus: successful treatment with oral methotrexate… [^111RTVxC]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

We report an encouraging response to treatment with methotrexate in a single patient with severe discoid lupus erythematosus who did not respond to conventional therapy. Report of a Case. A 61-year-old white woman presented 7 years ago with a 39-year history of severe scarring discoid lupus erythematosus. Previous treatments included topical and intralesional steroid therapy and lowdose prednisone. Examination revealed numerous large erythematous infiltrated scaly plaques with focal areas of atrophy on the face. There was extensive scarring from previous lesions. Aside from arthralgia, there was no evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. Initial laboratory investigations included a normal hemogram, an elevated sedimentation rate, normal renal function, negative rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA, and RNP and Sm antibodies. Complement studies were normal. Findings from a skin biopsy specimen were consistent with discoid lupus erythematosus.

Direct immunofluorescence studies showed negative findings. Initial therapy consisted of chloroquine: 938–939.

### Treatment of alopecia in chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus… [^117J3GA5]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Importance Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic variant of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the skin. Lesions are often localized to the scalp and can result in permanent scarring, disfiguration, and irreversible alopecia. Although DLE usually responds to topical or intralesional corticosteroids and/or oral antimalarials, some DLE is resistant to these treatments or adverse effects limit their effectiveness. Conclusions and Relevance This report is, to our knowledge, the first mention of tacrolimus being used in a lotion formulation to treat DLE lesions, resulting in hair regrowth. Topical tacrolimus lotion, 0. 3%, in an alcohol base may be a potential therapeutic option for patients with DLE that is refractory to first-line therapies and who risk late-stage disease with permanent scarring alopecia.

Introduction Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic variant of cutaneous lupus erythematosus characterized by well-defined erythematous plaques with scale, often predominantly featured on the face, ears, anterior neck, and scalp. More than half of patients with DLE first present with scalp involvement. Discoid lupus erythematosus is one of the most common causes of inflammatory cicatricial, or scarring, alopecia. Complications can include ulceration or permanent cosmetic disfigurement, with in situ squamous cell carcinoma occasionally seen in long-standing lesions. At later stages, the lesions may appear as smooth atrophic scars with central hypopigmentation and loss of follicular ostia, occasionally resembling lichen planopilaris or Brocq psuedopelade. Discussion Discoid lupus erythematosus is a common cause of scarring alopecia among patients with scalp involvement.

The inflammatory cell infiltrate is especially prominent around the hair follicle at the level of the sebaceous glands and bulge, the location of the hair's regenerative stem cells. In advanced DLE, many, if not all, of the hair follicles and sebaceous glands are destroyed, leaving residual fibrosis and atrophy. Early diagnosis and treatment are necessary because scarring can lead to irreversible alopecia and disfiguration.
