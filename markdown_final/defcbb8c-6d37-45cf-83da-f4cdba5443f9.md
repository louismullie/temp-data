## Question

Skin lesions with dark purple margins and pink center

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a lesion with a pink center and dark purple margins, likely a targetoid lesion, and wants to refine the differential, diagnostics, and management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this morphology matches a target or iris lesion and which entities best fit that pattern. Then, I should verify key distinguishing clinical features and triggers that separate look-alikes. Next, I will review which diagnostic tests meaningfully narrow the differential versus those that are low-yield. After that, I need to confirm the safest, highest-yield biopsy strategy if needed. Finally, I will outline evidence-based management and follow-up contingencies based on likely diagnoses, making sure to flag any overstatements I might make and correct them explicitly as I go.

> Let me first confirm the morphologic anchor. A pink center with a dark purple margin classically evokes a target lesion, and erythema multiforme (EM) is the prototypical target lesion with three concentric zones: a dark center, a lighter pink ring, and an outer red ring; EM is commonly triggered by HSV, Mycoplasma, medications, or other infections, and it favors acral sites symmetrically, so this morphology fits EM as a leading diagnosis [^1166U3Du] [^115rcjbq]. Wait, let me verify that the target description is accurate: yes, AAFP describes the concentric segments precisely and emphasizes the extremity distribution, which aligns with this pattern [^1166U3Du].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — other entities can mimic targets. Targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma (THH) can show a central purplish papule with an ecchymotic/brown ring that may look "targetoid", and its hallmark is the targetoid clinical silhouette with surrounding hemosiderin change, which could be misread as a dark margin in the right lighting. The distribution and history help distinguish it from EM, but the morphologic overlap means I should keep THH on the list when vascular malformation or trauma-associated patterns are suspected [^111aemW1]. I should double-check that THH truly can simulate a targetoid appearance: yes, case descriptions and images document the expanding ecchymotic ring and central papule, supporting its inclusion here [^111aemW1].

> I need to check pediatric considerations next. Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy (AHEI) presents with sharply demarcated, targetoid, indurated purpuric plaques on the face and extremities, often with facial edema in infants and young children; while age is a strong discriminator, the targetoid morphology with purpuric margins overlaps and can confound the picture if age is unknown or the case is atypical, so I should ask age carefully and look for systemic involvement to separate AHEI from EM and vasculitis mimics [^112mvDwD]. But wait, what if I initially overstate AHEI's frequency in adults? I should correct that: AHEI is primarily a disease of infants and toddlers, so in older patients this becomes much less likely, reinforcing the value of age in prioritization [^112mvDwD].

> Let me consider inflammatory and autoimmune differentials. Urticarial vasculitis produces urticarial lesions that burn or sting, persist longer than 24–48 hours, are nonblanching or purpuric, and often leave hyperpigmentation; the purple hue and longer duration would help distinguish it from simple urticaria and align better with a vasculitic process rather than EM's typical course, though overlap can occur and biopsy may be decisive if the story is atypical [^115f7eS8] [^117CEA92]. I should confirm the time course and tenderness because UV typically hurts and lasts days, whereas EM targets often evolve over 1–2 weeks with mucosal involvement in more severe forms [^115rcjbq].

> Next, I should review infections that can produce targetoid or annular lesions. Erythema migrans in Lyme disease expands centrifugally and is typically nonpruritic with central clearing, which could be misinterpreted as a target; however, its evolution over days to weeks without the classic three-zone target of EM, and epidemiologic context, usually separate it, but in early presentations I must ask about exposure risks and timing of expansion to avoid misclassification [^113bvXs7]. Secondary syphilis can also be annular and mimic targets, so I should keep a sexual and systemic history in mind if the distribution is truncal and polymorphic with palmoplantar involvement, as that pattern is less consistent with EM's acral predilection [^112AmniE].

> I will now examine drug-induced and immunologic causes. Fixed drug eruption can recur at the same site with violaceous patches or plaques and central duskiness, and mucosal involvement is common; the reproducibility at the same site after the same agent exposure is a key clue, so I should explicitly ask about prior identical episodes and medication timing, including OTCs and supplements, to avoid missing FDE masquerading as EM or vasculitis [^116PqAti]. Let me reconsider whether EM's drug triggers overlap here: yes, many drugs can trigger EM, so a meticulous medication timeline remains essential even when EM is suspected [^115rcjbq].

> But wait, what if this is vasculitic rather than hypersensitivity? Small-vessel vasculitides like leukocytoclastic vasculitis can produce purpuric papules and plaques with violaceous borders, and if hemorrhagic or necrotic, they can simulate a targetoid appearance; biopsy demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis is the key differentiator when the clinical course is prolonged, painful, or associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, or renal involvement [^117CEA92]. I should confirm systemic red flags in the review of systems to decide how urgently to pursue vasculitis workup and biopsy if the morphology or course deviates from EM's expected trajectory [^115f7eS8].

> Next, I should review diagnostic tools with real discriminative value. Dermoscopy can refine vascular patterns and background hues in pink and targetoid lesions, helping distinguish EM from vasculitis, annular lichen planus, or vascular tumors; in inflammatory lesions, dermoscopy can highlight vessel architecture and structural clues that the naked eye misses, and in pink tumors it can guide toward or away from malignancy, though it does not replace histology when cancer is suspected [^1144sg8n] [^116AN171]. I need to ensure I also apply ABCDE and the ugly duckling sign during full-body skin examination to catch atypical melanoma or other neoplasms that can rarely mimic targets, because missing a malignancy would be consequential [^116TNXya].

> I should double-check when noninvasive imaging adds value. Reflectance confocal microscopy can provide near-histologic resolution for equivocal pink lesions, aiding in the classification of amelanotic melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma when dermoscopy is indeterminate; however, availability is limited and it does not obviate the need for biopsy if melanoma or high-risk SCC is on the table, so I must use it judiciously and within appropriate diagnostic pathways [^113ZTm6u] [^113PKtrE]. Hold on, I should verify that RCM does not estimate Breslow depth: correct, it does not replace histologic staging, so any suspicion for melanoma still warrants appropriate biopsy technique and pathologic assessment [^111vvSSN].

> Now, I need to ensure the biopsy strategy is appropriate. For EM, a punch biopsy of the active outer border captures the interface dermatitis and vascular changes, and deeper biopsies are not usually required. Conversely, for suspected melanoma, an excisional biopsy with 1–3 mm margins that includes the full depth is preferred to avoid transection and to allow accurate Breslow measurement, with orientation planned for definitive surgery if needed, and with clinical context provided to the pathologist to optimize reporting and staging elements [^111Xa2fK] [^112ZPRAR] [^1167Gcw9]. Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: superficial shave can miss infiltrative components and under-stage melanoma, so I should avoid shave when melanoma is suspected and instead choose punch or elliptical excision that captures adequate depth and margins for microstaging [^112ZPRAR].

> Management will hinge on the working diagnosis. If EM is most likely and the patient is stable, supportive care, topical corticosteroids for pruritus, and treatment or suppression of HSV if present are appropriate, with close follow-up for mucosal involvement or progression. Severe mucosal disease may require systemic steroids, although this must be weighed against the risk of SJS/TEN overlap and appropriate inpatient care if unstable [^1166U3Du]. If THH is diagnosed, excision is curative for isolated lesions and the targetoid rim typically resolves after removal, so reassurance and local therapy suffice in most cases [^111aemW1]. If AHEI is identified in the appropriate age group, supportive care and observation are generally adequate given the self-limited course, with pediatric reassurance and follow-up to confirm resolution [^112mvDwD]. If vasculitis is confirmed, I should initiate a vasculitis workup and consider systemic therapy guided by extent and organ involvement, ensuring biopsy confirmation and appropriate referrals [^117CEA92].

> I should confirm red flags that mandate escalation. Rapid progression with systemic symptoms, mucosal erosions or respiratory involvement, necrosis or ulceration, and lesions persisting beyond two weeks without improvement should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis, broader laboratory evaluation, and expedited biopsy or specialty referral. Likewise, in high-risk patients or atypical presentations, a low threshold for biopsy and multidisciplinary input is prudent to avoid delays in diagnosing infection, vasculitis, or malignancy [^111Qzh4f]. Hold on, I should verify that documenting lesion size, location, and clinical photos before procedures is standard: yes, guidelines emphasize pre-biopsy photography and clear measurements to support accurate management and prevent wrong-site errors, which I will incorporate into routine care [^116DGoPc].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and patient education are explicit. For EM, counsel on HSV triggers, provide antiviral prophylaxis if recurrent, and advise prompt evaluation for new mucosal symptoms. For vasculitis, arrange rheumatology co-management and laboratory surveillance. For vascular mimics like THH, explain benignity and recurrence risk after excision. And for any biopsy-confirmed malignancy, coordinate oncologic pathways per disease-specific guidelines and ensure appropriate margin management and staging steps are completed without delay [^115rcjbq] [^111Xa2fK]. Let me double-check that I have addressed the original morphology succinctly: the pink center with dark purple margin most closely matches EM's target morphology, but THH, AHEI, urticarial vasculitis, fixed drug eruption, and infections like erythema migrans or secondary syphilis remain important mimics that require careful history, exam, dermoscopy, and selective biopsy to resolve confidently [^1166U3Du] [^111aemW1] [^112mvDwD] [^115f7eS8] [^113bvXs7] [^112AmniE].

---

The most likely diagnosis for a skin lesion with a **dark purple margin and pink center** is **erythema multiforme (EM)** [^1166U3Du], characterized by target lesions with three zones: a central pink or clear area, a darker red/purple middle ring, and an outer erythematous halo [^115rcjbq]. Other considerations include **urticarial vasculitis** [^115f7eS8] (painful, non-blanching, persistent lesions), **fixed drug eruption** [^116PqAti] (recurrent at the same site), and **targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma** [^111aemW1] (purplish papule with ecchymotic ring). Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by dermoscopy [^1144sg8n] and confirmed by biopsy if uncertain; management is cause-directed, with topical corticosteroids for EM and avoidance of triggers [^1166U3Du].

## Clinical features and differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Distinguishing characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| Erythema multiforme (EM) | - Target lesions with three zones <br/> - Central pink/clear area <br/> - Dark red/purple middle ring <br/> - Outer erythematous halo <br/> - Acral distribution <br/> - Often triggered by infections or drugs [^115rcjbq] | - Classic target lesions <br/> - Rapid onset <br/> - Self-limited [^115rcjbq] |
| Urticarial vasculitis | - Painful, non-blanching, persistent lesions <br/> - May leave hyperpigmentation <br/> - Associated with systemic symptoms [^115f7eS8] | - Painful lesions <br/> - Persistent (> 24 hours) <br/> - Systemic involvement [^111Qcgrx] |
| Fixed drug eruption | - Recurrent lesions at the same site <br/> - Central hyperpigmentation <br/> - History of drug exposure [^116PqAti] | - Recurrence at same site <br/> - Drug history <br/> - Central hyperpigmentation |
| Targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma | - Purplish papule with ecchymotic ring <br/> - Expanding brown ring <br/> - Central papule remains intact [^111aemW1] | - Vascular lesion <br/> - Expanding ecchymotic ring <br/> - Central papule [^111aemW1] |

## Diagnostic approach

- **Clinical examination**: Detailed history (onset, duration, symptoms, drug exposure, infections) and physical exam (lesion morphology, distribution) [^115rcjbq].

- **Dermoscopy**: Helps differentiate EM from vasculitis and vascular lesions by revealing vascular patterns and structural features [^116ac1wo] [^1144sg8n].

- **Biopsy**: Indicated if diagnosis is uncertain or to exclude vasculitis or malignancy. EM shows interface dermatitis; vasculitis shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis [^116poSa1] [^115f7eS8].

---

## Management strategies

- **Erythema multiforme**: Identify and treat triggers (e.g. HSV) [^115rcjbq]; topical corticosteroids for symptom relief; antihistamines for pruritus; severe cases may need systemic corticosteroids [^notfound].

- **Urticarial vasculitis**: Systemic corticosteroids; immunosuppressive agents for refractory cases; treat underlying systemic disease [^notfound].

- **Fixed drug eruption**: Stop offending drug; topical corticosteroids; avoid re-exposure to prevent recurrence [^notfound].

- **Targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma**: Surgical excision or laser therapy for cosmetic reasons or symptomatic lesions [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

EM is **self-limited** and resolves within weeks; recurrence is common with re-exposure to triggers [^115rcjbq]. Urticarial vasculitis may persist or recur and can involve internal organs, especially with hypocomplementemia [^111Qcgrx]. Fixed drug eruption resolves with drug withdrawal but recurs on re-exposure [^116PqAti]. Targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma is benign; excision is curative [^notfound].

---

A lesion with a **dark purple margin and pink center** most often reflects EM, but urticarial vasculitis, fixed drug eruption, and targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma should be considered. Diagnosis is clinical, with dermoscopy and biopsy as needed, and management targets the underlying cause with supportive care [^1144sg8n].

In addition to its "traditional" application for the early diagnosis of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers, dermoscopy gains appreciation in fields beyond dermato-oncology. Nowadays, dermoscopy has been established as a reliable adjunctive tool to the everyday clinical practice of general dermatology. Morphology and distribution of vascular structures, background colors, follicular abnormalities, and the presence of scales are important features that should be evaluated. Clinical examination remains the undoubted mainstay of diagnosis in inflammatory and infectious diseases.

### Cluster of pigmented macules in a pediatric patient [^1156jwPx]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old girl in good health presented with a cluster of pigmented lesions on the body that had been present since childhood. Upon examination, multiple brown, evenly pigmented macules were found to be present in the right scapular region, with sharp delineation at the midline (Fig 1); additionally, a few pigmented macules were found on the right buccal cheek (Fig 2) as well as right axillary freckling (Fig 3).

Question 1: What is the likely diagnosis in this patient?
A. Lentigo solaris
B. Partial unilateral lentiginosis (PUL)
C. Nevus of Ito
D. Speckled lentiginous nevus
E. Zosteriform lentiginous nevus

Answers:
A. Lentigo solaris – Incorrect. Lentigo solaris, also known as solar lentigo, is characterized by lentigines present on sun-exposed skin and is more commonly seen in older individuals. Histologically, there may be an increased number of melanocytes producing excess melanin, elongation of rete ridges, and solar elastosis within the dermis. This is in contrast to partial unilateral lentiginosis (PUL), which would look similar to lentigo simplex histologically; however, differences may arise in patient age, the clinical distribution of lesions, and histologic findings of solar elastosis.
B. Partial unilateral lentiginosis (PUL) – Correct. PUL is a rare disorder of aberrant pigmentation characterized by multiple lentigines with a unilateral segmental pattern and may follow ≥ 1 dermatomal distributions. These lesions typically present at birth or during childhood, becoming darker and more widespread with age. The presence of lentigines in a distinctive distribution indicates the need for a thorough physical examination to rule out any associated syndromes, including but not limited to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), LEOPARD (Lentigines, Electrocardiographic conduction defects, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormalities of the genitals, Retarded growth, Deafness) syndrome, and Carney complex.
C. Nevus of Ito – Incorrect. Nevus of Ito is a pigmented patch that is blue to gray-brown in color and is unilaterally located on the neck and shoulder. These nevi are typically present at birth and may mimic Mongolian spots.
D. Speckled lentiginous nevus – Incorrect. Speckled lentiginous nevus, also known as nevus spilus, appears as small, dark macules superimposed on a lighter pigmented patch. PUL may commonly be misdiagnosed as nevus spilus; however, PUL appears as brown macules on normal skin, without an associated background of lighter pigmentation.
E. Zosteriform lentiginous nevus – Incorrect. Zosteriform lentiginous nevus is from the family of nevus spilus; however, these lesions have more of a dermatomal arrangement.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^115f7eS8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical features distinguishing chronic urticaria from urticarial vasculitis and angioedema — CU lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals of variable size and shape with surrounding erythema and are generally pruritic, and individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours. A painful or burning dysesthesia is not characteristic of CU and suggests the presence of cutaneous vasculitis, in which lesions are palpable and usually nonblanching, spanning several days or more and often followed by residual hyperpigmented changes; diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis should be confirmed by a biopsy demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Because urticarial vasculitic lesions might sometimes be evanescent, lasting less than 24 hours, this condition cannot be completely excluded based on a history of lesions spanning less than 24 hours. Angioedema typically appears as nonpitting, brawny, nonpitting edema, typically without well-defined margins and without erythema.

### Annular lesions: diagnosis and treatment [^112AmniE]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Annular lesions can present in a variety of diseases. Knowledge of the physical appearance and history of presentation of these skin findings can help in the diagnosis. A pruritic, annular, erythematous patch that grows centrifugally should prompt evaluation for tinea corporis. Tinea corporis may be diagnosed through potassium hydroxide examination of scrapings. Recognizing erythema migrans is important in making the diagnosis of Lyme disease so that antibiotics can be initiated promptly. Plaque psoriasis generally presents with sharply demarcated, erythematous silver plaques. Erythema multiforme, which is due to a hypersensitivity reaction, presents with annular, raised lesions with central clearing. Lichen planus characteristically appears as planar, purple, polygonal, pruritic papules and plaques. Nummular eczema presents as a rash composed of coin-shaped papulovesicular erythematous lesions. Treatment is aimed at reducing skin dryness. Pityriasis rosea presents with multiple erythematous lesions with raised, scaly borders, and is generally self-limited. Urticaria results from the release of histamines and appears as well-circumscribed, erythematous lesions with raised borders and blanched centers. Annular lesions occur less commonly in persons with fixed drug eruptions, leprosy, immunoglobulin A vasculitis, secondary syphilis, sarcoidosis, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and granuloma annulare.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^111Xa2fK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Biopsy for cutaneous melanoma (CM) — skin biopsy remains the first step to establish a definitive diagnosis of CM; dermoscopy can improve diagnostic accuracy and/or help direct tissue sampling, and prebiopsy photographs are an important aid that help to prevent wrong-site surgery and should include a regional photograph with anatomic landmarks. Skin biopsy may be performed as an incisional, partial, or incomplete diagnostic biopsy, or with the intent to remove the entire lesion (excisional/complete). Partial biopsy may inaccurately stage CM and could negatively affect treatment planning; for a lesion clinically suggestive of CM, an excisional/complete biopsy is ideally performed with clinically negative margins and sufficient depth to avoid transection, generally achieved with a narrow peripheral margin of 1 to 3 mm. Diagnostic excisional biopsy can be accomplished in 3 ways: (1) elliptical (fusiform) excision; (2) punch excision around the clinical lesion; or (3) deep shave/saucerization.

### Dermatoscopic rainbow pattern in lichen planus pigmentosus inversus in a middle-aged African American man [^1178r1ii]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

LPP predominantly occurs in persons with darker skin and presents as hyperpigmented papules and plaques that appear dark brown or gray. In darker skin, the lesions of LPP can appear dark brown or gray rather than pink or violaceous, as is the case in lighter skin types.

Although dermatoscopy has been shown to be beneficial in diagnosing LPP, there are limited descriptive studies or images available in the literature involving dermatoscopic findings of LPP in SOC. Vázquez-López et alconducted a previous study in which 3 dermatoscopic patterns of LPP were defined: diffuse, dotted, and mixed. The diffuse pattern is characterized by brown, structureless areas, whereas the dotted pattern is characterized by a coarse, gray-blue or brown globus. In our patient, we observed brown, structureless areas with a conspicuous rainbow pattern and peripheral tramming, likely due to heavy pigmentation in skin type VI and the heavy pigment incontinence seen using histology. The rainbow pattern has been previously reported as the main pattern seen in Kaposi sarcoma. It has also been reported in LP and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus but not yet in LPP. The rainbow pattern may result from polarized light interacting with structural components in these lesions. The rich vascular network, diffuse homogeneous fibrosis, and dense lymphocytic infiltrate of lichenoid dermatosis may contribute to this phenomenon; however, the exact mechanism is not well established.

In addition, we observed Wickham striae in small, patchy lesions, which appear bluish gray using dermatoscopy, on our patients' darker skin. This is consistent with Wickham striae on SOC, which often appear globular as well as veil like and bluish rather than pearly white on light skin. There were several white rings surrounding dark spots, a finding known as the black-hole pigmentation pattern (Fig 2, D). García-García et alstudied LP in 5 patients with skin types V and VI and proposed that the black-hole pattern may be more common in dark skin. Additionally, the dotted, dark-brown pattern suggests hyperpigmentation, which is a characteristic of LPP and a feature that is more common in patients with darker skin. Lastly, we noted the lack of vascular features, which may be less viable on darker skin types.

### A practical approach to selected problematic melanocytic lesions [^115QbUeH]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Pigmented skin lesions are among the most common skin lesions. A majority can be diagnosed with ease; however, a minority of the cases are difficult and have the potential for error with catastrophic consequences for patients and the potential for litigation. Melanoma-related claims are second only to breast biopsy-related claims in surgical pathology. This review tries to highlight the problematic areas and diagnostic pitfalls in melanocytic lesions with emphasis on melanomas that might be underdiagnosed and benign melanocytic lesions that might be overdiagnosed and on practical approaches to deal with these lesions. Scanning power examination only is insufficient to avoid the potential diagnostic pitfalls in melanocytic lesions. We recommend examination of every melanocytic lesion in at least several high-power fields for cytologic atypia and mitotic activity. When dealing with problematic cases, it is important to see the entire lesion to determine whether lateral circumscription, nevoid maturation, and deep mitotic activity are present. Immunohistochemical analysis is useful, but it cannot replace careful examination of H&E-stained sections.

### Urticarial lesions: if not urticaria, what else? The differential diagnosis of urticaria: part II. systemic diseases [^111Qcgrx]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

There are a number of systemic disorders that can manifest with urticarial skin lesions, including urticarial vasculitis, connective tissue diseases, hematologic diseases, and autoinflammatory syndromes. All of these conditions may enter into the differential diagnosis of ordinary urticaria. In contrast to urticaria, urticarial syndromes may manifest with skin lesions other than wheals, such as papules, necrosis, vesicles, and hemorrhages. Lesions may have a bilateral and symmetrical distribution; individual lesions have a long duration, and their resolution frequently leaves marks, such as hyperpigmentation or bruising. Moreover, systemic symptoms, such as fever, asthenia, and arthralgia, may be present. The most important differential diagnosis in this group is urticarial vasculitis, which is a small-vessel vasculitis with predominant cutaneous involvement. Systemic involvement in urticarial vasculitis affects multiple organs (mainly joints, the lungs, and the kidneys) and is more frequent and more severe in patients with hypocomplementemia. Clinicopathologic correlation is essential to establishing a correct diagnosis.

Learning Objectives

After completing the learning activity, participants should be able to distinguish urticarial lesions suggesting diagnoses other than common urticaria; assess patients with urticarial lesions, and suspect systemic diseases presenting with urticarial skin lesions.

### Basal cell skin cancer, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116poSa1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Clinical presentation and workup of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) — On clinical presentation of a lesion suspicious for skin cancer, workup for BCC begins with a history and physical examination, biopsy, and if applicable a shave removal. A skin biopsy is then performed on any suspicious lesion, and the biopsy should include deep reticular dermis because infiltrative histology may be present only at deeper, advancing margins and superficial biopsies will frequently miss this component. After BCC diagnosis, a full skin examination is recommended since individuals with skin cancer often have additional, concurrent precancers or cancers at other sun-exposed sites and are also at increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma.

### Pink lesions [^116AN171]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

Dermoscopy (dermatoscopy or surface microscopy) is an ancillary dermatologic tool that in experienced hands can improve the accuracy of diagnosis of a variety of benign and malignant pigmented skin tumors. The early and more accurate diagnosis of nonpigmented, or pink, tumors can also be assisted by dermoscopy. This review focuses on the dermoscopic diagnosis of pink lesions, with emphasis on blood vessel morphology and pattern. A 3-step algorithm is presented, which facilitates the timely and more accurate diagnosis of pink tumors and subsequently guides the management for such lesions.

### Mucositis with targetoid lesions in an adult [^116PqAti]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation, laboratory studies, and histopathology?
A. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)
B. Rowell syndrome
C. Fixed drug eruption
D. Reactive and infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME)
E. Bullous lupus

Answers:
A. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) – Incorrect. SJS would present with dusky targetoid lesions that coalesce into larger patches and plaques without well-demarcated areas of normal intervening skin. Nikolsky-positive lesions and negative ANA would be expected.
B. Rowell syndrome – Correct. Rowell syndrome is characterized by well-defined dusky targetoid lesions with normal intervening skin; lesions can progress to form flaccid bullae with epidermal detachment. This, along with Ro and ANA positivity, strongly favors this diagnosis.
C. Fixed drug eruption – Incorrect. A fixed drug eruption may present as erythematous patches or plaques with overlying vesicles or bullae that occur in the same location on the body after repeated ingestion of a medication. Patients often have a history of a similar reaction, and the most common offending medications are antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
D. Reactive and infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME) – Incorrect. RIME presents with severe mucosal lesions with less cutaneous involvement.RIME is a reasonable consideration; however, extensive infectious work-up, which included herpes, Epstein-Barr virus, mycoplasma, and enterovirus, were negative.
E. Bullous lupus – Incorrect. While bullous lupus occurs in patients with positive ANA, the negative direct immunofluorescence and absence of tense bullae is not compatible with bullous lupus.

### Neonatal systemic juvenile xanthogranuloma with hydrops diagnosed by purpura skin biopsy: a case report and literature review [^115KQzTQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Making an immediate diagnosis of JXG was difficult because of the atypical appearance of the purple skin rash. At first, her purpuric skin lesions made believe that these were caused by coagulopathy. However, the lesion's color gradually turned dark blue-purple, almost black, and the shape changed to a firm and solid enlarged nodule, these findings led to the suspicion of a tumor. A skin biopsy was performed, and the patient's disease was finally diagnosed as JXG.

Neonatal systemic JXG is a rare disease, with only reported 32 cases in the literature (Table 1). All cases listed in Table presented systemic symptoms or had at least one affected visceral organ within the neonatal period. JXG typically presents yellow to pink-brown papules and nodules; 16 of the 32 cases presented a typical color (such as yellow and erythematous), with three of the 16 cases subsequently changing to a typical color. Eight cases had atypical skin lesions; one case had purpura (as in our case), and the others had bluish nodules, ecchymoses, petechiae, blueberry muffin rash, and a mass. Six cases had unclear in the details. There were nine cases in which the color and/or shape changed (excluding flattening, regression and disappearance) or new skin findings appeared over time, although there is a possibility that the change was not recognized because the patient was treated before the diagnosis. Change over time has been reported as a feature of congenital JXG. Therefore, diagnosis by visual inspection is difficult because it involves various phenotypes such as color, shape, and changes over time. It is unclear why the emergence of congenital JXG differs from that of a typical JXG, but it has been speculated that neonatal skin has less subcutaneous fat and appears purple due to subcutaneous bleeding.

### The color of skin: orange diseases of the skin, nails, and mucosa [^115KYSte]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous disease can present with lesions of all colors of the visible spectrum. Lesions of the skin, nail, and mucous membranes with an orange color can be due to a variety of etiologies. The conditions may appear as purely orange, yellow-orange, red-orange, tan, or brown with an orange hue. The orange color may also present as a transient phase of a disease process. As with all dermatologic pathology, a key way to distinguish orange-colored lesions is by distribution and morphology. The sclera, palate, lips, gingiva, and nails may also be involved. A literature review using PubMed with keywords, including orange, skin, mucosa, cutaneous, xanthoderma, and granuloma, was conducted to gather all dermatologic conditions that can present with an orange color. The relevant diseases were categorized by etiology and include inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and exogenous causes.

### Distinguishing breast skin lesions from superficial breast parenchymal lesions: diagnostic criteria, imaging characteristics, and pitfalls [^117JxcaT]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Superficial lesions are commonly encountered in the breast and may be located in the dermis, hypodermis (subcutaneous fat), or parenchyma. The differential diagnosis varies for each anatomic layer. Dermal lesions that are seen by breast imagers are usually benign skin cysts. Hypodermal lesions, although usually benign, may include lesions that arise from anterior terminal duct lobular units and include papilloma, adenosis, fibroadenoma, and breast cancer. To avoid misclassifying a small superficial breast cancer as a benign dermal lesion, it is necessary to understand superficial breast and skin anatomy and the mammographic, ultrasonographic (U.S.), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging signs that indicate that a lesion is dermal. Mammography is the optimal modality for localizing calcifications to the dermis or hypodermis. However, U.S. typically has higher resolution for localizing masses than mammography and MR imaging. At US, a lesion may be categorized as dermal (a) if it is contained entirely within the dermis, (b) if a tract that extends from the lesion to the skin is seen, or (c) if a claw of tissue surrounding the margin of the lesion is present. As with other breast lesions, suspicious imaging features should be sought in addition to determining the anatomic origin. If histologic analysis is necessary to characterize lesions with an unknown cause or origin, precautions must be taken to decrease patient morbidity.

### Asymptomatic pink nodules in an African-American woman [^115hfmcD]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

History

A 28-year-old African-American woman presented with a 6-year history of asymptomatic pink to skin colored nodules on her arms, trunk, upper thighs, and gluteal region with diameters ranging from 5 to 15 cm (Fig 1). Dermatoscopic examination of the lesion of her right thigh revealed a yellow structureless area surrounded by dark brown reticulated lines radiating from the center, without vascular structures (Fig 2). Punch biopsy (Fig 3, A and B) and immunohistochemical staining (Fig 3, C) demonstrated histiocytes positive for S-100 and CD68 but negative for CD1a. Systemic work up (positron emission tomography scan, complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and lactate dehydrogenase) was negative.

### Melanonychia and subungual papule in a middle-aged man [^1159Z4tC]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 59-year-old man with no personal or family history of skin cancer presented with a growing lesion on his left thumbnail for the past year. The area was painful and gradually became larger and darker, causing elevation of the nail plate. On examination, there was a 4 mm dark brown longitudinal band with subungual papule and distal onycholysis (Fig 1, A and B). Nail clipping was submitted to histopathology (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Dermatophytoma
B. Pigmented onychomatricoma
C. Pigmented onychopapilloma
D. Subungual melanoma
E. Subungual verruca

Answers:
A. Dermatophytoma – Correct. Dermatophytoma are densely packed fungal masses in the subungual space in patients with distal onychomycosis. Dermatophytoma commonly present as opaque yellow, orange, or white patches or streaks in the nail plate. Histopathology of the nail clipping showed confluent growth of fungal organisms, and culture was identified as Candida parapsilosis (Fig 2). This is a rare, but established, cause of black or brown pigmentation of the nail or longitudinal melanonychia. The patient had substantial clinical improvement with fluconazole 200 mg once weekly after 4 weeks of use.
B. Onychomatricoma – Incorrect. Onychomatricoma is a benign proliferation of fibroepithelial cells originating from the nail matrix. It is rare and usually presents as a thickened nail plate with honeycomb-like appearance of the distal nail plate. It is diagnosed via histologic examination of a nail clipping and will show filiform epithelial projections lined with matrix epithelium.
C. Onychopapilloma – Incorrect. Onychopapilloma is a tumor of the nail bed or distal nail matrix that often presents as longitudinal red, white, or brown streaks in the nail and subungual hyperkeratosis. Although it may present similarly, the histopathology shows papillomatosis or acanthosis of the nail bed epithelium.
D. Subungual melanoma – Incorrect. Subungual melanoma presents as a longitudinal brown or black band originating from the nail matrix. It can also present as a mass below the nail plate or ulceration of the nail. The image (Fig 1, A) shows that the pigmented band does not extend to the proximal nail fold. Hutchinson's nail sign is an extension of the pigmentation to the nail folds and is a strong predictor of melanoma.
E. Subungual verruca – Incorrect. Subungual verruca is a rare cause of melanonychia and is more likely to cause onycholysis and splinter hemorrhage.

### An irregular black patch on the nail plate [^115W32kJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What are key dermoscopic features of the correct diagnosis?
A. Longitudinal brown to black lines with irregular color, spacing, and thickness, with pigment extension onto the hyponychium, revealing a parallel ridge pattern
B. Gray homogenous band consisting of multiple thin homogeneous gray lines
C. Red-black globules along proximal and lateral margins of homogenous pigment that lacks melanin granules
D. Light- to dark-brown parallel striae that extend beneath a translucent eponychium
E. White or yellow streaks, nonlongitudinal homogenous pattern, and reverse triangular pattern

Answers:
A. Longitudinal brown to black lines with irregular color, spacing, and thickness, with pigment extension onto the hyponychium, revealing a parallel ridge pattern — Incorrect. Dermoscopic features suggestive of subungual melanoma may include irregular longitudinal brown to black lines with asymmetry in color, spacing, and thickness. Lines also may show parallelism disruption or blood spots.
B. Gray homogenous band consisting of multiple thin homogeneous gray lines — Incorrect. This dermoscopic feature is a sign of benign melanocytic activation and may be observed in several diagnoses, such as drug-induced pigmentation or ethnic-type melanonychia.
C. Red-black globules along proximal and lateral margins of homogenous pigment that lacks melanin granules — Incorrect. Homogenous red-maroon pigmentation with round globules at the periphery likely represents subungual hematoma. However, red-maroon pigmentation that does not resolve with nail growth may require additional histopathologic examination because of the concern for subungual melanoma.
D. Light- to dark-brown parallel striae that extend beneath a translucent eponychium — Incorrect. This feature is known as pseudo-Hutchinson sign and is a common feature of nail matrix nevi, often observed in younger adults and children. Other features of a nevus include the presence of melanin inclusion granules, regular nail band pattern, parallel lines, and uniform band thickness and spacing.
E. White or yellow streaks, nonlongitudinal homogenous pattern, and reverse triangular pattern — Correct. These features, along with subungual hyperkeratosis, yellow or multicolor pigmentation, and white scale, are more significantly associated with fungal melanonychia than sources of melanocyte activation or melanocyte hyperplasia. The presence of irregular reticular pigmentation has not previously been described, but may represent another dermoscopic feature of fungal melanonychia. Additional studies are needed to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of this feature.

### Skin imaging: is it clinically useful? [^116uXPnd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Non-invasive skin imaging techniques have proliferated over the last decade. Whilst most have a research role, some are routinely used in dermatology clinics. Of these, the skin surface microscope (dermatoscope), a diagnostic aid for pigmented lesions, has had most clinical impact. Such devices, when linked to a videomicroscope for computer analysis, have been dubbed as 'mole scanners'. Mole scanners are increasingly available on a commercial basis even though computer diagnosis of pigmented lesions is currently no better than diagnosis by human experts. Meanwhile, other imaging techniques, such as high-resolution ultrasonography, spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography, may yet find a role in diagnosis and disease monitoring.

### Dermoscopy for the pediatric dermatologist part I: dermoscopy of pediatric infectious and inflammatory skin lesions and hair disorders [^116ac1wo]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The dermoscope allows physicians to examine the macroscopic and microscopic primary morphology of skin lesions, identify subtle clinical clues, confirm naked-eye clinical diagnoses, and monitor treatment progress while posing little threat to the young patient. This review summarizes important dermoscopic structures seen in infectious and inflammatory skin conditions and hair disorders in children. Scabies, pediculosis, phthiriasis, molluscum contagiosum, tinea nigra, and verrucae are well characterized dermoscopically by delta-shaped structures, ovoid-shaped nits, the crab louse, red corona, brown strands or spicules, and multiple densely packed papilla with a central black dot surrounded by a whitish halo, respectively. These dermoscopic structures will be discussed, focusing on the dermoscopic morphologies and dermoscopic sensitivity for diagnosis and its utility in monitoring treatment progress. Dermoscopy has also been shown to significantly improve the clinician's diagnostic and monitoring accuracy of inflammatory skin lesions such as psoriasis, which is characterized dermoscopically by uniformly distributed dotted blood vessels, and lichen planus, which is characterized by whitish lines on a purple to reddish background. Dermoscopy of the hair and scalp (trichoscopy) facilitates the differential diagnosis of hair diseases in children, including alopecia areata, trichotillomania, and tinea capitis. It can also assist in the diagnosis of multiple genetic hair shaft disorders, such as monilethrix, trichorrhexis invaginata, trichorrhexis nodosa, pili torti, and pili annulati.

### Erythema multiforme: recognition and management [^115rcjbq]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on erythema multiforme:

- **Definition**: Erythema multiforme is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by the presence of distinctive target lesions on the skin (primarily in acral regions) and/or mucous membranes.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact pathophysiology of erythema multiforme is not fully understood, but it is believed to be an immune reaction triggered by various factors. Infections, particularly HSV, are the most common triggers. Other viruses, such as HCV, Coxsackievirus, and EBV, as well as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, certain medications, and vaccines have also been implicated.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of erythema multiforme is believed to be 0.01–1% annually, most commonly affecting individuals aged 18–30 years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for erythema multiforme include infections, especially HSV, and exposure to certain medications. However, in many cases, no specific trigger or risk factor can be identified.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, erythema multiforme presents with symmetrically distributed target lesions on the extremities and trunk. These lesions are characterized by concentric zones of color change. The severity of erythema multiforme can vary widely, from mild forms with only skin involvement to severe forms that affect multiple mucous membranes and can be life-threatening.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for erythema multiforme is generally favorable. Most cases are self-limiting and resolve within weeks to months without long-term complications.

### Basal cell skin cancer, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113TF3Yk]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Basal cell skin cancer — principles of biopsy reporting specify that "The intent of a biopsy is for diagnosis, not to assess the margin status". Pathologic evaluation "is ideally performed by a dermatologist, pathologist, dermatopathologist, or Mohs surgeon who is experienced in interpreting cutaneous neoplasms". Biopsy requisitions should include "patient age and gender, clinical diameter of lesion, anatomic location, and prior treatment of lesion", with "immunosuppression and history of RT". The pathologic report "should include histologic subtypea and presence and extent of any features that would increase the risk for local recurrence", including "invasion of tumor beyond reticular dermis and presence/caliber of perineural invasion". Footnote definitions note low-risk subtypes "include nodular, superficial, and other non-aggressive growth patterns such as keratotic, infundibulocystic, and fibroepithelioma of Pinkus"; and high-risk subtypes "include basosquamous, infiltrative, sclerosing/morpheaform, micronodular, and BCC with sarcomatoid differentiation".

### Reflectance confocal microscopy in the diagnosis of solitary pink skin tumours: review of diagnostic clues [^113PKtrE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a noninvasive tool that can be helpful in the diagnosis of nonpigmented skin tumours. As RCM enables visualization of architectural and cytological structures at near-histological resolution, it can improve the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopically equivocal solitary pink neoplasms. For management decisions, it is important to identify specific morphological clues that allow bedside classification of nonpigmented skin neoplasms into benign vs. malignant and melanocytic vs. nonmelanocytic. More specifically, the presence of a nested melanocytic proliferation at the dermoepidermal junction or dermis level permits the clinician to ascribe a given lesion as melanocytic; the identification of basaloid bright tumour islands is a key RCM feature for the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma; and the presence of disarrayed epidermis along with small demarcated papillae is suggestive for the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. The present review offers a comprehensive description of the main RCM diagnostic clues for solitary pink neoplasms that direct clinicians to the correct diagnosis and that may serve as groundwork for future prospective studies.

### A distinctive erythematous macular exanthem of the adult: a new entity? [^115T5qBA]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Delineating a new exanthem is difficult. Atypical or modified types of already known conditions can easily be mistaken for new entities.

Objectives

To report 29 cases of an acute, self-limiting exanthem never described before.

Methods

Clinical description, serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other laboratory investigations.

Results

The eruption starts with bright pink-red slightly oedematous macules symmetrically arranged on the trunk. The lesions tend to coalesce, and spread to the limbs on which they may acquire a marginated annular appearance. The lesions invariably spare the face (including oral mucous membranes), palms and soles. The eruption is pruritic and lasts 20–30 days, clearing spontaneously. The disease has a predilection for men aged 17–56 years and occurs mostly between spring and summer. Serological tests, PCR assays and investigations for bacteria, parasites or viruses were consistently negative.

Conclusions

The clinical picture does not recall any of the classical exanthems or their atypical forms.

### Differential diagnosis of round or discoid lesions [^111Z96DE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dermatologists are called on to diagnose a variety of skin conditions in diverse age groups. Dermatologic diagnosis, based on identification of a primary lesion, uses morphologic clues to categorize the pathologic process causing the eruption. In addition, distribution and grouping of lesions helps support a specific diagnosis. Dermatologists consciously or unconsciously use pattern recognition to arrive at their differential diagnosis based on clinical experience and their having previously viewed similarly appearing skin lesions in lectures, texts, and journals. Round and discoid patches and plaques are extremely common in the clinical practice of dermatology. This contribution reviews the dermatologic conditions that present as round or discoid lesions and presents an approach to diagnosis.

### Diagnosing common benign skin tumors… [^116e5Ety]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Keratoacanthomas Keratoacanthomas are rapidly growing, squamoproliferative benign tumors that resemble squamous cell carcinoma. They begin as round, firm, reddish or skin-colored papules that develop into dome-shaped nodules with a keratin-filled crater. They may grow to 1 to 2 cm over weeks or months. There is a slower involution phase over several months, leaving a scar if not excised early in its course. Keratoacanthomas generally occur later in life on sun-exposed areas, primarily the face, arms, and legs. They are attributed to sun exposure, cigarette smoking, human papillomavirus infection, genetic factors, trauma, and chemical carcinogens. 17 Pyogenic granulomas are yellow to purplish, pulpy vascular lesions often surrounded by a scaly collarette. They are usually removed because of their rapid growth and tendency to bleed. The differential diagnosis includes Spitz nevi, amelanotic melanoma, and squamous or basal cell carcinoma.

Treatment options include shave excision with electrodesiccation of the base, and laser ablation 18. 19 Diagnosis is based on the appearance of firm, raised, papules or nodules, ranging from tan to reddish brown. They tend to be darker at the center and fade to normal skin color at the margin. Dermatofibromas exhibit dimpling or retraction of the lesion beneath the skin with lateral compression. 20 No treatment is required unless there is a change in size or color, or bleeding or irritation from trauma. A 2012 study found that 73% of patients who underwent laser ablation reported satisfaction with the results.
21. Spontaneous inflammation and rupture can occur, with significant involvement of surrounding tissue. There is no way to predict which lesions will remain quiescent or become larger or inflamed. Infected cysts tend to be larger, more erythematous, and more painful than sterile inflamed cysts.

Cherry Angiomas Cherry angiomas are extremely common lesions that tend to appear with increasing age. They usually occur as multiple asymptomatic lesions, most commonly on the trunk and arms. They are dome-shaped, small, bright red to violaceous, soft, compressible papules with smooth surfaces that blanch with pressure and bleed profusely with traumatic rupture.

### The significance of reflectance confocal microscopy in the assessment of solitary pink skin lesions [^117ANtyE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Solitary pink lesions often manifest nondescript clinical and dermatoscopic primary morphologic features. The differential diagnosis for pink lesions tends, therefore, to be broad, ranging from inflammatory processes to malignancy. In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) may help in the evaluation of pink lesions.

Objective

We sought to demonstrate the use of RCM as an adjunct to the bedside diagnosis of pink lesions.

Methods

We describe a series of patients with clinically and dermatoscopically equivocal pink lesions for which RCM examination allowed for a rapid and accurate diagnosis. All lesions were excised for histopathologic evaluation. Integrating the findings in the case series with a literature review, we present RCM diagnostic criteria for pink lesions.

Results

Lesions included basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, and inflamed seborrheic keratosis. RCM shows distinctive findings for each diagnostic entity when stratified by anatomic level into suprabasal epidermis, dermoepidermal junction, and papillary dermis. In the cases presented RCM allowed for a rapid and accurate noninvasive diagnosis.

Limitations

The study is descriptive and does not test accuracy of RCM criteria in a prospective series of pink lesions.

Conclusion

RCM may add useful diagnostic features to the clinical evaluation of solitary pink lesions.

### Diagnosing disorders of hypopigmentation and depigmentation in patients with skin of color [^111VuiTu]. Dermatologic Clinics (2023). Medium credibility.

Skin hypopigmentation and depigmentation disorders are a top concern for patients with skin of color seeking care from a dermatologist. The visual contrast between involved and uninvolved skin in these disorders makes them particularly burdensome for patients with skin of color. These disorders may have a wide differential of diagnosis, as patients with skin of color may present differently or more frequently than White patients for certain conditions. Clues from a comprehensive history and physical examination with standard lighting and a Wood's light are essential for clinching the diagnosis, although a biopsy may be warranted in special cases.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117CEA92]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — lesion characteristics and differential include that CU lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals of variable size and shape with surrounding erythema and are generally pruritic, whereas a painful or burning dysesthesia is not characteristic of CU and suggests the presence of cutaneous vasculitis. Individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours, but new lesions might be developing simultaneously at other skin sites, while in contrast, vasculitis lesions are palpable and usually nonblanching, spanning several days or more and often followed by residual hyperpigmented changes, although in some cases lesions might be more evanescent, similar to ordinary CU. Angioedema typically appears as nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema, typically without well-defined margins and without erythema, and the medical work-up should keep in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases.

### Hyperpigmented nodule on a young black man [^115noZfU]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old Black man without a significant medical history presented to the emergency department with a 2-year-old nonhealing lesion that was associated with recurrent bleeding on the left portion of the postauricular region of his scalp. He had no family history of malignancy. A physical examination revealed a 2.3 × 3.1-cm 2 hyperpigmented nodule associated with a brown patch with a hyperpigmented border. Clinically, there was no regional lymphadenopathy. Histopathology revealed nests and irregularly shaped strands of basaloid cells with scant cytoplasm and round, dark nuclei. At the periphery of tumor islands, the basaloid cells were palisaded (Figs 1 and 2).

Question 1: What is the diagnosis?
A. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
B. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
C. Keloid
D. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)
E. Melanoma

Answers:
A. BCC – Correct. This patient has a micronodular and infiltrative BCC. BCC is the second most common skin cancer in Black individuals. The common histopathologic features include aggregates of basaloid cells with palisading on the periphery, retraction artifacts, and a surrounding fibromyxoid stroma. Clinical pigmentation is often present in this patient population.
B. SCC – Incorrect. SCC is the second most common skin malignancy in the United States after BCC; however, it is the most common skin cancer in Black individuals. Black patients are distinctive because SCC commonly develops in sun-protected locations in these individuals. The histopathology of SCC is characterized by pleomorphic keratinocytes that extend into the dermis.
C. Keloid – Incorrect. Keloids are caused by aberrant fibroblast activity, which results in painful, disfiguring skin lesions during the process of wound healing. Histopathology shows thickened, hyalinized collagen with increased fibroblasts.
D. MCC – Incorrect. MCC presents as a rapidly growing lesion that is often associated with immunosuppression. Histopathology typically reveals cells with large basophilic nuclei, speckled chromatin, minimal cytoplasm, and cytokeratin 20 positivity. Although Black individuals make up a small percentage of MCC cases, they typically present at later stages and with more poorly differentiated disease.
E. Melanoma – Incorrect. Melanoma can be clinically recognized based on lesion asymmetry, irregular borders, and rapid evolution. On histopathology, melanoma is characterized by asymmetrical growth of atypical melanocytes. Black patients have a worse survival rate and a greater proportion of aggressive subtypes than non-Hispanic White patients.

### Noninvasive imaging of skin tumors [^113wiNjo]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

In this article, the authors review different approaches to the diagnosis of skin tumors using noninvasive diagnostic tools, which are becoming increasingly reliable and, as a consequence, increasingly popular among physicians and patients. Especially in the realm of pigmented skin lesions, dermoscopy and sonography may add useful information to the clinical constellation, improving the diagnostic performance for early diagnosis of melanoma and for differentiating various melanocytic and nonmelanocytic pigmented lesions. More recently, confocal scanning laser microscopy was introduced as a novel technique that enables the in vivo study of the skin at a nearly histologic resolution, being of diagnostic value in various skin disorders, including basal cell carcinoma and pigmented skin lesions. These modalities have various other potential applications besides diagnosis, including lesion's selection for biopsy, determination of appropriate therapeutic modalities, verification of treatment efficacy, and decision of surgical margins. Finally, a hint to the use of cytodiagnosis for basal cell carcinoma is provided.

### Hemorrhagic bullae on bilateral lower extremities [^111CjgCc]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

History

A 33-year-old man newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented with worsening hemorrhagic bullae on the extremities that started 4 days earlier as a pink macular rash sparing the trunk. The patient denied any past medical history, medications, allergies, illicit drugs, or trauma over the last year.

On physical exam, the dorsal hands had scattered petechiae and hemorrhagic vesicles. The palms and soles were unaffected. Nonpitting edema and numerous hemorrhagic bullae with erythematous rims mixed with purpuric papules and plaques in a retiform pattern were noted on the lower extremities.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Bullous erythema multiforme
B. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster
C. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura
D. Bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to syphilis
E. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita

Answers:
A. Bullous erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Bullous erythema multiforme is an immune mediated hypersensitivity reaction that presents with targetoid lesions on the skin and mucosal surfaces.
B. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster – Incorrect. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster is a dermatomal eruption that occurs when the varicella zoster virus is reactivated in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion and commonly occurs in association with immunosuppression, thrombocytopenia, and/or anticoagulant use.
C. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura – Incorrect. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a self-limiting rare manifestation of a common vasculitic disease in childhood and is frequently associated with abdominal pain, arthralgias and/or renal involvement.
D. Bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to syphilis (Fig 1) – Correct. Bullous LCV is a manifestation of small vessel vasculitis, characterized by immune complex deposition in postcapillary venules leading to destructive inflammatory venulitis (Fig 1, Fig 2 3). Syphilis-induced endothelial cell swelling and endarteritis obliterans have been documented, but cases of LCV, especially with concurrent HIV infection, are rare. The potential mechanisms involve delayed hypersensitivity reactions mediated by antibody-antigen complexes and neutrophil hyperactivation, with HIV-induced immune alterations contributing.
E. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a rare autoimmune blistering condition that arises due to autoantibodies targeting type VII collagen. These bullae typically erupt in sites of trauma and can progress to milia and scarring.

### Dermatologic conditions in skin of color: part I. special considerations for common skin disorders [^115iLNjy]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Skin of color traditionally refers to that of persons of African, Asian, Native American, Middle Eastern, and Hispanic backgrounds. Differences in cutaneous structure and function can result in skin conditions with distinct presentations and varying prevalence that require unique treatment. Skin cancers have different presentations in these populations. The ability to recognize and diagnose skin cancer in a timely manner is important for reducing morbidity and mortality. Basal cell carcinoma often is pigmented, squamous cell carcinoma occurs in areas of chronic scarring and inflammation, and melanoma presents in non-sun-exposed areas, such as the soles and nail beds. Diagnosis requires biopsy, with the technique depending on size and location of the lesion. Treatment options range from topical to surgical. Acne commonly results in postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and keloids. Combination therapy with topical antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide is generally more effective than monotherapy for treating acne. Use of retinoids at lower concentrations and at less frequent dosing can help prevent postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.

### Recurrent lesion on toe of young man [^114gGSwT]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old male with noncontributory medical history presented with a lesion on his left toe for 2 months with a history of occasional bleeding. The lesion was partially removed by urgent care 1 month previously but recurred. Physical examination found a 0.6-cm pink papule with a collarette on the left second plantar toe (Fig 1). Shave biopsy was performed with histology findings shown in Fig 2.

Question 1. What is the diagnosis?
A. Verruca vulgaris (VV)
B. Pyogenic granuloma
C. Hidradenoma
D. Eccrine poroma (EP)
E. Nodular melanoma

Answers:
A. VV – Incorrect. The surface of this lesion is smooth rather than verrucous and the collarette is atypical for VV. Marked hyperkeratosis would be expected on biopsy.
B. Pyogenic granuloma – Incorrect. These more commonly occur in children with a history of epidermal trauma. Erosion and granulation tissue is not present in this lesion. Biopsy would have shown edematous stroma with capillary proliferation and leukocyte infiltration.
C. Hidradenoma – Incorrect. Cells within a hidradenoma are much larger than the cuboidal cells seen in this biopsy. They also would contain much more cytoplasm and remain confined to the deeper dermis. Additionally, these lesions are more commonly located on the trunk, head, or extremities rather than the palms or soles.
D. EP – Correct. Cuboid, or poroid, cells extend from the epidermis within a highly vascularized stroma and are lined by a well-demarcated edge of cuticular cells. Rare tubular structures are also common.
E. Nodular melanoma – Incorrect. Nuclear atypia is not present. Other characteristic features are also absent such as elongated spindle cells, focal junctional nests, significant ulceration, and pigment variation.

### Severe neurologic involvement of degos disease in a pediatric patient [^114UDrJU]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old male presented with paresthesias on the right upper and lower extremities, headache, and vomiting. In addition to worsening paresthesia and weakness on the right side of his body, blurred vision, fever, and skin lesions developed. He also had skin lesions characterized with 3–10 mm papules with a white atrophic center surrounded by pink rim mostly on the trunk and lower extremities. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed chronic subdural effusion and encephalomalacia of the left cerebral hemisphere. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed increased protein levels. Electromyography was consistent with diffuse polyradiculoneuropathy. Skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a rare vasculopathy: Degos disease. A case presenting with chronic subdural effusion, encephalomalacia, elevated CSF protein, and polyradiculopathy should be carefully examined for skin lesions, which may suggest the diagnosis of Degos disease.

### White network in fibroepithelioma of pinkus [^111F7Aa6]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case 1

A 51-year-old woman presented with an asymptomatic lesion near her right antecubital fossa that was slowly growing for 2 years. Physical examination found a dome-shaped, well-circumscribed, smooth, pink papule with an area of hyperpigmentation at one pole. Dermatoscopically, a white network with variable-sized pink holes accentuated by small vessels was accompanied by larger-caliber vessels coursing parallel to the surface. In addition to the white network, short shiny white streaks were present in center of the lesion (Fig 1). A conspicuous irregularly outlined darkly pigmented island was observed at one pole. Based on the clinical and dermatoscopic findings, diagnosis of congenital or Spitz nevus verses BCC was considered.

Excisional biopsy of the lesion found anastomosing cords of pink-to-blue hyperchromatic epithelial cells emanating from the epidermis surrounded by a fibrous stroma consistent with BCC of FEP type (Fig 2). A small nodular component surrounded by melanophages represented the pigmented portion of the lesion, showing the pigmented nodular component of the BCC. Melan-A stain was negative (Fig 2).

### Hyperpigmented papule in patient with breast cancer history [^111aemW1]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

History

A 34-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer in remission after treatment presented with an asymptomatic, hyperpigmented papule on her central abdomen. The patient reported that the lesion had been present for a few months, suddenly darkened on a single day during this period, and then remained stable. Review of systems was negative for any systemic findings. Physical exam showed an approximately 1 cm purplish-blue papulonodule with surrounding hyperpigmentation (Fig 1). The patient reported minimal tenderness in the surrounding area. The papule was excised, and histological findings are shown (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Sister Mary Joseph nodule
B. Angiosarcoma
C. Targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma (THH)
D. Cutaneous sarcoidosis
E. Kaposi sarcoma (KS)

Answers:
A. Sister Mary Joseph nodule – Incorrect. Although a new cutaneous papule in a patient with known prior metastatic breast cancer should raise concern for a cutaneous metastasis such as a Sister Mary Joseph nodule, the targetoid appearance and the pathology are most consistent with THH.
B. Angiosarcoma – Incorrect. Angiosarcomas are typically purplish-red, have irregular borders, exhibit surface bleeding, and would be expected to show ongoing progression. These findings are not present in this patient.
C. Targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma (THH) – Correct. THH has a classic, clinical presentation of a purplish papule surrounded by an ecchymotic/brown ring that expands or fades while leaving the central papule intact. The papule may darken over time as the patient reported.
D. Cutaneous sarcoidosis – Incorrect. While cutaneous sarcoidosis can present as a hyperpigmented papule, the targetoid appearance would not be expected, and granulomas would be expected to be seen on histopathology.
E. Kaposi sarcoma (KS) – Incorrect. Although KS can appear dark brown, KS typically presents as a multifocal vascular neoplasm with a distinct histopathology.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^112ZPRAR]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Melanoma: Cutaneous — principles of biopsy of a suspicious pigmented lesion state that excisional/complete biopsy (saucerization/deep shave removal, punch [for small diameter lesions], or elliptical excision) with 1- to 3-mm margins is preferred. Avoid wider margins to permit accurate subsequent lymphatic mapping. The orientation of an elliptical/fusiform excisional biopsy should be planned with definitive wide local excision in mind (eg, longitudinally [axially] and parallel to the underlying lymphatics on the extremities). Full-thickness incisional or punch biopsy of clinically thickest or most atypical portion of lesion is acceptable and may be preferred in certain anatomic areas (eg, palm/sole, digit, face, ear) or for very large lesions, and multiple scouting biopsies may help guide management for very large lesions. Superficial/tangential shave biopsy may compromise pathologic diagnosis and complete assessment of Breslow thickness, but is acceptable when the index of suspicion is low, and a broad shave biopsy may be optimal for histologic assessment for melanoma in situ (MIS), lentigo maligna (LM) type (ie, melanoma on skin with high cumulative sun damage [CSD]). If shave removal or tangential shave biopsy shows residual tumor/pigment at the base, a deeper biopsy (punch or elliptical) should be performed immediately and submitted in a separate container to the pathologist, noting that the shave specimen was transected. Biopsy of the nail matrix should be performed for suspected subungual melanoma and requires expertise in biopsy of the nail apparatus. Repeat narrow-margin excisional biopsy is generally not indicated if the initial specimen meets criteria for SLNB, unless the initial biopsy is inadequate for diagnosis or microstaging. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Rapidly enlarging nontender lesion on a child's face [^115woH15]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case description

An otherwise well 7-year-old Caucasian female presented to a dermatology outpatient clinic with a 2-month history of a rapidly enlarging non-tender nodule on the right cheek which measured approximately 1 cm. This patient had no medical history and was not on any medications. Two weeks later the lesion had grown to measure approximately 3 cm and significant erosion was noted (Fig 1). She was referred to plastic surgery for urgent excision. Representative image of histopathology is shown (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A. Spitz nevus
B. Pilomatricoma
C. Giant molluscum contagiosum
D. Amelanotic melanoma
E. Keratoacanthoma

Answers:
A. Spitz Nevus – Incorrect. Spitz nevi typically present in children as dome-shaped papules or nodules on the face and extremities, with colors ranging from pink, tan, to dark brown or black. Atypical spitz nevi can be very large with rapid growth, involvement of deep dermis and subcutis, and ulceration. Pathology demonstrates nests of epithelioid and/or spindled melanocytes.
B. Pilomatricoma – Correct. Pilomatricoma is a benign cutaneous adnexal tumor that originates from cells in the matrices of hair follicles. Typical lesions are round, mobile, firm, and surrounded by overlying skin. Pilomatricomas often exhibit calcification, causing them to feel hard or irregular upon palpation. Giant pilomatricomas are rare, greater than 5 cm in diameter, and are more common in females. Histopathology shows characteristic findings of basaloid cells and eosinophilic "ghost cells".
C. Giant molluscum contagiosum – Incorrect. Molluscum contagiosum is a common childhood infection caused by poxvirus. Lesions typically present as multiple smooth papules with central umbilication. Giant molluscum is associated with HIV infection and immunosuppression. Henderson-Patterson bodies on histology are pathognomonic.
D. Amelanotic melanoma – Incorrect. Amelanotic melanomas typically appear skin-colored or erythematous and account for a significant proportion of childhood melanomas. Pediatric melanoma is rare, and affected patients often have risk factors such as large/giant congenital nevi or genetic predisposition. Histopathology shows malignant melanocytes with decreased or complete absence of pigment.
E. Keratoacanthoma – Incorrect. Keratoacanthomas are cutaneous tumors which present as solitary nodules with a centralized keratin-filled crater. These tumors are more common in middle-aged or older adults but can present in childhood in the context of genetic disorders such as multiple self-healing squamous epitheliomas and xeroderma pigmentosum.

### Enlightening the pink: use of confocal microscopy in pink lesions [^113ZTm6u]. Dermatologic Clinics (2016). Low credibility.

Solitary pink lesions can pose a particular challenge to dermatologists because they may be almost or completely featureless clinically and dermoscopically, previously requiring biopsy to exclude malignancy. However, these lesions usually are not particularly challenging histopathologically. Thus, the incorporation of in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy into the clinical practice, which allows for noninvasive examination of the skin at the cellular level revealing features previously seen only on histopathology, is particularly useful for this subset of clinically difficult lesions.

Learning Objectives

After reading this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Clinically describe various cutaneous neoplasms. 2. Identify the corresponding histopathologic findings. 3. Discuss the optimal treatment approach for each entity.

Summary

Cutaneous neoplasms are broadly viewed as benign, premalignant, or malignant. In dermatology, lesions are classified based on the primary cell of origin or the component of the skin predominantly affected by the pathologic change (epidermis, dermis, or subcutaneous fat). The diagnosis and treatment of skin lesions rely on understanding the clinical presentation and corresponding histopathology. Surgical treatment is not always indicated and is dependent on multiple variables. This review discusses several benign and premalignant neoplasms frequently encountered by the plastic surgeon. The emphasis is on clinical presentation, histopathologic correlation, and management approach.

### Diagnostic criteria for differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia and vulvar aberrant maturation [^117M6vU3]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Vulvar Examination

Differentiated VIN and VAM look different to surrounding abnormal skin, but detection may be challenging. Lichen sclerosus produces changes to vulvar architecture, color, and texture, sometimes accompanied by superimposed mycotic, bacterial, or viral infection. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, melanosis, and postoperative changes further complicate assessment. Some specialists find a colposcope facilitates detection through light and magnification. Acetic acid application is not recommended for evaluation of HPV-independent neoplasia. Differentiated VIN and VAM do not demonstrate acetowhite uptake nor enhancement in margin visualization. Moreover, acetic acid is painful and produces false-positive results in areas of dermatitis and physiologic uptake at the mucocutaneous junction.

Differentiated VIN and VAM most often occur on periclitoral structures and labia minora, areas encompassing hairless skin, mucocutaneous junction, and nonkeratinized squamous epithelium. The next most common site is perineum and perianus, in keeping with LS distribution. Characterization of dVIN as unifocal and HSIL as multifocal is an oversimplification. Clinical photographs of HPV-independent neoplasia often show concurrent lesions with diverse morphologies, and 20%–50% of women have 2 or more noncontiguous disease sites.,

Vulvar aberrant maturation presents as a well-demarcated white papule or plaque, often with an irregular or verruciform surface(see Figure 1). Findings consistent with dVIN include a white papule or plaque, "gray-white discoloration with a roughened surface", pink-red plaque, glazed red patch, and flat pink center with a raised white border. (see Figures 2–4). Clinicians may describe pink-red patches as ulcers or erosions, but these labels do not uniformly concur with histopathologic findings. Pink-red areas may contain white papules or have a smooth surface, mosaic pattern, or gravel-like texture. Lesions may be less than 1 cm or extend across the vulva. The unifying description is any treatment-resistant lesion in a field of dermatosis-affected skin.

### More than one shade of pink as a marker of early amelanotic / hypomelanotic melanoma [^111zsXmr]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The location of the pink color in a dermoscopic image may also be a clue to the dermoscopic diagnosis of melanoma. Pink throughout or in the periphery of the lesion has been reported more frequently in melanomas (Figure 2b), differently from benign melanocytic lesions where the pink color is located more frequently in the center of the lesion (Figure 2d).

However, for the diagnosis of difficult, amelanotic lesions the optimal approach may be the combination of clinical information with total body dermoscopic examination, searching for the so called "little red riding hood sign". The more innocent lesion could clinically look benign from a distance (Figure 2a) but not when seen close up with dermoscopy, thanks to its ability to visualize more than one shade of pink (Figure 2b).

Clinical information and the consideration of high‐risk features for AHMplay an important role in the early diagnosis of AHM. The presence of a pink lesion in patients with red hair, fair skin, many freckles, few nevi, and a history of actinic keratoses and non‐melanoma skin cancer increases the index of suspicion that such a lesion could be a melanoma. In conclusion, because dermoscopy uses features reflecting increased vascular volume (more than one shade of pink) and pigmentation (irregular dots/globules and asymmetric pigmentation pattern), it may improve AHSSM detection. The early AHM stage may be characterized only by more than one shade of pink, without clearly visible vascularity, and could therefore be considered a marker for early AHM.

Cutaneous melanoma — pathology reporting for atypical melanocytic proliferations includes that the AAD recommends that pathologists should note cases of pure desmoplastic melanoma because this may affect downstream decisions, and several lesions can be diagnostically challenging; when such lesions are suspected, referral to a pathologist with expertise is recommended, and if melanoma is in the differential, the pathology report should include prognostic elements as for melanoma. Examples of challenging entities are listed, including atypical melanocytic proliferation, melanocytic tumor of uncertain malignant potential, superficial melanocytic tumor of uncertain significance, atypical Spitz tumor, and atypical cellular blue nevus, and these lesions are more frequently seen in younger patients.

### Basal cell carcinoma overlying a dermatofibroma in an African American patient [^112waN9Z]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous case reports in the literature have predominantly detailed occurrences in lighter skin types, indicating that this phenomenon is exceedingly rare, particularly in skin of color. The cases in the literature used histopathologic features to confirm the diagnosis of BCC over DF, noting FI and epidermal proliferation of basaloid cells, plus subtle features that confirmed overlying BCC such as nests, palisading cells, and retraction artifacts from the adjacent dermis. These specific histopathologic features distinguish a true BCC from BCC-like hyperplasia. It is hypothesized that the inductive effect of DF and fibrohistiocytic proliferation may contribute to the development of BCC; however, further research is needed.

Both BCCs and DFs can present as raised, firm nodules, with textures and coloration that may overlap, ranging from pink to brown. Although BCCs typically exhibit rolled or raised borders, both lesions can display concerning irregularities. Therefore, due to the numerous overlapping clinical features that can render DFs and BCC clinically indistinguishable, histopathologic examination is imperative for definitive diagnosis. Although rare, this case underscores the significance of utilizing skin biopsy to distinguish between benign DFs and those harboring malignant potential. Clinical indicators such as changes in size, irregularities in shape or color, or symptomatic lesions should prompt histopathologic investigation. Lesions of confirmed malignant nature should be excised by wide local excision, and benign-appearing lesions should be monitored for changes. Moreover, this case highlights the importance of recognizing diverse presentations across various skin tones and considering cutaneous malignancy despite its lower incidence in darker skin types. Continued education should be provided to allow for proper diagnosis in skin of color, as early diagnosis and prevention can greatly improve outcomes and patient care.

Non-specific morphologies

Outside of the 10 core diagnoses discussed above, there exist other potential non-specific presentations that occur at higher frequencies. These non-specific presentations require an evaluation as described above in order to come to a core diagnosis, when possible. When a core diagnosis is not reachable, workup may at least reveal new data that will allow for more targeted therapy in addition to severity grading (online supplemental table S23). The non-specific morphologies include hyperkeratotic papules and plaques, isolated mucositis, or the previously often diagnosed 'maculopapular rash'. Importantly, we would encourage clinicians to avoid making a final diagnosis of these non-specific subtypes, but rather to use them as descriptive terms while undertaking the evaluation of patient with D-irAE.

### IgG4 expression in cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation and localized amyloid deposition: a useful clue to cutaneous origin [^111BfN4P]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Primary cutaneous lymphomas include T-cell and B-cell neoplasms limited to skin without evidence of extracutaneous disease. Cutaneous follicle center cell lymphoma is the most common cutaneous B cell lymphoma, comprising 12% of cases. Primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (PCMZL) accounts for 7% of all skin lymphomas and comprises 25% to 30% of cutaneous B cell lymphoma. Cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the leg type is the least common at about 4% of cases.

PCMZL typically presents as pink-purple, solitary or grouped papules, plaques, and nodules on the trunk and upper extremities of adults in the fifth to sixth decade with a male predominance. Biopsy typically finds a vaguely nodular nonepidermotropic, deep dermal (bottom-heavy), subcutaneous and/or periadnexal polymorphous lymphoid infiltrate. Small lymphocytes surround germinal centers with either centrocytelike or plasmacytoid morphology. Plasma cells are often increased. Lymphoma cells express CD20 and CD79a and are negative for CD5, CD10, and Bcl-6. If plasma cells are increased, they exhibit immunoglobulin light chain restriction. Clonality can be identified in about 80% of cases.PCMZL and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas may be preceded by chronic antigen stimulation and are the most indolent tumors in this group. Only 4% of patients have extracutaneous disease, and less than 1% of patients die of disease; therefore, distinguishing PCMZL from marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) with secondary skin involvement is clinically important.

The clinical calculator "7-point dermoscopy checklist for melanoma" for cutaneous melanoma.

The 7-point dermoscopy checklist for melanoma is a diagnostic probability tool designed to assess the likelihood of melanoma in patients presenting with suspicious skin lesions. This tool aids in the early detection of melanoma, thereby facilitating timely intervention and improving patient outcomes.

The checklist comprises seven key dermoscopic features, each assigned a specific point value. These features include an atypical pigment network, gray-blue areas, an atypical vascular pattern, radial streaming or streaks, irregular diffuse pigmentation or blotches, irregular dots and globules, and a regression pattern. The points for each feature are summed to yield a total score, which is then used to estimate the probability of melanoma.

A score of 4 or more suggests a high likelihood of melanoma, with a reported sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 78%. Conversely, a score of 3 or less indicates a low risk of melanoma. This scoring system thus provides a structured approach to the dermoscopic evaluation of skin lesions, enhancing the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis and reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions.

The 7-point dermoscopy checklist offers a systematic way to evaluate the likelihood of melanoma by examining specific features of a skin lesion. By answering seven yes-or-no questions about distinct lesion characteristics, the checklist produces a score and interpretation that estimate melanoma risk.

The checklist assesses the following seven features:

- Atypical pigment network
- Gray-blue areas
- Atypical vascular pattern
- Radial streaming or streaks
- Irregular diffuse pigmentation or blotches
- Irregular dots and globules
- Regression pattern

Each detected feature contributes to a score based on its significance:

| **Feature** | **Score** |
|-|-|
| Atypical pigment network | 2 |
| Gray-blue areas | 2 |
| Atypical vascular pattern | 2 |
| Radial streaming, streaks | 1 |
| Irregular diffuse pigmentation, blotches | 1 |
| Irregular dots and globules | 1 |
| Regression pattern | 1 |

The checklist's algorithm adds up the scores for each present feature. This cumulative score provides an overall assessment of melanoma risk.

The resulting interpretation depends on the total score:

- A score of 4 or more suggests "Melanoma is likely" with 93% sensitivity and 78% specificity. This indicates a high probability of the lesion being melanoma.

- A score of 3 or less implies "The risk of melanoma is low", suggesting a lower probability of the lesion being melanoma.

The process results in a straightforward summary that aids clinicians in evaluating the risk of melanoma, delivering both the numerical score and the pertinent interpretation.

### A hyperpigmented plaque in a female patient [^116LdPEX]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A 59-year-old African American female with a past medical history of hypertension, depression, and arthritis presented for initial evaluation of a lesion on the upper portion of her back (Fig 1). The lesion had been slowly growing over the past few years and was occasionally pruritic. On examination, it appeared to be a waxy, firm, hyperpigmented, and painless plaque. She denied any history of keloids as well as prior trauma to the area, fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss. Upon biopsy of the lesion, histopathology revealed deposition of an extracellular pink hyaline material as well as an infiltrate of perivascular plasma cells (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Seborrheic keratosis
B. Keloid
C. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
D. Macular amyloidosis
E. Nodular cutaneous amyloidosis

Answers:
A. Incorrect - Seborrheic keratosis is a common skin finding and can present as a darkly pigmented plaque. The histopathology of seborrheic keratosis would show papillomatosis, acanthosis, and associated keratin-filled "horned pseudocysts".
B. Incorrect - Keloids are skin lesions that can present as nontender, slow-growing skin plaques. However, our patient's lesion was not associated with any previous trauma, which is typically seen in the case of keloids. Also, the histopathology of a keloid would exhibit proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen, which was not seen in the present case.
C. Incorrect - Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare, locally aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma that can present as a growing hyperpigmented skin plaque. Its histopathology features monomorphic spindle cells arranged in an irregularly whorled or storiform pattern, often said to resemble a "straw mat", which was not observed in this case.
D. Incorrect - Macular amyloidosis is a subtype of primary cutaneous amyloidosis that typically presents in the interscapular area. On histopathology, sparse pink deposits are limited to the papillary dermis and may mimic normal skin.
E. Correct - Nodular cutaneous amyloidosis is the rarest subtype of primary cutaneous amyloidosis. The histopathology of a specimen from this lesion featuring extracellular pink hyaline material is indicative of amyloid deposition. Plasma cell infiltrate and subcuticular involvement indicate nodular cutaneous amyloidosis rather than other subtypes of cutaneous amyloidosis.

### The color of skin: black diseases of the skin, nails, and mucosa [^1117LDo4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Gradations in skin color are a consequence of differing amounts of melanin and their varying distribution. Although many darkly pigmented skin lesions are melanocytic and can be attributed to melanin content, the color of a black lesion can also be due to blood, necrotic tissue, or exogenous pigment. The source, pattern, and distribution of the color in black lesions usually offer important insight into its etiology. This contribution reviews conditions that can take on a black color, discussing the cause of the hue and any additional impact sun exposure may have.

### Visualizing genetics: an investigation of dermoscopy as a tool for genetic variant prediction in capillary malformations [^113tVybf]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Capillary malformations (CMs) are congenital malformations of capillaries typically visible as blanchable, pink to brown patches on the skin and/or mucosa. The genetic cause of CMs guides diagnosis, treatment, and recurrence counseling. However, identification may be limited by the availability of samples, the type of tests, and insurance coverage. We hypothesize that there are distinct dermoscopic features associated with specific genotypes of congenital CMs.

Methods

A single-center, retrospective cohort study of 22 patients with CMs affecting the skin, a polarized dermoscopic photo of the lesion, and a single nucleotide variant in the EPHB4, GNA11/GNAQ, PIK3CA/PIK3R1, or RASA1 genes was performed. Three reviewers analyzed dermoscopic photos for the presence of apparent vessels, branching, lacunae, geometric shape formation, zones of dropout, follicle-sparing, vessel and background color, and length and width of vessels when discernable. Features were categorized by genotype.

Results

EPHB4-CMs have visible lengthwise and widthwise cross sections of vessels that exhibit branching. RASA1-CMs generally present with merely a red/pink/brown hue without visible vessels. GNA11 or GNAQ-CMs generally present with pink coloration and generally only with visible widthwise cross sections of vessels without branching. Geometric PIK3CA-CMs exhibit distinct purple lacunae that indicate a lymphatic component, but the reticulated PIK3CA-CMs otherwise demonstrate a varied presentation.

Conclusion

Our research identified distinct genotype-phenotype correlations for CMs by dermoscopy. Dermoscopy can narrow the differential diagnosis, guide genetic testing, and aid in the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). This study demonstrates that dermoscopy holds promise in aiding genetic diagnosis and ultimately medical management.

### Asymptomatic pink nodules on a 28-year-old patient [^114mZxSh]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old Asian-American man with no past medical history presented with enlarging pink nodules and skin texture changes on the left triceps lasting for approximately 1 year (Fig 1). The patient denied any previous trauma or injury to the site. The patient's symptoms and history were reviewed extensively. Physical exam revealed no lymphadenopathy. A punch biopsy showed a dense lymphoid infiltrate consisting of small to medium-sized lymphocytes containing abundant plasma cells (Fig 2). A panel of immunohistochemistry stains demonstrated many CD3 + T cells and vast collections of CD20 + B cells, with a much greater number of T cells. The plasma cells expressed lambda light chain to a much greater degree than kappa light chain (Fig 3). The patient was referred to oncology for further work up.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis if whole body positron emission tomography scan were unremarkable?
A. Primary cutaneous mantle cell lymphoma
B. Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL)
C. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma
D. Lymphomatoid papulosis
E. Primary cutaneous follicular center lymphoma

Answers:
A. Primary cutaneous mantle cell lymphoma – Incorrect. Mantle cell lymphoma typically stains CD5 + and CD10 −. It is associated with a t(11,14) translocation.
B. Primary Cutaneous Marginal Zone Lymphoma (PCMZL) – Correct. PCMZL accounts for approximately 40% of all cutaneous B-cell lymphomas and approximately 10% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas. It typically presents as pink to red nodules to plaques on the arms or trunk. It is a B-cell lymphoma with numerous T cells.
C. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma – Incorrect. The kappa-to-lambda ratio is normally two-thirds kappa to one-third lambda. The imbalance of this ratio suggests that B-cell clonality is present. In pseudolymphoma, there is no disproportionate change in the light chains. Thus, a true lymphoma is more likely in this patient's case.
D. Lymphomatoid papulosis – Incorrect. This is a benign proliferation of T cells, presenting as recurrent, self-resolving erythematous papules or nodules. It stains CD30 + and CD3 +, CD4 +, and CD5 + (common T-cell markers).
E. Primary cutaneous follicular center lymphoma – Incorrect. Primary cutaneous follicular center lymphoma typically stains CD10 + and Bcl-6 + and Bcl-2 −. A t(14,18) translocation is associated with the systemic form predominantly. The head and neck are most commonly affected.

### A purplish plaque and multiple nodules on the arm [^112tGKQK]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: Given the history and images, what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Angioma serpiginosum
B. Sporotrichosis
C. Linear scleroderma
D. Eccrine spiradenoma
E. Venous malformation

Answers:
A. Angioma serpiginosum – Incorrect. Although angioma serpiginosum commonly occurs in female children and can present a blaschkoid pattern, it is a vascular lesion that appears as small reddish dots.
B. Sporotrichosis – Incorrect. Cutaneous sporotrichosis is a fungal infection characterized by red, pink, or purple bumps that appear along the course of lymphatic vessels. However, these lesions tend to enlarge over time and to ulcerate, so this diagnosis is not compatible with the stable nature of the described lesions.
C. Linear scleroderma – Incorrect. Linear scleroderma is a subtype of morphea, whicht typically presents in children and generally appears as a single unilateral lesion, often affecting a limb. The affected areas are often indurated to the touch. Although clinically plausible, this diagnosis was excluded by histopathology.
D. Eccrine spiradenoma – Correct. Eccrine spiradenoma is a rare benign tumor of eccrine sweat glands. It usually presents as a single tender nodule, typically on the neck and back. Eccrine spiradenomas typically appear in the second and third decade of life, and are more common in females. Multiple eccrine spiradenomas are rare and can be described as linear, zosteriform, nevoid, or blaschkoid in pattern. Histopathology demonstrates tumor lobules located in the subcutaneous tissue containing small cells with round hyperchromatic nuclei at the periphery of the lobules, and larger cells with vesicular nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm centrally.
E. Venous malformation – Incorrect. Venous malformations can appear as bluish, palpable, and painful masses, and, while present at birth, they can become evident later in life. This diagnosis was excluded by histopathology.

### Towards characterization of skin melanoma in the clinic by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and imaging of melanin [^111vvSSN]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

When a lesion is suspected of melanoma, a decision is taken to excise the lesion with minimal margins. The histological analysis of the lesion will confirm the diagnostic benign/malignant. The primary tumor thickness (known as Breslow index, measured from the top of the tumor to the deepest tumor cells, Fig. 1) and presence of ulceration are the two major prognostic factors for survival and skin melanoma staging. When the Breslow depth is smaller than 0.8 mm and the tumor is not ulcerated, a second surgery is performed to enlarge the margins (1 cm) of resection. When the Breslow thickness is greater than 0.8 mm and/or the melanoma is ulcerated, the same second surgery is performed (margins of 1 or 2 cm according to the Breslow thickness) but simultaneous sentinel lymph node biopsy is associated in most cases. Indeed, regional lymph nodes represent the first sites of metastases in patients with melanoma.

Fig. 1
Illustration of different patterns of skin invasion by melanoma cells. Skin melanoma staging is based on the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) characterization. The tumor category T is determined based on Breslow tumor thickness and the presence or absence of ulceration. The stage of the skin lesion is dependent on the tumor thickness, with T1, T2, T3, and T4 lesions presenting a thickness smaller than 1 mm, between 1 and 2 mm, between 2 and 4 mm, and larger than 4 mm, respectively. Melanomas with a Breslow thickness lower than 0.8 mm have an excellent prognostic. Thicker the melanomas, higher the risk of migration of melanoma cells to lymph nodes (N) and higher the risk of distant metastases (M)

While advanced technologies described previously are valuable tools for early melanoma diagnosis, it should be emphasized that none is able to give an accurate in vivo estimation of the Breslow thickness. Ultra-high frequency ultrasound (HFUS) has been reported to be able to determine a Breslow thickness comparable to histological infiltration assessment on skin biopsies. However, while HFUS may define the thickness of a lesion, this method has no specificity regarding the nature of the lesion.

### Solitary pink papule in an elderly man [^117LBbfR]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following is a dermoscopic pattern for LyP 6p25.3?
A. A white, structureless area surrounding tortuous vessels that extends centrifugally
B. A central, white, structureless area with vessels present on the periphery
C. Vessels surrounding an area of necrosis and ulceration
D. A brown-gray, structureless area with no vessels
E. Linear, curved, and tortuous vessels; rosettes; and shiny, white lines

Answers:
A. A white, structureless area surrounding tortuous vessels that extends centrifugally – Incorrect. This pattern is seen in the initial stage of more common forms of LyP.
B. A central, white, structureless area with vessels present on the periphery – Incorrect. This pattern is seen with more mature lesions of more common forms of LyP.
C. Vessels surrounding an area of necrosis and ulceration – Incorrect. This pattern is seen in more common forms of LyP prior to the cicatricial phase.
D. A brown-gray, structureless area with no vessels – Incorrect. This pattern is seen with scarring or postinflammatory dyspigmentation in more common forms of LyP.
E. Linear, curved, and tortuous vessels; rosettes; and shiny, white lines – Correct. To our knowledge, this pattern has not yet been described, and it was seen in our patient with LyP with 6p25.3 gene rearrangement.

### Dermoscopic findings in the presurgical evaluation of basal cell carcinoma. A prospective study [^1162sGrW]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgery is the best treatment for basal cell carcinoma (BCC); however, incomplete excisions are possible.

Objective

Assessment of the accurateness of dermoscopy and clinical evaluation in the detection of borders of BCC and description of dermoscopic findings in clinically healthy tissue surrounding BCC.

Materials and Methods

Eighty-eight lesions with clinical dermoscopic diagnosis of BCC were examined clinically and dermoscopically, to delineate the correct site of surgical incision, demarcating the respective margins with colred dermographic pencils. Specific dermoscopic features were searched in the skin adjacent to the demarcated clinical margin.

Results

In 29 of 88 lesions, clinical and dermoscopic margins of the tumor coincided. In the remaining 59 (67%), 10 (16.9%) presented, in the lesion area identified under dermoscopy, classical criteria for BCC and 57 (96.6%) nonclassical criteria. Differences between clinical and dermoscopic margins were significantly more frequent in superficial BCCs (p = .006). The frequency was not significantly different (p = .85) in relation to body sites.

Conclusion

Dermoscopy improves the identification of margins for surgical excision in BCC. The observation of nontraditional dermoscopic criteria of BCC, mainly pink-white areas and short telangiectasias in the area between clinically and dermoscopically detected margins, helps to define the actual tumoral margins and to achieve a really radical excision.

### Eruptive melanocytic nevi heralding the diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma: a case report [^114arYgP]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Case report

An 80-year-old man presented with a 3.2-cm × 2.6-cm pink-brown thin plaque with irregular borders and color variation on the vertex of the scalp. The lesion was present for 1 year. After referral to a dermatologist, a total body skin examination also revealed a 1.3-cm × 1.0-cm dark brown patch of unknown duration on the left ala. The patient denied any constitutional symptoms. His medical history was notable for significant cardiovascular disease, an arrhythmia, chronic renal insufficiency, and Barrett's esophagus, which was under periodic surveillance. Recently, he was hospitalized for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and received a long course of intravenous antibiotics. Of note, results of his last screening colonoscopy were unremarkable, and he had no family history of melanoma.

Biopsy of the scalp lesion showed at least a 0.85-mm-thick melanoma, extending to the base (Clark's level III). Biopsy of the ala lesion showed a 1.6-mm-thick melanoma (Clark's level IV) (Fig 1). The patient underwent local resection of both tumors, but because of his medical comorbidities, a sentinel lymph node biopsy was not performed. Histology from the removed tissue on the scalp found a 2-mm-thick melanoma (Clark's level IV) with intravascular invasion and negative margins, with staging determined to be pT3a. The nasal ala tissue showed a 1.8-mm-thick melanoma (Clark's level IV) consistent with stage pT2a, however, with residual melanoma in situ at the surgical margins. After 3 months of treatment with topical imiquimod 5% cream and tazarotene 0.1% gel on the melanoma in situ lesion, 2 scouting biopsies of that area showed reactive changes and dermal fibrosis with no residual atypical melanocytes.

### Rapidly progressive purpuric plaques in an infant [^112mvDwD]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythema multiforme minor
B. Polyarteritis nodosa
C. Sweet Syndrome
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura

Answers:
A. Erythema multiforme minor – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme minor, a self-limited immune-mediated reaction to infections, is characterized by the acute onset of target, maculopapular lesions on extremities. It is not associated with edema of the face.
B. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a leukocytoclastic medium-sized vessel vasculitis associated with cutaneous lesions such as livedo, subcutaneous nodules and annular purpura commonly on the arms and legs. Although cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is the most common form in children, no subcutaneous nodules nor livedo were present here.
C. Sweet Syndrome – Incorrect. SS is characterized by acute purple and erythematous plaques on the face and extremities. Constitutional signs such as fever, malaise, arthralgia and leukocytosis, which are minor criteria for SS, were absent in this patient.
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy – Correct. AHEI is a rare cutaneous vasculitis, seen in children between 4 and 24 months of age. Initially small erythematous papules or macules progress within 48 hours to sharply demarcated, targetoid, indurated purpuric plaques involving the face, the upper and lower extremities and sparing the trunk. The children appear otherwise well. AHEI is associated with facial edema and low-grade fever.
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura – Incorrect. HSP and AHEI, both small-vessel vasculitis, have clinical and prognostic distinctive features. HSP mainly affects older children from 3 to 6 years of age, the palpable purpura in HSP is distributed on the buttocks and extensor surface of the legs, sparing the face.HSP's diagnostic criteria include this characteristic rash and at least 1 other than skin system involvement; it may be associated with renal and gastrointestinal risks.
