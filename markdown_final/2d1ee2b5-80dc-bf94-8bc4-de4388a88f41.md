## Question

Therapeutic lovenox

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about therapeutic enoxaparin (Lovenox) dosing, monitoring, special populations, and safety. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's identity and mechanism to anchor dosing. Then, I should verify labeled indications and standard therapeutic regimens. Next, I will examine renal dosing, obesity, and pregnancy. After that, I need to check monitoring strategies, including when anti-Xa levels are warranted. Finally, I will review safety, contraindications, and practical pearls, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these together with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the drug and mechanism so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin with predominant anti–factor Xa activity and a mean molecular weight around 4,500 daltons, which explains its predictable pharmacokinetics and subcutaneous administration, and it is not interchangeable with unfractionated heparin on a unit-for-unit basis, so I need to keep that in mind when comparing or switching agents [^03b17be6] [^fbb96b4e].

> Next, I should review labeled indications to frame when "therapeutic" dosing is appropriate. Enoxaparin is indicated for treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism in combination with warfarin, for prophylaxis of ischemic complications in unstable angina/non–Q-wave MI with aspirin, and for treatment of acute STEMI with aspirin, with additional labeled uses for VTE prophylaxis in surgery and acutely ill medical patients, so "therapeutic" generally refers to treatment of established thrombosis or ACS rather than prophylaxis [^d64f27e7] [^3d3894b9].

> I will now examine standard therapeutic regimens for VTE, and I should double-check the two accepted options. For acute DVT with or without PE, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours or 1.5 mg/kg once daily are both effective, with warfarin started within 72 hours and continued until INR is therapeutic for at least 5 days, and both regimens have been shown equivalent to unfractionated heparin in large randomized trials and meta-analyses, which supports either choice based on patient factors and preference [^d015954f] [^4feacbc8] [^021031b6].

> Hold on, I should verify renal dosing because accumulation increases bleeding risk. In severe renal impairment with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, the dose should be reduced to 1 mg/kg once daily for treatment indications, and for prophylaxis 30 mg once daily is recommended; anti-Xa monitoring can be considered in this setting, though routine monitoring is not required for most patients with normal renal function [^effa651e] [^71b2f658] [^46078f00].

> Let me consider obesity, since fixed dosing may under- or over-anticoagulate. Non–weight-adjusted prophylactic dosing leads to higher anti-Xa exposure in low-body-weight patients and lower exposure in obesity, so weight-based strategies are reasonable in extremes; for treatment, 1 mg/kg actual body weight is standard, and while some advocate anti-Xa monitoring in obesity, evidence is mixed and not mandated, so I should individualize and monitor closely for bleeding or recurrence [^160cd772] [^44300d18].

> I need to check pregnancy-specific issues carefully. Enoxaparin does not cross the placenta and is commonly used in pregnancy for treatment and prophylaxis, but mechanical prosthetic heart valves are a notable exception where LMWH may be inadequate and maternal/fetal thrombosis has been reported; if LMWH is used in this scenario, frequent anti-Xa peaks and troughs are advised, and neuraxial anesthesia timing must respect pharmacokinetics to mitigate spinal hematoma risk [^6e1685b8] [^ac254c18] [^05098e18].

> Next, I should review monitoring, and I must not jump to conclusions about routine labs. For most patients, routine anti-Xa monitoring is unnecessary because of predictable pharmacokinetics; however, in renal impairment, extremes of body weight, pediatrics, or when bleeding or thrombosis occurs, anti-Xa levels can guide therapy, with peak sampling 4 hours after injection and regimen-specific targets such as 0.6–1.0 IU/mL for enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily and around 1.0 IU/mL for once-daily regimens, noting that aPTT is not reliable for LMWH monitoring [^92a42032] [^4fc2f5d1] [^47be1278].

> I should confirm safety, contraindications, and reversal so I don't miss high-risk scenarios. Major contraindications include active major bleeding, recent HIT or circulating HIT antibodies, and hypersensitivity to enoxaparin, heparin, or pork products; major bleeding risk is increased in renal failure, low body weight, and concomitant antiplatelets, and protamine sulfate provides partial reversal of anti-Xa activity, though it is less effective than for UFH; neuraxial hematoma risk mandates strict timing around epidural catheters, especially in renal impairment [^77614c10] [^adb70155] [^05098e18] [^f51c5531].

> Let me synthesize practical pearls so the plan is actionable. For VTE treatment, use 1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily with warfarin overlap until INR is therapeutic for at least 5 days; reduce to 1 mg/kg once daily if CrCl is less than 30 mL/min; consider anti-Xa levels in renal failure, obesity, or if clinical events occur; and avoid enoxaparin in HIT, active bleeding, or mechanical valve scenarios where monitoring and alternatives may be preferable [^d015954f] [^effa651e] [^92a42032] [^ac254c18].

> But wait, what if the clinical context is ACS rather than VTE. In NSTE-ACS, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours is standard, and in STEMI managed with fibrinolysis or PCI, age- and renal-adjusted regimens including an IV bolus are recommended; during PCI, IV enoxaparin 0.5–0.75 mg/kg is used when no prior anticoagulant was given, and meta-analyses suggest improved ischemic outcomes compared with unfractionated heparin in primary PCI, though I should balance this with bleeding risk and procedural context [^9e452870] [^a3ba85f9] [^90f8ec27] [^c18cd12c].

> Finally, I should double-check that I've addressed special populations and monitoring succinctly. Renal dosing is the most critical adjustment, obesity favors weight-based treatment dosing, pregnancy is generally acceptable except for mechanical valves, and anti-Xa monitoring is reserved for select scenarios rather than routine care; keeping these guardrails in mind, enoxaparin remains a convenient and effective alternative to unfractionated heparin for therapeutic anticoagulation when used thoughtfully and with appropriate vigilance for bleeding and thrombocytopenia [^effa651e] [^160cd772] [^ac254c18] [^92a42032].

Therapeutic Lovenox (enoxaparin) is used for **treatment of acute DVT/PE** [^d64f27e7] and **ACS/STEMI** [^3d3894b9], with dosing tailored to indication, renal function, and body weight. For DVT/PE, use **1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours** or **1.5 mg/kg once daily** [^d015954f] for at least 5 days and until INR is therapeutic with warfarin [^2e6e774e]. For ACS/STEMI, use **1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours** with aspirin [^615bcbe8]; for PCI, add a 0.5–0.75 mg/kg IV bolus if no prior anticoagulant [^a3ba85f9]. Adjust dose to **1 mg/kg once daily** if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^effa651e] and monitor anti-Xa levels in renal impairment or obesity [^92a42032]. Major bleeding and HIT are key risks; monitor platelets and avoid use in active bleeding or HIT history [^77614c10] [^adb70155].

---

## Indications and dosing

### Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)

- **Standard dosing**: 1 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) every 12 hours [^d015954f] or 1.5 mg/kg SC once daily [^8d6e6fd9].
- **Duration**: Minimum 5 days and until therapeutic INR (2–3) is achieved with warfarin [^2e6e774e].
- **Renal impairment**: Adjust to 1 mg/kg once daily if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^effa651e].

---

### Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

- **Standard dosing**: 1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours with aspirin [^615bcbe8].
- **PCI dosing**: 0.5–0.75 mg/kg IV bolus if no prior anticoagulant [^a3ba85f9].
- **Renal impairment**: Adjust to 1 mg/kg once daily if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^9e452870].

---

## Special populations and dose adjustments

| **Population** | **Dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| Renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) | 1 mg/kg once daily [^effa651e] |
| Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) | Consider anti-Xa monitoring; no standard adjustment [^92a42032] [^44300d18] |
| Pregnancy | Safe; monitor anti-Xa if available [^6e1685b8] |
| Elderly | No routine adjustment; monitor closely [^160cd772] |

---

## Monitoring and laboratory tests

- **Routine monitoring**: Not required in most patients due to predictable PK [^47be1278].
- **Renal impairment**: Consider anti-Xa levels (target 0.5–1.0 IU/mL, 4 hours post-dose) [^92a42032].
- **Platelet count**: Monitor for HIT (platelet drop > 50% or new thrombosis) [^4bbe5e3d].

---

## Safety and adverse effects

- **Major bleeding**: Risk increases with renal impairment, obesity, and concomitant antiplatelets [^4bbe5e3d].
- **HIT**: Rare but serious; monitor platelets and stop if suspected [^adb70155].
- **Local reactions**: Injection-site hematoma, pain, and irritation are common [^0e1ecdb3].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **active major bleeding**, **HIT history** [^adb70155], hypersensitivity to enoxaparin, heparin, or pork, and benzyl alcohol allergy (multidose vials) [^77614c10]. Use with caution in patients with **bleeding disorders**, **uncontrolled hypertension**, recent GI ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, or renal dysfunction [^4bbe5e3d].

---

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

Enoxaparin is **noninferior to UFH** for DVT/PE treatment [^021031b6] and reduces recurrent VTE [^d015954f]. In ACS/STEMI, it reduces death/MI versus UFH [^615bcbe8] and improves net clinical benefit in PCI [^c18cd12c].

---

Therapeutic Lovenox is a **weight-based, indication-specific regimen** with renal adjustments and selective anti-Xa monitoring; it offers predictable anticoagulation with favorable efficacy-safety across DVT/PE and ACS/STEMI, provided bleeding and HIT risks are managed.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after randomization. Total follow-up was one year.

The rate of the primary efficacy endpoint (death or myocardial re-infarction) was 9.9% in the Lovenox group, and 12% in the unfractionated heparin group, a 17% reduction in the relative risk, (P = 0.000003) (see Table 25).

The beneficial effect of Lovenox on the primary endpoint was consistent across key subgroups including age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, fibrinolytic agent administered, and time to treatment with study drug (see Figure 1); however, it is necessary to interpret such subgroup analyses with caution.

The beneficial effect of Lovenox on the primary endpoint observed during the first 30 days was maintained over a 12 month follow-up period (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Plot – Death or Myocardial Re-infarction at 30 Days – ITT Population

There is a trend in favor of Lovenox during the first 48 hours, but most of the treatment difference is attributed to a step increase in the event rate in the UFH group at 48 hours (seen in Figure 2), an effect that is more striking when comparing the event rates just prior to and just subsequent to actual times of discontinuation. These results provide evidence that UFH was effective and that it would be better if used longer than 48 hours. There is a similar increase in endpoint event rate when Lovenox was discontinued, suggesting that it too was discontinued too soon in this study.

The rates of major hemorrhages (defined as requiring 5 or more units of blood for transfusion, or 15% drop in hematocrit or clinically overt bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage) at 30 days were 2.1% in the Lovenox group and 1.4% in the unfractionated heparin group. The rates of intracranial hemorrhage at 30 days were 0.8% in the Lovenox group and 0.7% in the unfractionated heparin group. The 30-day rate of the composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or ICH (a measure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower in the Lovenox group (10.1%) as compared to the heparin group (12.2%).

Similarly, in a multicenter, open-label, parallel group study, patients with acute proximal DVT were randomized to Lovenox or heparin. Patients who could not receive outpatient therapy were excluded from entering the study. Outpatient exclusion criteria included the following: inability to receive outpatient heparin therapy because of associated comorbid conditions or potential for non-compliance and inability to attend follow-up visits as an outpatient because of geographic inaccessibility. Eligible patients could be treated in the hospital, but ONLY Lovenox patients were permitted to go home on therapy (72%). A total of 501 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 96 years (mean age 57.8 years) with 60.5% men and 39.5% women. Patients were randomized to either Lovenox 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously or heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion administered to achieve an aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds (in-patient treatment). All patients also received warfarin sodium as described in the previous study. Lovenox or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days. Lovenox was equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 22).

14.4	Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) Lovenox 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) Lovenox 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of Lovenox or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Lovenox or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both Lovenox regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of enoxaparin sodium SC (also known as Lovenox):
- **Decreased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as thrombocytopenia can occur with the use of enoxaparin.
- **Gasping syndrome**: use caution in infants, as enoxaparin sodium vials contain benzyl alcohol preservative.
- **Hemorrhage**: use caution in patients undergoing PCI. If manual compression is used at the puncture site after PCI, remove the sheath 6 hours after the last enoxaparin dose. Administer the next scheduled dose no sooner than 6–8 hours after sheath removal.
- **Hemorrhage**: use caution in patients with bleeding disorder, uncontrolled hypertension, or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction, or hemorrhage.
- **Hemorrhage**: use extreme caution in patients at high risk of hemorrhage, including bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative or angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, recent brain, spinal, or ophthalmologic surgery, or concomitant use of platelet inhibitors.
- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as enoxaparin may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with or without thrombosis.
- **Prosthetic valve thrombosis**: use caution in thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, as the risk of thromboembolism is higher in this population. Obtain frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-factor Xa levels and adjust dosage.

14.2	Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

Lovenox has been shown to reduce the risk of postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following hip or knee replacement surgery.

In a double-blind study, Lovenox 30 mg every 12 hours subcutaneously was compared to placebo in patients with hip replacement. A total of 100 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 41 to 84 years (mean age 67.1 years) with 45% men and 55% women. After hemostasis was established, treatment was initiated 12 to 24 hours after surgery and was continued for 10 to 14 days after surgery. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 16).

A double-blind, multicenter study compared three dosing regimens of Lovenox in patients with hip replacement. A total of 572 patients were randomized in the study and 568 patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 31 to 88 years (mean age 64.7 years) with 63% men and 37% women. Patients were 93% Caucasian, 6% Black, < 1% Asian, and 1% others. Treatment was initiated within two days after surgery and was continued for 7 to 11 days after surgery. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 17).

2.1	Pretreatment Evaluation

Evaluate all patients for a bleeding disorder before starting Lovenox treatment, unless treatment is urgently needed.

Abdominal Surgery

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 40 mg by subcutaneous injection once a day (with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by subcutaneous injection in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. Administer the initial dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery, provided that hemostasis has been established. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

A dose of Lovenox of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously may be considered for hip replacement surgery for up to 3 weeks. Administer the initial dose 12 (± 3) hours prior to surgery.

Medical Patients during Acute Illness

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 40 mg once a day administered by subcutaneous injection for medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness. The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, who can be treated at home in an outpatient setting.

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered subcutaneously at the same time every day for inpatient (hospital) treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment).

In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, initiate warfarin sodium therapy when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of Lovenox). Continue Lovenox for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2 to 3). The average duration of administration is 7 days [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

11 DESCRIPTION

Lovenox is a sterile aqueous solution containing enoxaparin sodium, a low molecular weight heparin. The pH of the injection is 5.5 to 7.5.

Enoxaparin sodium is obtained by alkaline depolymerization of heparin benzyl ester derived from porcine intestinal mucosa. Its structure is characterized by a 2-O-sulfo-4-enepyranosuronic acid group at the non-reducing end and a 2-N,6-O-disulfo-D-glucosamine at the reducing end of the chain. About 20% (ranging between 15% and 25%) of the enoxaparin structure contains a 1,6-anhydro derivative on the reducing end of the polysaccharide chain. The drug substance is the sodium salt. The average molecular weight is about 4500 daltons. The molecular weight distribution is:

STRUCTURAL FORMULA

Lovenox 100 mg/mL Concentration contains 10 mg enoxaparin sodium (approximate anti-Factor Xa activity of 1000 IU [with reference to the W.H.O. First International Low Molecular Weight Heparin Reference Standard]) per 0.1 mL Water for Injection.

Lovenox 150 mg/mL Concentration contains 15 mg enoxaparin sodium (approximate anti-Factor Xa activity of 1500 IU [with reference to the W.H.O. First International Low Molecular Weight Heparin Reference Standard]) per 0.1 mL Water for Injection.

The Lovenox prefilled syringes and graduated prefilled syringes are preservative-free and intended for use only as a single-dose injection. The multiple-dose vial contains 15 mg benzyl alcohol per 1 mL as a preservative [see Dosage and Administration (2) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

Intravenous (Bolus) Injection Technique

Use the multiple-dose vial for intravenous injections. Administer Lovenox through an intravenous line. Do not mix or coadminister Lovenox with other medications. Flush the intravenous access device with a sufficient volume of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of Lovenox, to prevent mixing of drugs. Lovenox is compatible with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water.

2.6	Monitoring for Safety

During therapy monitor complete blood counts including platelets and stool occult blood.

Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

In patients with renal impairment anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox.

If during Lovenox therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox.

Special Populations

Gender

Apparent clearance and Amaxderived from anti-Factor Xa values following single subcutaneous dosing (40 mg and 60 mg) were slightly higher in males than in females. The source of the gender difference in these parameters has not been conclusively identified; however, body weight may be a contributing factor.

Geriatric

Apparent clearance and Amaxderived from anti-Factor Xa values following single and multiple subcutaneous dosing in geriatric subjects were close to those observed in young subjects. Following once a day subcutaneous dosing of 40 mg enoxaparin, the Day 10 mean area under anti-Factor Xa activity versus time curve (AUC) was approximately 15% greater than the mean Day 1 AUC value [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Renal impairment

A linear relationship between anti-Factor Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady state has been observed, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. Anti-Factor Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady state, is marginally increased in patients with creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min and patients with creatinine clearance 30 to < 50 mL/min after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Hemodialysis

In a single study, elimination rate appeared similar but AUC was two-fold higher than control population, after a single 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg intravenous dose.

Hepatic impairment

Studies with Lovenox in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted and the impact of hepatic impairment on the exposure to enoxaparin is unknown.

Weight

After repeated subcutaneous 1.5 mg/kg once-daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Factor Xa activity is marginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30–48 kg/m2) compared to non-obese control subjects, while Amaxis not increased.

When non–weight-adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-subcutaneous 40 mg dose, that anti-Factor Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (< 45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men (< 57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)].

Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases

Asymptomatic increases in aspartate (AST [SGOT]) and alanine (ALT [SGPT]) aminotransferase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal of the laboratory reference range have been reported in up to 6.1% and 5.9% of patients, respectively, during treatment with Lovenox.

Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease, and pulmonary emboli, elevations that might be caused by drugs like Lovenox should be interpreted with caution.

Local Reactions

Local irritation, pain, hematoma, ecchymosis, and erythema may follow subcutaneous injection of Lovenox.

Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Lovenox for Prophylaxis or Treatment of DVT, PE

Other adverse reactions that were thought to be possibly or probably related to treatment with Lovenox, heparin, or placebo in clinical trials with patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, abdominal or colorectal surgery, or treatment for DVT and that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in the Lovenox group, are provided below (see Tables 8 to 11).

Adverse Events in Lovenox-Treated Patients with Unstable Angina or Non–Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction

Non-hemorrhagic clinical events reported to be related to Lovenox therapy occurred at an incidence of ≤ 1%.

Non-major hemorrhagic events, primarily injection site ecchymosis and hematomas, were more frequently reported in patients treated with subcutaneous Lovenox than in patients treated with intravenous heparin.

Serious adverse events with Lovenox or heparin in a clinical trial in patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction that occurred at a rate of at least 0.5% in the Lovenox group are provided below (see Table 12).

Adverse Reactions in Lovenox-Treated Patients with Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

In a clinical trial in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 1.5%.

8.6	Patients with Mechanical Prosthetic Heart Valves

The use of Lovenox has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves and has not been adequately studied for long-term use in this patient population. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received Lovenox for thromboprophylaxis. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal and fetal deaths. Insufficient data, the underlying disease and the possibility of inadequate anticoagulation complicate the evaluation of these cases. Pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

8.7	Renal Impairment

In patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium. All such patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Because exposure of enoxaparin sodium is significantly increased in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic dosage ranges. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance 30 to < 50 mL/min and creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In patients with renal failure, treatment with Lovenox has been associated with the development of hyperkalemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

8.8	Low-Weight Patients

An increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been observed in low-weight women (< 45 kg) and low-weight men (< 57 kg). Observe low-weight patients frequently for signs and symptoms of bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.9	Obese Patients

Obese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses of Lovenox in obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose adjustment. Observe these patients carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after randomization. Total follow-up was one year.

The rate of the primary efficacy endpoint (death or myocardial re-infarction) was 9.9% in the enoxaparin sodium group, and 12% in the unfractionated heparin group, a 17% reduction in the relative risk, (P = 0.000003) (see Table 25).

The beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary endpoint was consistent across key subgroups including age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, fibrinolytic agent administered, and time to treatment with study drug (see Figure 1); however, it is necessary to interpret such subgroup analyses with caution.

14.4	Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

### Enoxaparin for primary thromboprophylaxis in symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 (OVID): a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre, phase 3 trial [^1abb703c]. The Lancet: Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Background

COVID-19 is a viral prothrombotic respiratory infection. Heparins exert antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects, and might have antiviral properties. We aimed to investigate whether thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin would prevent untoward hospitalisation and death in symptomatic, but clinically stable outpatients with COVID-19.

Methods

OVID was a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, phase 3 trial and was done at eight centres in Switzerland and Germany. Outpatients aged 50 years or older with acute COVID-19 were eligible if they presented with respiratory symptoms or body temperature higher than 37·5°C. Eligible participants underwent block-stratified randomisation (by age group 50–70 vs > 70 years and by study centre) in a 1:1 ratio to receive either subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for 14 days versus standard of care (no thromboprophylaxis). The primary outcome was a composite of any untoward hospitalisation and all-cause death within 30 days of randomisation. Analysis of the efficacy outcomes was done in the intention-to-treat population. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04400799) and has been completed.

Findings

At the predefined formal interim analysis for efficacy (50% of total study population), the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended early termination of the trial on the basis of predefined statistical criteria having considered the very low probability of showing superiority of thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin for the primary outcome under the initial study design assumptions. Between Aug 15, 2020, and Jan 14, 2022, from 3319 participants prescreened, 472 were included in the intention-to-treat population and randomly assigned to receive enoxaparin (n = 234) or standard of care (n = 238). The median age was 57 years (IQR 53–62) and 217 (46%) were women. The 30-day risk of the primary outcome was similar in participants allocated to receive enoxaparin and in controls (8 [3%] of 234 vs 8 [3%] of 238; adjusted relative risk 0·98; 95% CI 0·37–2·56; p = 0·96). All hospitalisations were related to COVID-19. No deaths were reported during the study. No major bleeding events were recorded. Eight serious adverse events were recorded in the enoxaparin group versus nine in the control group.

Interpretation

These findings suggest thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin does not reduce early hospitalisations and deaths among outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19. Futility of the treatment under the initial study design assumptions could not be conclusively assessed owing to under-representation of older patients and consequent low event rates.

### Intravenous enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin in primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction: the international randomised open-label ATOLL trial [^c18cd12c]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction has traditionally been supported by unfractionated heparin, which has never been directly compared with a new anticoagulant using consistent anticoagulation and similar antiplatelet strategies in both groups. We compared traditional heparin treatment with intravenous enoxaparin in primary PCI.

Methods

In a randomised open-label trial, patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an intravenous bolus of 0·5 mg/kg of enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin before primary PCI. Wherever possible, medical teams travelling in mobile intensive care units (ambulances) selected, randomly assigned (using an interactive voice response system at the central randomisation centre), and treated patients. Patients who had received any anticoagulant before randomisation were excluded. Patients and caregivers were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was 30-day incidence of death, complication of myocardial infarction, procedure failure, or major bleeding. The main secondary endpoint was the composite of death, recurrent acute coronary syndrome, or urgent revascularisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00718471.

Findings

910 patients were assigned to treatment with enoxaparin (n = 450) or unfractionated heparin (n = 460). The primary endpoint occurred in 126 (28%) patients after anticoagulation with enoxaparin versus 155 (34%) patients on unfractionated heparin (relative risk [RR] 0·83, 95% CI 0·68–1·01, p = 0·06). The incidence of death (enoxaparin, 17 [4%] vs heparin, 29 [6%] patients; p = 0·08), complication of myocardial infarction (20 [4%] vs 29 [6%]; p = 0·21), procedure failure (100 [26%] vs 109 [28%]; p = 0·61), and major bleeding (20 [5%] vs 22 [5%]; p = 0·79) did not differ between groups. Enoxaparin resulted in a significantly reduced rate of the main secondary endpoint (30 [7%] vs 52 [11%] patients; RR 0·59, 95% CI 0·38–0·91, p = 0·015). Death, complication of myocardial infarction, or major bleeding (46 [10%] vs 69 [15%] patients; p = 0·03), death or complication of myocardial infarction (35 [8%] vs 57 [12%]; p = 0·02), and death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularisation (23 [5%] vs 39 [8%]; p = 0·04) were all reduced with enoxaparin.

Interpretation

Intravenous enoxaparin compared with unfractionated heparin significantly reduced clinical ischaemic outcomes without differences in bleeding and procedural success. Therefore, enoxaparin provided an improvement in net clinical benefit in patients undergoing primary PCI.

### Safety and efficacy of only 2 weeks of ticlopidine therapy in patients at increased risk of coronary stent thrombosis: results from the antiplatelet therapy alone versus lovenox plus antiplatelet therapy in patients at increased risk of stent thrombosis (ATLAST) trial [^3006b82b]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy exists regarding the frequency of late stent thrombosis among patients treated with intracoronary stents and the most appropriate duration of treatment with a thienopyridine that is required to prevent this complication.

Methods

We analyzed the frequency of stent thrombosis and other ischemic events in the Antiplatelet Therapy alone versus Lovenox plus Antiplatelet therapy in patients at increased risk of Stent Thrombosis (ATLAST) trial. In the ATLAST trial, 1102 patients at increased risk of stent thrombosis (ST-elevation myocardial infarction within 48 hours, diffuse distal disease, a large amount of thrombus, acute closure, residual dissection, etc) were randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin (40 or 60 mg given every 12 hours for 14 days) or placebo; all patients received aspirin (325 mg daily) and ticlopidine (250 mg twice daily) for only 14 days.

Results

The primary end point, the 30-day combined incidence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization, was reached in 2.3% of patients (1.8% of patients taking enoxaparin vs 2.7% of patients taking placebo; P = 0.295). However, during the 15th through 30th days, the frequency of ischemic events was only 0.73%, and only 0.27% (3/1102) of patients had possible stent thrombosis (95% CI 0.06, 0.77).

Conclusion

The frequency of stent thrombosis and other adverse ischemic events in the 15th through 30th days after stent placement in even high-risk stent patients treated with ticlopidine for only 2 weeks is low whether or not enoxaparin is administered.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^47be1278]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Specific to this manuscript is why or when should a laboratory consider providing services for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy that do not require routine monitoring. For decades, we have monitored unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusions, with dose adjustment based on the reported activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and in some institutions, the anti‐FXa activity. Likewise, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been monitored using the prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR) for nearly 30 years in the United States, and longer elsewhere. Adjustment of daily VKA dose was primarily based on the patient's INR result with dietary intake, and other factors also considered. When low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) became available for clinical use (1993 in the United States), the drug prescribing information (PI) indicated, "There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of Lovenox in patients with normal presurgical coagulation parameters". However, notable in more recent enoxaparin labeling are pharmacokinetic (drug level) data, and subsequent iterations suggesting monitoring of anti‐FXa may be warranted in certain populations including renal insufficiency, abnormal laboratory coagulation results, or bleeding. When LMWH anticoagulation was available for the pediatric population, guidance suggesting the use of anti‐factor Xa (FXa) monitoring and dose adjustment algorithms soon followed.

Today the clinical laboratory is faced with a familiar dilemma with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) comprising a direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate and three direct FXa inhibitors, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. DOACs have predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties at fixed doses for approved indications and do not require routine monitoring to the same context as previous oral anticoagulants. However, soon after their approval, it became evident that having some capacity to measure (quantify) or detect (qualify) DOACs could be beneficial to address acute situations such as trauma, emergent surgery, neuraxial anesthesia, acute stroke, and others. Certain patient populations such as the frail elderly, renal impairment, extreme body weight, drug overdose, or interactions may also benefit for such assessment.

### Fondaparinux or enoxaparin for the initial treatment of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis: a randomized trial [^f9770d68]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The current standard initial therapies for deep venous thrombosis are low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin. In a dose-ranging study of patients with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, fondaparinux had efficacy and a safety profile similar to those of low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin).

Objective

To evaluate whether fondaparinux has efficacy and safety similar to those of enoxaparin in patients with deep venous thrombosis.

Design

Randomized, double-blind study.

Setting

154 centers worldwide.

Patients

2205 patients with acute symptomatic deep venous thrombosis.

Intervention

Fondaparinux, 7.5 mg (5.0 mg in patients weighing < 50 kg and 10.0 mg in patients weighing > 100 kg) subcutaneously once daily, or enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg of body weight, subcutaneously twice daily for at least 5 days and until vitamin K antagonists induced an international normalized ratio greater than 2.0.

Measurements

The primary efficacy outcome was the 3-month incidence of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolic complications. The main safety outcomes were major bleeding during initial treatment and death. An independent, blinded committee adjudicated all outcomes.

Results

43 (3.9%) of 1098 patients randomly assigned to fondaparinux had recurrent thromboembolic events compared with 45 (4.1%) of 1107 patients randomly assigned to enoxaparin (absolute difference, -0.15 percentage point [95% CI, -1.8 to 1.5 percentage points]). Major bleeding occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving fondaparinux and 1.2% of patients receiving enoxaparin. Mortality rates were 3.8% and 3.0%, respectively.

Limitations

Follow-up was incomplete in 0.4% of fondaparinux-treated patients and 1.0% of enoxaparin-treated patients.

Conclusions

Once-daily subcutaneous fondaparinux was at least as effective (not inferior) and safe as twice-daily, body weight-adjusted enoxaparin in the initial treatment of patients with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^28cb45f5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Similarly, in a multicenter, open-label, parallel group study, patients with acute proximal DVT were randomized to enoxaparin sodium or heparin. Patients who could not receive outpatient therapy were excluded from entering the study. Outpatient exclusion criteria included the following: inability to receive outpatient heparin therapy because of associated comorbid conditions or potential for non-compliance and inability to attend follow-up visits as an outpatient because of geographic inaccessibility. Eligible patients could be treated in the hospital, but ONLY enoxaparin sodium patients were permitted to go home on therapy (72%). A total of 501 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 96 years (mean age 57.8 years) with 60.5% men and 39.5% women. Patients were randomized to either enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously or heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion administered to achieve an aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds (in-patient treatment). All patients also received warfarin sodium as described in the previous study. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days. Enoxaparin sodium was equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 22).

### A direct comparison of intravenous enoxaparin with unfractionated heparin in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (from the ATOLL trial) [^daa7dfd6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Intravenous enoxaparin did not reduce significantly the primary end point (p = 0.06) compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the randomized Acute Myocardial Infarction Treated with primary angioplasty and intravenous enoxaparin Or unfractionated heparin to Lower ischemic and bleeding events at short- and Long-term follow-up (ATOLL) trial. We present the results of the prespecified per-protocol analysis excluding patients who did not receive the treatment allocated by randomization or received both enoxaparin and UFH. We evaluated all-cause mortality, complication of myocardial infarction, procedural failure, or major bleeding (primary end point) and all-cause mortality, recurrent acute coronary syndrome, or urgent revascularization (main secondary end point). Baseline and procedural characteristics were well balanced between the 2 treatment groups. Of 910 randomized patients, 795 patients (87.4%) were treated according to the protocol with consistent anticoagulation using intravenous enoxaparin (n = 400) or UFH (n = 395). Enoxaparin reduced significantly the rates of the primary end point (relative risk [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62 to 0.94, p = 0.012) and the main secondary end point (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.63, p < 0.0001). There was less major bleeding with enoxaparin (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01, p = 0.050) contributing to the significant improvement of the net clinical benefit (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.74, p = 0.0002). All-cause mortality was also reduced with enoxaparin (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.74, p = 0.003). In conclusion, in the per-protocol analysis of the ATOLL trial, pertinent to > 87% of the study population, enoxaparin was superior to UFH in reducing ischemic end points and mortality.

14.6 Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis in Adult Patients

In a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute symptomatic DVT without PE, fondaparinux sodium 5 mg (body weight less than 50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50 kg to 100 kg), or 10 mg (body weight greater than 100 kg) subcutaneously once daily (fondaparinux sodium treatment regimen) was compared to enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours. Almost all patients started study treatment in hospital. Approximately 30% of patients in both groups were discharged home from the hospital while receiving study treatment. A total of 2,205 patients were randomized and 2,192 were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 years to 95 years (mean age 61 years) with 53% men and 47% women. Patients were 97% Caucasian, 2% black, and 1% other races. Patients with serum creatinine level more than 2 mg/dL (180 micromol/L), or platelet count less than 100,000/mm3 were excluded from the trial. For both groups, treatment continued for at least 5 days with a treatment duration range of 7 ± 2 days, and both treatment groups received vitamin K antagonist therapy initiated within 72 hours after the first study drug administration and continued for 90 ± 7 days, with regular dose adjustments to achieve an INR of 2 to 3. The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed, symptomatic, recurrent VTE reported up to Day 97. The efficacy data are provided in Table 15.

Table 15: Efficacy of Fondaparinux Sodium Injection in the Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis (All Randomized)

aVTE was a composite of symptomatic recurrent non-fatal VTE or fatal PE reported up to Day 97. The 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference for total VTE was: (-1.8% to 1.5%).

During the initial treatment period, 18 (1.6%) of patients treated with fondaparinux sodium and 10 (0.9%) of patients treated with enoxaparin sodium had a VTE endpoint (95% CI for the treatment difference [fondaparinux sodium-enoxaparin sodium] for VTE rates: -0.2%; 1.7%).

### Primary prevention of venous thromboembolism in medical and surgical oncology patients [^9563cfc3]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

More evidence is available to support the routine use of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised general medical patients; this information may be extrapolated to hospitalised cancer patients. The MEDENOX study randomly assigned 1102 hospitalised acutely ill medical patients to LMWH enoxaparin (40 or 20 mg) or to placebo for 6–14 days. The primary outcome (VTE detected by bilateral venography or duplex ultrasonography between days 6 and 14 or documented PE) occurred in 5.5% of the enoxaparin 40 mg group and in 14.9% of the placebo group (relative risk, 0.37; P < 0.001). Lower-dose enoxaparin did not reduce risk for VTE. There was no difference between the two groups in the incidence of adverse effects, including bleeding. Similarly, the PREVENT study found that LMWH dalteparin was associated with a 45% reduction in the relative risk of VTE in acutely ill medical patients (P = 0.0015), without substantial differences in the incidence of bleeding. Fondaparinux was examined in a placebo-controlled study that enrolled a population of > 800 acutely ill medical patients; in this study, fondaparinux was associated with a 46.7% reduction in risk for VTE.

### Enoxaparin vs unfractionated heparin in high-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes managed with an intended early invasive strategy: primary results of the SYNERGY randomized trial [^e59db200]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Enoxaparin has demonstrated advantages over unfractionated heparin in low- to moderate-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS) treated with a conservative strategy.

Objectives

To compare the outcomes of patients treated with enoxaparin vs unfractionated heparin and to define the role of enoxaparin in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS at high risk for ischemic cardiac complications managed with an early invasive approach.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Superior Yield of the New Strategy of Enoxaparin, Revascularization and Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors (SYNERGY) trial was a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter, international trial conducted between August 2001 and December 2003. A total of 10 027 high-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS to be treated with an intended early invasive strategy were recruited.

Interventions

Subcutaneous enoxaparin (n = 4993) or intravenous unfractionated heparin (n = 4985) was to be administered immediately after enrollment and continued until the patient required no further anticoagulation, as judged by the treating physician.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was the composite clinical end point of all-cause death or nonfatal myocardial infarction during the first 30 days after randomization. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding or stroke.

Results

The primary end point occurred in 14.0% (696/4993) of patients assigned to enoxaparin and 14.5% (722/4985) of patients assigned to unfractionated heparin (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86–1.06). No differences in ischemic events during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were observed between enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin groups, respectively, including similar rates of abrupt closure (31/2321 [1.3%] vs 40/2364 [1.7%]), threatened abrupt closure (25/2321 [1.1%] vs 24/2363 [1.0%]), unsuccessful PCI (81/2281 [3.6%] vs 79/2328 [3.4%]), or emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery (6/2323 [0.3%] vs 8/2363 [0.3%]). More bleeding was observed with enoxaparin, with a statistically significant increase in TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) major bleeding (9.1% vs 7.6%, P = 0.008) but nonsignificant excess in GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Arteries) severe bleeding (2.7% vs 2.2%, P = 0.08) and transfusions (17.0% vs 16.0%, P = 0.16).

Conclusions

Enoxaparin was not superior to unfractionated heparin but was noninferior for the treatment of high-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS. Enoxaparin is a safe and effective alternative to unfractionated heparin and the advantages of convenience should be balanced with the modest excess of major bleeding.

### Use of enoxaparin in end-stage renal disease [^01ab431e]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Enoxaparin has become the treatment of choice for various thromboembolic diseases. In most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), prophylactic dosage of enoxaparin does not appear to be associated with an increased bleeding risk and can be used without the need for monitoring and adjustment of regimens. Empirical dose adjustment and biological monitoring seem to be necessary along with therapeutic doses. Anti-factor Xa poorly predicts the degree of anticoagulation in ESRD patients given enoxaparin.

### Individualized compared with conventional dosing of enoxaparin [^877ad8e2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare an individualized dosing regimen for enoxaparin to conventional dosing. Patients in the individualized arm were initially dosed according to weight: patients < 100 kg using total body weight; patients ≥ 100 kg using lean body weight. Doses were adjusted at 48 h according to renal function. Patients in the conventional arm received enoxaparin according to current practice. Dose-individualized patients had fewer bleeding events (primary end point; relative risk (RR) = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.01–0.89, P = 0.03) and composite bleeding and bruising events (secondary end point; RR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.12–0.71, P = 0.003) than those who received conventional dosing. In both arms of the study, there were no recurrent thromboembolic events during treatment and no deaths had occurred at 30 days. Dose individualization of enoxaparin significantly reduces the prevalence of bleeding and bruising events, without apparent loss in effectiveness.

14.4 Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium injection 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium injection 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium injection or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium injection or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium injection regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

### Efficacy and safety of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin during percutaneous coronary intervention: systematic review and meta-analysis [^b3df4b8c]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Unanswered questions and future research

Two new anticoagulants (bivalirudin and enoxaparin) have proved to be superior to unfractionated heparin during percutaneous coronary intervention, particularly in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. A head to head comparison between intravenous enoxaparin and intravenous bivalirudin is needed in the setting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention using contemporary techniques (radial access, last generation of stent, and thromboaspiration) and new antiplatelet agents such as prasugrel or ticagrelor.

Conclusions

During percutaneous coronary intervention, enoxaparin seems to be superior to unfractionated heparin in reducing all cause mortality and ischaemic and bleeding end points. This superiority was particularly evident in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Given the relatively low cost of enoxaparin (and its wide availability), this seems to be an attractive strategy to improve outcomes in the large number of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention worldwide.

Low molecular weight heparins enoxaparin (Lovenox) and dalteparin (Fragmin) list half-life 2–6 h and drug elimination 10–30, detected by Anti-Xa assay, with Protamine as reversal. Unfractionated heparin lists half-life 1.5–2 h and drug elimination 7.5–10 with PTT, anti-Xa assay, and Protamine reversal. Dabigatran (Pradaxa) shows half-life 12–17 h and drug elimination 60–85 with TT and ecarin clotting time used for detection and Idarucizumab (Praxbind) for reversal. Among factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban (Eliquis) has half-life 15 h and drug elimination 75 with Anti-Xa assay and an apixaban assay where available, and reversal Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) PCC; rivaroxaban (Xarelto) has half-life 9–13 h and drug elimination 45–65 with Anti-Xa assay and a rivaroxaban assay where available, and reversal Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) PCC. A pharmacokinetic note states that after 5 half-lives the amount of drug remaining is approximately 3%, and time to normal hemostasis may vary with these drugs in patients with renal failure as a result of renal excretion of the medications.

Key messages

- doses of 40 mg QD and 30 mg BID enoxaparin yield sub-therapeutic levels of anti-Xa in critically ill patients.

- a dose of 1 mg/kg QD enoxaparin is more likely to achieve a target anti-Xa range of 0.1 to 0.4 U/ml.

14.6 Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis in Adult Patients

In a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute symptomatic DVT without PE, ARIXTRA 5 mg (body weight less than 50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50 kg to 100 kg), or 10 mg (body weight greater than 100 kg) subcutaneously once daily (ARIXTRA treatment regimen) was compared to enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours. Almost all patients started study treatment in hospital. Approximately 30% of patients in both groups were discharged home from the hospital while receiving study treatment. A total of 2,205 patients were randomized and 2,192 were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 years to 95 years (mean age 61 years) with 53% men and 47% women. Patients were 97% Caucasian, 2% black, and 1% other races. Patients with serum creatinine level more than 2 mg/dL (180 micromol/L), or platelet count less than 100,000/mm3were excluded from the trial. For both groups, treatment continued for at least 5 days with a treatment duration range of 7 ± 2 days, and both treatment groups received vitamin K antagonist therapy initiated within 72 hours after the first study drug administration and continued for 90 ± 7 days, with regular dose adjustments to achieve an INR of 2 to 3. The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed, symptomatic, recurrent VTE reported up to Day 97. The efficacy data are provided in Table 15.

During the initial treatment period, 18 (1.6%) of patients treated with fondaparinux sodium and 10 (0.9%) of patients treated with enoxaparin sodium had a VTE endpoint (95% CI for the treatment difference [fondaparinux sodium-enoxaparin sodium] for VTE rates: -0.2%; 1.7%).

Intravenous (Bolus) Injection Technique

Use the multiple-dose vial for intravenous injections. Administer enoxaparin sodium through an intravenous line. Do not mix or coadminister enoxaparin sodium with other medications. Flush the intravenous access device with a sufficient volume of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of enoxaparin sodium to prevent mixing of drugs. Enoxaparin sodium is compatible with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water.

2.6	Monitoring for Safety

During therapy monitor complete blood counts including platelets and stool occult blood.

Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

In patients with renal impairment anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium.

If during enoxaparin sodium therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium.

### Meta-analysis comparing the efficacy, safety, and cost-benefit of direct acting oral anticoagulants versus enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis to prevent venous thromboembolism among hospitalized patients [^ef98d63e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially fatal complication of hospitalization. Thromboprophylaxis using subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) can result in local irritation, pain, and ecchymoses, leading to nonadherence. Direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are an alternative, but their efficacy and safety for short-term inpatient-only use versus LMWH, in medically hospitalized patients, has not been rigorously assessed. We performed a systematic review with meta-analyses and exploratory cost effectiveness analysis of Phase III randomized controlled trials comparing DOACs to LMWH for VTE prophylaxis to determine the risk and benefit of each. The primary efficacy end point (composite of total VTE and any-cause mortality) occurred in 1,321 of 10,978 (11.4%) of patients receiving DOAC prophylaxis and 1,084 of 10,600 (10.2%) with LMWH (odds ratio [OR] 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63 to 1.13). The primary safety end point (composite of major bleeding and clinically relevant bleeding) occurred in 519 of 16,131 (3.2%) of patients receiving DOACs and 381 of 14,616 (2.6%) with LMWH (OR 1.12; 95%CI 0.83 to 1.53). Subgroup analyses for efficacy (n = 9,233) and safety (n = 12,584) was conducted on patients randomized to Apixaban or LMWH. The primary efficacy end point occurred in 294 of 4618 (6.4%) patients on Apixaban and 383 of 4615 (8.3%) on Enoxaparin (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.24). Major and clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 157 of 6278 (2.50%) and 185 of 6,306 (2.9%), respectively (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.26). Exploratory cost effectiveness analysis suggested that Apixaban compared with Enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis could result in long-term cost savings. In conclusion, this systematic review of randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis, stratified by type of patients and drug, indicates noninferiority of DOACs in efficacy, safety, and cost for short-term VTE thromboprophylaxis among patients hospitalized for medical illness.

### Efficacy and safety of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin during percutaneous coronary intervention: systematic review and meta-analysis [^90f8ec27]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, enoxaparin was superior to unfractionated heparin in reducing mortality and bleeding outcomes during percutaneous coronary intervention, particularly in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST elevation myocardial infarction. Since early 2000 data have accumulated on enoxaparin in varied percutaneous coronary intervention settings. This current meta-analysis, with information on more than 30 000 patients, showed a 34% statistically significant reduction in mortality (1.66% absolute risk reduction) in patients receiving enoxaparin during percutaneous coronary intervention compared with unfractionated heparin. This survival benefit is supported by concomitant reductions in both ischaemic and major bleeding complications. All sensitivity analyses of mortality confirmed a genuine difference between the two drugs. Subgroup analyses suggested that the benefits on mortality and ischaemic complications were largely driven by the superiority measured in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST elevation myocardial infarction, whereas the better safety outcomes might be driven by the intravenous (versus subcutaneous) use of enoxaparin.

This meta-analysis confirms the results recently reported in the ATOLL (Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction Treated with primary angioplasty and intravenous enoxaparin Or unfractionated heparin to Lower ischemic and bleeding events at short- and Long-term follow-up) randomised trial. Compared with unfractionated heparin, intravenous enoxaparin at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg reduced death or resuscitated cardiac death in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention by 42% (P = 0.049) and death or myocardial infarction by 37% (P = 0.02). Although the 40% relative risk reduction in all cause mortality associated with enoxaparin in ATOLL was not significant (P = 0.08) owing to lack of power, it is consistent with the 38% reduction in mortality found in the group with ST elevation myocardial infarction in the current meta-analysis (P < 0.001), and more specifically with the 48% reduction of mortality in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (P < 0.001). The survival benefit associated with enoxaparin was present in both risk of bias subgroups in our meta-analysis; in low risk of bias studies (randomised trials and retrospective analysis of randomised trials) and in those showing higher risk of bias (non-randomised studies).

2.1	Pretreatment Evaluation

Evaluate all patients for a bleeding disorder before starting enoxaparin sodium treatment, unless treatment is urgently needed.

Abdominal Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 40 mg by subcutaneous injection once a day (with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by subcutaneous injection in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. Administer the initial dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery, provided that hemostasis has been established. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

A dose of enoxaparin sodium of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously may be considered for hip replacement surgery for up to 3 weeks. Administer the initial dose 12 (± 3) hours prior to surgery.

Medical Patients during Acute Illness

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 40 mg once a day administered by subcutaneous injection for medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness. The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, who can be treated at home in an outpatient setting.

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered subcutaneously at the same time every day for inpatient (hospital) treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment).

In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, initiate warfarin sodium therapy when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of enoxaparin sodium). Continue enoxaparin sodium for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2 to 3). The average duration of administration is 7 days [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

5.1	Increased Risk of Hemorrhage

Cases of epidural or spinal hemorrhage and subsequent hematomas have been reported with the use of enoxaparin sodium and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture procedures, resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of these events is higher with the use of postoperative indwelling epidural catheters, with the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity [see Boxed Warning, Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].

To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of enoxaparin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.

Placement or removal of a catheter should be delayed for at least 12 hours after administration of lower doses (30 mg once or twice daily or 40 mg once daily) of enoxaparin sodium and at least 24 hours after the administration of higher doses (0.75 mg/kg twice daily, 1 mg/kg twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) of enoxaparin sodium. Anti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial hematoma will be avoided. Patients receiving the 0.75 mg/kg twice-daily dose or the 1 mg/kg twice-daily dose should not receive the second enoxaparin dose in the twice-daily regimen to allow a longer delay before catheter placement or removal. Likewise, although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent enoxaparin sodium dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least four hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. For patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin is more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of enoxaparin sodium (30 mg once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (1 mg/kg/day) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Enoxaparin in experimental stroke: neuroprotection and therapeutic window of opportunity [^7353bd90]. Stroke (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Heparin and heparinoids have long been proposed for stroke treatment. This study investigates the effect of enoxaparin (Lovenox, Clexane), a low-molecular-weight heparin, on functional outcome (neuroscore) and lesion size in stroke models with reversible and irreversible cerebral ischemia using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rat.

Methods

Ischemia was induced in rats by transient occlusion for 2 hours or by permanent electrocoagulation of the left MCA. Forty-eight hours after ischemia, neurological deficit was evaluated by scoring sensorimotor functions and ischemic damage was quantified by histological evaluation of lesion volumes.

Results

After transient MCAO, enoxaparin at 2x1.5 mg/kg IV (2 and 24 hours after insult) significantly reduced lesion size by 30% (P < 0.05) and improved neuroscore (P < 0.01). This significant effect on lesion size and neuroscore was still evident when treatment was started 5 hours after insult. Administered under the same protocol with a 5 hours delay post permanent MCAO, enoxaparin reduced lesion size by 49% (P < 0.05) and improved neuroscore (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

This study indicates that standard nonhemorrhagic doses of enoxaparin reduce ischemic damage with a wide therapeutic window. In addition to its anticoagulant properties, other properties of enoxaparin could act in synergy to explain its neuroprotective profile in ischemia. Thus clinical application of enoxaparin treatment in stroke warrants serious consideration.

### Enoxaparin, effective dosage for intensive care patients: double-blinded, randomised clinical trial [^891f6e94]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The present study seems to suggest inadequate dosage as one of the possible mechanisms for the high failure rate of enoxaparin in ICU patients.

- 60 mg, or 1.5 times the standard dose, resulted in the best peak aFXa levels.

- Further trials using 60 mg daily, with clinical end points, are needed.

### Optimal dosing of prophylactic enoxaparin after surgical procedures: results of the double-blind, randomized, controlled FIxed or variable enoxaparin (FIVE) trial [^5b38be36]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The accepted "one-size-fits-all" dose strategy for prophylactic enoxaparin may not optimize the medication's risks and benefits after surgical procedures. The authors hypothesized that weight-based administration might improve the pharmacokinetics of prophylactic enoxaparin when compared to fixed-dose administration.

Methods

The FIxed or Variable Enoxaparin (FIVE) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial that compared the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of patients assigned randomly to postoperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily or enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg twice daily. Patients were randomized after surgery and received the first enoxaparin dose at 8 hours after surgery. Primary hypotheses were (1) weight-based administration is noninferior to a fixed dose for avoiding underanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa < 0.2 IU/ml) and (2) weight-based administration is superior to fixed-dose administration for avoiding overanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa > 0.4 IU/ml). Secondary endpoints were 90-day venous thromboembolism and bleeding.

Results

In total, 295 patients were randomized, with 151 assigned to fixed-dose and 144 to weight-based administration of enoxaparin. For avoidance of under anticoagulation, weight-based administration had a greater effectiveness (79.9 percent versus 76.6 percent); the 3.3 percent (95 percent CI, -7.5 to 12.5 percent) greater effectiveness achieved statistically significant noninferiority relative to the a priori specified -12 percent noninferiority margin (p = 0.004). For avoidance of overanticoagulation, weight-based enoxaparin administration was superior to fixed-dose administration (90.6 percent versus 82.2 percent); the 8.4 percent (95 percent CI, 0.1 to 16.6 percent) greater effectiveness showed significant safety superiority (p = 0.046). Ninety-day venous thromboembolism and major bleeding were not different between fixed-dose and weight-based cohorts (0.66 percent versus 0.69 percent, p = 0.98; 3.3 percent versus 4.2 percent, p = 0.72, respectively).

Conclusion

Weight-based administration showed superior pharmacokinetics for avoidance of underanticoagulation and overanticoagulation in postoperative patients receiving prophylactic enoxaparin.

### Parenteral anticoagulants: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^03b17be6]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) — derived from unfractionated heparin (UFH) by chemical or enzymatic depolymerization — are described as having reduced inhibitory activity against thrombin relative to factor Xa, a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio than heparin in animal models, use to treat VTE, and superior pharmacokinetic properties. Structurally, LMWHs are about one-third the molecular weight of UFH, with a mean molecular weight of 4,000 to 5,000 — which corresponds to about 15 saccharide units — and a range of 2,000 to 9,000. Because different depolymerization methods yield agents with differing properties and recommended dosing, these drugs are not interchangeable on a unit-for-unit basis. Preparation methods include: Bemiparin — Alkaline degradation; Dalteparin (Fragmin) — Nitrous acid depolymerization; Nadroparin calcium (Fraxiparine) — Nitrous acid depolymerization; Enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox/Clexane) — Benzylation followed by alkaline depolymerization; Tinzaparin (Innohep) — Enzymatic depolymerization with heparinase; and Danaparoid sodium (Orgaran) — Prepared from animal gut mucosa; contains heparan sulfate (84%), dermatan sulfate (12%), and chondroitin sulfate (4%).

Study design and procedures. This single-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase I study was designed and conducted at MDS Pharma Services.

At the enrollment visit (day 1), the subjects were asked to report to the study unit at least 15 h before the first scheduled dose. After check-in, eligible subjects were randomly assigned to four groups of 12 subjects each to receive twice-daily subcutaneous injections of one of the following drugs: UFH (150 U/kg; Heparin Sodium Injection, USP, 20,000 U/ml; APP Pharmaceuticals, Schaumburg, IL), enoxaparin sodium (1 mg/kg; Lovenox; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ), dalteparin sodium (120 IU/kg; Fragmin; Pfizer for Eisai, New York, NY), or adomiparin sodium (125 IU/kg; Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA). The doses selected were those appropriate for the indication of ACS. The first dose was given on the morning of day 1, and the final dose was given on the morning of day 5. The subjects were confined to the clinic from at least 15 h before the first scheduled dose to 48 h after the last dose; that is, the subjects entered the clinic by the evening of day −1 and were discharged on the morning of day 7. Subjects returned for a follow-up visit 7 days after the last dose (i.e. on day 12), and for a final safety evaluation to test for the development of heparin-induced antibodies 28 days after the last dose (i.e. day 33; data not shown).

14.6	Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

In a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who were to be hospitalized within 6 hours of onset and were eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either enoxaparin sodium or unfractionated heparin.

Study medication was initiated between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the initiation of fibrinolytic therapy. Unfractionated heparin was administered beginning with an intravenous bolus of 60 U/kg (maximum 4000 U) and followed with an infusion of 12 U/kg per hour (initial maximum 1000 U per hour) that was adjusted to maintain an aPTT of 1.5 to 2 times the control value. The intravenous infusion was to be given for at least 48 hours. The enoxaparin dosing strategy was adjusted according to the patient's age and renal function. For patients younger than 75 years of age, enoxaparin was given as a single 30 mg intravenous bolus plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by a subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg every 12 hours. For patients at least 75 years of age, the intravenous bolus was not given and the subcutaneous dose was reduced to 0.75 mg/kg every 12 hours. For patients with severe renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL per minute), the dose was to be modified to 1 mg/kg every 24 hours. The subcutaneous injections of enoxaparin were given until hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days (whichever came first). The mean treatment duration for enoxaparin was 6.6 days. The mean treatment duration of unfractionated heparin was 54 hours.

### A novel enoxaparin regime for ST elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention: a WEST sub-study [^a55df57b]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the anticoagulation effect of subcutaneous (SQ) and intravenous (IV) enoxaparin through systematic anti-Xa sampling during primary PCI for acute STEMI.

Background

Although appropriate anticoagulation is essential to maximize the efficacy and safety of primary PCI, the optimal dosing of enoxaparin in this setting is unclear.

Methods

STEMI patients randomized to primary PCI received ASA, clopidogrel 300 mg and enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SQ at earliest point of care, including prehospital. Plasma anti-Xa determination occurred just prior to and after primary PCI. Supplemental IV enoxaparin (0.3–0.5 mg/kg) and abciximab was encouraged prior to PCI.

Results

The 1st anti-Xa level 56 min (median, IQR 47–77) post SQ enoxaparin was 0.28 U/ml (0.23–0.41); 85% of patients (28/33) were < 0.5 U/ml (the recommended therapeutic level). Following PCI, 126 min (118–185) after SQ enoxaparin in those without IV dosing (8/33) the 2nd anti-Xa level was 0.44 U/ml (0.29–0.53); 6 of 8 patients remained < 0.5 U/ml. With IV enoxaparin (25/33) the 2nd anti-Xa was 0.96 U/ml (0.82–1.16) 97 min (82–109) after SQ enoxaparin: all were ≥ 0.5 U/ml and 2 had levels 1.5 U/ml.

Conclusion

A single SQ enoxaparin dose fails to achieve anti-Xa levels ≥ 0.5 U/ml in the majority of STEMI patients. When combined with a strategy of supplemental IV enoxaparin, adequate anti-Xa levels were achieved in all patients with few having levels > 1.5 U/ml. This regime of SQ injection with additional IV enoxaparin provides an attractive strategy enhancing effective early anti-thrombotic therapy at first medical contact prior to primary PCI.

### Apixaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after hip replacement [^cb7e1d61]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

There are various regimens for thromboprophylaxis after hip replacement. Low-molecular-weight heparins such as enoxaparin predominantly inhibit factor Xa but also inhibit thrombin to some degree. Orally active, specific factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban may provide effective thromboprophylaxis with a lower risk of bleeding and improved ease of use.

Methods

In this double-blind, double-dummy study, we randomly assigned 5407 patients undergoing total hip replacement to receive apixaban at a dose of 2.5 mg orally twice daily or enoxaparin at a dose of 40 mg subcutaneously every 24 hours. Apixaban therapy was initiated 12 to 24 hours after closure of the surgical wound; enoxaparin therapy was initiated 12 hours before surgery. Prophylaxis was continued for 35 days after surgery, followed by bilateral venographic studies. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of asymptomatic or symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause during the treatment period. Patients were followed for an additional 60 days after the last intended dose of study medication.

Results

A total of 1949 patients in the apixaban group (72.0%) and 1917 patients in the enoxaparin group (71.0%) could be evaluated for the primary efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 27 patients in the apixaban group (1.4%) and in 74 patients in the enoxaparin group (3.9%) (relative risk with apixaban, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22 to 0.54; P < 0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority; absolute risk reduction, 2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.5). The composite outcome of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 129 of 2673 patients assigned to apixaban (4.8%) and 134 of 2659 assigned to enoxaparin (5.0%) (absolute difference in risk, -0.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.4 to 1.0).

Conclusions

Among patients undergoing hip replacement, thromboprophylaxis with apixaban, as compared with enoxaparin, was associated with lower rates of venous thromboembolism, without increased bleeding. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00423319.).

### An open-label, comparative study of the efficacy and safety of once-daily dose of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin in the treatment of proximal lower limb deep-vein thrombosis [^0e25ecf6]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) with a once-daily regimen of enoxaparin, rather than a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is more convenient and allows for home care in some patients. This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of these two regimens for the treatment of patients with proximal lower limb DVT.

Methods

201 patients with proximal lower limb DVT from 13 centers in Brazil were randomized in an open manner to receive either enoxaparin [1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous (s.c.) OD] or intravenous (i.v.) UFH (adjusted to aPTT 1.5–2.5 times control) for 5–10 days. All patients also received warfarin (INR 2–3) for at least 3 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent DVT (confirmed by venography or ultrasonography), and safety endpoints included bleeding and serious adverse events. The rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) was also collected. Hospitalization was at the physician's discretion.

Results

Baseline patient characteristics were comparable between groups. The duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter with enoxaparin than with UFH (3 versus 7 days). In addition, 36% of patients receiving enoxaparin did not need to be hospitalized, whereas all of the patients receiving UFH were hospitalized. The treatment duration was slightly longer with enoxaparin (8 versus 7 days). There was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in the rate of recurrent DVT with enoxaparin versus UFH, and similar safety.

Conclusions

A once-daily regimen of enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous is at least as effective and safe as conventional treatment with a continuous intravenous infusion of UFH. However, the once daily enoxaparin regimen is easier to administer (subcutaneous versus intravenous), does not require aPTT monitoring, and leads to both a reduced number of hospital admissions and an average 4-day-shorter hospital stay.

Eligibility Criteria

Type of Studies

Only head‐to‐head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fondaparinux with LMWHs published in English, and meeting the study inclusion criteria were taken into consideration. LMWHs included enoxaparin sodium, dalteparin sodium, nadroparin calcium, parnaparin sodium, and tinzaparin sodium. Potential studies in other languages were searched for abstracts in English. Studies were included if published between January 2000 and December 2017. This period was selected because the first clinical trial of fondaparinux comparing LMWH was published in 2001. 11

Participants

RCTs were considered eligible if they included both male and female adults aged ≥ 18 years old. RCTs enrolling patients undergoing major orthopedic surgeries (eg, total hip replacement, total knee replacement, or hip fracture surgeries), major general surgeries (eg, abdominal surgery, cancer surgery), and related surgical immobility proven to be a risk factor for the development of VTE were included in the analyses.

Interventions

The interventions compared in this review were subcutaneous fondaparinux and subcutaneous LMWHs at titrated dose/manufacturer's recommended dose as per body weight or at the standard dose as per the country of interest. Studies in which the assessment was done up to 15 days after surgery were only taken into consideration for inclusion. Assessment period was chosen as 15 days, as the increased risk of VTE has been cited to be during the first 2 weeks. 23, 24, 25

Information Sources

We conducted a systematic search of the databases (Embase, PubMed, The Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials, ProQuest‐Direct, Science Direct, Clinicaltrials.gov), and conference proceedings to find RCTs evaluating fondaparinux and LMWH for the prophylaxis of VTE. Trials presented in conference proceedings but not published were searched for full‐text results. When full‐text results were not available, the reviewers contacted the authors of the unpublished studies via email to request trial results and full‐text manuscripts if available. The reference lists of all identified trials and review articles were hand searched to find any additional trials.

### Enoxaparin in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^021031b6]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Low-molecular-weight heparins have been compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, a comparison of their efficacy in the presence or absence of pulmonary embolism (PE) has not been studied. We estimated the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin vs UFH in patients with proximal DVT with/without symptomatic PE using a meta-analysis of individual data from randomized controlled trials.

Design and Setting

Randomized controlled trials were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, abstracts from international meetings on venous thromboembolism (VTE), previous meta-analyses, and trial data provided by the sponsor.

Participants

For inclusion, randomized controlled trials had to be properly randomized; include patients with objectively diagnosed DVT; compare enoxaparin twice daily with UFH; use objective methods to assess recurrent symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and death at 3 months; and include blind evaluation of clinical events.

Measurements

A meta-analysis was performed using the logarithm of the relative risk (RR) method. Enoxaparin in DVT treatment with/without symptomatic PE was considered noninferior to UFH for preventing VTE at 3 months if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the RR (enoxaparin/UFH) was lower than a prespecified noninferiority margin (1.61). No increase in major bleeding or mortality should be observed.

Results

The meta-analysis included individual data from three randomized controlled trials (749 patients and 754 patients in the enoxaparin and UFH groups, respectively). The observed RR (enoxaparin/UFH) of VTE was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.52 to 1.26) for the intention-to-treat population (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.13; for per-protocol analysis). Results did not differ for patients with clinical PE (235 patients; RR, 0.84) and without clinical PE (1,268 patients; RR, 0.71), with a nonsignificant heterogeneity test between groups (p = 0.76). A trend in favor of enoxaparin was observed for reduced mortality and major bleeding.

Conclusions

The efficacy and safety of enoxaparin vs UFH for DVT treatment is not modified by the presence of symptomatic PE.

### Enoxaparin followed by once-weekly idrabiotaparinux versus enoxaparin plus warfarin for patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism: a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority trial [^ee9796f0]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment of pulmonary embolism with low-molecular-weight heparin and vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, is not ideal. We aimed to assess non-inferiority of idrabiotaparinux, a reversible longlasting indirect inhibitor of activated factor X, to warfarin in patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism.

Methods

In our randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled adults with objectively documented acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism attending 291 centres in 37 countries. We excluded patients who were pregnant, had active bleeding, kidney failure, or malignant hypertension, or were at high risk of death, bleeding, or adverse reactions to study drugs. We randomly allocated patients to receive 5–10 days' enoxaparin 1·0 mg/kg twice daily followed by subcutaneous idrabiotaparinux (starting dose 3·0 mg) or adjusted-dose warfarin (target international normalised ratio 2·0–3·0); regimens lasted 3 months or 6 months dependent on clinical presentation. Block randomisation was done with a central interactive computerised system, stratified by study centre and intended treatment duration. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent venous thromboembolism at 99 days after randomisation. We estimated the odds ratio and 95% CI with a Mantel-Haenzsel χ(2) analysis (non-inferiority margin 2·0) in the intention-to-treat population. The main safety outcome was clinically relevant bleeding (major or non-major) in all patients at day 99. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00345618.

Findings

Between Aug 1, 2006, and Jan 31, 2010, we enrolled 3202 patients aged 18–96 years. 34 (2%) of 1599 patients randomly allocated to receive enoxaparin-idrabiotaparinux and 43 (3%) of 1603 patients randomly allocated to receive enoxaparin-warfarin had recurrent venous thromboembolism (odds ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·50–1·25; p(non-inferiority) = 0·0001). 72 (5%) of 1599 patients in the enoxaparin-idrabiotaparinux group and 106 (7%) of 1603 patients in the enoxaparin-warfarin group had clinically relevant bleeding (0·67, 0·49–0·91; p(superiority) = 0·0098). We noted similar differences in outcomes in those patients treated to 6 months.

Interpretation

Idrabiotaparinux could provide an attractive alternative to warfarin for the long-term treatment of pulmonary embolism, and seems to be associated with reduced bleeding.

In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a meta-analysis of 7 randomized clinical trials (n = 5154) comparing escalated-dose (intermediate- or full-dose) versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulation found stroke incidence 0.5% (11/2296) versus 0.5% (11/2195) with no significant differences (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.43–2.09]; P = 0%), and the primary outcome all-cause death was RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.78–1.18]. In the Stone et al randomized three-arm trial of noncritically ill patients, prophylactic-dose enoxaparin (n = 1141) versus full-dose enoxaparin (n = 1136) or full-dose apixaban (n = 1121) yielded a 30-day composite outcome of 1.32% versus 1.13% (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.69–1.04]; P = 0.11), with no stroke cases in the prophylactic-dose group and only 1 stroke case in the full-dose group.

Intravenous (Bolus) Injection Technique

Use the multiple-dose vial for intravenous injections. Administer enoxaparin sodium injection through an intravenous line. Do not mix or coadminister enoxaparin sodium injection with other medications. Flush the intravenous access device with a sufficient volume of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of enoxaparin sodium injection, to prevent mixing of drugs. Enoxaparin sodium injection is compatible with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water.

2.6 Monitoring for Safety

During therapy monitor complete blood counts including platelets and stool occult blood.

Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

In patients with renal impairment anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium injection.

If during enoxaparin sodium therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium injection [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium injection.

### Thromboprophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin versus standard of care in unvaccinated, at-risk outpatients with COVID-19 (ETHIC): an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^80d4624a]. The Lancet: Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Background

COVID-19 is associated with inflammation and an increased risk of thromboembolic complications. Prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin have been used in hospitalised and non-critically ill patients with COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) versus standard of care (no enoxaparin) in at-risk outpatients with COVID-19.

Methods

This open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial (ETHIC) was done at 15 centres in six countries (Belgium, Brazil, India, South Africa, Spain, and the UK). We consecutively enrolled participants aged at least 30 years who had not received a COVID-19 vaccine and had symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 in the outpatient setting plus at least one risk factor for severe disease. Within 9 days of symptom onset and by use of a web-based random block design (block size either 2 or 4), eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either subcutaneous enoxaparin for 21 days (40 mg once daily if they weighed < 100 kg and 40 mg twice daily if they weighed ≥ 100 kg) or standard of care (without enoxaparin). The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of all-cause hospitalisation and all-cause mortality at 21 days after randomisation and, in our main analysis, was analysed in the intention-to-treat population, which comprised all patients who were randomly assigned. Safety was also analysed in the intention-to-treat population for our main analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04492254, and is complete.

Findings

Following the advice of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, this study was terminated early due to slow enrolment and a lower-than-expected event rate. Between Oct 27, 2020, and Nov 8, 2021, 230 patients with COVID-19 were assessed for eligibility, of whom 219 were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive standard of care (n = 114) or enoxaparin (n = 105). 96 (44%) patients were women, 122 (56%) were men, and one patient had missing sex data. 141 (65%) of 218 participants with data on race and ethnicity were White, 60 (28%) were Asian, and 16 (7%) were Black, mixed race, or Arab or Middle Eastern. Median follow-up in both groups was 21 days (IQR 21–21). There was no difference in the composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalisation at 21 days between the enoxaparin group (12 [11%] of 105 patients) and the standard-of-care group (12 [11%] of 114 patients; unadjusted hazard ratio 1·09 [95% CI 0·49–2·43]; log-rank p = 0·83). At 21 days, two (2%) of 105 patients in the enoxaparin group (one minor bleed and one bleed of unknown severity) and one (1%) of 114 patients in the standard-of-care group (major abnormal uterine bleeding) had a bleeding event. 22 (21%) patients in the enoxaparin group and 13 (11%) patients in the standard-of-care group had adverse events. The most common adverse event in both groups was COVID-19-related pneumonia (six [6%] patients in the enoxaparin group and five [4%] patients in the standard-of-care group). One patient in the enoxaparin group died and their cause of death was unknown.

Interpretation

The ETHIC trial results suggest that prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin had no benefit for at-risk outpatients with COVID-19. Although the trial was terminated early, our data, combined with data from similar studies, provide further insights to inform international guidelines and influence clinical practice.

Data Extraction

The systematic review management tool Covidence was used to manage the review process. All results from Embase and Ovid Medline were loaded into Covidence, and all duplicates were removed. The title and abstract of each study were independently screened by 2 reviewers (SK and JSR), where disagreements over study inclusion or exclusion occurred, and this article was independently reviewed by a third reviewer (SN). The full-text screening was performed independently by 4 reviewers (MA, SK, JSR and SN) and studies meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were included in this review.

Three researchers (SK, JSR, and SN) then performed data extraction in Excel and extracted the following data: first author, research design, country, sample size, methods of patient recruitment, clinical baseline characteristics, dosing strategy, indication, follow-up period, safety, and outcomes data. Data extraction was independently checked (MA). The dose of enoxaparin was expressed as "mg" in all included studies. Although some jurisdictions use "IU" or "IU of anti-Xa activity" as dosing units, for consistency this review will use milligrams; 1 mg is equivalent to 100 IU of anti-Xa activity.

2.1 Pretreatment Evaluation

Evaluate all patients for a bleeding disorder before starting enoxaparin sodium injection treatment, unless treatment is urgently needed.

Abdominal Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 40 mg by subcutaneous injection once a day (with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by subcutaneous injection in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. Administer the initial dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery, provided that hemostasis has been established. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

A dose of enoxaparin sodium injection of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously may be considered for hip replacement surgery for up to 3 weeks. Administer the initial dose 12 (± 3) hours prior to surgery.

Medical Patients During Acute Illness

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 40 mg once a day administered by subcutaneous injection for medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness. The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis With or Without Pulmonary Embolism

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, who can be treated at home in an outpatient setting.

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered subcutaneously at the same time every day for inpatient (hospital) treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment).

In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, initiate warfarin sodium therapy when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of enoxaparin sodium injection). Continue enoxaparin sodium injection for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2 to 3). The average duration of administration is 7 days [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].
