## Question

why would TSH be elevated with normal T3 and T4 levels

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why TSH can be elevated while T3 and T4 remain normal, and how to interpret and manage that pattern. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal physiology of the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis and the log-linear TSH–free T4 relationship. Then, I should verify the formal definition of subclinical hypothyroidism and its pathophysiology. Next, I will review common and uncommon etiologies, including autoimmune thyroiditis, medications, obesity, and rare entities. After that, I need to check assay pitfalls and transient or non-thyroidal illness confounders. Finally, I will consider clinical significance, risk stratification, and evidence-based management, including when to treat versus observe and how to monitor over time.

> Let me first confirm the physiological basis. The pituitary senses small decrements in circulating free T4 via a log-linear inverse relationship, so even a modest fall in free T4 can produce a several-fold rise in TSH; this amplification explains why TSH becomes abnormal before free T4 falls below the reference interval, which is the biochemical rationale for an elevated TSH with normal T3/T4 early in thyroid failure [^112AZiH6] [^1138vdXP].

> I should confirm the definition next. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated serum TSH with normal free T4 (and usually normal T3), reflecting early or mild primary thyroid gland failure; importantly, this diagnosis presumes a stable axis and no recent severe illness, and it is typically categorized as mild when TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L and more significant when TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L, which carries higher risk of progression and cardiovascular associations [^111trvZ4] [^1129gwkb] [^11777Vu1].

> Now, let me consider the most common cause. Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's) is the leading etiology. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies are frequently present and mark increased risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism, with progression risk rising as TSH increases and when antibodies are positive, which aligns with population data and clinical series [^11777Vu1] [^1151QfPg].

> Wait, let me verify medication and transient contributors. Amiodarone can transiently raise TSH early via pituitary type 2 deiodinase inhibition, and lithium, interferon, and immune checkpoint inhibitors can impair thyroid function. Recovery or progression varies, so persistence beyond 3 months should prompt reassessment and consideration of therapy if TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L or symptoms are compelling [^113XpJMe] [^111trvZ4].

> I need to check non-thyroidal and obesity-related dynamics. In chronic kidney, liver, or heart disease, isolated TSH elevations often normalize over time and do not reliably indicate thyroid gland failure; similarly, obesity is associated with modest TSH elevations that tend to normalize with weight loss, so I should avoid over-calling "subclinical hypothyroidism" in these contexts unless the pattern persists and antibodies support autoimmunity [^111brCgr] [^111Ckemw] [^116KaxmC].

> Hold on, I should verify age-related physiology. TSH distribution shifts upward with aging, and many older adults with TSH 4.5–6.0 mIU/L revert to normal on follow-up. Randomized data in older adults with mild TSH elevations show no symptomatic benefit from levothyroxine, reinforcing a conservative, observe-first approach in the elderly unless TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L or symptoms are unequivocal [^113kszhz] [^11363Bwp] [^11777Vu1].

> But wait, what if the labs are misleading? I should double-check for assay interference and spurious results. Heterophilic antibodies, biotin supplementation, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and TSH or anti-T4 antibodies can distort immunoassays; repeating TSH and free T4 on an alternate platform, serial dilutions, or using equilibrium dialysis/ultrafiltration free hormone methods can clarify discordant results before labeling someone with subclinical disease [^114fiaqB] [^1172q5sC] [^114tE5SG].

> Let me think about rare but important mimics. Resistance to thyroid hormone beta presents with elevated free T4/T3 and inappropriately normal or mildly elevated TSH; distinguishing RTHβ from a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma may require TRH testing, T3 suppression, alpha-subunit, and pituitary imaging, and mislabeling these as "subclinical hypothyroidism" would be incorrect, so I should keep these in mind when free hormones are high with nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o] [^115N9GwJ] [^116AQ92d].

> I should confirm the clinical significance and thresholds. Mild TSH elevations (about 4.5–10 mIU/L) are often asymptomatic and may remit spontaneously, whereas TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L is associated with dyslipidemia and higher progression risk. Symptoms attributable to subclinical hypothyroidism are subtle at best, and large reviews conclude that treatment benefits are uncertain in mild disease but more compelling when TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L or when symptoms and antibodies coexist [^111trvZ4] [^11777Vu1] [^1151QfPg].

> Next, I should review management principles. Observation with repeat TSH and free T4 in 3–6 months is reasonable for TSH < 10 mIU/L, especially if asymptomatic. Treatment with levothyroxine is generally recommended for TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, for symptomatic patients (younger or middle-aged), in pregnancy or preconception, and when goiter or positive TPO antibodies are present. In older adults, many experts favor a higher treatment threshold and slower titration to avoid overtreatment and iatrogenic hyperthyroidism [^111trvZ4] [^1151QfPg] [^11777Vu1].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and targets. After initiating levothyroxine, I should recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks and adjust the dose to a TSH in the reference range, recognizing that in older adults a slightly higher TSH target may be acceptable; I need to ensure assay timing is consistent, avoid biotin around testing, and remember that TSH can lag after thyroid status changes, so free T4 may be informative early in therapy or in central hypothyroidism contexts [^114fiaqB] [^116NZHCj] [^113Fad1b].

> Let me reconsider the core question to ensure coherence. TSH rises out of proportion to small decreases in free T4 because of the log-linear feedback sensitivity of the pituitary; thus, an elevated TSH with normal T3/T4 most often represents early autoimmune thyroid failure (subclinical hypothyroidism), but I must exclude transient causes, assay artifacts, medications, obesity, and systemic illness, and tailor management to TSH magnitude, antibody status, symptoms, age, and pregnancy plans before committing to lifelong therapy [^113Fad1b] [^111trvZ4] [^11777Vu1].

TSH can be high with normal T3/T4 because the pituitary is **more sensitive to small drops in thyroid hormone** than peripheral tissues, so TSH rises before T3/T4 fall — the defining pattern of **subclinical hypothyroidism** [^112AZiH6] [^111trvZ4]. This early rise reflects **early thyroid failure** (most often autoimmune) [^11777Vu1], medication effects (e.g. amiodarone, lithium) [^113XpJMe], or assay interference [^114fiaqB]; T3/T4 remain normal because the gland can still meet basal demand, but not fully suppress TSH [^111w8THM]. Confirm with **repeat TSH/FT4**, check **TPOAb**, and review drugs; treat if TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L or if symptomatic with positive antibodies [^112MTEEc] [^114xt31k].

---

## Physiological basis of elevated TSH with normal T3/T4

- **TSH sensitivity**: The pituitary is more sensitive to small changes in thyroid hormone than peripheral tissues, so TSH rises before T3/T4 fall [^112AZiH6].

- **Log-linear relationship**: Small decreases in FT4 cause large increases in TSH, explaining why TSH is often the first abnormality in early thyroid failure [^112AZiH6].

- **Early thyroid failure**: The thyroid can still meet basal demand, keeping T3/T4 normal, but not enough to fully suppress TSH [^11777Vu1].

## Common causes of elevated TSH with normal T3/T4

| **Category** | **Specific causes** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Autoimmune thyroid disease | Hashimoto's thyroiditis | - Autoimmune destruction of thyroid tissue <br/> - Early/compensated hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1] |
| Medications | - Amiodarone <br/> - Lithium <br/> - Interferon-alpha | - Direct thyroid effects <br/> - Or immune modulation causing hypothyroidism [^113XpJMe] |
| Assay interference | - Heterophile antibodies <br/> - Biotin supplementation | Spurious TSH elevation due to assay cross-reactivity [^114fiaqB] |
| Nutritional deficiencies | Iodine deficiency | - Increased TSH drive <br/> - With normal T3/T4 early on [^notfound] |
| Genetic factors | - Thyroid hormone resistance <br/> - Polymorphisms in thyroid pathway genes | Altered sensitivity to thyroid hormone or its regulation [^116AQ92d] |

---

## Clinical significance and implications

- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: Defined by elevated TSH with normal FT4; prevalence up to 10% in adults, higher in women and older adults [^11777Vu1] [^1151QfPg].

- **Progression risk**: About 2–5% per year progress to overt hypothyroidism, higher with positive TPOAb or higher TSH [^11777Vu1] [^1151QfPg].

- **Symptoms**: Often mild or nonspecific (fatigue, weight gain, cognitive changes) but may be absent [^11777Vu1].

- **Cardiometabolic risk**: Associated with dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and possibly cardiovascular events, especially when TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L [^11777Vu1] [^1151QfPg].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Confirm persistence**: Repeat TSH and FT4 in 3–6 months to confirm the pattern [^116XK1nC].

- **Assay interference**: Rule out heterophile antibodies or biotin use; consider alternate platforms or dilution studies [^114fiaqB].

- **Autoimmunity**: Measure TPOAb to assess autoimmune etiology and progression risk [^1151QfPg].

- **Medication review**: Identify drugs that may elevate TSH (e.g. amiodarone, lithium) [^113XpJMe].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound if goiter or nodules are suspected; not routine without clinical clues.

---

## Management considerations

Treatment is generally indicated for **TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L** or for **TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L** with symptoms, positive TPOAb, or cardiovascular risk factors [^1151QfPg] [^111trvZ4]. Levothyroxine is first-line; monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually. Observation is reasonable for **mild, asymptomatic cases** with negative antibodies and no progression risk, with periodic reassessment [^1151QfPg].

---

## Special populations and considerations

In **pregnancy**, subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with adverse outcomes; treat when TSH exceeds trimester-specific limits [^113M6tvK] [^114xt31k]. In **elderly patients**, TSH reference ranges shift upward with age; use age-specific ranges and individualize treatment to avoid overtreatment [^113kszhz] [^112Rdy9U]. In **children**, subclinical hypothyroidism is less common; monitor growth and development closely and treat if symptomatic or TSH is persistently elevated [^112Wvvia].

---

Elevated TSH with normal T3/T4 most often reflects **early thyroid failure** or assay issues; confirm persistence, assess autoimmunity and medications, and treat if TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L or if symptomatic with positive antibodies.

### Is total thyroxine better than free thyroxine during pregnancy? [^113M6tvK]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aims were to establish a gestational-age specific curve for serum total thyroxine (T4) levels and to compare pregnancy outcomes of euthyroid women with those identified to have subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) defined by an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level in conjunction with either total T4 or free T4 determinations.

Study Design

Over a 2.5 year period, serum thyroid analytes were measured in all women presenting for prenatal care. After exclusion of women with overt thyroid disorders, the normal distribution of serum total T4 levels were determined by quantile curves for those screened in the first 20 weeks and who were delivered of a singleton infant weighing at least 500 g. Pregnancy outcomes for women with an elevated TSH and normal total T4 concentrations were analyzed and compared with those of women identified to have SCH defined by normal free T4 levels.

Results

Of 17,298 women tested, serum total T4 increased into the second trimester and plateaued around 16 weeks. The upper threshold for total T4 ranged from 12.6 to 16.4 μg/dL, and the lower threshold ranged from 5.3 to 8.0 μg/dL. Women identified to have SCH defined by serum free T4, total T4, or both were at risk for preterm delivery (P = .007) and placental abruption (P = .013) when compared with euthyroid women.

Conclusion

When combined with elevated TSH levels, free or total T4 determinations are equally sensitive to identify women with SCH who are at increased risk for preterm birth and placental abruption when compared with euthyroid women.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^113XpJMe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Approach to Diagnosis

Considering the clinical context is helpful when evaluating a patient with discordant thyroid function. For instance, objective abnormalities (eg, goiter, clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, increased uptake on thyroid isotope scan) can suggest that the observed biochemical hyperthyroidism is genuine. Sedation with chloral hydrate (often undertaken in children) prior to blood sampling is a recognized cause of transient, reversible hyperthyroxinemia. Potential confounding factors, including altered physiological states (eg, pregnancy), intercurrent illness or concurrent medication should be considered (also reviewed in detail in).

Amiodarone Therapy

Changes in TFTs are almost universal in amiodarone-treated patients, with 2% to 24% developing overt thyroid dysfunction. The drug inhibits TH biosynthesis and pituitary type 2 deiodinase activity, prompting an initial rise in circulating TSH (1 week after commencement), which typically normalizes by 12 weeks. Subsequently, the drug blocks hepatic, type 1 deiodinase activity, inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3 and breakdown of reverse T3, resulting in a TFT profile of raised/high normal T4, low/low-normal T3, and markedly elevated reverse T3. This pattern may be evident as early as 2 weeks after commencement of treatment and can persist after drug withdrawal, with the changes in TFTs being dose dependent. Due to inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion, patients with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism may require T4 replacement in supraphysiologic dosage to normalize TSH and therefore exhibit concurrently raised FT4 and TSH levels.

Nonthyroidal Illness

Prolonged or severe critical illness is often associated with abnormal TFTs; typically, circulating FT3 and FT4 fall (usually to low-normal levels), reverse T3 rises, and TSH values are low or low-normal. The degree of excursion in hormones is related to illness severity. Recovery is heralded by a rise in TSH with subsequent normalization of T4 and T3. Notably, changes in TFTs are not restricted to critical illness, with a low FT3, raised TSH and FT4 pattern being recorded in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery and in the weeks following myocardial infarction.

Acute Psychiatric States

True hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis can be associated with psychiatric abnormalities. Conversely, transient hormonal changes (typically elevated circulating FT4 with nonsuppressed TSH) are seen in patients (∼15%) admitted with acute psychiatric states, with this pattern being short lived, reversible, and not associated with a particular psychiatric condition.

Thyroid hormone testing — triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is positioned as follows: Many laboratories prefer total triiodothyronine (TT3) rather than free triiodothyronine (fT3) because of concerns about fT3 immunoassay reliability; in hypothyroidism, T3 can remain within the reference interval, so T3 measurement in suspected hypothyroidism or with increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is of limited clinical value; in hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4 and T3 analysis can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH; in nonthyroidal illness, a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark and T3 measurement is unlikely to be diagnostically relevant; however, it can be useful in patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease to help distinguish hyperthyroidism from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or identify coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — free T4 assessment, L-thyroxine timing, and pregnancy testing: A subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to establish hypothyroidism (primary with elevated TSH or central with normal/low TSH), and in previously hyperthyroid patients treated with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioiodine it is the primary test when TSH may remain low. For patients on L-thyroxine, blood for free T4 should be collected before dosing because levels increase by up to 20% after administration; in athyreotic patients, total T4 rose by 1 hour, peaked at 2.5 hours, while free T4 peaked at 3.5 hours and stayed above baseline for 9 hours. In pregnancy, measurement of serum total T4 is recommended over direct immunoassay of free T4; many patients have third-trimester free T4 values below nonpregnant ranges, and total T4 increases in the first trimester with the reference range ~1.5-fold the nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy. Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism.

True Biochemical Hyperthyroidism With Nonsuppressed TSH

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4

Thyroxine therapy, including with poor compliance

Variable compliance with T4 therapy in hypothyroidism can cause a biochemical pattern of normal or elevated FT4 and raised TSH concentrations. In this context, a seemingly appropriate increase in thyroxine dosage (perhaps to a supraphysiological level) can normalize TSH levels but be associated with concomitantly elevated circulating THs, raising the possibility of underlying RTHβ. Distinguishing this clinical situation from true coincidence of RTHβ with autoimmune hypothyroidism (which occurs rarely), is discussed further below.

Separate to this, it is also recognized that a subset of hypothyroid patients, compliant with thyroxine therapy in physiological dosage, can exhibit raised circulating FT4 but normal FT3 and TSH concentrations. This phenomenon has been attributed to diminished activity of type 2 deiodinase, reducing the generation of T3 (from its T4 precursor) that is available to inhibit pituitary TSH secretion.

Deficiency of selenocysteine-containing proteins, including deiodinase enzymes

Over 25 human proteins, including the thyroid deiodinase enzymes, contain the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). The incorporation of Sec into selenoproteins during their translation is dependent on a unique cellular pathway that includes its own transfer RNA (Sec-tRNA (Ser)Sec, encoded by TRU-TCA1–1) and a protein (SECIS binding protein 2, encoded by SECISBP2), which binds a specific sequence (SElenium Cysteine Insertion Sequence [SECIS]) located in the 3′-untranslated region of all selenoprotein mRNAs. Biallelic mutations in SECISBP2 cause a rare multisystem disorder, often presenting in childhood with growth retardation and developmental delay. Diminished activity of deiodinase enzymes and low circulating selenoproteins cause a distinctive biochemical signature of raised FT4, normal or low FT3, normal or raised TSH, elevated reverse T3 and low circulating selenium concentrations in all patients (Table 4); this biochemical pattern has also been documented in 2 patients with selenoprotein deficiency due to a homozygous nucleotide substitution in TRU-TCA1–1.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^1138vdXP]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

### Thyroid and aging [^113bqae9]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Review physiologic thyroid function changes with aging and emphasize careful interpretation of tests in the aging population.

Methods

Literature review.

Results

Using age-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference ranges should minimize or avoid the unnecessary diagnosis of thyroid disease in elderly patients. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and abnormal TSH with normal thyroid levels may improve with time, so careful monitoring of thyroid function is recommended. Overt thyroid disease should always be treated.

Conclusion

Clinical judgement is always warranted to decide how and when to treat subclinical thyroid disease in the elderly.

### Thyroid hormone action and liver disease, a complex interplay [^114ieU4W]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

These observations have provided the rationale for therapeutic interventions with TH in preclinical models of NAFLD, as well a small clinical trial which showed that low-dose levothyroxine (synthetic T4) administration resulted in a significant reduction in hepatic fat content from baseline.

Observational and meta-analysis data linked TH and NAFLD. Several studies have investigated the association between either subclinical (ie, elevated TSH with normal TH levels) or overt hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with subnormal TH levels) and NAFLD. Data are conflicting: some studies indicated that hypothyroidism, mainly subclinical, was common, occurring in ~25% of the individuals with imaging-defined or biopsy-proven NAFLD, other studies, however, failed to identify a significant association between hypothyroidism and NAFLD. In a large population-based cohort study conducted on 3144 euthyroid subjects, Chen et alfound positive associations of fT3 levels and fT3/fT4 ratios with NAFLD in euthyroid women but not in euthyroid men.

In addition, a study conducted in children with obesity and NAFLD showed that adolescents with hepatic steatosis had elevated values for fT3/fT4 ratio. This finding is consistent with peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 due to increased deiodinase activity as a compensatory mechanism to increase energy expenditure to prevent excessive fat accumulation. Conversely, it is also possible that the shift to the right of the thyroid axis is driven by the adiposity resulting in elevated leptin levels, which in turn stimulate the hypothalamic release of TRH ultimately stimulating the thyroid axis. A significant positive relationship between TSH levels and hepatic steatosis, independent of age, sex, and stage of puberty was also observed in euthyroid severely obese children and adolescents. Higher TSH levels were associated with a greater degree of fatty infiltration, emphasizing the possible significance of subclinical hypothyroidism as a predictor of metabolic comorbidity. Collectively, the human data do not demonstrate whether the changes in circulating TH observed in NAFLD are causative or rather the consequence of obesity, which is associated per se with NAFLD.

The axiom that hypothyroidism is associated with fatty liver has been partly challenged by recent mouse model data. Experimental observations indicate that mice develop NAFLD when TH levels are mildly reduced but, counterintuitively, not when there is a severe reduction of TH levels. The disease process of hypothyroidism-induced NAFLD therefore appears to involve both intrahepatic and extrahepatic factors, with important differences between mild (subclinical) and severe hypothyroidism. Future mechanistic and clinical studies are needed clarify this emerging concept.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^115N9GwJ]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114PrnPb]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy-related thyroid function test interpretation describes that serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy, especially in gestational weeks 9–13, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit of normal for TSH in the pregnant population can be used. Free T4 and T3 measured in an equilibrium dialysis or an ultrafiltrate of serum may be slightly higher (5%–10%) than nonpregnancy values early in gestation, then gradually decrease so that late third trimester values are lower than in nonpregnant women. Serum total T4 and T3 reference ranges increase at a rate of 5% of nonpregnant values per week over the 10-week period of gestation weeks 7–16, after which this 50% increase stabilizes and reference range limits remain 1.5 times above nonpregnancy ranges over the remaining weeks of pregnancy.

### Evaluation and follow-up of clinically euthyroid children with normal free T4 and suppressed TSH [^1156QMVU]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

Although subnormal TSH between 0.1–0.4 mIU/L is fairly common and benign, suppression of TSH to < 0.1 mIU/L with normal free T4 is less common and more worrisome. We have conducted a retrospective chart review of a collection of such cases and have summarized the features and outcome on follow up.

Methods

We studied 23 consecutive patients referred from 2005–07 to our pediatric endocrine clinic with TSH < 0.1 mIU/L and free T4 in the range of 0.8–2 ng/dl. We collected historical, clinical and laboratory data, and analyzed their outcome.

Results

The natural evolutions of these subjects were separated into 4 groups. Group 1, 14 subjects, (61%) became euthyroid within a mean of 3.7 months. Group 2, 4 subjects, (17%) became hypothyroid within a mean of 2.8 months. Group 3, 2 subjects (9%) progressed to overt hyperthyroidism. Group 4, 3 subjects (13%) had persistently suppressed TSH, 8–14 months after initial testing, of which one had a multinodular goiter and had a thyroidectomy. Elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO) was seen in 54.5% of those tested.

Conclusion

Only 2/23 in our series became overtly hyperthyroid. Substantial number of subjects had a short period of transient TSH suppression that resolved spontaneously. Markers suggestive of autoimmune thyroid disease were consistently seen in group 2 and less so in others. It is prudent to observe such cases in the short term with serial follow up TSH, free T4 and T3, and to reserve further testing and treatment for those who become symptomatic or do not resolve.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mVjnY]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid function testing (1,23) are based on the measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Patients are therefore classified as having euthyroidism (normal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), overt thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), subclinical thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH/normal thyroid hormone levels), and isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia (normal TSH/abnormal thyroid hormone levels).

This classification of thyroid function is based on the concept of TSH levels being the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function such that subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently defined is believed to be more significant than isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia, as indicated by the alternative term for the latter, "euthyroid hyper/hypothyroidism".

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common and comprises most cases of thyroid dysfunction with a population prevalence of ∼5%, increasing to 15% in older adults. Even though it is generally asymptomatic or associated only with non-specific symptoms, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with many adverse outcomes across a variety of organ systems. Therefore, despite the lack of convincing evidence of significant benefit, treatment for subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been recommended in certain circumstances.

It has previously been suggested by some authors that the earlier definition of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is overly simple and that its diagnosis should not be based solely on the TSH level being outside of a general population range. Rather, it is claimed that more accuracy may be achieved by defining a normal reference range for the combination of thyroid hormones and TSH.

However, any model whereby judgment of the thyroid status includes consideration of the TSH level is anomalous, in that the levels of other physiological parameters are not judged by the levels of their controlling hormones. For example, whether or not an individual has hypoglycemia or hypercalcemia is not determined by reference to insulin or parathyroid hormone levels, respectively. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, though helpful in diagnosing adrenal autonomy, are not considered diagnostic for Cushing's syndrome. In general, the level of a controlling hormone is used to determine the cause of a disturbance rather than identifying whether or not there is a disturbance.

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^112t6NpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

Regarding specific circumstances for thyroid hormone resistance, more specifically with respect to patients with resistance to thyroid hormone beta (management of hypothyroidism), ETA 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that elevated circulating TSH with normal free thyroid hormone concentrations in levothyroxine treatment of hypothyroidism (autoimmune or congenital) with coexisting resistance to thyroid hormone beta signifies under-replacement. Titrate levothyroxine therapy to achieve fT4 concentrations comparable to other family members (with resistance to thyroid hormone beta alone) or maintain concurrent high-normal thyroid stimulating-hormone and high free thyroid hormone concentrations, with monitoring of cardiac function to avoid overtreatment.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^116xmsiu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and persistently suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland with normal/high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake or by inflammation in the thyroid resulting in release of excess thyroid hormones and low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake. Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, causes symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and the skeletal systems, and increased mortality, whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism evolves to overt thyrotoxicosis, and whether or not it should be treated. The present report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based upon the literature and the authors' experience.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^1151wBvN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T3 and T3/T4 Ratio With Nonsuppressed TSH

Some acquired or genetic conditions can be associated with high-normal/high circulating FT3 and low-normal/low FT4 concentrations, computing to a raised T3/T4 ratio, with normal TSH levels.

Dyshormonogenesis

Iodine deficiency, typically caused by a restrictive diet with inadequate intake of this element, can result in low circulating FT4 with slightly increased FT3 (due to preferential production of T3 over T4) and normal TSH concentrations, with chronic deficiency causing goiter formation. Progressive goiter, normal TSH, and raised circulating FT3 or an elevated T3/T4 ratio has been reported in the context of mild, dyshormonogenic CH due to partial, loss of function mutations in thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin gene defects, with hypersecretion of T3 being attributed to increased thyroidal activity of pituitary type 2 deiodinase. Increased thyroidal deiodinase enzyme activity in cases of metastatic follicular or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer also mediates higher circulating FT3 concentrations and an elevated T3/T4 ratio.

Resistance to thyroid hormone α

Heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor α gene cause a disorder characterized by features of hypothyroidism, but associated with normal circulating TSH, low-normal/low FT4, high-normal/high FT3, and a raised T3/T4 ratio.

Monocarboxylate transporter 8 deficiency

Mutations in an X-linked gene (SLC16A2), encoding a membrane protein (MCT8) required for transport of THs into the central nervous system, cause a disorder (Allan–Herndon Dudley syndrome) with psychomotor retardation, elevated circulating FT3, low or low-normal FT4, and normal TSH concentrations.

Table 5 illustrates how entities sharing this pattern of TFTs can be differentiated, using a combination of clinical features and key biochemical measurements (eg, urinary iodine, serum thyroglobulin, and reverse T3).

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: a review [^1151QfPg]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated serum thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH) level with normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) affects up to 10% of the adult population.

Observations

Subclinical hypothyroidism is most often caused by autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. However, serum thyrotropin levels rise as people without thyroid disease age; serum thyrotropin concentrations may surpass the upper limit of the traditional reference range of 4 to 5 mU/L among elderly patients. This phenomenon has likely led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons older than 70 years. In patients who have circulating thyroid peroxidase antibodies, there is a greater risk of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease events, and mortality from coronary heart disease. In addition, middle-aged patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may have cognitive impairment, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, and altered mood. In the absence of large randomized trials showing benefit from levothyroxine therapy, the rationale for treatment is based on the potential for decreasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and the possibility of preventing progression to overt hypothyroidism. However, levothyroxine therapy may be associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, especially in elderly patients, and there is no evidence that it is beneficial in persons aged 65 years or older.

Conclusions and Relevance

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common and most individuals can be observed without treatment. Treatment might be indicated for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and serum thyrotropin levels of 10 mU/L or higher or for young and middle-aged individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism and symptoms consistent with mild hypothyroidism.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Subclinical but significant? updated review of pediatric hypothyroidism [^112Wvvia]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this review are to describe the rates of diagnosis of true thyroid disease (and subsequent treatment) in children with an elevated TSH referred to pediatric endocrinology, risk factors associated with elevated TSH secondary to thyroid disease, and TSH threshold level associated with thyroid disease.

Methods

To accomplish these aims, our team searched through four databases to curate 211 articles regarding TSH values in healthy children ages 1–18 years without an underlying risk for hypothyroidism.

Results

Five studies met our criteria and were analyzed to create the conclusions about rates of hypothyroidism requiring treatment (6.3–59%), risk factors to developing hypothyroidism (TSH > 10 mIU/L, goiter, and anti-thyroid antibodies), and high-risk TSH value (9.6 mIU/L when averaged among four studies).

Conclusions

The results are helpful in guiding practitioners about when to repeat TSH value before considering referral to endocrinology, when to refer, and when to anticipate the need of thyroid hormone replacement.

### Association between thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies [^115qw3iZ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that results from pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and peripheral insulin resistance. The worldwide prevalence is 9.1%, equating to 415 million adults suffering from the disease. T2DM is a complex disease arising from a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Recently, evidence has suggested that low circulating levels of thyroid hormone, even within the normal reference concentrations, may be related to an elevated risk of developing T2DM, especially within the prediabetes population.

Like diabetes, thyroid dysfunction results from dysregulated hormone secretion. Recent data from the Colorado Thyroid Disease Prevalence study showed that 9.5% of 25,862 participants had an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); conversely, 2.2% had low TSH. The thyroid hormone axis includes TSH, thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3), all of which are required to maintain the normal functioning of the thyroid. The imbalance of these hormones may lead to metabolic overactivity (hyperthyroidism; excess thyroid hormone) or underactivity (hypothyroidism; inadequate thyroid hormone). Based on the severity of the imbalance, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can be diagnosed as either clinical or subclinical, of which the latter is the more prevalent. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is commonly defined as having an abnormal TSH but normal T4 concentration. The presence or absence of symptoms may be independent of T4 levels. Despite being mild, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been linked to several complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease, and type 1 diabetes in children.

The clinical utility of TSH measurement — serum TSH is widely used for diagnosis and screening, with age-specific interpretation needs; in newborns < 3 days of age results are confounded by the postnatal surge, while in newborns 3 days to 1 month a serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally treated as a clinical cutoff requiring immediate action; primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency; in the elderly the upper bound of the TSH reference interval increases with age; interpretation leverages the log-linear relationship between TSH and free thyroxine (fT4) and must consider factors such as iodine intake, age, sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used.

4.4 Diagnosis

The biochemical hallmark of RTHβ comprises true (nonartefactual) hyperthyroxinaemia (raised T4 and T3) with non‐suppressed TSH levels (TSH is usually normal or slightly raised). However, this TH pattern can also be caused by other factors such as assay interference (e.g. antiiodothyronine or TSH antibodies, familial dysalbuminaemic hyperthyroxinaemia and displacement of TH from binding proteins) or a TSH‐secreting pituitary tumour. Distinguishing between these entities can be challenging, requiring further studies including biochemical analyses to exclude assay interference, dynamic endocrine investigation (e.g. TRH stimulation and T3 suppression testing) or pituitary imaging. Following exclusion of assay interference, ascertainment of similar and abnormal thyroid function tests in first degree relatives is suggestive (but certainly not diagnostic) of RTHβ. THRB sequencing is diagnostic in most patients and if a pathogenic variant is identified, genetic testing can be offered to first degree relatives with similar, abnormal TFTs. Increasingly, NGS identifies THRB variants of unknown significance; here, providing the variant THRB genotype cosegregates with abnormal thyroid function in families to establish pathogenicity, functional studies of THRB variants may not be necessary.

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

4) and total or free triiodothyronine levels. 1 Subclinical hyperthyroidism can be divided into two categories: low but detectable TSH and less than 0. 1 mIU per L. 4 and T 3 levels tend to be lower in persons with these conditions, whereas persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism may have free T 4 and T 3 levels in the mid to high reference range. Reassessment of TSH, free T 3, and free T 4 levels is appropriate after two to four months to evaluate whether low TSH is persistent and whether subclinical thyroid disease has progressed to overt hyperthyroidism. A suggested diagnostic approach is outlined in Figure 1.
2. 17 A meta-analysis of five prospective cohort studies evaluating a total of 8, 711 participants showed an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in those with TSH levels less than
0. 1 mIU per L and 0. 1 to
0. 44 mIU per L, 4 indicating that the risk of atrial fibrillation inversely correlates with TSH levels. 4 The highest risk was observed in patients with TSH levels less than 0. 1 mIU per L, in men, and in adults older than 65 years. Exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism due to excessive levothyroxine replacement was also associated with increased cardiovascular and overall mortality in patients with fully suppressed TSH levels compared with those with normal TSH levels.
5. When to Consider Treatment The ATA recommends treating patients with TSH levels persistently less than
0. 1 mIU per L if they are 65 years or older; if they are younger than 65 years and have heart disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism; or if they are postmenopausal, younger than 65 years, and not taking estrogen or bisphosphonates.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: deciding when to treat… [^112VJzEn]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Recommendations about thyroid screening, however, have been inconsistent. Currently, no organizations recommend routine universal screening. For example, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. 4) or free T 4 index. This state — an elevated TSH level with a normal free T. 4 level — is referred to as subclinical hypothyroidism. The term "subclinical" may not be strictly correct, since some of these patients may have clinical symptoms, but no better term has been proposed. The elevation of TSH levels reflects the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to small decreases in circulating thyroid hormone; as the thyroid gland fails, the TSH level may rise above the upper limit of normal when the free T 4 level has fallen only slightly and is still within the normal range. Clinical manifestations, if present, may be explained by assuming that a T 4 level of 6 or 7 μg per dL, although not outside the normal range of 4. 5 to
12.

5 μg per dL, may represent a significant fall from an original level of 9 or 10 μg per dL and, thus, is low for this particular patient. In short, it seems reasonable to treat patients who have a TSH level that is consistently elevated above 10 μU per mL, especially if titers of antithyroid antibodies are increased. Also, patients who complain of fatigue, dry skin, constipation, muscle cramps or other common symptoms of hypothyroidism may possibly benefit from treatment even if their TSH level is elevated only into the 5 to 10 μU per mL range. An algorithm summarizing this approach is presented in Figure 1. A common error is the failure to decrease the levothyroxine dosage if the TSH level is suppressed below the normal range, which may occur without the free T 4 level rising above normal.

This state is considered to represent "subclinical hyperthyroidism, " and although formerly it was thought to be harmless, it is now believed to be associated with undesired effects on bone density and cardiac function, and to be a possible cause of neuropsychologic symptoms and other mild manifestations of hyperthyroidism. 16, 17.

### The clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^1151xyer]. Endocrine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease (SCTD) is defined as serum free T(4) and free T(3) levels within their respective reference ranges in the presence of abnormal serum TSH levels. SCTD is being diagnosed more frequently in clinical practice in young and middle-aged people as well as in the elderly. However, the clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is much debated. Subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism can have repercussions on the cardiovascular system and bone, as well as on other organs and systems. However, the treatment and management of SCTD and population screening are controversial despite the potential risk of progression to overt disease, and there is no consensus on the thyroid hormone and thyrotropin cutoff values at which treatment should be contemplated. Opinions differ regarding tissue effects, symptoms, signs, and cardiovascular risk. Here, we critically review the data on the prevalence and progression of SCTD, its tissue effects, and its prognostic implications. We also examine the mechanisms underlying tissue alterations in SCTD and the effects of replacement therapy on progression and tissue parameters. Lastly, we address the issue of the need to treat slight thyroid hormone deficiency or excess in relation to the patient's age.

### Is an isolated TSH elevation in chronic nonthyroidal illness "subclinical hypothyroidism"? [^111brCgr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Elevated TSH with normal T4 frequently occurs with chronic kidney, liver, and heart diseases. Whether isolated TSH elevations represent mild thyroid gland failure has not been established.

Evidence Acquisition

PubMed was searched for longitudinal studies in chronic heart, liver, or kidney disease documenting persistent isolated TSH elevations or progression to overt hypothyroidism.

Evidence Synthesis

Four articles met inclusion criteria. In 16 end-stage renal failure patients, four had isolated TSH elevations. All normalized within 14 months. In 452 systolic heart failure patients, 20 had isolated TSH elevations, five of 20 were persistent, and none progressed to overt hypothyroidism within 6 months. In 207 untreated chronic hepatitis C patients, 12 had isolated TSH elevations and four had increased TSH with reduced free T4; all were female, and 14 had positive antithyroid antibodies. After 1 year, two of 12 developed "clinical hypothyroidism". In 72 chronic hepatitis C patients, nine females had positive antithyroid antibodies. Two antibody-negative patients had TSH 5–6 mU/L with reduced free T4. After 1 year, three of four with positive antithyroid antibodies and baseline TSH < 4 mU/L had elevated TSH with reduced free T4.

Conclusions

In chronically ill patients, there is inadequate evidence to determine: 1) that isolated TSH elevations usually persist or progress to overt hypothyroidism; 2) the etiology and clinical significance of isolated TSH elevations; and 3) whether levothyroxine therapy is indicated for persistent isolated TSH elevations. Thus, isolated TSH elevations in chronic renal, cardiac, or liver diseases have not been documented to indicate mild thyroid gland failure.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### Don't order a total or free triiodothyronine (T3) level when assessing… [^112eqRqg]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

T4 is converted into T3 at the cellular level in virtually all organs. Intracellular T3 levels regulate pituitary secretion and blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, as well as the effects of thyroid hormone in multiple organs; a normal TSH indicates an adequate T4 dose. Conversion of T4 to T3 at the cellular level may not be reflected in the T3 level in the blood. Compared to patients with intact thyroid glands, patients taking T4 may have higher blood T4 and lower blood T3 levels. Thus the blood level of total or free T3 may be misleading; in most patients a normal TSH indicates a correct dose of T4.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on subclinical hypothyroidism:

- Definition: Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum TSH levels with normal circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, indicating mild thyroid dysfunction. It is a biochemical diagnosis made through thyroid function testing and is most prevalent in women and older adults. The condition is graded as mild (TSH < 10 mU/L) or moderate (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L).
- Pathophysiology: Autoimmunity is the most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism.
- Epidemiology: Subclinical hypothyroidism affects up to 10% of adults in iodine-sufficient populations, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring more frequently in women. The condition is often transient, with many individuals reverting to normal thyroid function over time. Age-related increases in TSH levels without true thyroid disease may contribute to overestimation of its prevalence.
- Disease course: Subclinical hypothyroidism, particularly grade 1, is usually asymptomatic and rarely associated with classic hypothyroid or neuropsychiatric symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally mild and more likely in grade 2 disease, presenting as subtle memory or mood disturbances. In older adults, hypothyroid symptoms are often absent even in overt disease, and QoL is typically similar to that of euthyroid individuals. About 2.5% of patients progress to clinically overt hypothyroidism each year, with a higher rate of progression in patients with thyroid autoantibodies and higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Thyroid function normalizes spontaneously in up to 40% cases.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Subclinical hypothyroidism in younger patients (< 65 years of age) is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, HF and cerebrovascular accident.

Other endocrine alterations

Thyroid

Elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as a sign of disturbed thyroid function are regularly observed in individuals with obesity. Usually, thyroid hormone levels, T3 and T4 are within the normal range and weight loss results in normalization of the TSH levels. The situation is similar in children. The mechanisms are unclear but a modest and reversible obesity‐induced thyroid gland dysfunction or an increased turnover of thyroid hormones might contribute. Elevated TSH among children with obesity is associated with cardiometabolic markers in childhood and later cardiovascular disease. TSH may have other effects in the body beyond the stimulation of thyroid hormone production but based on the present knowledge, there are no signs of a causal association between increased TSH levels in childhood and later disease.

Vitamin D

Low vitamin D levels are often found in children with obesity. Vitamin D deficiency in childhood has been associated with the development of several diseases such as MS and prediabetes, that is, two conditions also associated with obesity. Whether supplementation of vitamin D affects T2D, prediabetes, and the metabolic syndrome has been investigated, but with contradictory results and the pathophysiological significance of vitamin D deficiency for the development of T2D is unclear. A large double‐blind intervention study in adults failed to identify any beneficial effect on glucose metabolism of vitamin D substitution whereas a modest effect has been noted in children and adolescents. Yet, most likely the association between vitamin D insufficiency and disturbed glucose metabolism in obesity is primarily due to that similar factors contribute to both low vitamin D levels and insulin resistance, that is, sedentary indoor life and unhealthy food intake.

The mechanisms behind low vitamin D levels are unknown. Both increased storage in the adipose tissue and increased metabolism have been proposed and it has been suggested that there is no true deficiency since the levels are low due to increased accumulation in the adipose tissue. It has also been suggested that the metabolism of vitamin D is disturbed. Vitamin D can be metabolized in the adipose tissue and the expression of 25‐hydroxylase CYP2J2 and the 1a‐hydroxylase CYP27B1 are decreased in subcutaneous adipose tissue from obese subject. But as mentioned, both indoor activities and poor eating habits probably contribute as well.

### The association between serum concentration of thyroid hormones and thyroid cancer: a cohort study [^1171CsQd]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The impact of serum thyroid hormone levels on thyroid cancer risk is unclear. Some studies reported that elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is associated with higher risk for incidence of thyroid cancer, but other studies reported no relationship. We conducted a large cohort study in 164,596 South Korean men and women who were free of thyroid cancer at baseline and underwent health examination with hormone levels of thyroid function. A parametric proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. During 2,277,749.78 person-years of follow-up, 1280 incident thyroid cancers were identified (men = 593, women = 687). Among men, the multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) for thyroid cancer comparing low levels of TSH with normal levels of TSH was 2.95 (1.67–5.23), whereas the corresponding HR (95% CI) in women was 1.5 (0.88–2.55). High levels of free T4 and free T3 were also associated with incident thyroid cancer in both men and women. In clinical implication, overt hyperthyroidism is associated with thyroid cancer in both men and women. Within the euthyroid range, the highest tertile of TSH was associated with a lower risk of thyroid cancer than the lowest TSH tertile and the highest FT4 tertile was associated with a higher risk of thyroid cancer than the lowest FT4 tertile in both men and women. Our finding indicates that low levels of TSH and high levels of FT4, even within the normal range, were associated with an increased risk of incident thyroid cancer.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood-current knowledge and open issues [^113yEN4h]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as serum levels of TSH above the upper limit of the reference range, in the presence of normal concentrations of total T 4 or free T 4. This biochemical profile might be an indication of mild hypothyroidism, with a potential increased risk of metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular disease recorded among adults. Whether subclinical hypothyroidism results in adverse health outcomes among children is a matter of debate and so management of this condition remains challenging. Mild forms of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism do not seem to be associated with impairments in growth, bone health or neurocognitive outcome. However, ongoing scientific investigations have highlighted the presence of subtle proatherogenic abnormalities among children with modest elevations in their TSH levels. Although current findings are insufficient to recommend levothyroxine treatment for all children with mild asymptomatic forms of subclinical hypothyroidism, they highlight the potential need for assessment of cardiovascular risk among children with this condition. Increased understanding of the early metabolic risk factors associated with subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood will help to improve the management of affected individuals.

Third generation thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) assays have emerged as the single most useful test of thyroid function, and are used widely and appropriately as a screening test. TSH measurement alone may be misleading in complicated patients and those undergoing treatment for thyroid dysfunction. Before obtaining thyroid function tests, clinicians need to consider whether the patient might have pituitary or hypothalamic disease or severe nonthyroidal illness, and whether assessment of the pituitary-thyroid axis reflects steady-state conditions. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with adverse effects on the skeleton and the heart, and is best assessed by measurement of serum TsH with a third-generation assay.

### Incidence and determinants of spontaneous normalization of subclinical hypothyroidism in older adults [^11363Bwp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

With increasing age, circulating levels of TSH generally rise, accompanied by a higher prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated TSH level while the serum free T4 (fT4) concentration is within the normal range. Several randomized controlled trials have shown that treatment of mild subclinical hypothyroidism in older adults does not improve clinical outcomes. Therefore, it has been suggested to reevaluate the reference range for TSH in older adults. To this end, we need to further explore the natural course of subclinical hypothyroidism in older adults. Interestingly, several studies in adults have shown that subclinical hypothyroidism can spontaneously normalize. However, it is not known what the most important determinants are for spontaneous TSH normalization in older adults. Enhanced understanding of the natural history and factors contributing to normalization may help clinical decision making on the follow-up strategy.

In this longitudinal study, we aimed to investigate the incidence of spontaneous normalization of TSH levels and identify determinants of normalization in a large group of adults aged 65 years and older with (persistent) subclinical hypothyroidism. We combined individual participant level data from 2 randomized trials investigating the effect of levothyroxine treatment in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: the Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults With Subclinical Hypothyroidism Trial (TRUST) and Institute for Evidence-Based Medicine in Old Age (IEMO) trials. Because we were interested in spontaneous normalization, we only included the pretrial screening populations and the in-trial placebo groups of the 2 clinical trials.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Prognostic significance of low TSH concentration in patients with COVID-19 presenting with non-thyroidal illness syndrome [^115BUsEr]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

NTI refers to alterations in a thyroid test without thyroid lesions in individuals with acute or chronic non-thyroid diseases, and it has been reported in many diseases, such as fractures, major trauma, cardiac surgery, meningococcal septic shock, community-acquired pneumonia, kidney disease, lymphocytic leukemia, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. NTI is characterized by decreased T3 levels and no elevation in TSH levels, always with increased rT3 levels. High, normal or low T4 levels, as well as low or normal TSH levels, have been observed in patients with NTI, but the corresponding proportions were unclear. In this study, most the included patients with COVID-19 presenting low FT3 levels had normal FT4 and TSH levels, and then 14% had normal FT4 levels and decreased TSH levels. Although the lung is the key lesioned organ, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to invade humans, is expressed at a high level in the thyroid. Many cases of subacute thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported. Presumably, NTI was combined with thyrotoxicosis in some patients with COVID-19, especially in those with low FT3 and elevated FT4 levels.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

### The change in thyroid function categories with time in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ByBkX]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a form of thyroid dysfunction where the serum levels of thyroxine (T4) and/or triiodothyronine (T3) are within the reference range, while the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is slightly elevated. The etiology of SCH is complex and can be induced by autoimmune diseases, surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, iodine excess, and medication. Since SCH is often asymptomatic, it is frequently discovered incidentally during routine blood tests or other disease screenings. However, due to significant fluctuations in TSH levels, it usually requires 2–3 months to repeat measurements of TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) to confirm the diagnosis. Due to the lack of specific clinical manifestations of this disease, a considerable number of patients can maintain good physical condition even without treatment, and only a small number of SCH patients may progress to overt hypothyroidism (OH). Even if it does not progress to OH, many research suggested that the disease is also related to cardiovascular symptoms, dyslipidemia, cognitive impairment and depression. For most patients, we cannot currently determine the outcome of their disease. Therefore, it is essential to identify risk factors for disease progression and implement specific management strategies for patients with different levels of risk.

According to previous studies, patients with SCH mainly exhibit three outcomes: return to euthyroidism (EU), persistent SCH, and progression to OH or experiencing significant hypothyroidism-related symptoms. Therefore, we attempt to elucidate the occurrence of three different outcomes in SCH patients who have not been treated by L-T4 and summarize the research data in the original literature to stratify the patients as much as possible to clarify the impact of age, TSH level, thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), and gender on the prognosis of patients with SCH.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TH MEASUREMENTS COMPLEMENTING INTERPRETATION OF THE PRIMARY PARAMETER TSH

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease as a consequence of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval as this allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical, and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in a number of clinical situations (Table 2) such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome,), and the initial treatment of hypo-or hyperthyroidismas the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Table 2.
Common Physiological and Pharmacological Effects on the Biology of the Thyroid Hormone Axis

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, this term is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis. In addition, "thyroid function tests" are frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring, for example, primary congenital hypothyroidism. Table 3 describes rare causes of perturbation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

According to the current model, normalizing serum thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH) is generally considered the target of therapy, and serum T3 is typically not measured or monitored, and direct evidence on whether small decrements in plasma T3 have clinically important sequelae is lacking. Some data in humans suggest maintenance of serum T3 concentrations is clinically important; for example, in one study of 15 athyreotic patients taking LT4, a progressive 50% fall in T3 induced by PTU over 8 days led to a doubling of TSH even though T4 was constant.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^116jiqMd]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

### Defending plasma T3 is a biological priority [^112YExLJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Triiodothyronine (T3), the active form of thyroid hormone is produced predominantly outside the thyroid parenchyma secondary to peripheral tissue deiodination of thyroxine (T4), with < 20% being secreted directly from the thyroid. In healthy individuals, plasma T3 is regulated by the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis and by homoeostatic changes in deiodinase expression. Therefore, with the exception of a minimal circadian rhythmicity, serum T3 levels are stable over long periods of time. Studies in rodents indicate that different levels of genetic disruption of the feedback mechanism and deiodinase system are met with increase in serum T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, while serum T3 levels remain stable. These findings have focused attention on serum T3 levels in patients with thyroid disease, with important clinical implications affecting therapeutic goals and choice of therapy for patients with hypothyroidism. Although monotherapy with levothyroxine is the standard of care for hypothyroidism, not all patients normalize serum T3 levels with many advocating for combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. The latter could be relevant for a significant number of patients that remain symptomatic on monotherapy with levothyroxine, despite normalization of serum TSH levels.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood [^111qrnmf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is defined as an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in association with a normal total or free thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3). It is frequently encountered in both neonatology and general paediatric practice; however, its clinical significance is widely debated. Currently there is no broad consensus on the investigation and treatment of these patients; specifically who to treat and what cut-off level of TSH should be used. This paper reviews the available evidence regarding investigation, treatments and outcomes reported for childhood SH.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^114rAP4D]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association/AACE — Thyroid function testing during pregnancy — diagnostic interpretation is as follows: Serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy; therefore, low serum TSH with normal free T4 in early pregnancy does not indicate abnormal thyroid function, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit for TSH in the nonpregnant population can be used. Serum total T4 and T3 increase in early pregnancy and, from the late first trimester, reference ranges are close to 1.5 times nonpregnancy ranges during the second and third trimesters. Total T4 and T3 may be combined with a T3 uptake test or TBG measurements to create "free T4 index" or "TBG adjusted T4", which may be useful for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, but trimester-specific normal reference ranges should be established for each individual test and assay used. The reliability of automated analog-based free T4 and free T3 assays has been questioned, and method-specific reference ranges for each trimester of pregnancy should be employed by the manufacturer.

Conclusions — practice implications and laboratory–clinician interface: over the past five decades, testing for TSH and thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) has greatly improved in selectivity and sensitivity. Physicians and laboratorians must understand the limitations of TH measurement, and there is a need for a stronger laboratory–clinician interface. Laboratories often receive requests missing clinical and pharmacological information; the laboratory should educate physicians regarding test limitations and interpretations and should notify physicians before changing methods and reference ranges. Standardization, quality, performance, and harmonization of assays (TSH, T4, T3) need to be maintained and improved to enable exchange, application, and interpretation of test results within clinical standards.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### Interpretation of thyroid function tests [^114Ub1fK]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: a review of the clinical literature [^117EwFyN]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper) is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by a decreased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. Because SCHyper can be resolved, it is recommended to repeat serum TSH, T3, and T4 concentrations in 3 to 6 months before confirming a diagnosis of SCHyper to consider treatment. Proposed grading systems distinguish between mild (TSH, 0.1–0.4 mIU/L) and severe SCHyper (TSH, < 0.1 mIU/L) and are used alongside patients' age and the presence of risk factors and symptoms to guide treatment. Appropriate evaluation includes an investigation of the underlying cause and assessment of an individual's risk factors to determine the necessity and type of treatment that may be recommended. SCHyper may be associated with increased risks of cardiovascular-related adverse outcomes, bone loss, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Treatment may include observation without therapy, initiation of antithyroid medications, or pursuit of radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery. Considerations for treatment include the SCHyper etiology, anticipated long-term natural history of the condition, potential benefits of correcting the thyroid dysfunction, and risks and benefits of each treatment option. The purpose of this overview is to provide a guide for clinicians in evaluating and managing SCHyper in the routine clinical practice.

### Increases in thyrotropin within the near-normal range are associated with increased triiodothyronine but not increased thyroxine in the pediatric age group [^115F1bwk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

TSH has been shown in vitro to increase conversion of T4 to T3 and to preferentially increase thyroidal T3 secretion. Whether or not these effects are significant in vivo, other than in obesity, is unclear.

Objective

To test whether the incremental relationships between free T4 (FT4), free T3 (FT3), and TSH are compatible with TSH enhancement of a preferential increase in serum FT3.

Design and Setting

A large database of pediatric and adolescent thyroid test results drawn in community clinics from children and adolescents without known thyroid disease was analyzed.

Patients and Methods

RESULTS of FT3, FT4, and TSH were studied anonymously. They were crossed with electronic charts to exclude a history of positive thyroid autoantibodies and use of thyroid hormone preparations, antithyroid medication, or drugs known to affect thyroid function. All samples from patients appearing more than once in the database were removed. After exclusions, 3276 samples remained. FT4, FT3, and the FT3/FT4 ratios were correlated with TSH for the entire group, and the same parameters were segregated by TSH quartile. RESULTS were stratified for body mass index and studied separately in a normal-weight subgroup.

Main Outcome Measures

Stepwise correlations of FT4, FT3, and FT3/FT4 ratios with TSH.

Results

There was a significant positive linear correlation of TSH with FT3 and FT3/FT4 ratios (R = 0.12; P < .0001 in both), but not with FT4.

Conclusion

Within the near-euthyroid range, increasing TSH levels are associated with increasing FT3 levels, without an increase in FT4. This provides in vivo support for TSH enhancing preferentially T3 production and/or secretion.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

Triiodothyronine (T3) measurement — clinical utility: Total triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is preferred over free T3 measurement, may be useful in the evaluation of patients with suppressed TSH levels, and is not helpful in the evaluation of patients with suspected hypothyroidism; total T3 measurement can be helpful in the management of patients on T4 and T3 combination therapy for the treatment of hypothyroidism, the monitoring of patients on suppressive doses of T4 for treatment of thyroid cancer, and the evaluation of patients on T4 treatment for hypothyroidism with suspected T4 to T3 conversion defects; in Graves' disease, alterations of T3/T4 ratio can be helpful in identifying patients whose disease may remit.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and the risk of cancer incidence and cancer mortality: a systematic review [^112FCgkz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The relationship between thyroid function and cancer has been a subject of debate for more than 200 years, with studies showing conflicting results. In vitro studies have shown that thyroid hormones not only regulate body metabolism but they also play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation in normal tissues. Thyroid hormones consist of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which is the active form of the thyroid hormone. Both enter cells via transporter proteins whereby T4 becomes converted to T3 by deiodinases. T3 subsequently binds to thyroid hormone receptors, which then forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to induce transcription of a number of target genes with thyroid response elements.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a form of thyroid dysfunction that is highly prevalent, with a reported prevalence of 5 to 10% of the population worldwide. SCH is defined by elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal T4 levels. Given that the T4 level is within normal range, patients with SCH usually do not experience hypothyroid symptoms. However, given that studies have shown an increased risk of heart failure associated with SCH whereby the TSH levels are > 10 mIU/L, it is recommended that patients with SCH and this extent of TSH elevation receive levothyroxine replacement. Currently, there is no consensus as to whether patients with SCH with a TSH level of < 10mIU/L should be treated with levothyroxine as there is uncertainty regarding the clinical benefits of therapy in these cases. According to some studies, less than 50% of patients with SCH receive hormone replacement.

Given that thyroid hormone has been shown to play a role in cancer pathogenesis, further studies assessing the association between thyroid dysfunction and its effects on carcinogenesis are needed. This is particularly true for SCH, where the clinical benefits of levothyroxine treatment are unclear. The objective of this study is therefore to determine the influence of thyroid dysfunction, namely SCH, on cancer incidence and cancer mortality via systematic review of the evidence available to date.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^114xt31k]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Discordant test results between thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine or triiodothyronine levels can lead to unnecessary follow-up, patient anxiety, and increased health care costs without clinical benefit. The US Preventive Services Task Force states that there is insufficient evidence for screening asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults for thyroid disease. 7 Given the risks of unnecessary treatment and overtreatment, it is critical to use a patient-centered approach. When should thyroid function tests be performed, and when should they be avoided. For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained.

1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. 8 Measuring TSH levels is also recommended as the first-line test for pregnant patients with a personal or family history of thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes, or a clinical concern for thyroid disease. In pregnant patients with hypothyroidism, TSH levels should be maintained between the trimester-specific lower limit and 2. 5 mIU/L, and TSH measurement should be obtained every 4 to 6 weeks to ensure appropriate levels of levothyroxine.
8. When treating primary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine dosing should be adjusted based on normalizing TSH and not free T 4 levels. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is recommended if TSH is greater than 10 mIU/L or thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated. 1 A previous American Family Physician article discusses dosing recommendations for hypothyroidism.
1.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels. TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111t4S1w]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Thyroid disease — biochemical characterization of hypothyroidism and resistance: Hypothyroidism is characterized by the relative or absolute reductions in serum levels of thyroxine (T4), and serum levels of total or free triiodothyronine (T3) are not reliable markers of hypothyroidism; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated in primary hypothyroidism but is typically low or inappropriately normal in central hypothyroidism due to pituitary (secondary) or hypothalamic (tertiary) disorders, and patients with generalized thyroid hormone resistance usually have high concentrations of T3 and T4 with inappropriately normal or elevated TSH and variable degrees of hypothyroid and hyperthyroid symptoms.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^115izZ2e]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1143FMWs]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism in adults — therapeutic endpoints and TSH targets indicate that the most reliable therapeutic endpoint for primary hypothyroidism is the serum TSH value, since confirmatory total T4, free T4, and T3 lack sufficient specificity as stand-alone endpoints; when serum TSH is within the normal range, free T4 will also be normal, whereas T3 may be in the lower reference range and occasionally mildly subnormal. The normal TSH range with an upper limit of 4.12 mIU/L is largely based on NHANES III, but some propose an upper normal of 2.5 or 3.0 mIU/L because the distribution is skewed by values between 3.1 and 4.12 mIU/L and mean/median are approximately 1.5 mIU/L; however, measurements vary up to 50% above and below the mean, and setting 2.5 mIU/L as the upper normal could yield more than 10 million additional diagnoses per year in the United States without clear-cut benefit.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^117RSRDa]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction before or during pregnancy: Whether to universally screen for thyroid disease either before or during pregnancy remains controversial. Untreated overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are associated with adverse obstetrical and fetal outcomes. However, overt thyroid dysfunction is less common than subclinical dysfunction and is frequently identified by clinical assessment at the time of presentation. Thus, the most notable impact of a universal screening mandate for thyroid dysfunction would be the identification of the large proportion of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (mild elevations in serum TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels).

Thyroid hormone status discordance between pituitary and peripheral tissues — There are specific instances in which there appears to be discordance between the thyroid status of the pituitary gland, as reflected by serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and the status of other tissues indicated by biomarkers, and the clinical significance is not known. Mechanistic data indicate tissues can have variable tissue-specific thyroid status and that normalization of TSH does not ensure uniform triiodothyronine (T3) levels across tissues; animal and in vitro/rodent studies show primary changes in type 2 or type 3 deiodinase (D2 or D3) within a tissue can alter thyroid status without affecting circulating T3, thyroxine (T4), or TSH, with reports of relatively T3-deficient tissues despite the same plasma T3 and T4 and sometimes normal serum TSH; human studies have not been reported.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.
