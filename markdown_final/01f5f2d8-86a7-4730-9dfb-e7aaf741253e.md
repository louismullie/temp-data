## Question

Lee score for preoperative clearance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to use the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (Lee score) for preoperative clearance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the RCRI and its intended scope. Then, I should verify its performance characteristics and limitations across surgical subgroups. Next, I will examine alternative or enhanced models including biomarkers and intraoperative tools. After that, I need to check current guideline positions and any nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a practical workflow and a cautious, evidence-grounded recommendation for clinical use.

> Let me first confirm the RCRI structure and purpose. The RCRI assigns one point each for six binary factors: high-risk surgery, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-treated diabetes, and creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL, producing scores from 0 to 6 that historically map to approximate event risks of 0.4 percent, 1.0 percent, 2.4 percent, and 5.4 percent for 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more factors respectively, and it was designed for noncardiac surgical risk estimation, not for cardiac surgery, which I should explicitly avoid applying it to [^116PuBsn] [^114uzWkj] [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about performance without data. The best summary evidence suggests the RCRI has moderate discrimination overall for mixed noncardiac surgery populations with an AUC around 0.75 and performance drops for vascular cohorts with AUC near 0.64, so I should be careful about overreliance in high-risk surgical domains where calibration may be poorer and underestimation more likely [^116ha7oZ].

> I will now examine the high-risk vascular subgroup more closely. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of underestimation in vascular surgery because decisions often hinge here; prospective vascular cohorts show RCRI AUCs around 0.58 with systematic underestimation across risk strata, and even among patients with coronary disease heading to vascular procedures, preoperative coronary revascularization did not reduce 30-day death or MI across RCRI risk subsets, which tempers the impulse to escalate invasive preoperative strategies solely on clinical score strata [^112aWbki] [^112gXkxD] [^116ha7oZ].

> Next, I should review thoracic surgery, especially lung resection. The signal is consistent that both the generic RCRI and thoracic adaptations like the ThRCRI perform poorly in predicting postoperative cardiac complications after lung resection, with AUCs around 0.57 to 0.59, and prior recommendations to refer all asymptomatic lung resection candidates with more than three RCRI factors to cardiology are not well supported by these discrimination metrics, so I need to ensure expectations are appropriately calibrated in this domain [^111opXkg] [^115D4vGD] [^116y7do4].

> Let me consider aging and geriatric sensitivity, since I should confirm whether age modifies performance. Large population data show the RCRI's discrimination declines with advancing age, with C statistics falling toward 0.68 in the oldest patients, and geriatric-focused models such as GSCRI demonstrate better discrimination and calibration in older adults, outperforming RCRI and often Gupta MICA in geriatric cohorts, which means I should preferentially use elder-sensitive tools when age is a dominant risk driver [^111diPuQ] [^117FE5tP] [^114uzWkj].

> I need to check general conceptual limitations that might explain these deficits. The RCRI relies on binary variables that simplify complex physiology and does not incorporate functional status, ASA class, frailty, urgency, or detailed procedure granularity, while contemporary approaches emphasize broader covariates and better calibration to current practice patterns and case mix, which supports augmenting or substituting RCRI with models that include functional capacity and surgical specifics when possible [^117KK6QH] [^1153zk7a].

> Now, I will evaluate enhanced or alternative risk models. The Gupta MICA calculator includes age, ASA class, functional status, creatinine, and procedure type, and has shown superior discrimination compared with RCRI in multiple datasets, though I should double-check that calibration can degrade in geriatric samples, as noted in validation work; derivation and validation C statistics approached 0.88 in NSQIP-era datasets and exceeded RCRI's performance, while GSCRI specifically improves classification in older adults [^1153zk7a] [^114mCDTk] [^117FE5tP].

> But wait, what about simpler bedside expansions that capture frailty and anemia. The AUB-HAS2 index uses six readily available elements including history and symptoms of heart disease, age at least 75, anemia thresholds, vascular surgery, and emergency status, and has repeatedly outperformed RCRI across surgical subgroups while better identifying truly low-risk patients whose event rates are under 0.5 percent when the score is zero, which can pragmatically refine triage in clinic [^114P1rtN] [^116nTiKN] [^115rQC9u].

> Next, I should review biomarker-enhanced strategies since the field has shifted toward troponin and natriuretic peptides. The ESAIC 2023 focused guideline recommends considering routine preoperative troponin in addition to clinical risk scores to improve risk prediction and enable perioperative surveillance, and in vascular patients, BNP and NT-proBNP often outperform RCRI and render its clinical variables nonindependent when biomarkers are included, while meta-analytic work also supports incremental prognostic value from biomarkers over RCRI alone; emerging data even suggest polygenic risk scores may add small but significant incremental value when integrated with clinical and intraoperative variables [^112cVZFC] [^117TVai9] [^111AFSvm] [^112GH1XW] [^112Tx8Zp].

> I should also confirm whether intraoperative information can help re-estimate risk in real time. The Surgical Apgar Score, derived from blood loss, lowest mean arterial pressure, and lowest heart rate, meaningfully improves discrimination and reclassification for postoperative myocardial injury when added to preoperative RCRI, and it is a pragmatic bridge between preoperative estimates and actual intraoperative physiology for postoperative planning and monitoring [^111wXSpu] [^114KqUS8].

> Let me now reconcile guideline perspectives so I do not misstate endorsements. I initially thought the ESC and ESA jointly endorsed routine preoperative troponin in 2023, but wait, I should correct that: the ESC 2022 perioperative guideline emphasizes timely preoperative risk assessment and does not exclusively endorse RCRI, while the ESAIC 2023 focused guideline specifically recommends incorporating cardiac biomarkers such as troponin and BNP into perioperative risk pathways, and the CCS 2022 peripheral arterial disease guideline goes further by advising against using RCRI for peripheral arterial surgery, nudging clinicians toward vascular-specific approaches and biomarker use in that population [^115dqxGQ] [^112cVZFC] [^117TVai9] [^114AuZMr].

> With this, I should outline a practical, stepwise workflow while staying cautious about overtesting. I start with a baseline RCRI to anchor risk communication, then immediately contextualize by surgical category, age, and urgency while incorporating functional capacity or ASA class and considering an alternative calculator such as Gupta MICA, GSCRI in older adults, or AUB-HAS2 when RCRI seems miscalibrated to the case mix; if risk remains intermediate or high or discordant across tools, I add preoperative biomarkers such as high-sensitivity troponin and NT-proBNP to refine risk and guide perioperative monitoring, and I plan to re-estimate risk intraoperatively using the Surgical Apgar Score to inform telemetry, ICU triage, and postoperative troponin surveillance, documenting the combined numerical estimates and the shared decision-making used to clear or optimize the patient for surgery [^115dqxGQ] [^116QZ1Gq] [^111wXSpu] [^112cVZFC].

> Hold on, I should verify how I translate this into clearance recommendations. For low risk by RCRI corroborated by an alternative model and normal biomarkers, I would generally forgo further cardiac testing and proceed with standard monitoring, for intermediate risk I would consider baseline ECG, perioperative troponin surveillance, and step-up monitoring such as telemetry, and for high risk by score or elevated biomarkers I would involve cardiology, optimize guideline-directed medical therapy including beta-blockers and statins as appropriate, and plan higher-acuity postoperative care while recognizing that preoperative coronary revascularization rarely reduces 30-day events in stable patients heading to vascular surgery [^115dqxGQ] [^112cVZFC] [^112gXkxD].

> Finally, I should synthesize the bottom line without overpromising precision. The RCRI remains a useful and simple screening tool with moderate discrimination in general noncardiac surgery, but it underperforms in vascular, thoracic, and very old patients, so the safest approach is to treat it as a baseline anchor and then layer on population-specific models, preoperative cardiac biomarkers, functional or frailty assessments, and intraoperative signals to recalibrate risk dynamically, which aligns with contemporary guideline trends and mitigates the systematic underestimation seen in higher-risk subgroups [^116ha7oZ] [^111opXkg] [^117FE5tP] [^112cVZFC] [^111wXSpu].

The Lee score, or Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), is a simple, **six-factor tool** for preoperative cardiac risk stratification in noncardiac surgery [^116PuBsn]. In the RCRI, **each risk factor scores 1 point**: high-risk surgery, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, and creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL [^114uzWkj]. Risk increases with the total score: 0 points ≈0.4%, 1 point ≈1%, 2 points ≈2.4%, and ≥ 3 points ≈5.4% for major cardiac complications [^114uzWkj]. The RCRI is widely used and recommended by major guidelines [^116PuBsn]; however, it has moderate discrimination [^116ha7oZ] and may underestimate risk in vascular or thoracic surgery [^112aWbki] [^116y7do4], so consider biomarkers [^112cVZFC] [^112GH1XW] or alternative models in high-risk or geriatric patients [^117FE5tP] [^1153zk7a] [^115dqxGQ].

---

## Components of the lee score

The Lee score **assigns one point** for each of the following six risk factors [^116PuBsn] [^114uzWkj]:

| **Risk factor** | **Definition** |
|-|-|
| High-risk surgery | - Intraperitoneal <br/> - Intrathoracic <br/> - Suprainguinal vascular procedures |
| Ischemic heart disease | - History of myocardial infarction <br/> - Positive exercise test <br/> - Current chest pain <br/> - Use of nitrate therapy <br/> - Pathological Q waves on ECG |
| Congestive heart failure | - History of pulmonary edema <br/> - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea <br/> - Physical exam showing rales or S3 gallop <br/> - Chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution |
| Cerebrovascular disease | History of stroke or transient ischemic attack |
| Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin therapy | Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus |
| Preoperative serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL | Renal insufficiency |

---

## Risk stratification and clinical implications

The total score ranges from 0 to 6; **higher scores indicate greater risk** of perioperative cardiac complications [^116ha7oZ]. The risk categories and associated complication rates are:

| **Score** | **Risk category** | **Estimated risk of major cardiac complications** |
|-|-|-|
| 0 | Low | 0.4% |
| 1 | Intermediate | 1.0% |
| 2 | Intermediate | 2.4% |
| ≥ 3 | High | 5.4% |

---

These risk categories **guide clinical decision-making** [^116PuBsn] about the need for further cardiac evaluation, perioperative monitoring, and medical optimization [^115dqxGQ].

---

## Clinical utility and limitations

The Lee score is **widely used** for its simplicity and ease of application and is **recommended by major guidelines**, including the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS), for preoperative cardiac risk assessment in noncardiac surgery [^116PuBsn] [^115dqxGQ].

However, the Lee score has **limitations**, including:

- **Moderate discrimination**: The score has moderate predictive accuracy (AUC ~0.75) [^116ha7oZ] and may underestimate risk in certain populations, such as vascular or thoracic surgery patients [^112aWbki] [^116y7do4].
- **Limited applicability**: The score may not accurately predict risk in specific surgical populations, such as lung resection [^116y7do4] or peripheral arterial surgery [^112aWbki].
- **Lack of age consideration**: The score does not include age [^116689ow], which may limit its predictive value in elderly patients [^111diPuQ].

---

## Comparison with other preoperative risk assessment tools

The Lee score is **frequently compared** with other risk assessment tools, such as the Gupta Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA) calculator [^1153zk7a] and the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) Surgical Risk Calculator [^111qwJo7]. These tools incorporate additional variables, such as age, functional status, and ASA class, and may improve predictive accuracy in certain populations [^117FE5tP] [^114P1rtN].

---

## Recent updates and modifications

Recent studies have explored modifications to the Lee score, including **adding biomarkers** (e.g. NT-proBNP, troponin) [^112cVZFC] [^112GH1XW] and genetic information (e.g. polygenic risk scores) [^112Tx8Zp] to improve predictive accuracy. However, these modifications **require further validation** before widespread clinical adoption [^112GH1XW] [^112qZq8V].

---

The Lee score is a simple, **widely used tool** for preoperative cardiac risk assessment in noncardiac surgery [^116PuBsn]. It **guides clinical decision-making but has limitations**, including moderate discrimination [^116ha7oZ] and limited applicability in certain populations [^112aWbki].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for perioperative cardiac risk management in noncardiac surgery, specifically with respect to cardiac biomarkers, the ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend considering a routine preoperative measurement of cardiac troponins. This can help evaluate the risk of certain adverse outcomes both before and after noncardiac surgery. It is advisable to obtain cardiac troponins in addition to clinical risk scores for predicting certain postoperative events.

### Derivation and validation of a geriatric-sensitive perioperative cardiac risk index [^114uzWkj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is a previously published index of postsurgical cardiac risk that uses six risk factors of major cardiac complications. These risk factors include high-risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, history of heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment, and serum creatinine levels greater than 2.0 mg/dL. These risk factors are binary, indicating presence or absence. High-risk surgery is defined as vascular surgery and open intraperitoneal or intrathoracic procedures. Participants with no risk factors were assigned a predicted probability of 0.4%; those with one risk factor are assigned 1.0%, two risk factors 2.4%, and three or more risk factors 5.4%. There were a total of 485,426 participants (172,905 age ≥ 65) in the NSQIP 2012 who were able to have their RCRI scores computed.

The Gupta MICA model is a risk score for perioperative cardiac risk developed in the NSQIP 2007 and validated in the NSQIP 2008 data sets. The Gupta MICA risk score comprises five items: the participant's functional status, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, creatinine levels, age, and type of surgery that will be performed. There were a total of 479,453 participants (170,737 age ≥ 65) in the NSQIP 2012 who had their Gupta MICA scores computed.

### Canadian cardiovascular society guidelines on perioperative cardiac risk assessment and management for patients who undergo noncardiac surgery [^116PuBsn]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2017). High credibility.

The clinical calculator, "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for perioperative risks (RCRI)", is used for perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery. It covers conditions such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, heart failure, mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation.

The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is a clinical calculator employed to estimate the risk of cardiac complications during the perioperative period in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. It is particularly useful for stratifying patients into different risk categories based on six identified risk factors: high-risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, history of congestive heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, insulin therapy for diabetes, and preoperative serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL.

The RCRI is not applicable to patients undergoing cardiac surgery, as it was specifically designed for non-cardiac surgical procedures. It may also not be as accurate in populations not represented in the original study, such as those with less common comorbidities or undergoing less common surgical procedures.

The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) calculator assesses perioperative cardiac risks by considering six specific risk factors associated with the patient. Each factor corresponds to a condition or characteristic, and if the patient exhibits that factor, it scores 1 point. The total score, ranging from 0 to 6, represents the overall cardiac risk.

The six risk factors analyzed are as follows:

1. High-risk surgery
2. History of ischemic heart disease
3. History of congestive heart failure
4. History of cerebrovascular disease
5. Insulin therapy for diabetes
6. Preoperative serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL

### Prediction of major cardiac events after vascular surgery [^112aWbki]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Predicting cardiac events is essential to provide patients with the best medical care and to assess the risk-benefit ratio of surgical procedures. The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (Lee) and the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSG) Cardiac Risk Index scores for the prediction of major cardiac events in unselected patients undergoing arterial surgery and to determine whether the inclusion of additional risk factors improved their accuracy.

- **Methods**: The study prospectively enrolled 954 consecutive patients undergoing arterial vascular surgery, and the Lee and VSG scores were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic curves for each cardiac risk score were constructed, and the areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared. Two logistic regression models were completed to determine new variables related to the occurrence of major cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.

- **Results**: Cardiac events occurred in 120 (12.6%) patients. Both scores underestimated the rate of cardiac events across all risk strata. The VSG score had an AUC of 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.58–0.68), which was higher than the AUC of the Lee score (0.58; 95% CI, 0.52–0.63; p = 0.03). The addition of preoperative anemia significantly improved the accuracy of the Lee score to an AUC of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.58–0.67; p = 0.002), but not that of the VSG score.

- **Conclusions**: The Lee and VSG scores have low accuracy and underestimate the risk of major perioperative cardiac events in unselected patients undergoing vascular surgery.

The RCRI score was calculated using the variables defined by Lindenauer et al.: high-risk surgery, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus, with each variable counting as one point if present. Hip fracture surgery is considered intermediate-risk according to the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association guidelines. Accordingly, points for high-risk surgery were not awarded to any patient in this study.

### Derivation and validation of a geriatric-sensitive perioperative cardiac risk index [^116KCZsY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Although we believe in the clinical utility of a parsimonious model for predicting MICA, modern computational algorithms can maximize the predictive ability of the predictors by modeling complex nonlinear and high-order interactions. Often called machine or statistical learning, these techniques provide greater predictive accuracy, though often at the expense of interpretability. In our study, we used one such technique, stochastic gradient boosting, to provide us with an upper-limit benchmark for our GSCRI model performance.

Using a gradient-boosted machines (GBM) model with the gbm package in R, we evaluated the set of predictors from the RCRI, Gupta MICA, and GSCRI in the geriatric subset of the NSQIP 2013 derivation data set. Tenfold cross-validation was used to select the interaction depth and number of iterations that minimized the cross-validated error at a shrinkage rate of 0.01. The optimal model, once selected using cross-validation, was then applied to the 2012 validation data set to predict MICA risk. The area under the curve (AUC) was computed from this model and used as our likely upper limit of predictive ability from the set of predictors under evaluation.

### Does the revised cardiac risk index predict cardiac complications following elective lung resection [^111opXkg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score and Thoracic Revised Cardiac Risk Index (ThRCRI) score were developed to predict the risks of postoperative major cardiac complications in the generic surgical population and thoracic surgery, respectively. This study aims to determine the accuracy of these scores in predicting the risk of developing cardiac complications, including atrial arrhythmias, after lung resection surgery in adults.

- **Methods**: We studied 703 patients undergoing lung resection surgery in a tertiary thoracic surgery center. Observed outcome measures of postoperative cardiac morbidity and mortality were compared against those predicted by risk.

- **Results**: Postoperative major cardiac complications and supraventricular arrhythmias occurred in 4.8% of patients. Both index scores had poor discriminative ability for predicting postoperative cardiac complications, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.59 (95% CI 0.51–0.67) for the RCRI score and 0.57 (95% CI 0.49–0.66) for the ThRCRI score.

- **Conclusions**: In our cohort, RCRI and ThRCRI scores failed to accurately predict the risk of cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective resection of lung cancer. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) recommendation to seek a cardiology referral for all asymptomatic pre-operative lung resection patients with more than 3 RCRI risk factors is thus unlikely to be of clinical benefit.

### Implementation of a software-based decision support tool for guideline-appropriate preoperative evaluation: A prospective agreement study [^116QZ1Gq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). High credibility.

Decision rules are stored as dichotomous decision trees or logical AND/OR combinations using ESC and ESA guideline recommendations. Examples for translating the guidelines into a decision support tool include a flow diagram of conditions leading to the recommendation of ECG and logical AND/OR links leading to the recommendation of non-invasive cardiac stress testing. The numbers correspond to the entered observations' database identifiers (primary keys). Relevant observations concern MET as a measure of functional capacity represented by observations (2.1.4, 2.1.5, or 2.1.6), linked by an OR-condition, and the RCRI as a score calculated from observations 2.2.1–2.2.5 indicating the presence of cardiac risk factors and high-risk surgical conditions represented by observation 1.1.3.

The software outputs applicable recommendations, including their grades and levels of evidence according to GRADE, if any. If a recommendation is based on multiple conditions, the software displays only the one with the highest GRADE level, whereas all other applicable conditions remain available in the database. In addition, risk scores are calculated from the information entered, such as the Preoperative Score to Predict Postoperative Mortality (POSPOM), the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the STOP-BANG score for screening of obstructive sleep apnea, and the General Surgery Acute Kidney Risk Index.

### Preoperative and intraoperative prediction of risk of cardiac dysfunction following open heart surgery [^115AG6N3]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac dysfunction following open heart surgery is a major determinant of subsequent morbidity and mortality. The objective of the study was to develop a specific risk prediction model for postoperative cardiac dysfunction based on preoperative variables. It also aimed to investigate whether prediction could be improved by the inclusion of selected intraoperative variables and to compare this model with five previously published risk scores.

The research was conducted using single-centre, prospectively collected data from a tertiary care centre in Middle Norway. A total of 4,989 patients, all eligible and undergoing open cardiac surgery from 2000 to 2007, were included in the study.

- **Main outcome measures**: Logistic regression models for postoperative cardiac dysfunction were used to evaluate predictive accuracy, calibration, and discrimination, as shown by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, with internal validity indicated by bootstrapping. The goodness-of-fit of these predictions was compared with those based on alternative risk scores.

- **Results**: The preoperative model identified chronic cardiac insufficiency, previous myocardial infarction, previous cardiac operation, pulmonary hypertension, renal dysfunction, low haemoglobin concentration, urgent operation, and operation types other than isolated coronary artery bypass surgery as significant factors. The area under the curve was 0.838 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.812–0.864), indicating an accurate risk prediction apart from a slight overestimation in the 2% of highest-risk patients. Including a few intraoperative variables, such as inotropic or vasoconstrictor drugs and plasma or red cell transfusion, slightly improved the model.

### Preoperative cardiac risk assessment for noncardiac surgery: defining costs and risks [^117KK6QH]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiac risk stratification before noncardiac surgery remains important. Two major areas have been emphasized: cost-effective risk stratification and enhanced identification of high-risk populations. Recent studies have highlighted the lack of quality and affordable medical consultation.

- **Cost-effective risk stratification**: The indications for resting preoperative echocardiography merit streamlining, given recent data that failed to demonstrate tangible benefit. Furthermore, noninvasive cardiac stress testing is expensive and unnecessary in low-risk patients.

- **Enhanced identification of high-risk populations**: Perioperative troponin determination significantly improves the detection of myocardial infarction, facilitating its early management. The revised cardiac risk index is a standard tool for risk stratification, despite multiple limitations. The first approach has been to recalibrate the traditional risk index to specific high-risk surgical subgroups. The second approach has been to develop new cardiac risk models with more power. Both approaches have yielded risk calculators that outperform the traditional risk model. This latest generation of risk models is available as online calculators that can be accessed at the bedside.

Further clinical trials are indicated to test the validity, clinical utility, and cost-effectiveness of these novel risk calculators. It is likely that these powerful instruments will refine the indications for specialized cardiac testing, offering multiple opportunities to reduce perioperative risk and cost simultaneously.

### Preoperative geriatric nutritional risk index predicts prognosis and postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery: a retrospective cohort study [^114H5cig]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

At-risk GNRI was associated with poor survival outcomes and postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. We recommend including preoperative GNRI assessment into the ERAS protocol, but prospective studies with longer-term follow-up are warranted.

### Derivation and validation of a geriatric-sensitive perioperative cardiac risk index [^111VHHDH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

This article demonstrates the concept of developing a predictive model in the geriatric population, in contrast to other articles where the model development is across a wider age spectrum. Currently, geriatric patients have low participation in clinical trials and are often excluded due to age-related comorbidities. When included, the data of older participants are often pooled together with participants of younger ages who have much lower risk, which possibly leads to inaccurate parameter estimation. Developing predictive models on these pooled data that ignore age categories can lead to models that are dominated by variables and coefficients not optimized for performance in geriatric patients, hence providing decreased predictive accuracy and lower sensitivity to certain geriatric characteristics. This holds true especially in the development of predictive models because even minor inaccuracies in the derivation of the parameter estimates could dramatically affect the discrimination and calibration of a model.

In this study, our hypothesis of the need for specific geriatric analysis and model derivation proved to be valid, and our efforts culminated in producing the Geriatric-Sensitive Perioperative Cardiac Risk Index (GSCRI). Our GSCRI has an AUC of 0.76 and outperformed the RCRI and Gupta MICA models by 13% (P < 0.001) and 6% (P < 0.001) in geriatric patients of the validation cohort, respectively. Although the GSCRI was developed for optimal performance in a geriatric population, we wished to test the GSCRI against the RCRI and Gupta MICA in their respective performance metrics.

### Preoperative risk stratification models fail to predict hospital cost of cardiac surgery patients [^116N2hLL]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The study evaluates the effectiveness of preoperative risk stratification models in predicting the hospital costs associated with cardiac surgery patients. Abbreviations used include EuroScore, which refers to the European system for cardiac risk evaluation, ICU for Intensive Care Unit, and OR for Operative Room. The findings suggest that these models do not adequately predict the financial outcomes for hospitals, indicating a gap in the current risk assessment processes.

### AUB-HAS2 cardiovascular risk index: Performance in surgical subpopulations and comparison to the revised cardiac risk index [^112MNJjb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

This study reconfirms the very low risk of patients with an AUB‐HAS2 score of 0 in a broad range of surgical procedures. In most cases, the 30‐day risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke was 3%, with a postoperative event rate of over 10% in most procedures, and reaching over 30% in AAA and colon surgeries. This small patient group would therefore require more extensive cardiovascular evaluation and optimization before surgery, and would probably need closer postoperative monitoring. These clinical care strategies based on the AUB‐HAS2 score constitute major targets for prospective validation in future studies.

### Does the revised cardiac risk index predict cardiac complications following elective lung resection [^115D4vGD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Risk models aid in the decision-making process for patients contemplating surgery. Surgeons can provide accurate information on a more individual basis, facilitating the consent process prior to surgery. Several risk models and stratification tools have been developed, identifying risk factors for cardiac complications after adult general thoracic surgery. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index score (RCRI) was devised from a broad surgical population and included only a small group of patients who underwent thoracic surgery (12%). Brunelli and colleagues recalibrated the RCRI specifically for lung resection surgery, generating the Thoracic Revised Cardiac Risk Index score (ThRCRI). The new United Kingdom (UK) and European guidelines for the radical management of patients with lung cancer have incorporated the RCRI as a risk assessment tool for the selection of surgery for patients who are not perceived to have active cardiovascular disease. The discriminative and predictive ability of RCRI in lung resection surgery alone has not been reported in the UK population.

The recent British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines place increasing emphasis on shared decision-making, with individual risk scores being discussed with every patient. The risk of life-threatening cardiac complications is low, but the development of supraventricular arrhythmias is common. Both the RCRI and the ThRCRI were developed to predict the risk of development of supraventricular arrhythmias. However, these 'minor' complications are similarly associated with a prolonged stay in the hospital and slower recovery.

### AUB-HAS2 cardiovascular risk index: Performance in surgical subpopulations and comparison to the revised cardiac risk index [^115rQC9u]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The AUB‐HAS2 Cardiovascular Risk Index is a newly derived measure that can quickly stratify the risk of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. It was validated in a large population of over 1 million patients registered in the ACS NSQIP database. Different types of surgery carry different risks depending on their location, hemodynamic stress, duration, and other factors. It is therefore important to study the performance of a new preoperative risk index in different surgical subpopulations as part of its ongoing validation. In this study, the performance of the AUB‐HAS2 index was analyzed and compared with that of the RCRI in a wide spectrum of surgical specialties and site‐specific surgeries. Several important observations are noted.

The RCRI, reported in 1999, was derived and validated in a study of 4315 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery in one tertiary‐care teaching hospital. Its primary outcome measure was a combination of myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, ventricular fibrillation, primary cardiac arrest, and complete heart block. Recent large‐cohort studies have suggested that the RCRI may underestimate the risk of cardiovascular events in contemporary surgical practice. Our findings show that the AUB‐HAS2 index has a superior discriminatory power compared with the RCRI in the overall study population and in all surgical subgroups as well. There are several factors that may explain this superiority. The AUB‐HAS2 index is more comprehensive in both its data elements as well as in its outcome measure.

### Does the revised cardiac risk index predict cardiac complications following elective lung resection [^113GY1Bb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Data from a total of 703 patients who underwent lung resection surgery within a single institution were analyzed. The characteristics of these patients are displayed in Table 1. Ninety-five patients (14%) had a history of ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure. The median age of the patients was 68 years (range 14–89), and 401 patients (57%) were male.

The procedures performed were as follows: 385 lobectomies (55%), 158 wedge excisions (22%), 67 pneumonectomies (10%), 42 segmentectomies (6%), 31 explorations (4%), and 20 sleeve resections (3%). Risk scores were calculated for all patients. An RCRI score of 3 was recorded in 6.8% (68 patients), and a score of 4 in 19 (2.7%) of the study population.

The ThRCRI scores were also calculated and recorded as follows: a score of 2.5 in 24 patients (3.4%), a score of 3 in 10 patients (1.4%), and a score of 4 in 2 patients (0.3%).

### Improved re-estimation of perioperative cardiac risk using the Surgical Apgar Score: A retrospective cohort study [^111wXSpu]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

This study aims to assess whether the Surgical Apgar Score (SAS) improves the re-estimation of perioperative cardiac risk. The SAS is a novel risk index that integrates three relevant and easily measurable intraoperative parameters: blood loss, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure. These parameters help predict outcomes, although the incremental prognostic value of the SAS, when used alongside standard preoperative risk indices, remains unclear.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving adults aged 18 years and older who underwent elective non-cardiac surgery at a quaternary care hospital in Canada between 2009 and 2014. The primary outcome measured was postoperative acute myocardial injury. The SAS, ranging from 0–10, was calculated based on intraoperative estimated blood loss, the lowest mean arterial pressure, and the lowest heart rate documented in electronic medical records. The incremental prognostic value of the SAS, when combined with the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, was assessed based on several factors:

- **Discrimination (c-statistic)**: Evaluates the ability to distinguish between patients who did and did not experience myocardial injury.
- **Reclassification**: Measured using integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification index.
- **Clinical utility**: Assessed through decision curve analysis.

The cohort included 16,835 patients, of whom 607 (3.6%) experienced acute postoperative myocardial injury. The addition of the SAS to the Revised Cardiac Risk Index enhanced risk estimation. There was an integrated discrimination improvement of 2.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5%-2.4%) and a continuous net reclassification index of 54% (95% CI: 46%-62%). The c-index improved from 0.68 (95% CI: 0.65–0.70) to 0.75 (95% CI: 0.73–0.77) with the incorporation of the SAS. Decision curve analysis further showed the benefit of including the SAS in risk assessment.

### The surgical mortality probability model: Derivation and validation of a simple risk prediction rule for noncardiac surgery [^112C4seh]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The objective was to develop a 30-day mortality risk index for noncardiac surgery that can be used to communicate risk information to patients and guide clinical management at the "point-of-care", as well as for surgeons and hospitals to internally audit their quality of care.

Clinicians rely on the Revised Cardiac Risk Index to quantify the risk of cardiac complications in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Because mortality from noncardiac causes accounts for many perioperative deaths, there is also a need for a simple bedside risk index to predict 30-day all-cause mortality after noncardiac surgery.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 298,772 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery from 2005 to 2007 using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database.

The 9-point S-MPM (Surgical Mortality Probability Model) 30-day mortality risk index was derived empirically and includes three risk factors:

- **ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status**: Patients were assigned points based on their ASA physical status: I (0 points), II (2 points), III (4 points), IV (5 points), or V (6 points).
- **Surgery risk class**: Intermediate- or high-risk procedures were assigned 1 or 2 points, respectively.
- **Emergency status**: Emergency procedures were assigned 1 point.

Patients with risk scores less than 5 had a predicted risk of mortality less than 0.50%, whereas patients with a risk score of 5 to 6 had a risk of mortality between 1.5% and 4.0%. Patients with a risk score greater than 6 had a risk of mortality more than 10%.

### AUB-HAS2 cardiovascular risk index: Performance in surgical subpopulations and comparison to the revised cardiac risk index [^114P1rtN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The American University of Beirut (AUB)-HAS2 Cardiovascular Risk Index is a newly derived index for preoperative cardiovascular evaluation. It is based on six data elements: history of heart disease, symptoms of angina or dyspnea, age ≥ 75 years, and hemoglobin < 12 g/dL for women or < 13 g/dL for men. The index stratifies patients into categories 0, 1, 2, and ≥ 3, depending on the number of data elements present.

The performance of the AUB-HAS2 index was studied in nine surgical specialty groups and in eight commonly performed site-specific surgeries. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for the AUB-HAS2 and Revised Cardiac Risk Index measures, and the areas under the curve were compared. The outcome measure was death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 30 days after surgery.

The AUB-HAS2 score was able to stratify risk in all surgical subgroups (P < 0.001). In the majority of surgeries, patients with an AUB-HAS2 score of 0 had an event rate of < 0.5%. The performance of the AUB-HAS2 index was superior to that of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index in all surgical subgroups (P < 0.001).

This study extends the validation of the AUB-HAS2 index to a broad spectrum of surgical subpopulations.

### Comparative utility of frailty to a general prognostic score in identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes after aortic valve replacement [^115dvgx1]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

- **Risk of poor outcomes according to the Lee index categories**: The risk of poor outcome in the combined cohort was 6.8% in quartile 1 (reference), 17.9% in quartile 2 (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.9–10.2), 20.0% in quartile 3 (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.0–11.4), and 34.0% in quartile 4 (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 2.2–22.6) (p-for-trend = 0.004). This positive trend between the Lee index and poor outcome remained statistically significant after adjusting for age and sex (OR 2.7 [95% CI, 0.8–9.5] in quartile 2, OR 2.8 [95% CI, 0.8–10.5] in quartile 3, and OR 6.0 [95% CI, 1.5–23.3] in quartile 4, p-for-trend = 0.01).

- **In the SAVR cohort**: The risk of poor outcome was 2.1% in quartile 1 (reference), 4.0% in quartile 2 (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.2–32.7), 15.4% in quartile 3 (OR, 8.5; 95% CI, 0.7–102.9), and 20.0% in quartile 4 (OR, 11.8; 95% CI, 0.6–225.4) (p-for-trend = 0.13). This trend attenuated after adjustment for age and sex (p-for-trend = 0.28).

### The influence of clinical risk factors on pre-operative B-type natriuretic peptide risk stratification of vascular surgical patients [^111AFSvm]. Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

The role of the revised cardiac risk index in risk stratification has recently been challenged by studies reporting on the superior predictive ability of pre-operative B-type natriuretic peptides. We found that in 850 vascular surgical patients initially risk stratified using B-type natriuretic peptides, reclassification with the number of revised cardiac risk index risk factors worsened risk stratification (p0, > 2, > 3, and > 4 risk factors, and p = 0.23 for > 1 risk factor). When evaluated with pre-operative B-type natriuretic peptides, none of the revised cardiac risk index risk factors were independent predictors of major adverse cardiac events in vascular patients. The only independent predictor was B-type natriuretic peptide stratification (OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.8–15 for the intermediate class, and OR 25, 95% CI 8.7–70 for the high-risk class). The clinical risk factors in the revised cardiac risk index cannot improve a risk stratification model based on B-type natriuretic peptides.

### Preoperative cardiac risk index predicts long-term mortality and health status [^115S14GK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease patients undergoing vascular surgery are known to be at risk for the occurrence of late cardiovascular events. Before surgery, the perioperative cardiac risk is commonly assessed using the Lee Risk Index score, a combination of six cardiac risk factors. This study assessed the predictive value of the Lee Risk Index for late mortality and long-term health status in patients after vascular surgery.

Between May and December 2004, data on 711 consecutive peripheral arterial disease patients undergoing vascular surgery were collected from eleven hospitals in the Netherlands. Before surgery, the Lee Risk Index was assessed in all patients. At the 3-year follow-up, 149 patients died (21%), and the disease-specific Peripheral Artery Questionnaire (PAQ) was completed in 84% (n = 465) of the survivors. Impaired health status according to the PAQ was defined by the lowest tertile of the PAQ summary score. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to investigate the prognostic ability of the Lee Index for mortality and impaired health status at the 3-year follow-up.

The Lee Risk Index proved to be an independent prognostic factor for both late mortality (1 risk factor hazard ratio [HR] = 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–3.6; 2 risk factors HR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4–4.0; and ≥ 3 risk factors HR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.7–6.2) and impaired health status at the 3-year follow-up (1 risk factor odds ratio [OR] = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1–3.5; 2 risk factors OR = 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6–5.2; and ≥ 3 risk factors OR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3–7.5). The predominant contributing factors were not specified in the excerpt.

### Peri-operative cardiac biomarker screening: a narrative review [^112qZq8V]. Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

Peri-operative risk estimation has traditionally focused on assessing the likelihood of postoperative morbidity and mortality using pre-operative functional assessment. Although this strategy is currently recommended by most major society guidelines, contemporary evidence suggests that cardiac biomarker measurement has important advantages over pre-operative functional assessment. These advantages include superior predictive discrimination and inclusion of the postoperative course in risk estimation.

In this review, we provide an overview of the evidence supporting the peri-operative utilisation, compare risk estimation methods, and discuss which patients may benefit most from cardiac biomarker screening. We also discuss protocols for biomarker screening and management of patients with abnormal results.

### Derivation and validation of a geriatric-sensitive perioperative cardiac risk index [^117FE5tP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

- **Comparison of risk scores**: AUCs for each of the models can be found in Table 4. The GSCRI had a significantly higher AUC than either the RCRI or Gupta MICA in both the geriatric group (AUC = 0.76) and the overall sample (AUC = 0.83). The Gupta MICA also outperformed the RCRI in the geriatric group (0.70 versus 0.63) and the overall sample (0.72 versus 0.68). We found the Gupta MICA model to be poorly calibrated (Figure 3), with an underestimation of risk in the geriatric sample. Although both the RCRI and GSCRI also underestimated the risk, the median difference from the observed risk was only −0.28 and −0.04 percentage points different, respectively, whereas the Gupta MICA was off by −0.73% in geriatric patients.

	- In Figure 4, we see that the Gupta MICA model severely underestimates the risk in the low-risk categories and overestimates the risk in high-risk categories. Given this, we find the Gupta MICA model to be poorly calibrated in the NSQIP 2012 validation data.

	- Although the RCRI also underestimates risk for low-risk patients, it is well calibrated for the highest-risk group (2.4% to 5.4% in RCRI). The GSCRI is very well calibrated and tends to slightly overestimate the risk in the highest predicted risk group.

	- For the performance of risk prediction in geriatric patients for noncardiac surgery groups by age, see Table S4. Additionally, to compare the performance of this new risk score GSCRI with the RCRI, as well as the Gupta MICA risk scores, net reclassification index (5% threshold) and integrated discrimination improvement metrics were compared.

### Esaic focused guideline for the use of cardiac biomarkers in perioperative risk evaluation [^117TVai9]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

In recent years, there has been increasing focus on the use of cardiac biomarkers in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

- **Aims**: The aim of this focused guideline was to provide updated guidance regarding the pre-, post-, and combined pre-and postoperative use of cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptides in adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

- **Methods**: The guidelines were prepared using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. This included the definition of critical outcomes, a systematic literature search, appraisal of certainty of evidence, and evaluation of biomarker measurement in terms of the balance of desirable and undesirable effects, including clinical outcomes, resource use, health inequality, stakeholder acceptance, and implementation. The panel differentiated between three different scopes of applications: cardiac biomarkers as prognostic factors, as tools for risk prediction, and for biomarker-enhanced management strategies.

- **Results**: In a modified Delphi process, the task force defined 12 critical outcomes. The systematic literature search resulted in over 25,000 hits, of which 115 full-text articles formed the body of evidence for recommendations. The evidence appraisal indicated heterogeneity in the certainty of evidence across critical outcomes. Furthermore, there was a relevant gradient in the certainty of evidence across the three scopes of application. Recommendations were issued, and if this was not possible due to limited evidence, clinical practice statements were produced.

### The comparative and added prognostic value of biomarkers to the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for preoperative prediction of major adverse cardiac events and all-cause mortality in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery [^112GH1XW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is a widely acknowledged prognostic model for preoperatively estimating the probability of developing in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. However, the RCRI does not always make accurate predictions. Various studies have investigated whether adding or comparing biomarkers to the RCRI could improve prediction accuracy.

- **Objectives**: Primary: To investigate the added predictive value of biomarkers to the RCRI to preoperatively predict in-hospital MACE and other adverse outcomes in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Secondary: To investigate the prognostic value of biomarkers compared to the RCRI to preoperatively predict in-hospital MACE and other adverse outcomes in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Tertiary: To investigate the prognostic value of other prediction models compared to the RCRI to preoperatively predict in-hospital MACE and other adverse outcomes in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE and Embase from 1 January 1999 (the year that the RCRI was published) until 25 June 2020. We also searched ISI Web of Science and SCOPUS for articles referring to the original RCRI development study within that period.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies among adults who underwent noncardiac surgery and reported on (external) validation of the RCRI, including:
	- the addition of biomarkers to the RCRI;
	- the comparison of the predictive accuracy of biomarkers to the RCRI; or
	- the comparison of the predictive accuracy of the RCRI to other prediction models.

### Does the revised cardiac risk index predict cardiac complications following elective lung resection [^111NxL2G]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

- **Statistical methods**: Results are expressed in percentages for categorical variables, and the median, interquartile range, and full range for non-normally distributed continuous variables. Univariate analyses were performed using Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, where appropriate, for categorical factors. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for continuous factors to assess their relationship with cardiac complications.

- **Performance assessment**: The performance of the cardiac risk scores (RCRI and ThRCRI) in predicting post-operative cardiac complications within 30 days was assessed using the area under a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and associated 95% confidence intervals to evaluate model discrimination. Additionally, the R² measure of goodness of fit was used as a measure of predictive ability from a logistic regression model with the score included as a categorical variable. All analyses were performed using the SAS statistical package version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

### Perioperative complications after vascular surgery are predicted by the revised cardiac risk index but are not reduced in high-risk subsets with preoperative revascularization [^112gXkxD]. Circulation. Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2009). Low credibility.

The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is useful for risk stratifying patients before noncardiac operations. Among patients with documented coronary artery disease who undergo vascular surgery, it is unclear whether preoperative revascularization reduces postoperative cardiac complications in high-risk subsets defined by the RCRI.

- **Methods and results**: The Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis Trial was a randomized, controlled trial that tested the long-term benefit of a preoperative coronary artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery. Using preoperative baseline characteristics to determine the RCRI, we tested the benefit of preoperative revascularization on death and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with multiple risks. Among 462 patients undergoing vascular surgery, there were 72 complications (15.6%) within 30 days postsurgery, including 15 deaths (3.2%) and 57 nonfatal myocardial infarctions (12.3%).

- **Postoperative risk analysis**: The postoperative risk of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction after surgery increased according to the RCRI (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.26 to 2.38; P ≤ 0.001). There was a correlation between increased risks in patients with three or more identified risk factors. Preoperative revascularization had no significant influence on the incidence of complications in any risk subset (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.49; P = 0.60).

Among those individuals with two or more risks who also demonstrated ischemia on a preoperative stress-imaging test (N = 146), the incidence of events was 23% in patients with and without preoperative revascularization (P = 0.95).

### Cardiac risk assessment in noncardiac thoracic surgery [^111xiDwX]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Preoperative cardiac risk assessment for noncardiac thoracic surgery is limited by the lack of data specific to this type of surgery, especially prospective, controlled data. However, the value of clinical predictors in determining accurate postoperative cardiac outcomes is a reliable tool. Thus, the approach is similar to traditional cardiac risk assessment for noncardiac surgery. The essential elements of cardiovascular evaluation as it pertains to noncardiac thoracic surgery are reviewed with a specific focus on coronary artery disease, perioperative arrhythmias, and selected topics relevant to noncardiac thoracic surgery. The core recommendations of the clinical guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association are discussed in the context of noncardiac thoracic surgery.

### Predictive value of stress testing, revised cardiac risk index, and functional status in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [^117Voocf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing noncardiac surgery are at risk for postoperative cardiovascular complications. Literature regarding the ability of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), functional capacity, and stress testing to predict perioperative cardiac events is scarce. The authors examined the association of these parameters with perioperative cardiac events and their additive ability to predict these outcomes.

- **Design**: This was a single-center retrospective study conducted at the Cleveland Clinic.

- **Setting**: Hospital.

- **Participants**: Patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

- **Intervention**: Patients underwent stress testing.

- **Measurements and main results**: The primary outcome of interest was major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The study cohort included 509 patients with predominantly good functional status, as defined by estimated metabolic equivalents (METSe), which was ≥ 4 in 83% of the patients. The addition of preoperative stress testing, when indicated based on the RCRI and functional class limitation, only modestly improved discrimination of risk for postoperative outcomes (METSe + RCRI + positive stress test-C statistic 0.77 for MACE; 0.84 for 1-year mortality) compared with the combination of functional capacity (METSe) and RCRI (C statistic 0.70 for MACE; 0.79 for 1-year mortality). A surprisingly high prevalence of false negative stress tests (negative stress tests in patients who later had the presence of obstructive coronary disease on angiography) was noted, but the C statistic for MACE remained unchanged even when no false negative results were assumed.

### Preoperative NT-proBNP and CRP predict perioperative major cardiovascular events in non-cardiac surgery [^112Xj1mC]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical perioperative cardiovascular risk was assessed according to the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) modified by Lee, a well-validated and widely used risk prediction index. Briefly, RCRI calculates perioperative risk by the sum of points. Each risk factor, including high-risk surgical procedures, history of ischaemic heart disease, pulmonary oedema, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, and serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dl, is assigned one point. The risk of major cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, pulmonary oedema, primary cardiac arrest, and complete heart block, predicted by RCRI was known to be 0.4% to 11% according to an RCRI score of 0 to ≥ 3.

The patient's clinical history and functional capacity were evaluated according to the ACC/AHA guidelines on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and care for non-cardiac surgery. Basic laboratory tests including electrocardiography, chest x-ray, NT-proBNP, and CRP were evaluated within 2 weeks before surgery. Additional non-invasive tests were performed at the physician's discretion. Electrocardiography and serum troponin I were evaluated at the end of the day of surgery and 24 hours later. A chest x-ray was taken the next day.

Any abnormal signs or symptoms suggesting pulmonary oedema or myocardial ischaemia were followed by meticulous evaluation of perioperative cardiac status with repeated cardiac serum markers and electrocardiography. If active pulmonary oedema or ongoing myocardial ischaemia was found, the patient was transferred to the cardiovascular team and treated appropriately.

### The cardiac anesthesia risk evaluation score: a clinically useful predictor of mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery [^1147p4UY]. Anesthesiology (2001). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Cardiac Anesthesia Risk Evaluation score (CARE score)" is used for assessing risk in patients with conditions such as coronary artery disease, thoracic aortic aneurysm, valvular heart disease, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and infective endocarditis.

The Cardiac Anesthesia Risk Evaluation (CARE) score is a clinical calculator used to assess the risk of perioperative cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. It is particularly useful for patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. The CARE score accounts for factors such as age, type of surgery, history of myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, and renal insufficiency. A higher score indicates a greater risk of perioperative cardiac complications. This calculator is not applicable to patients undergoing cardiac surgery, as it is specifically designed for non-cardiac surgical procedures. The CARE score aids clinicians in decision-making regarding preoperative cardiac evaluation and management, and can guide discussions about surgical risk with patients.

The Cardiac Anesthesia Risk Evaluation (CARE) score is designed to assess the risk of mortality and morbidity for patients undergoing various types of surgery, based on their cardiac condition and urgency of surgery. Through this score, healthcare professionals can categorize patients into different risk levels, enabling them to make informed surgical and anesthetic decisions.

To determine the CARE score, the calculator requires two types of input.

### A new index for pre-operative cardiovascular evaluation [^117PSDMn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Currently used indices for pre-operative cardiovascular evaluation are either powerful but complex, or simple but with weak discriminatory power.

- **Objectives**: This study sought to prospectively derive and validate a simple, powerful index that can stratify the cardiovascular risk of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

- **Methods**: The derivation cohort consisted of 3,284 prospectively enrolled adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. The validation cohort consisted of 1,167,414 patients registered in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. The primary outcome measure was death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 30 days after surgery.

- **Results**: The primary outcome occurred in 38 patients (1.2%) in the derivation cohort. Multivariate logistic regression analysis in the derivation cohort identified six data elements to be included in the prediction model: age ≥ 75 years, history of heart disease, symptoms of angina or dyspnea, hemoglobin level (less than 12 g/dL), and urgent or emergent surgery. Patients were stratified into five cardiovascular risk index (CVRI) groups from 0 to 3 based on the number of data elements present. The incidence of the primary outcome increased steadily across the CVRI groups in both the derivation cohort (0%, 0.5%, 2.0%, 5.6%, and 15.7%, respectively; p < 0.0001) and validation cohort (0.3%, 1.6%, 5.6%, 11.0%, and 17.5%, respectively; p < 0.0001). The discriminatory power of the new CVRI was further confirmed by constructing a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

### Development and validation of a risk calculator for prediction of cardiac risk after surgery [^1153zk7a]. Circulation (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest" is used for cardiac arrest, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery.

The Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA) estimates the likelihood of cardiac complications in patients undergoing surgery. It calculates risk as a percentage based on variables including age, functional status, ASA class, serum creatinine levels, and the type of procedure. Each factor is assigned a specific value, contributing to a logistic regression equation that provides a percentage risk score. This model is widely used to stratify risk and guide perioperative management.

The Gupta Perioperative Risk calculator is designed to estimate the risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest around the time of surgery. It considers five key patient-specific inputs and computes a percentage risk that helps clinicians assess the likelihood of these cardiac events during or after surgery.

To conduct this assessment, the calculator requires the following inputs:

- **Age**: The calculator uses the patient's age, calculated as age multiplied by a coefficient, contributing incrementally to the risk.

- **Functional status**: Here you can select from three levels, each impacting risk differently:
	- **Independent**: No additional risk
	- **Partially dependent**: +0.65 to risk
	- **Totally dependent**: +1.03 to risk

### Prediction of cardiac risk before abdominal aortic reconstruction: Comparison of a revised Goldman Cardiac Risk Index and radioisotope ejection fraction [^117S6rsP]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

A revised Goldman Cardiac Risk Index has been suggested to identify patients at higher risk for cardiac complications in those undergoing major noncardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to test the usefulness of this model in an independent series of patients who underwent abdominal aortic surgery and to compare the index with the multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan in the prediction of cardiac complications.

- **Methods**: We studied 77 patients who underwent a MUGA scan before elective abdominal aortic reconstruction. The revised index was calculated for each patient after recording the following five risk factors: a history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, and creatinine level more than 2 mg/dL. The Technetium-99m MUGA scan provided information about the resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities.

- **Results**: Fourteen patients (18%) developed cardiac complications. The index proved to be a satisfactory predictor of postoperative cardiac events (P = 0.008), while an abnormal LVEF failed to do so (P = 0.1). The presence of wall abnormalities, with or without an abnormal LVEF, predicted cardiac complications (P = 0.004 and P = 0.006). Patients with a higher index score tended to have a lower LVEF (Spearman rank correlation, r = -0.43; P < 0.001). Wall abnormalities, with or without an abnormal LVEF, were more frequent in patients with higher scores (P = 0.03 and P = 0.009). Combining the index with the LVEF or the wall abnormalities showed…

### Cardiac scoring systems — what is their value [^115DEsnu]. Anaesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Estimating the peri-operative risk of major adverse cardiac events is one of the functions of cardiac risk scoring systems. Fortunately, peri-operative cardiac complications are relatively infrequent in most patients. Clinical algorithms use sequential screening tests to detect patients most at risk of cardiac complications. However, because the sensitivity and specificity of the tests used are low, the predictive performance of the commonly used cardiac screening tests may not be completely satisfactory. The purpose of this review is to describe measures of performance of cardiac screening tests and illustrate their potential benefits and weaknesses.

### Development and validation of a risk calculator for prediction of cardiac risk after surgery [^114mCDTk]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is currently the most commonly used cardiac risk stratification tool; however, it has several limitations, including its relatively low discriminative ability. The objective of the present study was to develop and validate a predictive cardiac risk calculator.

- **Methods and results**: Patients who underwent surgery were identified from the American College of Surgeons' 2007 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, a multicenter (> 250 hospitals) prospective database. Of the 211,410 patients, 1371 (0.65%) developed perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, five predictors of perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest were identified: type of surgery, dependent functional status, abnormal creatinine, American Society of Anesthesiologists' class, and increasing age. The risk model based on the 2007 data set was subsequently validated on the 2008 data set (n = 257,385). Model performance was very similar between the 2007 and 2008 data sets, with C statistics (also known as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.884 and 0.874, respectively. Application of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index to the 2008 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data set yielded a relatively lower C statistic (0.747). The risk model was used to develop an interactive risk calculator.

- **Conclusions**: The cardiac risk calculator provides a risk estimate based on multiple predictors, improving on the limitations of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index.

### Cardiac surgery risk models: A position article [^114rFkVz]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Differences in medical outcomes may result from disease severity, treatment effectiveness, or chance. Because most outcome studies are observational rather than randomized, risk adjustment is necessary to account for case mix. This has usually been accomplished through the use of standard logistic regression models. However, Bayesian models, hierarchical linear models, and machine-learning techniques such as neural networks have also been used. Many factors are essential to ensuring the accuracy and usefulness of such models. These factors include the selection of an appropriate clinical database, inclusion of critical core variables, precise definitions for predictor variables and endpoints, proper model development, validation, and audit.

Risk models may be used to assess the impact of specific predictors on outcomes, aid in patient counseling and treatment selection, profile provider quality, and serve as the basis of continuous quality improvement activities.

### Age-specific performance of the revised cardiac risk index for predicting cardiovascular risk in elective noncardiac surgery [^111diPuQ]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2015). Low credibility.

The revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) holds a central role in preoperative cardiac risk stratification in noncardiac surgery. Its performance in unselected populations, including different age groups, has, however, not been systematically investigated. We assessed the relationship of RCRI with major adverse cardiovascular events in an unselected cohort of patients undergoing elective, noncardiac surgery overall and in different age groups.

- **Methods and results**: We followed up all individuals aged ≥ 25 years who underwent major elective noncardiac surgery in Denmark from January 1, 2005, to November 30, 2011, for the 30-day risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death). There were 742 of 357,396 (0.2%), 755 of 74,889 (1.0%), 521 of 11,921 (4%), and 257 of 3,146 (8%) major adverse cardiovascular events occurring in RCRI classes I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Multivariable odds ratio estimates were as follows: ischemic heart disease 3.30 (95% confidence interval, 2.96–3.69), high-risk surgery 2.70 (2.46–2.96), congestive heart failure 2.65 (2.29–3.06), cerebrovascular disease 10.02 (9.08–11.05), insulin therapy 1.62 (1.37–1.93), and kidney disease 1.45 (1.33–1.59). Modeling RCRI classes as a continuous variable, the C statistic was highest among the age group 56 to 65 years (0.772) and lowest for those aged > 85 years (0.683). Sensitivity of RCRI class > I (i.e. having ≥ 1 risk factor) for capturing major adverse cardiovascular events was 59%, 71%, 64%, 66%, and 67% in patients aged ≤ 55, 56 to 65, 66 to 75, 76 to 85, and > 85 years, respectively.

### AUB-HAS2 cardiovascular risk index: Performance in surgical subpopulations and comparison to the revised cardiac risk index [^116nTiKN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment is an essential step in the initial evaluation and management of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Several indices have been developed for this risk assessment. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is probably the most commonly used measure because of its relative simplicity. It consists of six variables: high-risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, history of congestive heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus on insulin, and creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. However, recent large cohort studies have suggested that the RCRI may underestimate the risk of cardiovascular events in contemporary surgical practice.

We have recently reported a new risk index: the AUB-HAS2 cardiovascular risk index, which is simple to acquire and has a powerful discriminatory ability to predict cardiovascular events after noncardiac surgery. The index was derived from a prospectively enrolled cohort of 3,284 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery at the American University of Beirut (AUB) and was validated in the large American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database. The AUB-HAS2 index is based on six easily acquired data elements: history of heart disease, symptoms of heart disease (angina or dyspnea), age ≥ 75 years, anemia (hemoglobin < 12 mg/dL), vascular surgery, and emergency surgery. It can stratify patients undergoing noncardiac surgery into three risk categories.

### Guidelines for perioperative care for emergency laparotomy enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations: Part 1-preoperative: diagnosis, rapid assessment and optimization [^111WD1t2]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

**Risk assessment**: Risk assessment has become an important tool to support clinical management of patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Initially promoted in the UK through Higher Risk Surgical Patient Guidelines, it was revealed that many laparotomy patients were not receiving care commensurate to their risk levels, such as planned postoperative ICU admissions. Inexperienced clinical teams in emergency laparotomy management often underestimated the potential for adverse outcomes. A risk score facilitates communication among clinical teams regarding priorities and pathways, including patient transfer, encourages the involvement of highly experienced staff, and aids discussions with patients and their families. There are several surgical or disease-specific risk prediction tools available. Tools such as the Portsmouth-POSSUM (P-POSSUM) score were developed many years ago for retrospective comparison of observed and expected outcomes when all variables are known. However, there is concern about over-interpreting individual patient preoperative predictions when these scores are applied prospectively and some variables must be estimated. Risk prediction scores offer a population risk based on a risk model; however, they can overestimate or underestimate risk for individual patients. Clinicians must be cautious in utilizing these scores for prognosticating patient outcomes. For instance, a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer, who is acutely unwell with markedly deranged physiology and a very high-risk score, may still benefit from rapid, relatively simple surgery.

### The preoperative cardiovascular evaluation of the intermediate-risk patient: new data, changing strategies [^115SD4Eo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The intermediate-risk preoperative patient can be defined as a patient without severely symptomatic or unstable heart disease who, nonetheless, has clinical predictors of adverse perioperative cardiovascular events. Newer data have created an awareness of competing considerations in managing these patients. There is still debate about how to appropriately select patients for noninvasive cardiac testing, invasive coronary testing, coronary revascularization, beta-blockers, or a combination of these.

In this article, we review the evidence pertaining to these issues. We conclude that intermediate-risk preoperative patients are best managed by an approach that emphasizes the following points:

- **Identification and risk stratification**: Intermediate-risk patients should be identified and risk stratified using a clinical tool (e.g. the Revised Cardiac Risk Index).

- **Noninvasive cardiac testing**: This should be reserved for those patients with multiple clinical predictors of risk or the presence of other modifying factors.

- **Preoperative coronary revascularization**: It does not appear to reduce perioperative risk in patients with significant but stable coronary artery disease.

- **Medical therapy optimization**: Medical therapy should be optimized for these patients, including the application of beta-blockers in all intermediate-risk patients that do not have contraindications.

### Recalibration of the revised cardiac risk index in lung resection candidates [^115dBe4M]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) has been proposed as a tool for cardiac risk stratification before lung resection. However, the RCRI was originally developed from a generic surgical population, including a small group of thoracic patients. The objective of this study was to recalibrate the RCRI in candidates for major lung resections to provide a more specific instrument for cardiac risk stratification.

- **Methods**: One thousand six hundred ninety-six patients who underwent lobectomy (1,426) or pneumonectomy (270) in two centers between the years 2000 and 2008 were analyzed. Stepwise logistic regression and bootstrap analyses were used to recalibrate the six variables comprising the RCRI. The outcome variable was the occurrence of major cardiac complications: cardiac arrest, complete heart block, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, or cardiac death during admission. Only those variables with a probability of less than 0.1 in more than 50% of bootstrap samples were retained in the final model and proportionally weighted according to their regression estimates.

- **Results**: The incidence of major cardiac morbidity was 3.3% (57 patients). Four of the six variables present in the RCRI were reliably associated with major cardiac complications: cerebrovascular disease (1.5 points), cardiac ischemia (1.5 points), renal disease (1 point), and pneumonectomy (1.5 points). Patients were grouped into four classes according to their recalibrated RCRI, predicting an incremental risk of cardiac morbidity (p < 0.0001). Compared with the traditional RCRI, the recalibrated index provided a more accurate prediction model for this specific patient population.

### Cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery [^115JPzEw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Major perioperative cardiac events are estimated to complicate between 1.4% and 3.9% of surgeries. Because most surgeries are elective, there is the opportunity to implement strategies to reduce this risk. Accurate identification of patients at risk for such events will allow patients to be better informed about the benefit-to-risk ratio of procedures. It will also guide the allotment of limited clinical resources, utilization of preventive interventions, and areas of future research. This review focuses on important features of the initial pre-operative clinical risk assessment, indications for diagnostic testing to quantify cardiac risk, and the methods and indications for pre-emptive therapies.

### AUB-HAS2 cardiovascular risk index: Performance in surgical subpopulations and comparison to the revised cardiac risk index [^117TNwS4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The original study describing the derivation and validation of the AUB‐HAS2 Cardiovascular Risk Index recommended using low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐risk categories, depending on the score (low risk for a score of 0–1, intermediate risk for a score of 2–3, and high risk for a score > 3). Conventionally, low‐risk surgeries are those with ≤ 1% risk, 1%–10% risk is considered intermediate, and > 10% risk is high. For the majority of specialties and site‐specific surgeries, there was a correlation between the AUB‐HAS2 risk categories and these percentage definitions. However, in a few specific situations, there was some overlap in these categories.

In both AAA repair and colectomy, there was an upward shift of risk in all AUB‐HAS2 risk groups. In both types of surgery, a score of 1 had a low/intermediate risk of around 3%, and a score of 3 had a high risk of around 20%. This is probably due to the fact that the overall risk of these two surgeries is relatively high (13.1% and 5.2%, respectively), similar to what has been reported in the literature. This should be taken into consideration in the evaluation of patients undergoing these types of surgery.

- **Limitations**: In this study, we have described the performance of the newly derived AUB‐HAS2 Cardiovascular Risk Index and compared it to that of the commonly utilized RCRI in a wide spectrum of surgical specialties and site‐specific surgeries. Although our study population is derived from a large multicenter database, it primarily represents North America. The findings will need to be further validated.

### The influence of aging on the prognostic value of the revised cardiac risk index for postoperative cardiac complications in vascular surgery patients [^116689ow]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The Lee-risk index (Lee-index) was developed to predict major adverse cardiac events (MACE) but does not include age as a risk factor. The aim was to assess the value of the Lee-index in vascular surgery patients across different age categories.

Of 2642 patients, cardiovascular risk factors were noted to calculate the Lee-index. Patients were divided into four age categories: < 55 years (n = 1012), 55–64 years (n = 605), 65–74 years (n = 487), and > 75 years (n = 538). Outcome measures included postoperative MACE, such as cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), coronary revascularization, and heart failure. The performance of the Lee-index was determined using C-statistics within the four age groups.

The incidence of MACE was 10.9%, with percentages for Lee-index scores of 1, 2, and ≥ 3 being 6%, 13%, and 20%, respectively. However, the prognostic value differed among age groups. The predictive value for MACE was highest among patients under 55 years (0.76) compared to patients aged over 75 years (0.62). The prediction of MACE improved in the elderly (aged > 75) after adjusting the Lee-index with age, revised risk of operation (low, low-intermediate, high-intermediate, and high-risk procedures), and hypertension, increasing from 0.62 to 0.69.

In conclusion, the prognostic value of the Lee-index is reduced in elderly vascular surgery patients. However, adjustment for age, risk of surgical procedure, and hypertension significantly improves the Lee-index.

### Preoperative risk stratification models fail to predict hospital cost of cardiac surgery patients [^115Yfjrg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The conclusion drawn from this study is that all six preoperative scoring models evaluated fail to effectively predict the total costs associated with cardiac surgery patients. It is recommended to reconsider the variables and their additive weight in these scores regarding the total hospital cost, to develop a reliable financial risk model.

Consent for publication was not obtained from patients, as the report covers a large population rather than individual patients. No individual patient images accompany this report.

### An Apgar score for surgery [^114KqUS8]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2007). High credibility.

The Surgical Apgar Score (SAS) is a clinical tool used to evaluate the risk of postoperative complications in patients undergoing surgery. This score is especially relevant for a broad range of surgical patients, including those in general, vascular, thoracic, and orthopedic procedures. The SAS bases its assessments on three intraoperative parameters: lowest heart rate, lowest mean arterial pressure, and estimated blood loss. Scores range from 0 to 10, with lower values indicating greater risk of postoperative complications such as major morbidity or mortality. The SAS is invaluable for guiding postoperative management decisions and facilitating prognosis discussions with patients and their families. It is important to note, however, that the SAS may not be suitable for surgeries such as cardiac or neurosurgery, where these parameters might be deliberately manipulated during the procedure.

The clinical calculator "Surgical Apgar Score for postoperative risk (SAS score)" assesses perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery. This tool utilizes three critical intraoperative inputs: estimated blood loss, lowest mean arterial pressure, and lowest heart rate. Each parameter is assigned a score according to predefined scales, determining the overall Surgical Apgar Score. The inputs and scores are outlined below:

- **Estimated blood loss**:
	- **More than 1,000 mL**: 0
	- **601–1,000 mL**: 1
	- **101–600 mL**: 2
	- **100 mL or less**: 3

### Impact of the choice of risk model for identifying low-risk patients using the 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association perioperative guidelines [^111qwJo7]. Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

The 2014 American College of Cardiology perioperative guideline recommends risk stratifying patients scheduled to undergo noncardiac surgery using either:

1. the Revised Cardiac Index;
2. the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator; or
3. the Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest calculator.

The aim of this study is to determine how often these three risk-prediction tools agree on the classification of patients as low risk (less than 1%) of major adverse cardiac event.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective observational study using a sample of 10,000 patient records. The risk of cardiac complications was calculated for the Revised Cardiac Index and the Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest models using published coefficients, and for the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator using the publicly available website. The authors used the intraclass correlation coefficient and kappa analysis to quantify the degree of agreement between these three risk-prediction tools.

- **Results**: There is good agreement between the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest estimates of major adverse cardiac events (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.70), while there is only poor agreement between the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator and the Revised Cardiac Index.

### Revised cardiac risk index and postoperative morbidity after elective orthopaedic surgery: a prospective cohort study [^112hdeKQ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

The revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) is strongly associated with increased cardiac ischemic risk and perioperative death. However, associations with non-cardiac morbidity in non-cardiac surgery have not been explored. In the elective orthopaedic surgical population, morbidity is common, but preoperative predictors remain unclear. We hypothesized that RCRI would identify individuals at increased risk of non-cardiac morbidity in this surgically homogeneous population.

- **Methods**: Five hundred sixty patients undergoing elective primary (> 90%) and revision hip and knee procedures were studied. A modified RCRI (mRCRI) score was calculated, weighting intermediate and low-risk factors. The primary endpoint was the development of morbidity, collected prospectively using the Postoperative Morbidity Survey, on postoperative day (POD) 5.

- **Results**: Morbidity on POD 5 was more frequent in patients with an mRCRI ≥ 3 [relative risk 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4–2.1; P < 0.001]. Time to hospital discharge was delayed in patients with an mRCRI score ≥ 3 (log-rank test, P = 0.0002). Pulmonary (P < 0.001), infectious (P = 0.001), cardiovascular (P = 0.0003), renal (P < 0.0001), wound (P = 0.02), and neurological (P = 0.002) morbidities were more common in patients with an mRCRI score ≥ 3. Pre/postoperative hematocrit, anesthetic/analgesic technique, and postoperative temperature were similar across mRCRI groups. There were significant associations with hospital stay, as measured by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for mRCRI 0.64 (95% CI: 0.58–0.70) and POSSUM 0.70 (95% CI: 0.70).

### Implementation of a software-based decision support tool for guideline-appropriate preoperative evaluation: a prospective agreement study [^115oqHq2]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Low credibility.

A total of 204 patients for elective surgery at high perioperative risk were included, none of whom were lost during the study.

- **Patient characteristics**: Patient characteristics included median values (interquartile range) or numbers of patients (%). The preoperative score to predict postoperative mortality (POSPOM) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index were utilized. Surgical risk was assessed according to the 2014 European Society of Cardiology guidelines.

- **Clearance for surgery**: In the digital guideline support approach, 37 (18.1%) patients were cleared for surgery without further investigations, whereas in the standard approach, 151 (74.0%) were cleared, and with the expert, 97 (47.5%) were cleared. The agreements between the clearance decisions using digital guideline support and those of the expert (66.7%), and between the standard clearance decisions and those of the expert (67.6%) were fair, with no significant difference in the coefficients (Cohen's kappa 0.37 [interquartile range 0.26–0.48] vs 0.31 [0.21–0.42], P = 0.6).

The correct clearance decisions using digital guideline support primarily involved patients with correctly requested additional examinations in 50.5%, whereas correct clearance decisions using the standard approach mainly consisted of patients correctly cleared for surgery in 44.6%. The incorrect decisions using digital guideline support included 31.4% based on unnecessarily requested additional examinations.

### Use of a polygenic risk score improves prediction of myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery [^112Tx8Zp]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

While postoperative myocardial injury remains a major driver of morbidity and mortality, the ability to accurately identify patients at risk remains limited despite decades of clinical research. The role of genetic information in predicting myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS) remains unknown and requires large-scale electronic health records and genomic datasets.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective observational study of adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, we defined MINS as new troponin elevation within 30 days following surgery. To determine the incremental value of polygenic risk score (PRS) for coronary artery disease, we added the score to three models of MINS risk: revised cardiac risk index, a model comprised entirely of preoperative variables, and a model with combined preoperative plus intraoperative variables. We assessed performance without and with PRSs via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and net reclassification index.

- **Results**: Among 90,053 procedures across 40,498 genotyped individuals, we observed 429 cases with MINS (0.5%). PRS for coronary artery disease was independently associated with MINS for each multivariable model created (odds ratio = 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02–1.24], P = 0.023 in the revised cardiac risk index-based model; odds ratio = 1.19 [95% CI, 1.07–1.31], P = 0.001 in the preoperative model; and odds ratio = 1.17 [95% CI, 1.06–1.30], P = 0.003 in the preoperative plus intraoperative model). The addition of clinical risk factors improved model discrimination.

### Does the revised cardiac risk index predict cardiac complications following elective lung resection [^116y7do4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) score and the thoracic revised cardiac risk index (ThRCRI) score were developed to predict the risks of postoperative major cardiac complications in the generic surgical population and thoracic surgery, respectively. This study aims to determine the accuracy of these scores in predicting the risk of developing cardiac complications, including atrial arrhythmias, after lung resection surgery in adults.

- **Methods**: We studied 703 patients undergoing lung resection surgery in a tertiary thoracic surgery centre. Observed outcome measures of postoperative cardiac morbidity and mortality were compared against those predicted by risk.

- **Results**: Postoperative major cardiac complications and supraventricular arrhythmias occurred in 4.8% of patients. Both index scores had poor discriminative ability for predicting postoperative cardiac complications with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.59 (95% CI 0.51–0.67) for the RCRI score and 0.57 (95% CI 0.49–0.66) for the ThRCRI score.

- **Conclusions**: In our cohort, the RCRI and ThRCRI scores failed to accurately predict the risk of cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective resection of lung cancer. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) recommendation to seek a cardiology referral for all asymptomatic pre-operative lung resection patients with more than three RCRI risk factors is thus unlikely to be of clinical benefit.
