## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for insomnia classified as a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10 code for insomnia characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which ICD-10 coding system applies (ICD-10 vs ICD-10-CM). Then, I should verify the correct code category and subcodes for insomnia. Next, I will check whether the description "difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep" maps to a specific subcode or defaults to an unspecified code. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and provide a concise, clinically grounded answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the coding framework. For U.S. billing and clinical documentation, we use ICD-10-CM, which is the Clinical Modification of ICD-10, and insomnia falls under the G47 category of sleep disorders, specifically G47.0 for insomnia disorders, with subcodes for unspecified, due to medical condition, and other specified insomnia [^2f17a966].

> Wait, let me verify the subcodes under G47.0. The ICD-10-CM listing shows G47.00 for insomnia, unspecified; G47.01 for insomnia due to medical condition; and G47.09 for other insomnia, which captures specified insomnia not otherwise categorized, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating these with broader sleep disorder codes outside G47.0 [^2f17a966] [^7bcb7002].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which subcode fits "difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep". The phrase itself is a core symptom description of insomnia rather than a named subtype, so it does not automatically map to G47.01 or a more specific G47.09 variant; in the absence of a documented causal medical condition or a more specific insomnia diagnosis, the appropriate default is G47.00, insomnia, unspecified, with the clinical note capturing the symptom profile of sleep-onset and maintenance difficulties [^2f17a966].

> I should double-check that this aligns with how authoritative sources describe insomnia. Contemporary reviews and guidelines define insomnia by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with daytime consequences, and they emphasize that diagnosis is clinical and symptom-based; they do not require a specific ICD-10-CM subcode beyond G47.0 when the etiology is not specified, reinforcing that G47.00 is correct when the cause is not documented or when no more specific insomnia subtype applies [^2f17a966] [^9d8a6982] [^a9f76275].

> But wait, what if someone argues for G47.09 because the symptom profile is "specified"? Let me reconsider: G47.09 is intended for other specified insomnia, such as paradoxical insomnia or other named forms, and still requires a more specific diagnostic label than simply describing initiation and maintenance difficulties; without a named subtype or a documented medical etiology, G47.00 remains the proper unspecified code, with the record noting the symptom details for clinical clarity [^2f17a966] [^7bcb7002].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for insomnia characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, when no more specific etiology or subtype is documented, is **G47.00** (insomnia, unspecified) [^2f17a966].

---

The ICD-10 code for insomnia characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep is **G47.00** (insomnia, unspecified) [^2f17a966]. If the insomnia is due to a medical condition, use **G47.01**; if it is due to a mental or behavioral disorder, use **F51.0** (nonorganic insomnia) [^notfound]. Accurate coding requires documentation of the underlying cause, duration, and functional impact to support the correct ICD-10 assignment [^bafd3289].

---

## ICD-10 codes for insomnia

ICD-10 classifies insomnia under two main categories: **organic insomnia** (G47.x) and **nonorganic insomnia** (F51.x). The choice depends on whether a medical or mental/behavioral disorder is the underlying cause [^notfound].

| **ICD-10 category** | **Code** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Organic insomnia | G47.00 | Insomnia, unspecified |
| Organic insomnia | G47.01 | Insomnia due to medical condition |
| Organic insomnia | G47.09 | Other insomnia |
| Nonorganic insomnia | F51.0 | Nonorganic insomnia (insomnia not due to organic disease) |

---

## Specific ICD-10 code for difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep

The most appropriate ICD-10 code for insomnia characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, when no specific cause is identified, is **G47.00** (insomnia, unspecified) [^2f17a966]. This code encompasses insomnia symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and early morning awakenings without specifying the underlying cause [^notfound].

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate ICD-10 coding of insomnia requires detailed clinical documentation, including:

- **Symptom description**: Clearly document the specific sleep difficulties, such as difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or early morning awakenings [^bafd3289].
- **Duration and frequency**: Document the duration of symptoms (acute, subacute, or chronic) and their frequency (e.g. number of nights per week) [^168396ef].
- **Underlying cause**: Identify and document any underlying medical or psychiatric conditions contributing to insomnia [^bafd3289].
- **Functional impact**: Document the impact of insomnia on daytime functioning, including fatigue, cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and occupational or social impairment [^168396ef].

---

## Clinical implications of accurate ICD-10 coding

Accurate ICD-10 coding of insomnia has several **clinical implications**:

- **Treatment planning**: Proper coding ensures appropriate treatment strategies, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions [^5716a7eb].
- **Insurance reimbursement**: Accurate coding facilitates insurance reimbursement and reduces claim denials [^notfound].
- **Epidiological data**: Accurate coding contributes to reliable epidemiological data, aiding in research and public health planning [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10 code for insomnia characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep is **G47.00** (insomnia, unspecified) [^2f17a966]. Accurate coding requires comprehensive clinical documentation of symptoms, duration, underlying causes, and functional impact.

### Insomnia disorder [^7d795464]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Insomnia disorder affects a large proportion of the population on a situational, recurrent or chronic basis and is among the most common complaints in medical practice. The disorder is predominantly characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep duration or quality and difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, along with substantial distress and impairments of daytime functioning. It can present as the chief complaint or, more often, co-occurs with other medical or psychiatric disorders, such as pain and depression. Persistent insomnia has been linked with adverse long-term health outcomes, including diminished quality of life and physical and psychological morbidity. Despite its high prevalence and burden, the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood. In the past decade, important changes in classification and diagnostic paradigms have instigated a move from a purely symptom-based conceptualization to the recognition of insomnia as a disorder in its own right. These changes have been paralleled by key advances in therapy, with generic pharmacological and psychological interventions being increasingly replaced by approaches that have sleep-specific and insomnia-specific therapeutic targets. Psychological and pharmacological therapies effectively reduce the time it takes to fall asleep and the time spent awake after sleep onset, and produce a modest increase in total sleep time; these are outcomes that correlate with improvements in daytime functioning. Despite this progress, several challenges remain, including the need to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie insomnia and to develop more cost-effective, efficient and accessible therapies.

### Global perspectives on the sleep condition indicator for DSM-5 insomnia disorder: a COSMIN and STARD systematic review of psychometric and diagnostic performance [^dc9f4f43]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Insomnia disorder (ID) is characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep quality or quantity associated with difficulty falling or staying asleep, and substantial distress or daytime impairments. For ID diagnosis, these sleep disturbances must occur at least three times per week, persist for over 3 months, and cause daytime impairment. The Prevalence of short-term insomnia symptoms in the general population ranges from 15 to 20%, while acute and chronic insomnia affect 3.9 to 22% of the population, depending on the definitions and diagnostic criteria used. The high prevalence of insomnia has important individual and socioeconomic consequences, highlighting the urgent need to address this health concern.

Insomnia diagnoses can be made under three main systems: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM, American Psychiatric Association;), the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD, American Academy of Sleep Medicine;), and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD, World Health Organization;). Each classification serves a distinct purpose within its respective domains of psychiatric disorders, sleep disorders, and classification of diseases. Using different criteria and tools for diagnosing insomnia, including varying items and limitations, leads to inconsistent prevalence estimates of this disorder, making systematic comparisons and gathering research findings challenging. Notably, following the removal of the distinction between primary and secondary insomnia in the DSM-5, the definitions of insomnia in both the ICSD-3 and ICD-11 have aligned accordingly. Although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has proven effective in treating it, receiving an accurate diagnosis of ID is a crucial barrier to treatment. Professional diagnoses of ID are rare in clinical practice, and as a result, numerous patients cannot access early treatment for this disorder. Hence, this reality underscores the imperative need for a quick and precise clinical screening and measuring tool.

International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition (ICSD-3) — definition and prevalence of chronic insomnia indicate that "The disorder is identified as chronic when it has persisted for at least three months at a frequency of at least three times per week", and "When the disorder meets this frequency criteria but has persisted for less than three months, it is considered short-term insomnia". Epidemiology notes that "Occasional, short-term insomnia affects 30% to 50% of the population" and "The prevalence of chronic insomnia disorder in industrialized nations is estimated to be at least 5% to 10%".

### Classifying insomnia in a clinically useful way [^7cbfd838]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a prevalent complaint that may arise from myriad causes. Therefore, patients who present for insomnia evaluation and treatment represent a rather heterogeneous group that merits a reliable and valid diagnostic system. This review article considers the general purposes of diagnostic classification per se and highlights the factors that influence the development of diagnostic nosologies. Various past and current insomnia nosologies are described, and data supporting the reliability, validity, and general utility of these systems are presented. In addition, the limitations of existing nosologies are discussed, and factors that will lead to improved insomnia nosologies in the future are considered. The panel discussion that follows this review highlights the limitations of current nosologies and notes barriers that must be overcome to improve upon the currently available classification systems.

Chronic insomnia disorder — definition and criteria — are described as an insomnia disorder generally characterized by a persistent difficulty with sleep initiation or maintenance, associated with a perceived daytime impairment or concern/dissatisfaction with sleep; the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, Text Revision (ICSD-3-TR) specifies that insomnia disorder can be either short-term, or chronic, and criteria include patient or caregiver report of difficulties with initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, waking up earlier than desired, resistance to going to bed on an appropriate schedule or difficulty sleeping without caregiver intervention (e.g. adults with dementia).

### Recent developments in the classification, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia [^ec0a2e07]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Sleep/wake complaints, and specifically insomnia, are some of the more common problems encountered in the outpatient setting. Despite its prevalence, few clinicians are experts at diagnosing and treating this entity. Additionally, diagnosis and treatment of insomnia is a time-intensive process (often the initial interview takes at least 1 h, depending on the complexity of the insomnia). With a conservative estimate of the annual cost of insomnia between dollar 92.5 and dollar 107.5 billion dollars, it is becoming clear that insomnia has significant medical and public health implications. A problem that has hampered insomnia research is the lack of a standard definition of insomnia for use in research, as well as guidelines for assessment. In recent years, there have been important advances in the classification, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia with efforts to establish greater consensus in how to define and measure insomnia. Cognitive behavioral and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective treatment approaches. Insomnia is a complex entity, often multifactorial in its etiology; and as research and clinical guidelines are established and validated (leading to better data interpretation), continued enhancement of our understanding of this disorder is expected.

### Emerging research on the treatment and etiology of secondary or comorbid insomnia [^ba67a9b9]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Secondary insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that occurs as a consequence of another primary medical or psychiatric disorder. This distinction from primary insomnia has been thought to be important from a diagnostic standpoint so that treatment for secondary insomnia can appropriately target the primary disorder. By convention, treating insomnia directly has only been recommended with primary insomnia. However, a number of recent studies of cognitive-behavioral treatment for a wide range of secondary insomnias have demonstrated that this approach is an effective treatment in this population. These results are not predicted by the traditional conceptualization of secondary insomnia. Results of epidemiological research also argue against viewing insomnia that is comorbid with another disorder as being caused by that disorder. A revised model is needed to understand insomnia that is comorbid with medical and/or psychiatric illness, in addition to re-evaluating standard treatment protocols for comorbid insomnia.

### The effect of insomnia definitions, terminology, and classifications on clinical practice [^018c072b]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

There is a need for newer, more clinically useful classifications for insomnia. Identification of specific subtypes of insomnia helps anchor research, allows for prediction of prognosis/course of the condition, and may allow for individualization of treatment. Existing classifications differ, and many terms remain inadequately defined, which leads to diagnostic confusion. Historically, insomnia has been classified according to symptom type, symptom duration, and underlying cause, but these classifications have not been based on evidence of their utility, and newer research suggests the need for change. Symptoms may include difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and not feeling restored by sleep, although it has not been clear that it is possible to identify distinct subtypes of patients by symptom or that distinguishing symptom type affects the course of clinical treatment. Classification of insomnia by duration most commonly involves three categories: transient (no more than a few days), short-term (up to 3 weeks), and long-term (more than 3 weeks). This categorization is of uncertain utility and has been primarily based on nonempiric concerns about treatment with sedative-hypnotic medications for periods longer than several weeks. The subtyping of insomnia in terms of whether there is an identifiable underlying cause such as a psychiatric or medical illness was based on an unproven assumption that in most instances other disorders caused insomnia. Recent studies suggest the need to revisit these classification strategies. Evidence that symptom types typically overlap and change over time complicates the categorization of subjects by whether they have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or have nonrestorative sleep. New studies of the treatment of chronic insomnia change the perspective on duration of treatment and, as a result, classification of duration of disease. Two studies of nightly pharmacotherapy for insomnia including more than 800 insomnia patients have not identified any increase in the risks after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. In addition, nonpharmacological treatments demonstrate long-lasting efficacy in patients with chronic insomnia, and the development of abbreviated cognitive-behavioral therapies, which are particularly well suited to primary care practice, have improved their applicability. Newer studies of the relationships between insomnia and associated medical and psychiatric conditions undermine the notion that insomnia is always a symptom and caused by an underlying condition. They suggest that, although it is important to identify and treat these conditions, this may not be sufficient to alleviate the insomnia, which may adversely affect the course of the associated disorder. As a result, treatment targeted specifically to the insomnia should be considered. All of these developments point to an increasing ability to tailor therapy to the particular needs of patients and to optimize the clinical management of insomnia.

### International classification of sleep disorders-third edition: highlights and modifications [^6223eaef]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

The recently released third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) is a fully revised version of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine's manual of sleep disorders nosology, published in cooperation with international sleep societies. It is the key reference work for the diagnosis of sleep disorders. The ICSD-3 is built on the same basic outline as the ICSD-2, identifying seven major categories that include insomnia disorders, sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, parasomnias, and other sleep disorders. Significant modifications have been made to the nosology of insomnia, narcolepsy, and parasomnias. Major features and changes of the manual are reviewed in this article. The rationales for these changes are also discussed.

### Childhood insomnia: why chris can' T sleep [^a496f836]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Children of all ages experience difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, which is known as childhood insomnia. Insomnia is a symptom that may be caused by a primary sleep disorder or is associated with other sleep, medical, and psychiatric disorders. The sleep disturbance causes significant impairment in daytime functioning and impacts negatively on family life. This problem is managed primarily by behavioral or cognitive-behavioral approaches. Medications are frequently prescribed, but there is a lack of data from controlled studies to support the use of pharmacologic agents in the management of childhood insomnia.

### Sleep disorders in psychiatric practice [^82b5836f]. World Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Over the last years, a large body of evidence has accumulated showing that complaints of disordered sleep are quite prevalent in the community. Insomnia is by far the most common disturbance and is often associated with concurrent psychiatric illness, in particular anxiety and mood disorders. On the other hand, sleep complaints are frequently present among psychiatric patients and have been incorporated in the official diagnostic criteria for many mental disorders, such as major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and substance-related disorders. Estimates of the prevalence of sleep disorders diverge widely, because these disorders have been variously conceptualized. Currently, however, three different classifications for sleep disorders establish reliable diagnostic criteria and allow for more consistency in clinical research. In particular, the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for insomnia helped to establish a consensus among sleep specialists by defining accurately this clinical condition, i.e. by conceptualizing it as the subjective complaint of insufficient or non-restorative sleep, which is the important feature, not the actual amount of time spent asleep. Alongside the evolution of taxonomic systems, the development of specific diagnostic tools, such as rating scales for measuring clinical manifestations of sleep disorders, has contributed significantly to the growth in the field. For instance, the risk factors responsible for the development of chronic insomnia, its consequences, and the complex relationship between insomnia and psychopathology, have been considerably clarified. In terms of the polysomnographic aberrations observed in various mental disorders, these, although proven not to be pathognomonic for any of them, have been considerably refined over the last decade, and certain general sleep patterns for some specific disorders have emerged. Finally, substantial advances have been made in the elucidation of the neuropsychobiological substrate of disturbed sleep. Thus, hyperarousal has been identified as the cardinal feature of chronic insomnia, which is associated with an around-the-clock activation of both major components of the stress system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system.

### The pathophysiology of insomnia [^36626d27]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Insomnia disorder is characterized by chronic dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality that is associated with difficulty falling asleep, frequent nighttime awakenings with difficulty returning to sleep, and/or awakening earlier in the morning than desired. Although progress has been made in our understanding of the nature, etiology, and pathophysiology of insomnia, there is still no universally accepted model. Greater understanding of the pathophysiology of insomnia may provide important information regarding how, and under what conditions, the disorder develops and is maintained as well as potential targets for prevention and treatment. The aims of this report are (1) to summarize current knowledge on the pathophysiology of insomnia and (2) to present a model of the pathophysiology of insomnia that considers evidence from various domains of research. Working within several models of insomnia, evidence for the pathophysiology of the disorder is presented across levels of analysis, from genetic to molecular and cellular mechanisms, neural circuitry, physiologic mechanisms, sleep behavior, and self-report. We discuss the role of hyperarousal as an overarching theme that guides our conceptualization of insomnia. Finally, we propose a model of the pathophysiology of insomnia that integrates the various types of evidence presented.

### Management of insomnia [^8505041a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on insomnia:

- **Definition**: Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by persistent symptoms of trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early in the morning accompanied by at least one symptom of impaired daytime function (not getting enough sleep or daytime sleepiness).
- **Pathophysiology**: Insomnia is caused by a hyperarousal state primarily due to physiologic or neurophysiologic factors.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for insomnia include advancing age, female sex, depression, anxiety disorders, night shift or rotating shift work, chronic conditions causing dyspnea, GERD, chronic pain conditions, neurodegenerative diseases, restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorders, snoring, and sleep apnea.
- **Disease course**: Insomnia is characterized by difficulty sleeping, frequent nocturnal awakening, prolonged periods of wakefulness during sleep period, and poor quality sleep. Insomnia impacts physical functioning, role limitation due to physical and emotional health problems, body pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, and mental health.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Persistent insomnia has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02–2.45), while intermittent insomnia has not been associated with an increased risk.

### Medical ontology learning framework to investigate daytime impairment in insomnia disorder and treatment effects [^699436e9]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To demonstrate the potential of DiSMOL, we applied the framework to examine the burden of daytime impairment in people with insomnia disorder, the most prevalent worldwide sleeping disorder. Daytime impairment is a required feature of insomnia diagnosisand a very relevant aspect to be addressed for individuals affected by the disease. Improving daytime functioning has been identified as the most important attribute of an insomnia treatment by people with insomnia disorder. Despite its significance and importance for individuals with insomnia, symptoms describing daytime impairment are rarely coded. Therefore, DiSMOL aims to identify as many genuine daytime impairment symptoms as possible while minimizing the inclusion of spurious symptoms to provide an accurate representation of this critical aspect of insomnia disorder. In this paper, we show that DiSMOL is able to detect symptoms of daytime impairment in people with insomnia with greater sensitivity compared to ICD-10 codes. Additionally, the framework reveals significant increases in daytime impairment symptoms following benzodiazepine use (18.9%), while traditional ICD codes do not detect any significant change.

### Association between insomnia and the incidence of myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c147ea38]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

The protocol for this paper was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022348707) and the regulations of the preferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (PRISMA) were followed.

2.1 Search strategy

A literature search of the following databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) on May 17, 2022, using key terms such as "Insomnia", "sleep complaints", "sleep initiation", "Myocardial Infarction", "MI", and "STEMI", was performed to identify studies of interest. (View the supplementary material for the full search strategy).

2.2 Insomnia definition

Insomnia was defined according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM); codes 307.4 (a disorder of initiating or maintaining sleep) and 780.5 (insomnia, unspecified). We also utilized the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐5), which stated that insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by the presence of any of the following three symptoms: (1) difficulty initiating sleep, (2) difficulty maintaining sleep, (3) early morning awakening with inability to return to sleep. In addition to that, we included an objective measure of insomnia which is the sleep duration. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other sleep apneas weren't included in our study.

2.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We screened the studies according to the following criteria:

Inclusion criteria: Studies selected must be in the English language; controlled observational studies with data on the incidence of myocardial infarction among adults (≥ 18 years) suffering from insomnia, including cross‐sectional, case–control, and cohort studies were included.

Exclusion criteria: Editorials, commentaries, reviews, systematic reviews, meta‐analyses, case reports, case series, animal studies, studies without data about the risk of myocardial infarction in patients suffering from insomnia, and studies lacking a control group were excluded; in case of duplicate studies, the most recent study with the largest study population was included.

2.4 Study selection

Two independent reviewers (T.S. and M. A.) screened the studies according to our criteria. If a consensus is not achieved, a third independent reviewer (R.S.) was consulted to resolve the conflict.

### DSM-5 sleep-wake disorders classification: overview for use in clinical practice [^37eba2fb]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Mental health clinicians should appreciate that sleep is a fundamental human behavior and that inadequate sleep has adverse medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial consequences. Sleep disturbances interact with common mental disorders; the two are mutually exacerbating, and both must be appropriately addressed to ensure optimal outcomes for our patients. Sleep is by the brain, of the brain, and for the brain.

### Classification of sleep disorders [^24aa13f6]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The classification of sleep disorders is necessary to discriminate between disorders and to facilitate an understanding of symptoms, etiology, and pathophysiology that allows for appropriate treatment. The earliest classification systems, largely organized according to major symptoms (insomnia, excessive sleepiness, and abnormal events that occur during sleep), were unable to be based on pathophysiology because the cause of most sleep disorders was unknown. These 3 symptom-based categories are easily understood by physicians and are therefore useful for developing a differential diagnosis. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, version 2, published in 2005 and currently undergoing revision, combines a symptomatic presentation (e.g., insomnia) with 1 organized in part on pathophysiology (e.g., circadian rhythms) and in part on body systems (e.g., breathing disorders). This organization of sleep disorders is necessary because of the varied nature and because the pathophysiology for many of the disorders is still unknown. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, version 2 provides relevant diagnostic and epidemiological information on sleep disorders to more easily differentiate between the disorders.

### Affect and arousal in insomnia: through a lens of neuroimaging studies [^26b9631e]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep. Typically, these nighttime disturbances go along with various daytime impairments, such as mood swings, deficits in attention and memory problems. With a point prevalence of 6–10% and an incidence rate of 4% per year, insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder and one of the most widespread diseases in western industrialized countries. Moreover, demographic trends in these countries suggest that the societal relevance of insomnia might even increase in the future, given the fact that the prevalence rises with age. Insomnia is also closely linked to depression, as epidemiological (insomnia as a predictor of depression, see) and neurobiological (for a systematic review, see) research suggests. It seems therefore particularly important to understand underlying features of insomnia related to mood and affect.

Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by nocturnal symptoms of difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, and by daytime symptoms that impair occupational, social, or other areas of functioning. Insomnia disorder can exist alone or in conjunction with comorbid medical and/or psychiatric conditions. The incidence of insomnia is higher in women and can increase during certain junctures of a woman's life (e.g., pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause). This article will focus on an overview of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, evidence of effectiveness for this treatment when insomnia disorder is experienced alone or in parallel with a comorbidity, and a review with promising data on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when present during postpartum and menopause.

### Athens insomnia scale: validation of an instrument based on ICD-10 criteria [^23902be4]. Journal of Psychosomatic Research (2000). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS)" for insomnia.

The Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) is a clinical calculator used to assess the severity of insomnia in adults. It is a self-assessment psychometric instrument designed to quantify sleep difficulty based on the ICD-10 criteria. The AIS is particularly useful in both clinical practice and research settings for diagnosing insomnia, evaluating the severity of insomnia, and monitoring treatment response.

The AIS consists of eight items: the first five pertain to sleep induction, awakenings during the night, final awakening, total sleep duration, and sleep quality, while the last three refer to well-being, functioning capacity, and sleepiness during the day. Each item is rated on a 0–3 scale, with higher scores indicating more severe insomnia.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the AIS, but it is not designed for use in children or adolescents. Additionally, it may not be as effective in individuals with certain medical conditions or psychiatric disorders that could affect sleep, such as sleep apnea or major depressive disorder.

The Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) assesses sleep difficulties through eight questions about different aspects of sleep and its effects on daytime life. The inputs relate to:

- Sleep induction (how long it takes to fall asleep)
- Nocturnal awakenings
- Timing of final awakening
- Total sleep duration
- Overall sleep quality
- Sense of well-being during the day
- Daytime functioning
- Daytime sleepiness

Each response is associated with a specific score as follows:

- **Sleep induction**:
- No problem = 0
- Slightly delayed = 1
- Markedly delayed = 2
- Very delayed or did not sleep at all = 3

- **Nocturnal awakenings**:
- No problem = 0
- Minor problem = 1
- Considerable problem = 2
- Serious problem or did not sleep at all = 3

- **Final awakening earlier than desired**:
- Not earlier = 0
- A little earlier = 1
- Markedly earlier = 2
- Much earlier or did not sleep at all = 3

- **Total sleep duration**:
- Sufficient = 0
- Slightly insufficient = 1
- Markedly insufficient = 2
- Very insufficient or did not sleep at all = 3

- **Overall sleep quality**:
- Satisfactory = 0
- Slightly unsatisfactory = 1
- Markedly unsatisfactory = 2
- Very unsatisfactory or did not sleep at all = 3

- **Daytime sense of well-being**:
- Normal = 0
- Slightly decreased = 1
- Markedly decreased = 2
- Very decreased = 3

- **Daytime functioning**:
- Normal = 0
- Slightly decreased = 1
- Markedly decreased = 2
- Very decreased = 3

- **Daytime sleepiness**:
- None = 0
- Mild = 1
- Considerable = 2
- Intense = 3

To compute the AIS score, each response is converted into its numerical counterpart based on these predefined scales. The scores for all responses are then summed to produce a total score. This overall score ranges from 0 to 24, providing insight into the severity of insomnia.

The interpretation of the total score is straightforward:

- A score of 6 or more indicates that the criteria for insomnia are met, suggesting significant sleep problems.
- A score below 6 indicates that the criteria for insomnia are not met, suggesting more typical sleep patterns.

### Insomnia in the elderly: a review [^4a8c8c9b]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Insomnia remains one of the most common sleep disorders encountered in the geriatric clinic population, frequently characterized by the subjective complaint of difficulty falling or maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative sleep, producing significant daytime symptoms including difficulty concentrating and mood disturbances.

Methods

A search of the literature was conducted to review the epidemiology, definition, and age-related changes in sleep, as well as factors contributing to late-life insomnia and scales utilized for the assessment of insomnia in older people. The aim is to summarize recent diagnostic guidelines and both nonpharmacological and pharmacological strategies for the management of insomnia in the older population.

Results

Insomnia remains a clinical diagnosis. There are several demographic, psychosocial, biologic, and behavioral factors that can contribute to late-life insomnia. Older adults are at higher risk for the medical and psychiatric effects of insomnia.

Conclusions

The most important aspect in evaluation of insomnia is detailed history taking and thorough physical examination. Nonpharmacological treatment options have favorable and enduring benefits compared to pharmacological therapy.

### Subtyping primary insomnia: is sleep state misperception a distinct clinical entity? [^d34f4689]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Among the range of primary insomnia subtypes, those assigned such labels as subjective insomnia or sleep state misperception historically have been among the most intriguing yet challenging to understand and manage clinically. Such patients who produce seemingly normal polysomnograms often present rather compelling and, at times, dramatic sleep complaints. Our earliest formal sleep nosology included a separate diagnostic category for such individuals, but little research has been devoted to this insomnia subtype in the 20 years since this classification scheme was proposed. As a result, use of diagnoses such as subjective insomnia or sleep state misperception have remained controversial. The current article reviews this controversy and highlights the major criticisms forged against subdividing primary insomnia into objective and subjective subtypes. Subsequently, the relative merits of these criticisms are considered in view of early and recent findings vis-à-vis the subjective/objective insomnia dichotomy. Although available data are not conclusive, there appears to be sufficient evidence to suggest subjective and objective insomnia subtypes may suffer from distinctive forms of sleep-related pathophysiology. We conclude by advocating continued study of the subjective insomnia phenomenon and by providing specific directions for relevant future research.

### Insomnia [^a9f76275]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Insomnia is one of the most prevalent health concerns in the population and in clinical practice. Clinicians may be reluctant to address insomnia because of its many potential causes, unfamiliarity with behavioral treatments, and concerns about pharmacologic treatments.

Objective

To review the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of insomnia in adults.

Evidence Review

Systematic review to identify and summarize previously published quantitative reviews (meta-analyses) of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for insomnia.

Findings

Insomnia is a common clinical condition characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, accompanied by symptoms such as irritability or fatigue during wakefulness. The prevalence of insomnia disorder is approximately 10% to 20%, with approximately 50% having a chronic course. Insomnia is a risk factor for impaired function, development of other medical and mental disorders, and increased health care costs. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia involve genetic, environmental, behavioral, and physiological factors culminating in hyperarousal. The diagnosis of insomnia is established by a thorough history of sleep behaviors, medical and psychiatric problems, and medications, supplemented by a prospective record of sleep patterns (sleep diary). Quantitative literature reviews (meta-analyses) support the efficacy of behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacologic interventions for insomnia. Brief behavioral interventions and Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy both show promise for use in primary care settings. Among pharmacologic interventions, the most evidence exists for benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, although persistent concerns focus on their safety relative to modest efficacy. Behavioral treatments should be used whenever possible, and medications should be limited to the lowest necessary dose and shortest necessary duration.

Conclusions and Relevance

Clinicians should recognize insomnia because of its effects on function and health. A thorough clinical history is often sufficient to identify factors that contribute to insomnia. Behavioral treatments should be used when possible. Hypnotic medications are also efficacious but must be carefully monitored for adverse effects.

### Acupuncture for insomnia [^e7283c2c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Insomnia is a subjective complaint of poor sleep, which may produce impairment in daytime function or mood. The 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐V) defines insomnia disorder as subjective difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or non‐restorative sleep lasting at least three months (APA 2013). Insomnia is very common and can be acute, intermittent, or chronic (AASM 2014). More than 100 differential diagnoses of insomnia have been listed in the revised edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (AASM 2014). In order to meet the diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder, one must have sleeping difficulties at least three nights per week for at least three months despite adequate opportunity for sleep and resulting in at least one associated daytime impairment affecting social, occupational, academic, or other essential areas of functioning (AASM 2014; APA 2013). Since there is no universally established definition of 'normal' sleep, the estimates of insomnia prevalence vary widely due to differences in case definitions, assessment procedures, sample characteristics, and time intervals between assessments. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) has estimated that about 30% of adults experience symptoms of insomnia (AASM 2005).

In Hong Kong and the USA, the prevalence of insomnia disorders was found to be 22.1%, 3.9%, and 14.7% for DSM‐IV, ICD‐10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision), and ICSD‐2 (International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition), respectively (Chung 2015). Women and older adults tend to report higher rates of sleep problems (Crowley 2011; Jaussent 2011; Suh 2018). The COVID‐19 pandemic further exacerbated the burden of insomnia (Halsøy 2021). There has been evidence from multiple sources suggesting that the world is facing an increasing risk of insomnia, with 37% of adults, 39% of healthcare workers, 58% of university students, 54% of people with COVID‐19 infection, and 53% of pregnant women suffering from insomnia‐related symptoms (Morin 2021; Pappa 2020; Yuan 2022).

### Sleep disorders and the risk of cognitive decline or dementia: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies [^1228a3f0]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Assessment of study quality

Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) by two researchers (XYL and JO) (NOS: The NOS consists of nine items. Each item is assigned a star if the study meets the criteria of the item. The studies were divided into three categories: high quality (> 7 stars), medium quality (5–6 stars), low quality (< 4 stars).

Definitions

We assessed the independent variables (i.e. sleep disorders, including insomnia, SRBD, EDS, sleep quality, sleep duration, circadian rhythm, SRMD, and RBD) with the dependent variables (dementia, including dementia of all causes, AD, and VD) and cognitive decline.

Insomnia refers to a clinical condition characterized by dissatisfaction with the quantity or quality of sleep, manifested as difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up early and being unable to fall back asleep. SRBD is a group of disorders characterized by abnormal breathing during sleep, with OSA being the most typical and common. EDS refers to a condition where it is difficult to maintain wakefulness and alertness during primary waking periods. In situations where most people can easily stay awake, patients experience unwanted sleep episodes or fall asleep. Sleep quality refers to a multidimensional measure of subjective perceptions of sleep, including sleep depth, restorative quality (the extent to which one feels refreshed upon waking), and continuity, rather than merely sleep duration. It is a subjective concept. SRMD refers to a class of sleep disorders characterized by simple, repetitive movements that interfere with sleep initiation or maintenance. RBD refers to a parasomnia that occurs during REM sleep, characterized by dream-related behaviors (such as shouting, punching, kicking, or falling) and the absence of REM sleep-related muscle relaxation. The above diagnosis is mainly based on clinical scales and objective sleep monitoring, etc.

The diagnosis of dementia was required to be based on recognized diagnostic criteria, such as from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DMS-IV) criteria and the International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes. Participants were classified as having cognitive decline had a diagnosis of MCI or cognitive impairment. AD and VD, diagnosed primarily based on clinical scales and neuroimaging, are subtypes of dementia.

Criterion A requires that the patient (or the patient's parent or caregiver) reports or observes one or more of the following: difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, final awakening earlier than desired, resistance to going to bed on appropriate schedule, or difficulty sleeping without parent or caregiver intervention. Criterion B requires one or more daytime problems related to the nighttime sleep difficulty, including fatigue/malaise, impaired attention, concentration, or memory, impaired social, family, occupational, or academic performance, mood disturbance/irritability, subjective daytime sleepiness, behavioral problems (e.g., hyperactivity, impulsivity, aggression), reduced motivation/energy/initiative, proneness for errors/accidents, and concerns about or dissatisfaction with sleep. Criterion C specifies that the reported sleep/wake complaints cannot be explained purely by inadequate opportunity (i.e., time allotted for sleep) or inadequate circumstances (i.e., safety, darkness, quiet, and comfortable) for sleep. Criterion D requires frequency such that the sleep disturbance and associated daytime symptoms occur at least three times per week, and Criterion E requires duration such that these symptoms have been present for at least three months.

### Medical cannabis for the treatment of insomnia [^5bde749f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Insomnia involves difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime consequences, not due to environmental factors or inadequate sleep opportunities, as defined by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD‐3). Chronic insomnia persists for at least three months, with symptoms occurring at least three times per week, while short‐term insomnia lasts less than three months. Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder, with approximately 6% to 10% of the population meeting the criteria for insomnia; up to 25% of adults being dissatisfied with their sleep; and up to 10% to 15% experiencing insomnia symptoms severe enough to cause daytime distress or impairments. Insomnia prevalence increases with age and is twice as prevalent in women as in men. It often presents independently or alongside other medical or psychiatric conditions such as chronic pain, fibromyalgia, cancer, major depression, or substance misuse. It is characterised by dissatisfaction with sleep quality or duration, difficulty falling asleep, waking up at night or too early in the morning, or non‐restorative sleep, leading to daytime fatigue, low energy, cognition issues, and mood disturbances.

Despite its high prevalence and burden, insomnia often remains unrecognised and untreated, being a major public health issue due to the associated increased risk for medical (e.g. hypertension), psychiatric (e.g. depression), and occupational (e.g. absenteeism) morbidity and mortality. Treatment should be initiated promptly when individuals report sleep disturbances, particularly if these complaints are severe enough to meet the criteria for an insomnia disorder. Treatment options include non‐pharmacological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTi) and sleep hygiene education, which are first‐line treatments with reported improvement in approximately 60% of patients. Pharmacological therapies include antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, trazodone), benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g. flurazepam, eszopiclone), and antipsychotics (e.g. quetiapine, olanzapine).

### Finding the balance between lumping and splitting. A response to martin et al [^ea98fe1a]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Pearson correlations among the pilot items that split the three insomnia symptoms v. the lumped symptom

Martin et al. also pointed out that we did not extract mentions of 'awakening' in diagnostic criteria as indexing insomnia. For example, in nightmare disorder we did not code the diagnostic criterion 'On awakening from the dysphoric dreams, the individual rapidly becomes oriented and alert' as including insomnia as a symptom.

If we reconsider our results incorporating both the tripartite symptom split for insomnia, and the three instances of 'awakening' noted by Martin et al. the symptoms would occur with the following frequency: insomnia in 16 diagnoses (six chapters), difficulty initiating sleep in four diagnoses (three chapters), difficulty maintaining sleep in seven diagnoses (three chapters), and waking up earlier than desired in three diagnoses (three chapters). As a consequence, insomnia would be ranked fourth in Table 2 of Forbes et al. rather than first, and the difficulties maintaining sleep in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, nightmare disorder, and restless legs syndrome would no longer be omitted.

### Workplace psychosocial resources and risk of sleep disturbances among employees [^2041fe30]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Assessment of Sleep Disturbances

Sleep disturbances were defined as self-reported difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, nonrestorative sleep, or daytime tiredness during the past 4 weeks (for WEHD and FPS) or 3 months (for SLOSH) according to the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire (3 or 4 items; for WEHD and SLOSH) or Jenkins Sleep Problem Scale (4 items; for FPS) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Sleep disturbances were identified if respondents reported any of the symptoms at least often or all the time (in WEHD), 2 to 4 nights per week (in FPS), or 3 to 4 nights per week (in SLOSH), and the same criteria were used for indicating insomnia. An alternative definition was applied to indicate the overall severity of the sleep disturbances (identified when the mean value was greater than or equal to the corresponding value of the aforementioned threshold).

Covariates

Potential confounders were identified using directed acyclic graphs based on previous evidence, and included age, sex, country of birth (categorized as Scandinavian countries, other European countries, and other continents), marital status (married or cohabiting, single, separated or divorced, and widowed), highest educational level achieved (≤ 9, 10–12, and ≥ 13 years), type of employment contract (permanent, and nonpermanent), preexisting comorbidities, and preexisting mental disorders. Information on these variables were extracted from national registers in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, except that marital status and employment contract in SLOSH and marital status in FPS were self-reported. Information on country of birth was not available in FPS. Preexisting comorbidities according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index and preexisting mental disorders were detected using the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8), International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes from the national patient registries (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 1). Self-reported night shift work (yes and no) was also a potential confounder; however, night shift data were not available in FPS wave 2010 (wave 2).

### Influence of poor sleep on cardiovascular disease-free life expectancy: a multi-resource-based population cohort study [^624a6db0]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CVD incidence and all-cause mortality

We identified the incidence of hospital inpatient disease events based on ICD-9 and ICD-10: CVD (I01 to I09, I11, I13, I21 to I25, I27, I3, I4, I50, I51, I6, I7, I80 to I84, I87 to I9, R54). The corresponding ICD-9 was provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. The date of events and death were retrieved from the NHS electronic health records described above.

Sleep Exposure

As part of the baseline questionnaire, participants reported five sleep characteristics, based on which we further identified five healthy phenotypes, including no usual insomnia complaints, adequate sleep duration (7 to < 9 h/day), no snoring, morning chronotype, and no frequent daytime sleepiness. We scored participants from 0 to 5, according to the count of healthy characteristics and categorized them into three groups: "healthy sleep" (≥ 4 composite sleep score); "intermediate sleep" (2 or 3 score); and "poor sleep" (≤ 1 score). This categorization has been proven to distinguish different CVD risk profiles, and the simple addition approach showed a similar predictive power to a weighted score. The original questions and options were provided in Additional file 1: Table S2. These definitions and scores have shown excellent convergent validity with CVD incidence and mortality.

We identified recent clinical sleep disorder events (2 years before enrolment) based on inpatient admissions, primary care clinical events, and sleep disorder-specific prescriptions (BNF Chapter 4 Sect. 1: hypnotics and anxiolytics). Modified from the definition provided by the American Sleep Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine, we distinguished five different sleep disorders, including insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and parasomnias (including sleep-related bruxism). In addition, we grouped hypersomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, parasomnias, non-specific sleep disorders (e.g. "poor sleep pattern"), and sleep medication prescriptions without a corresponding clinical event into "other sleep disorders". We provided detailed codes for each classification system in Additional file 1: Table S3-5. Since the clinical diagnosis of sleep disorders mainly refers to more than one self-reported sleep characteristic, we did not further integrate both self-reported and clinically unhealthy sleep.

### How do teenagers sleep? Analysis of factors related to sleep disorders in a group of Polish high school students [^b130409b]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder not only in the adult population but also among adolescents. According to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10), inorganic insomnia is defined as insufficient quantity and/or quality of sleep, occurring at least 3 times a week for at least one month, not caused by somatic and/or neurological causes, which results in deterioration of well-being and functioning. On the other hand, according to the DSM V criteria, insomnia is defined as the predominant sleep dissatisfaction despite having an appropriate opportunity to sleep, including difficulties in falling asleep and / or staying asleep and/or waking up early with an inability to return to sleep. Symptoms should persist for at least 1 month and cause significant suffering to the patient or limit his/her functioning, both socially and professionally. Insomnia is rarely an isolated symptom, it frequently coexists with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, somatization disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and correlates with harmful usage and addiction to alcohol, caffeine, tobacco or marijuana - substances that cause activation of the CNS, hindering falling asleep and restful sleep. Insomnia also often occurs in the course of somatic diseases - it accompanies chronic pain, cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease), respiratory diseases (obstructive lung diseases), digestive system diseases (reflux disease) or metabolic diseases (obesity, diabetes). Applied pharmacotherapy of somatic diseases can also lead to sleep disorders. Despite the fact that these problems most often occur in the elderly, the studies conducted so far have shown that it may also affect from 4% to even 39% of adolescents. Causes may be both genetic factors (higher incidence of insomnia in children of sick parents), as well as the biological, social or environmental ones. Among biological factors changes like CNS development that causes shifts in the sleep architecture - slow reduction in the amount of slow-wave sleep and the start of the REM phase, prolongation of the N1 and N2 stages as well as the wakefulness interfered during sleep, shortening of N3 sleep associated with a sharp decrease in delta power, are taken into consideration. Genetically determined is also the so-called. "night owl" chronotype - increased activity shift towards evenings hours, resulting in a delay in falling asleep, difficulties in waking up and morning drowsiness. Sleep disorders are also clearly related to gender. Female sex determines hormonal changes, resulting in greater neuroendocrine sensitivity, and thus stress reactivity affecting sleep. Also, stress itself, as an environmental factor, is not without significance in reducing the amount and quality of sleep by activating the sympathetic nervous system and increasing cortisol secretion which puts the body in a state of agitation, which makes it difficult to fall asleep and also disturbs the continuity of sleep. Recently, the tendency to use electronic devices at bedtime, which is frequent, especially in the group of young people, has become very important -exposure to artificial light in the evening and also emotional approach to the posted content may hinder the process of falling asleep.

### Common sleep disorders in adults: diagnosis and management [^9d8a6982]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population and are associated with adverse effects such as motor vehicle collisions, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized into three groups: people with problems falling asleep, people with behavior and movement disturbances during sleep, and people with excessive daytime sleepiness. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is defined by difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or both, resulting in daytime consequences. Insomnia is diagnosed by history and is treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without medications. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in patients acting out their dreams with potentially harmful effects. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is diagnosed by polysomnography and treated with melatonin or clonazepam. Restless legs syndrome is defined by an urge to move the legs that worsens when at rest. Restless legs syndrome is treated with gabapentin or dopamine agonists, depending on the severity. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep hallucinations. Diagnosis is suggested by the history and can be confirmed with polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test the following day. Narcolepsy is treated with behavior modifications and medications such as stimulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sodium oxybate, and pitolisant. Obstructive sleep apnea may be diagnosed in patients with excessive snoring and witnessed apneas and can be diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Treatment consists of positive airway pressure therapy while sleeping in conjunction with weight loss.

### Interactive association between insomnia symptoms and sleep duration for the risk of dementia-a prospective study in the Swedish national March cohort [^9567a257]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Ascertainment of dementia

Using participants' national registration number, information regarding the first date when dementia was ascertained was obtained from the Swedish National Patient Registers or the Swedish Cause of Death Register. The National Patient Register covers discharge following all in-patient care in Sweden since 1987. Since 2001 outpatient doctor visits from both private and public caregivers are also covered. Mortality data were obtained by linkage to the Swedish Cause of Death Register. Individuals with dementia as the underlying cause of death were identified. All events were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10). We used the following codes to identify dementia: 290.0, 290.1, 290.4, 294.1, 290.8, 290.9, 331.0, 331.1, 331.2, 331.9 (ICD-9) and F00, F01, F02, F03, G30, G31.1, G31.8, F05.1 (ICD-10). In the Swedish healthcare system, dementia was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). AD was diagnosed according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke and the AD and Related Disorders Association criteria. Cases of dementia without neuroimaging and without sufficient clinical details in the medical records to set a specific dementia subtype diagnosis were classified as unspecified dementia.

Covariates

Selection of potential confounding factors was based on the Lancet Commission's 2020 report on dementia prevention, intervention and care, as well as subject matter knowledge guided by directed acyclic graphs. Details are given in Supplement (Appendix 1).

### Insomnia is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the clinical setting [^89238500]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Follow-up of patients and identification of the development of T2DM

We followed participants with pre-diabetes from T 0 until the earliest of the following events occurred: T2DM diagnosis, loss of Kaiser Permanente membership (> 3 months break in coverage), death, bariatric surgery, or end of study follow-up (December 31, 2016). Patients were determined to have a T2DM diagnosis when two of the following occurred within a 2-year window: physician-entered outpatient T2DM diagnosis (ICD-9 250.00; ICD-10 E11), dispensing of an antihyperglycemia agent, A1c > 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), and/or FPG > 125 mg/dL. One hospital inpatient stay with an associated T2DM diagnosis was also sufficient for classification of T2DM.

Identification of insomnia and covariates

Participants were determined to have insomnia if they had a physician-entered diagnosis of insomnia (ICD-9 307.40, 307.45–9, 780.50, 780.53, 780.55–9, V69.4, 307.41, 307.42, 780.51, 780.52; ICD-10 F51.01) prior to the diagnosis of diabetes and/or used one or more medications predominantly prescribed for sleep problems in this health plan (eg, trazodone, eszopiclone, zaleplon, or zolpidem) in the 12 months prior to the diagnosis of diabetes.

We also collected data on potential covariates that might influence the development or detection of T2DM: age, body mass index (BMI), sex, race (black, Asian, white, other), ethnicity (Hispanic, not Hispanic), history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and myocardial infarction, hypertension (measured as ≥ 140/90 or by diagnosis code), elevated triglyceride levels (> 150 mg/dL), and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (< 40 mg/dL).

### Treatment failure and long-term prescription risk for guideline-recommended hypnotics in Japan [^1622ac91]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 6% to 10%. It is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep despite adequate sleep opportunity, resulting in daytime impairment of and interference with social, occupational, and other functions. Insomnia not only increases the risk of mental and physical illnessbut also results in increased economic costs, decreased work productivity, and increased workplaceand traffic accidents.

The main treatments for chronic insomnia disorders involve psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Most clinical guidelines recommend cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as a first-line treatment because of its superior benefit-to-harm ratio compared with that of pharmacotherapy. Reportedly, the acceptability of CBT-I and pharmacotherapy do not differ, and CBT-I results in higher sleep efficiency after treatment and in the 1- to 3-month and 4- to 11-month follow-up periods. However, because CBT-I is not available for all patients with chronic insomnia disorders, many affected patients are treated with pharmacotherapy.

### Effect of interventions for the management of sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1aa9be6d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Long COVID is a complex condition characterized by more than 200 documented symptomsthat persist or develop following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. This multisystemic disease affects various bodily functions and causes significant neurological and psychological distress. According to the World Health Organization, 10–20% of COVID-19 patients go on to develop long COVID. With over 65 million cases reported worldwide as of 2023, long COVID presents challenges across all demographics, with particular prevalence in females and adults aged 18 years and older, regardless of the initial infection's severity.

Long COVID has many definitions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, patients with long COVID experience a "range of ongoing symptoms and conditions" lasting at least 3 months postinfection. The National Center for Infectious Diseases describes it as a group of symptoms in recovered COVID-19 patients that "persist or emerge four weeks after the initial infection". The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence further defines long COVID as symptoms developing during or after infection that prolong for "more than 12 weeks" and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Additionally, the World Health Organization characterizes long COVID as the persistence or emergence of new symptoms 3 months after initial infection, lasting at least 2 months without any other explanation.

Among the neurological and psychological symptoms reported, sleep disturbances are particularly prevalent. Sleep disturbances encompass disorders that disrupt normal sleep patterns, classified in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition into 6 major categories: insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, hypersomnolence and narcolepsy, circadian rhythm disorders, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders. Studies on long COVID–associated sleep disturbances have identified common issues such as insomnia, frequent awakenings, difficulty falling or staying asleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Chinvararak and Chalderfound that about 46% of patients with long COVID experienced sleep disturbances, with insomnia affecting 38%. Similarly, Seighali et al'smeta-analysis reported a 45% prevalence of sleep disorders among 15,362 patients. If not adequately managed, these disturbances can impair physical, psychological and social health, increase anxietyand dyspnoea, and significantly reduce quality of life.

### Medical ontology learning framework to investigate daytime impairment in insomnia disorder and treatment effects [^57ee2ed5]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In medicine, ontology refers to the formal representation of medical concepts to enable clear and unambiguous communication through defined medical terms, often using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. The development of medical ontologies is rigorous and lengthy, involving the collaboration of knowledge engineers and physicians. Despite these efforts, medical ontologies often lack specificity for a particular disease and are influenced by administrative processes. Recent advancements in natural language processing and the availability of large amounts of semantically rich medical information have given rise to the field of ontology learning. Ontology learning involves the semi-automatic identification and extraction of key concepts from text to enable the construction of an ontology, and can increase the accuracy of disease representations.

Real-world data is now widely used to assess disease burden, treatment effectiveness, and safety. Unlike controlled clinical trials, researchers lack control and guidance over data reporting in real-world studies. Furthermore, real-world evidence studies often suffer from a lack of transparency regarding the reliability of selected ontologies, and a more rigorous assessment of the ontologies utilized is warranted. Here, we introduce the Disease-Specific Medical Ontology Learning (DiSMOL) framework, an innovative approach to ontology learning where pre-existing ontologies are enriched with real-world data and carefully evaluated. DiSMOL uses physician notes to extend medical ontologies, providing first-hand access to real-world reporting practices and language use among healthcare providers. This approach involves elements of deep phenotyping, particularly in systematically characterizing and learning about disease symptoms. However, it is also crucial to recognize that our work extends beyond mere symptom documentation. By incorporating these symptoms into an existing knowledge base, we essentially engage in a form of ontology learning, expanding and refining this knowledge base, which already has a specific structural framework.

### Insomnia is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the clinical setting [^33c4d852]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the possible association between insomnia and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the naturalistic clinical setting.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine the risk of developing T2DM among patients with pre-diabetes with and without insomnia. Participants with pre-diabetes (identified by a physician or via two laboratory tests) between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2015 and without sleep apnea were followed until December 31, 2016. Patients were determined to have T2DM when two of the following occurred within a 2-year window: physician-entered outpatient T2DM diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-9 250.00; ICD-10 E11), dispensing of an antihyperglycemia agent, and hemoglobin A1c (A1c) > 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 125mg/dL. One hospital inpatient stay with an associated T2DM diagnosis was also sufficient for classification of T2DM.

Results

Our cohort consisted of 81233 persons with pre-diabetes, 24146 (29.7%) of whom had insomnia at some point during the 4.3-year average observation period. After adjustment for traditional risk factors, those with insomnia were 28% more likely to develop T2DM than those without insomnia (HR 1.28; 95%CI 1.24 to 1.33). The estimate was essentially unchanged after adjusting for baseline A1c level (HR 1.32; 95%CI 1.25 to 1.40) or FPG (HR 1.28; 95%CI 1.23 to 1.33).

Conclusions

Insomnia imparts an increased risk of T2DM comparable with that conferred by traditional risk factors (eg, overweight, non-white race, cardiovascular risk factors). This association could have clinical importance because it suggests a new potentially modifiable risk factor that could be targeted to prevent diabetes.

### Insomnia is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the clinical setting [^090ffcec]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Setting

Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) is a not-for-profit, group-model integrated delivery system that provides comprehensive medical care to more than 600 000 individuals in the metropolitan area around Portland, Oregon.

Identification of cohort or patients with pre-diabetes

KPNW uses healthcare utilization data to track and facilitate operations. An electronic medical record (EMR), in use since 1996, allows providers to record International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes at each patient contact and to update an electronic problem list, also with ICD codes. A single regional laboratory processes most KPNW outpatient laboratory tests, and the results are stored in a searchable database. A pharmacy is located at each medical clinic, and most members have a pharmacy benefit, ensuring almost complete capture of data on pharmaceutical dispenses. The EMR healthcare utilization data made it possible to determine patient eligibility for the study cohort. To be eligible for the study cohort, participants had to have had pre-diabetes (as defined by a physician diagnosis [ICD-9 790.29; ICD-10 R73.09] or two laboratory tests in the pre-diabetes range (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] from 100 to 125 mg/dL and/or hemoglobin A1c [A1c] from 5.70% to 6.49% [39–47 mmol/mol]) between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2015. Participants' baseline (T 0) was defined as the date of their first indicator of pre-diabetes. Participants had to be continuous members at least 1 year prior to T 0 and 18 years or older at T 0. Participants with obstructive sleep apnea (ICD-9 327.23; ICD-10 G47.33), sleep-disordered breathing (ICD-9 327.2X; ICD-10 G 47.30), restless leg syndrome (ICD-9 333.94; ICD-10 G25.81), and periodic leg movement disorder (ICD-9 327.5; ICD 10 G47.61) up to 1 year prior to T 0, or with T2DM (as described below) or bariatric surgery at any prior date were excluded.

### Medical ontology learning framework to investigate daytime impairment in insomnia disorder and treatment effects [^09849bb4]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Ontology evaluation

While the precision of the ontologies exhibited a similar performance, DiSMOL displayed a substantial increase in sensitivity, improving by 476% from 17% to 98%, and a noteworthy enhancement of the F1-score by 207%, rising from 28% to 86% when compared with ICD-clin. An increase in sensitivity, rising from 17% to 51%, when utilizing ICD-clin-DiSMOL in comparison to ICD-clin, implies that insomnia experts can enhance their code selection by incorporating a broader range of symptoms, as indicated by DiSMOL (Fig. 3). An indication of reduced sensitivity in the ICD benchmarks implies that daytime impairment may be underreported in insurance claims. In this context, DiSMOL stands out as the most accurate method for measuring daytime impairment symptoms. Interestingly the inclusion of patient relevant symptoms did not harm the precision of DiSMOL compared with ICD-clin. This may suggest that symptoms that are relevant to patients are also relevant to clinicians, an observation which warrants further investigations.

Comparison of ontology performance.

This bar chart presents a comparison of three methods — ICD-clin, ICD-clin-DiSMOL, and DiSMOL — across three key performance metrics: Sensitivity, Precision, and F1-Score. DiSMOL demonstrates the highest performance in Sensitivity (98%) and F1-Score (86%), while ICD-clin leads slightly in Precision (78%). ICD-clin-DiSMOL shows moderate scores across all metrics, achieving 51% in Sensitivity, 72% in Precision, and 60% in F1-Score. The source data for Fig. 3 is in Supplementary Data 5.

### Hypersomnia and depressive symptoms: methodological and clinical aspects [^2eb4d97e]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR include a symptom duration criterion of at least one month, and both imply either distress or impairment in social and/or occupational areas. The ICSD-2 is the only system that recommends objective measurement with PSG. However, it does not stipulate the daytime or nocturnal sleep duration, assessment procedures, or pathological cut-offs. Reduced sleep efficiency, increased sleep frequency, and increased number of awakenings together with 'variable but often normal' mean sleep latency on the MSLT were only proposed.

The proposed DSM-5 criteria for sleep-wake disorders nosology planned for publication this year included major changes regarding hypersomnia with elimination of the diagnosis of 'primary hypersomnia' in favor of 'hypersomnia disorder', with concurrent specification of clinically comorbid conditions. These modifications will also lead to elimination of 'sleep disorder related to another mental disorder' and 'sleep disorder due to a general medical condition', in favor of 'hypersomnia disorder' with concurrent specification of clinically comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions. Sleep disorders per se are frequently accompanied by depression, anxiety and other cognitive mental status changes that warrant independent clinical attention and must be addressed in treatment management. As the primary users of DSM are mental health and general medical clinicians, not sleep disorder specialists, new DSM5 sleep-wake disorders criteria also included aggregation of hypersomnia disorder and narcolepsy without cataplexy, which will be distinguished from narcolepsy-cataplexy/hypocretin-1 deficiency disorder. Based on a recent cross-sectional telephone survey, a new definition of hypersomnia has been proposed in the upcoming DSM-5 revision including a frequency of 'excessive sleepiness' (defined by either recurrent periods of irrepressible need to sleep or to nap within the same day; recurrent naps within the same day; a nonrestorative/unrefreshing prolonged main sleep episode of nine hours or more; and/or confusional arousals-sleep drunkenness) at least three times per week for at least three months, despite normal main sleep duration lasting seven hours or longer, with significant daytime distress/impairment leading to a final prevalence of 1.5%.

### Medical ontology learning framework to investigate daytime impairment in insomnia disorder and treatment effects [^ae1fd9c0]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Specificity challenges frequently arise in medical ontology used for the representation of real-world data, particularly in defining mental health disorders within widely used classification systems such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). This study aims to address these challenges by introducing the Disease-Specific Medical Ontology Learning (DiSMOL) framework, designed to generate precise disease representations from clinical physician notes, with a focus on daytime impairment in insomnia disorder.

Methods

The study applied the Disease-Specific Medical Ontology Learning framework to clinical notes to better represent daytime impairment. The framework's performance was compared to insomnia expert-selected codes from ICD. Key statistical methods included sensitivity and F1-score comparisons, as well as analysis of symptom changes after the use of various medications, including benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and trazodone.

Results

The DiSMOL framework significantly enhances the identification of daytime impairment in people with insomnia. Sensitivity increases from 17% to 98%, and the F1-score improves from 28% to 86%, compared with expert-selected ICD codes. Additionally, the framework reveals significant increases in daytime impairment symptoms following benzodiazepine use (18.9%), while traditional ICD codes do not detect any significant change.

Conclusions

The study demonstrates that DiSMOL offers a more accurate method for identifying specific disease aspects, such as daytime impairment in insomnia, than traditional coding systems. These findings highlight the potential of specialized ontologies to enhance the representation and analysis of real-world clinical data, with important implications for healthcare policy and personalized medicine.

Group III: temporal, spatial, and population distribution of SCI applications

In addition to the 19 studies previously discussed, we included 285 studies that employed the SCI (Additional file 2: Tables S10 and S11) as a general measurement tool for insomnia. Figure 4 provides an overview of the utilization of the SCI across populations (Fig. 4 A), study types (Fig. 4 B), and global distributions on sample sizes (Fig. 4 C) and study sizes (Fig. 4 D) over the 13 years from 2012 to 2024 since the creation of the SCI. In particular, utilization of the SCI has steadily increased each year across both clinical populations (classified under ICD-11 disease categories) and non-clinical populations (classification: adults, students, adolescents, medical workers, workers, military personnel, pregnant women, and women). Four types of study design were employed: cross-sectional (k = 149), longitudinal (k = 51), case–control (k = 6), and trials (k = 79). The SCI had been used at least in 31 regions, with the largest sample and study sizes observed in the UK, USA, and Italy. Overall, the sample sizes of these SCI studies ranged from 2 to 290,000, with a cumulative total of more than 720,000 participants (N = 722,253). Of these, 20 were online studies and the source of the sample was treated to be the same as the original place of the first or corresponding author. Notably, 74 large-scale surveys had sample sizes greater than 1000 participants each. Most studies used validated versions of the SCI in each language, except for one Korean study. Studies (k = 48) used different cut-off values of the SCI, studies (k = 269) that used the SCI for evaluation purposes calculated a total score to assess insomnia or sleep condition, and a few studies (k = 2) simply used items from the SCI.

Group II: STARD

The STARD guidelines were used to assess the quality of the selected studies exploring the diagnostic accuracy of the SCI. The STARD checklist, consisting of 30 items, was used to assess the accuracy, completeness, potential bias, and generalizability of the diagnostic accuracy studies. Each study was examined for its scientific and clinical background, eligibility criteria, reference standard, and index test descriptions, with attention to the handling of indeterminate items and the results of diagnostic accuracy measures. The overall quality of each language version was rated as "poor" (< 50%), "moderate" (50–75%), or "good" (> 75%) based on the number of STARD criteria met.

Group III: Application

This group included all studies that utilized either the partial or full forms of the SCI for evaluating insomnia or sleep conditions. General information was extracted from all these studies to provide an overview of SCI applications across three dimensions: populations, study types, and global distributions.

7A00 Chronic insomnia International Classification of Diseases for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics, 11th Revision, v2025-01. Chronic insomnia is a frequent and persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep and that results in general sleep dissatisfaction and some form of daytime impairment. Daytime symptoms typically include fatigue, depressed mood or irritability, general malaise, and cognitive impairment. The sleep disturbance and associated daytime symptoms occur at least several times per week for at least 3 months. Some individuals with chronic insomnia may show a more episodic course, with recurrent episodes of sleep/wake difficulties lasting several weeks at a time over several years. Individuals who report sleep related symptoms in the absence of daytime impairment are not regarded as having an insomnia disorder.

If the insomnia is due to another sleep-wake disorder, a mental disorder, another medical condition, or a substance or medication, chronic insomnia should only be diagnosed if the insomnia is an independent focus of clinical attention. postcoordination Add Stem and/or Extension codes to form a cluster code which adds detail to the condition.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^0057ff9c]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic insomnia disorder — diagnostic criteria and evaluation — is described as an insomnia disorder occurring at least three times per week and lasting more than three months in duration, and the diagnosis requires a clinical evaluation including a sleep, medical, and psychiatric history. Insomnia questionnaires may be useful screening tools but are not diagnostic for chronic insomnia disorder, and in routine clinical practice objective measures are not indicated for the evaluation of insomnia unless there is a clinical suspicion of OSA or another sleep disorder; examples include objective measures, such as actigraphy or polysomnography (PSG). Chronic insomnia disorder is a diagnosis based on a thorough sleep history and clinical evaluation; objective testing is not required, and while short-term insomnia disorder symptoms are noted as present for < 3 months, the focus of this guideline is patients experiencing chronic insomnia disorder.

### Management of common sleep disorders [^bd32b810]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are common and affect sleep quality and quantity, leading to increased morbidity. Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized as those who cannot sleep, those who will not sleep, those with excessive daytime sleepiness, and those with increased movements during sleep. Insomnia, defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that results in daytime impairment, is diagnosed using history findings and treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without sleep hypnotics. Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an urge to move the legs that worsens with rest, is relieved by movement, and often occurs in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome is treated based on the frequency of symptoms. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. It is diagnosed using a sleep log or actigraphy, followed by overnight polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test. Narcolepsy is treated with stimulants, such as modafinil; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; or gamma hydroxybutyric acid (sodium oxybate). Patients with snoring and witnessed apneas may have obstructive sleep apnea, which is diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Continuous positive airway pressure is the most common and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in the patient acting out dreams with possible harmful consequences. It is diagnosed based on history and polysomnography findings, and treated with environmental safety measures and melatonin or clonazepam.

RESULTS

There were 116,541 individuals in the MarketScan databases with a qualifying diagnosis of AD between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018 (Fig. 1). Of these, 112,466 were between the ages of 50 and 99 at their first AD diagnosis during the selection window. We excluded 61,128 individuals because they did not meet the initial continuous enrollment criteria and an additional 14,473 individuals because they had a prior diagnosis of AD. This left 36,865 qualifying adults with AD, of which 5,374 (14.6%) had a diagnosis of insomnia or claim for an insomnia medication in the 3 months preceding or 12 months following their AD diagnosis.

### Increased susceptibility to new-onset atrial fibrillation in diabetic women with poor sleep behaviour traits: findings from the prospective cohort study in the UK biobank [^2d57e1c2]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of sleep behaviour traits

The UK Biobank collected the baseline sleep data from each participant through a questionnaire. These sleep-related questions were carefully curated by international sleep experts and drew from questionnaires used in previous observational studies, clinical trials and population surveys. The questionnaire design aimed to strike a balance between exploring sleep patterns in-depth and minimising participant burden. Sleep behaviour traits assessed included sleep duration, chronotype, insomnia, snoring and daytime sleepiness.
Sleep Duration: Participants reported their average 24-h sleep duration, including naps. Their sleep duration was then categorised as short (≤ 5 h), proper (6–8 h) or long (≥ 9 h).
Chronotype: This metric distinguishes between participants with a propensity for morning or evening activities, classified as either a 'definite morning type' or a 'definite evening type'. Morning types typically commence their day early and exhibit peak alertness in the morning, while evening types tend to stay up late, with peak alertness manifesting in the evening. Furthermore, participants were subsequently classified as either an early chronotype (definitely a 'morning' person or more a 'morning' than an 'evening' person) or a non-early chronotype.
Insomnia: Participants were evaluated for insomnia symptoms based on the frequency of sleep onset difficulties or nocturnal awakenings, categorised as 'never/rarely' or 'often' insomnia.
Snoring: Assessment of snoring relied on participants' self-reported sleep habits and feedback from their spouses or close relatives regarding their snoring habits, grouped as 'never/rarely snore' or 'frequent snorers'.
Daytime sleepiness: Participants were asked about the frequency of unintentional dozing during daily activities, classified as 'never/rarely' or 'often' daytime sleepiness. The detailed survey questions are presented in Additional file 1: Table S1.

Assessment of AF

The UK Biobank integrated multiple data sources, including death registries, primary care records, hospitalisation records and self-reports, to develop diagnostic algorithms for specific health conditions. Diagnosis of AF was based on code I48 in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). In this study, the date of the first record labelled as code I48 constituted the initial diagnosis date of AF for each participant. Data were continuously updated for all participants, with 1 April 2023 marking the end of the study's follow-up period.

Participants further self-reported age, sex, caffeine intake (self-reported cups of tea per day and cups of coffee per day), daytime napping (Do you have a nap during the day?), smoking status, alcohol intake frequency (never, once/week, 2–3 times/week, 4–6 times/week, daily), chronotype (Do you consider yourself to be…, with the following response options: Definitely a 'morning' person, More a 'morning' than 'evening' person, More an 'evening' than a 'morning' person, and Definitely an 'evening' person), menopause status, and employment status during assessment. Socio-economic status was represented by the Townsend deprivation index based on national census data immediately preceding participation in the UK Biobank. Weight and height were measured and BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height² (m²). Cases of sleep apnea were determined from self-report during nurse-led interviews or health records using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes for sleep apnea (G47.3). Cases of insomnia were determined from self-report to the question, Do you have trouble falling asleep at night or do you wake up in the middle of the night? with responses never/rarely, sometimes, usually, prefer not to answer. Participants who responded usually were set as insomnia cases, and remaining participants were set as controls. Missing covariates were imputed using sex-specific median values for continuous variables (i.e. BMI, caffeine intake, alcohol intake, and Townsend index), or using a missing indicator approach for categorical variables (i.e. napping, smoking, menopause, employment, and chronotype).

Sleep Status Groups

After each evaluation, participants were classified into 1 of 3 sleep status groups according to a standard algorithm used in our research program. This algorithm uses a combination of criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition)and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision and reported use of sleep-promoting medications. Responses from the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating higher severity of insomnia)and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Indexand to questions on use of sleep medication were used to classify participants into 1 of the 3 groups. The reference period for these assessments was the past month.

Insomnia Syndrome

Participants in this group met all diagnostic criteria for insomnia. They were dissatisfied with their sleep patterns (score of 3 or 4 on the ISI scale) and presented with symptoms of initial insomnia (sleep onset latency > 30 minutes), middle insomnia (wake time after sleep onset > 30 minutes), or late insomnia (morning awakening > 30 minutes before desired wake time) at least 3 nights per week for at least 1 month; they reported significant psychological distress or impairments in daytime functioning associated with sleep difficulties (score of 3 or 4 for 1 of these 2 items on the ISI scale). Participants using prescribed medication for sleep 3 nights or more per week were also classified in this group.

Subsyndromal Insomnia

Participants in the group with subsyndromal insomnia reported symptoms of insomnia at least 3 nights per week without meeting all criteria for an insomnia syndrome (ie, did not report distress, daytime impairments, or dissatisfaction with sleep, and sleep difficulties lasted < 1 month). Participants who were dissatisfied with their sleep but did not present with symptoms of insomnia and those using prescribed medication or over-the-counter sleep-promoting products at least 1 night but less than 3 nights per week were classified in this group.

Good Sleepers

Participants classified as good sleepers were satisfied with their sleep patterns. They did not present with symptoms of insomnia and did not use prescribed or over-the-counter medication to promote sleep.

### Validation of electronic diagnostic codes for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder [^1fad6788]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We investigated the accuracy of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for the identification of veterans with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. The charts of 139 randomly sampled veterans with ≥ 1 ICD-9 and ICD-10 code(s) for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder were reviewed for documentation of a suspected, previous, or current diagnosis; clinical symptoms; and/or empiric treatments for this disorder. Notably, 71 (51.1%) patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder electronic diagnoses had not undergone polysomnography, and 29 (20.9%) had polysomnography reports without commentary on rapid eye movement sleep without atonia. Sleep centers are therefore encouraged to include a brief sentence in polysomnography report templates commenting on the presence/absence of rapid eye movement sleep without atonia.

### Insomnia phenotypes, cardiovascular risk and their link to brain health [^5763fac2]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

About 30% to 40% of the general population experiences insomnia symptoms of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, and another 10% to 15% of the general population experiences chronic insomnia disorder. The prevalence of insomnia is disproportionately higher in people with cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and neurocognitive disorders, including vascular cognitive impairment. In fact, recent meta-analytic evidence from epidemiological studies has demonstrated that insomnia, especially when accompanied by objective short sleep duration, is a risk factor for incident hypertension, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, stroke, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and all-cause mortality. Insomnia should, thus, be part of the prevention and management of these adverse health outcomes. However, randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated whether treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, the first-line guideline-recommended treatment, or hypnotics/sedatives improves heart- or brain-related outcomes. Studies have also failed to consider insomnia a heterogeneous disorder consisting of distinct phenotypes that result from the relative contribution of biological versus cognitive-behavioral perpetuating factors. Objective short sleep duration has emerged as a marker of physiological hyperarousal in insomnia (ie, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, increased sympathetic nervous system activation, and increased inflammation), as a predictor of insomnia-related adverse heart and brain health outcomes and, potentially, poor response to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia. This review summarizes the meta-analytic evidence on the association of insomnia with cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and neurocognitive disorders, including current knowledge on the heterogeneity of the disorder. This review also summarizes the potential pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to heart and brain morbidity, which vary across insomnia phenotypes based on objective sleep duration. This review suggests that basic and clinical sciences need to unveil the molecular, cellular, and behavioral mechanisms at play across insomnia phenotypes, as the public health and clinical implications of their association with adverse heart and brain health are demanding immediate attention.

### Prevalence and risk factors of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in insomnia sufferers: a study on 1311 subjects [^b5e01307]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Population

The sample was comprised of 1311 insomnia sufferers who were recruited retrospectively from the database of the general sleep laboratory of Erasme Hospital, which contains data for 3511 individuals who completed sleep laboratory monitoring in the years 2002–2014. This database includes information regarding a large range of primary sleep disorders and indications.

These insomnia sufferers were referred to the sleep laboratory by physicians specializing in sleep medicine after an ambulatory consultation during which a preliminary assessment of complaints related to sleep, ongoing treatments, somatic and psychiatric comorbidities was carried out systematically, making it possible to conduct a first diagnostic hypothesis. Following this first assessment, a sleep laboratory was offered to all insomnia sufferers to exclude the presence of other sleep pathology and obtain an objective evaluation of their sleep. Thus, only insomnia sufferers who accepted the sleep laboratory are present in the database. Moreover, the data obtained during this ambulatory consultation are systematically checked when the subjects are admitted to the sleep laboratory.

The inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years, the presence of diagnostic criteria A (complaint of difficulty initiating [defined as sleep latency ≥ 30 min at least 3×/week] or maintaining sleep [defined as 3 or more nocturnal awakenings or a long nighttime awakening (30 min or more) or early morning awakening (30 min or more before the usual time) at least 3×/week], or non-restorative sleep, for at least 1 month) and diagnostic criteria B (the sleep disturbance or associated daytime fatigue causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning) of insomnia from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition - Text Revision (DSM IV-TR).

The exclusion criteria included the presence of a major psychiatric disorder (psychotic disorder), uncontrolled heavy somatic disease, chronic pulmonary disease, inflammatory or infectious disease, history of cranial trauma, history of central nervous system injury that could involve respiratory centres in the brain, history of craniofacial or thoracic cavity malformations, pregnancy, OSA already diagnosed or course of treatment before sleep laboratory, predominantly central apnea syndrome, narcolepsy or primary hypersomnia, parasomnia, and presence or history of substance abuse.

### Diagnosis and management of insomnia in dialysis patients [^674aeacd]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

Sleep-related complaints affect 50–80% of patients on dialysis. Sleep disorders impair quality of life significantly. Increasing evidence suggests that sleep disruption has a profound impact both on an individual and on a societal level. The etiology of sleep disorders is often multifactorial: biologic, social, and psychological factors play a role. This is especially true for insomnia, which is the most common sleep disorder in different populations, including patients on dialysis. Biochemical and metabolic changes, lifestyle factors, depression, anxiety, and other underlying sleep disorders can all have an effect on the development and persistence of sleep disruption, leading to chronic insomnia. Insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or having nonrestorative sleep. It is also associated with daytime consequences, such as sleepiness and fatigue, and impaired daytime functioning. In most cases, the diagnosis of insomnia is based on the patient's history, but in some patients objective assessment of sleep pattern may be necessary. Optimally the treatment of insomnia involves the combination of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. In some cases acute insomnia resolves spontaneously, but if left untreated, it may lead to chronic sleep problems. The treatment of chronic insomnia is often challenging. There are only a few studies specifically addressing the management of this sleep disorder in patients with chronic renal disease. Considering the polypharmacy and altered metabolism in this patient population, treatment trials are clearly needed. This article reviews the diagnosis of sleep disorders with a focus on insomnia in patients on dialysis.

### Which older adults receive sleep medicine specialty care? Predictors of being seen by a board-certified sleep medicine provider [^bffd0c16]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

The aim of this study was to characterize older adult Medicare beneficiaries seen by board-certified sleep medicine providers (BCSMPs) and identify predictors of being seen by a BCSMP.

Methods

Our data source was a random 5% sample of Medicare administrative claims data (2006–2013). BCSMPs were identified using a cross-matching procedure based on national provider identifiers available within the Medicare database and assigned based on the first sleep disorder diagnosis received. Sleep disorders (insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, hypersomnias, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, and restless legs syndrome) were operationalized as International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes. The number of sleep disorders per beneficiary was computed and compared between BCSMPs and nonspecialists. Logistic regression was used to identify medical and demographic predictors of being seen by a BCSMP.

Results

A total of 57,209 beneficiaries received one or more sleep disorder diagnoses during the study period. Of these, 1,279 (2.2%) were initially diagnosed by a BCSMP. Relative to individuals seen by nonspecialists, beneficiaries treated by a BCSMP were more likely to have two or more sleep disorders (9.0% vs 24.1%, P < .001). The most common diagnosis assigned by BCSMPs was obstructive sleep apnea (70.4% of patients seen by BCSMPs were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea). The most common diagnosis assigned by nonspecialists was insomnia (48.2% of patients seen by nonspecialists were diagnosed with insomnia). In a fully adjusted regression model, male sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36, 1.72), asthma (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.30, 1.73), and heart failure (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.10, 1.41) were positively associated with being treated by a BCSMP. Conversely, depression (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73, 1.00), anxiety (OR 0.69, 95% CI .59, .82), Alzheimer and related dementias (OR 0.80, 95% CI .65, .99), and anemia (OR .88, 95% CI .78, .99) were associated with a reduced likelihood of being seen by a BCSMP.

Conclusions

Relative to older adults seen by nonspecialists, those seen by BCSMPs are more medically but less psychiatrically complex and are diagnosed with a greater number of sleep disorders. These results suggest the possibility that medically complex patients are referred for specialty care, whereas psychiatrically complex patients might be seen at the nonspecialist level. Further, these results demonstrate the value of board certification in sleep medicine in caring for complex sleep patients.

### Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia on depression and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^51da8682]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, posing a significant public health concern, with an estimated prevalence of 10–30% among adults in the general population. These numbers are greater among patients, with reports estimating 69% prevalence among primary care patients. Insomnia disorder is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – IV (DSM-IV) as the complaint for difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, or restorative sleep for at least 1 month. Such sleep disturbances may cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning. Apart from fatigue, insomnia has also been associated mental disorders, low work productivity, and cognitive impairment. Despite its high prevalence and potentially severe consequences, only a limited number of people seek treatment for insomnia.

Depression and anxiety are the most common comorbid mental disorders associated with insomnia which can also exacerbate the sleep disorder. Recently, epidemiologic studies have reported that insomnia predicts the development of major depression, anxiety, and suicide. Various cross-sectional and longitudinal research have presented insomnia to be associated with an increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders as well as suicide. Those with insomnia reported increased odds of depression and anxiety as compared to those without. Sleep disturbances are detected among 90% of patients with clinical depression, and those with insomnia are ten times more likely to experience clinical depression. As a result, insomnia can be considered a subsequent risk factor for depression due to its bidirectional relationship with depression. Likewise, insomnia is also the most prevalent sleep disturbance associated with anxiety disorders as poor sleep quality has been found among adults with anxiety disorders. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), sleep disturbances are one of the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, which is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about certain events or activities. Moreover, studies have found generalized anxiety disorder to be the most prevalent psychiatric diagnosis among patients with insomnia, thus presenting as a significant comorbid disorder.

### Physician and patient factors associated with the prescribing of medications for sleep difficulties that are associated with high abuse potential or are expensive: an analysis of data from the national ambulatory medical care survey for 1996–2001 [^f9af6375]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated the association between various socioeconomic and clinical factors relating to patients and physicians and the prescribing of medications that have a high abuse potential or are expensive for the treatment of sleep difficulties in a nationally representative sample of outpatient physician visits in the United States.

Methods

This cross-sectional study used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1996–2001. Patients aged ≥ 18 years who received treatment for sleep difficulties in US outpatient settings over this period were included in the study sample. Office visits were considered related to insomnia/sleep difficulties if relevant International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis codes were recorded and if insomnia was reported as the reason for the visit or any medication with a primary indication for insomnia was prescribed. Medications associated with dependence and withdrawal symptoms were categorized as having a high abuse potential. Medications were considered expensive if the average wholesale price of 100 tablets was ≥ $150 (ie, the 75th percentile of the total cost of all medications prescribed for sleep disorders only). The data were subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

From 1996 through 2001, 2966 unweighted patient visits for insomnia/sleep difficulty were identified, representing approximately 94.6 million weighted observations in the overall US population; pharmacotherapy only was prescribed at 48% (45 million) of these visits. Medications with abuse potential were prescribed at 53% (24 million) of visits. Among visits at which pharmacotherapy was prescribed, visits by male patients were 39% less likely than visits by female patients to result in a prescription for a medication with abuse potential (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45–0.81). Visits by patients with psychiatric comorbidities were 80% more likely to be associated with receipt of a prescription for a medication with abuse potential than were visits by patients with no such comorbidities (OR = 1.80; 95% CI, 1.31–2.47). Expensive medications were prescribed at 25% (15 million) of visits involving some pharmacotherapy. Patients aged ≥ 65 years were 44% less likely to receive a prescription for an expensive medication than was the reference group, patients aged 18 to 34 years (OR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35–0.90). Hispanic patients were 56% less likely to receive a prescription for an expensive medication than were non-Hispanic patients (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22–0.88).

Conclusions

This study found an increased probability of female patients with sleep difficulties receiving a medication with high abuse potential in outpatient settings in the United States from 1996 through 2001. In addition, there was a possible association between the age and ethnicity of patients with insomnia/sleep difficulties and the prescribing of expensive medications for sleep difficulties.

### Insomnia subtypes and the subsequent risks of stroke: report from a nationally representative cohort [^dd0a78aa]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The studies assessing the impact of insomnia on stroke are still lacking. We aim to investigate insomnia in relation to subsequent stroke during the 4-year follow-up.

Methods

Data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were used. Enrollees with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code for insomnia were compared with randomly selected, age- and sex-matched noninsomnia enrollees with subsequent hospitalization for stroke during the 4-year follow-up. All enrollees, insomniacs and noninsomniacs, did not have previous diagnosis of stroke, sleep apnea, and insomnia. Individuals with insomnia were further categorized into different subgroups based on their insomnia patterns to explore whether the risk of stroke varies by subtype. The risk of outcomes was assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and the impact of insomnia was estimated using Poisson regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

The study included 21,438 (mean age, 52 ± 16 years) insomniacs and 64,314 matched noninsomniacs (mean age, 51 ± 16 years). Compared with noninsomniacs, insomniacs had 54% higher risk of developing stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–1.72). When breaking down into insomnia subgroups, the persistent insomniacs had a higher 3-year cumulative incidence rate of stroke than those in the remission group (P = 0.024). The insomniacs-to-noninsomniacs incidence rate ratio for stroke was highest among those aged 18 to 34 years (incidence rate ratio, 8.06).

Conclusions

Insomnia predisposes individuals to increased risk of stroke and this association is profound among young adults. Our results underscore the clinical importance of identifying and treating insomnia. A novel behavioral intervention targeting insomnia that may prevent stroke should be explored.

### Insomnia symptoms and risk of cardiovascular diseases among 0.5 million adults: a 10-year cohort [^6946c671]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Ascertainment of CVD outcomes

Information on CVD incidence was collected through linkages with established disease registries, the new national health insurance claim databases, and local residential records. Electronic linkage to the national health insurance databases has covered 95% of the participants in 2013 and has been renewed annually. To minimize underreporting of diseases and to identify those who were lost to follow-up, participants not linked to the health insurance databases were actively followed up annually by staff to ascertain their status of hospital admission, death, or moving out of the study area.

Trained staff blinded to baseline information of participants coded all diagnoses and deaths that occurred during follow-up using the ICD-10. The main outcomes of interest included the incidences of CVD (I00–I99); ischemic heart disease (IHD, I20–I25) and acute MI (I21); and stroke (I60–I61; I63-I64), hemorrhagic stroke (I61), and ischemic stroke (I63).

Statistical analysis

Descriptive analyses were conducted to compare the distributions of baseline characteristics among participants with and without specific insomnia symptoms. The differences of means or proportions of baseline variables between groups were estimated with general linear regression or binary/multinomial logistic regression models, respectively, controlling for age, sex, and study areas. Follow-up time of each participant was defined as the time interval from the baseline survey (2004–2008) to the diagnosis of the specific outcome, death resulting from any cause, loss to follow-up, or December 31, 2016, whichever occurred first. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the HRs and 95% CIs for the associations between each of the 3 insomnia symptoms (DIMS, EMA, DDF) and CVD outcomes, with age as the underlying time scale. To account for the group-specific effect, the models were stratified jointly by sex, 10 study areas, and age at baseline in 5-year intervals.
