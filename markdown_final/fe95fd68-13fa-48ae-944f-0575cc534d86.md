## Question

What is the appropriate management for mastitis in a lactating patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate management of mastitis in a lactating patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnosis and severity stratification. Then, I should verify first-line conservative care and what to avoid. Next, I will assess the 24–48 hour reassessment trigger for antibiotics, followed by culture and imaging indications. After that, I will examine abscess and phlegmon management, then address recurrent mastitis, prevention, and patient education. Finally, I should confirm follow-up timelines, highlight special situations, and double-check areas where older guidance conflicts with updated recommendations, correcting as needed with current sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis and severity frame. Lactational mastitis is a spectrum of inflammatory breast conditions in breastfeeding women, often starting with localized pain, erythema, warmth, and tenderness, and sometimes progressing to systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise, and tachycardia; diagnosis is clinical, and routine labs or imaging are not required if the presentation is straightforward, though inflammatory markers may be elevated and are not necessary for diagnosis [^111q9yLk] [^113H1epL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to distinguish mastitis from engorgement, plugged ducts, galactocele, or rarer entities like idiopathic granulomatous mastitis and to keep inflammatory breast cancer on the radar when symptoms are atypical, progressive, or refractory (peau d'orange, retraction), as this mandates urgent breast surgery/oncology referral; admission is reserved for severe sepsis, inability to tolerate oral agents, or multidrug-resistant organisms, and otherwise outpatient care is appropriate [^112DHhbp] [^112QBDHp] [^116d529F].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative management because most early cases are inflammatory rather than infectious; I need to ensure continued direct breastfeeding from the affected breast for milk drainage and to avoid abrupt weaning, optimize latch and positioning, use reverse pressure softening for edematous areolae, favor on-demand feeding rather than "emptying", and minimize pumping to avoid overstimulation and milk stasis; rooming-in can help support physiologic, on-demand feeds and reduce unnecessary pumping [^1153uCKX] [^113jSQHo] [^116dEPeb] [^111Nozrj].

> Wait, let me verify supportive measures because older habits can mislead; ice and NSAIDs are recommended to reduce edema and pain, while heat should be avoided because it can worsen inflammation and disrupt feedback inhibition; gentle lymphatic drainage is reasonable, but deep tissue massage should be avoided due to the risk of increasing inflammation and microvascular injury; an appropriately fitting supportive bra helps reduce dependent lymphedema and musculoskeletal strain [^116jffmR] [^115TCGQV] [^111bFrFW] [^116c3oAT].

> I will now examine the reassessment window; if symptoms improve within 24–48 hours on conservative care, continue the same plan, but if there is no improvement or worsening (e.g., persistent high fever, systemic toxicity, expanding cellulitis), I should suspect bacterial mastitis and evaluate for abscess, which is when a shift to targeted antibiotics and potential imaging becomes necessary [^1139ekpF] [^116d529F].

> Let me think about antibiotic choices and duration; when indicated, use narrow-spectrum agents targeting Staphylococcus and Streptococcus such as dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cephalexin for about 10–14 days (shorter if cellulitis resolves rapidly), with clindamycin or TMP/SMX as second-line options for MRSA risk or beta-lactam allergy; continue breastfeeding during bacterial mastitis because milk is safe for the infant, and reserve IV therapy and admission for severe illness or inability to tolerate oral treatment [^111e2HYH] [^1123XHo6] [^1133TwZA] [^116d529F] [^112QBDHp].

> Hold on, I should verify culture indications; obtain a breast milk culture if there is no improvement after 48 hours of appropriate first-line antibiotics, with recurrent mastitis, in healthcare workers in high-MRSA-prevalence settings, or when providing milk to an immunocompromised NICU infant, and use local antibiograms to guide empiric therapy; I need to double-check that culture can refine therapy and detect uncommon pathogens and resistance patterns [^113HAQcj] [^115BaQDt] [^116d529F].

> Next, I should review when to image for abscess; persistent focal pain, fluctuance, or a palpable mass warrants ultrasound to distinguish abscess from phlegmon; ultrasound-guided needle aspiration with fluid culture is first-line for lactational abscesses and often requires serial aspirations, with drain placement considered when aspiration fails or for definitive management, placing drains to gravity rather than suction; importantly, mothers should continue breastfeeding after aspiration or drain placement and remain on antibiotics tailored to culture [^116oUaB2] [^115Lie1h] [^1155ARCA] [^116d529F].

> I need to check related complications; a phlegmon merits an extended antibiotic course until clear clinical resolution, while a symptomatic galactocele should be drained and, when feasible, managed with drain placement rather than repeated aspirations to reduce recurrence and infection risk, with antibiotics indicated if the galactocele is infected [^116qDynC] [^113aHAiE] [^117KwN9o].

> Let me consider modifiable risk factors and root causes; hyperlactation and oversupply drive recurrent inflammation, so block feeding or other supply-reduction strategies may help, while addressing nipple trauma, latch/positioning issues, infant ankyloglossia, and tight bras can reduce recurrence; I should also screen for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders because psychosocial stressors can impair effective breastfeeding and self-care, compounding risk [^117XLGCf] [^115RPRbs] [^111cxzqo] [^113H1epL].

> But wait, what if episodes recur in the same location; I should obtain a milk culture rather than treat empirically and arrange imaging to exclude an underlying mass, granulomatous mastitis, or inflammatory breast cancer, escalating promptly if clinical red flags are present; probiotics with Ligilactobacillus salivarius or Limosilactobacillus fermentum may be considered for prevention, though evidence varies by strain and remains mixed, and prophylactic antibiotics should be avoided due to lack of benefit and resistance concerns [^115BantR] [^112DHhbp] [^117TEvqa] [^1136yezk] [^116d529F].

> I should confirm patient education priorities; teach normal breast anatomy and postpartum lactation physiology, early recognition of symptoms, effective latch and positioning, and to avoid harmful practices such as deep massage, routine heat, overfeeding, and excessive pumping; encourage supportive bras, rooming-in to facilitate on-demand feeds, and hand expression as needed to relieve symptoms or provide milk when infant transfer is suboptimal [^114UMaAr] [^111bFrFW] [^113hG1ev] [^111Nozrj] [^115m3CBJ].

> Next, I should review follow-up and prognosis; with appropriate management, most cases resolve within 48–72 hours, but if symptoms persist despite antibiotics or there is clinical deterioration, I need to re-evaluate for abscess, resistant organisms, or alternate diagnoses, arranging reassessment within 2–3 days when antibiotics are started and ensuring access to lactation support to reduce recurrence and early weaning [^113H1epL] [^116d529F].

> Hmm, wait a minute — older sources sometimes recommend warm compresses and frequent emptying, but updated guidance advises ice rather than heat, on-demand feeding rather than frequent complete emptying, and minimizing pumping to avoid exacerbating inflammation and oversupply; I should explicitly correct my reflex to recommend heat or aggressive emptying based on current ABM and AAFP recommendations [^115TCGQV] [^11598Lqa] [^1153uCKX].

> Finally, I need to ensure awareness of rare but severe scenarios; invasive Streptococcus pyogenes mastitis with toxic shock has been reported in mothers breastfeeding children with scarlet fever, so in the setting of a household strep outbreak and severe maternal illness features, I should maintain a high index of suspicion and escalate care promptly while balancing the general guidance that breastfeeding remains safe for most bacterial mastitis contexts [^114HhvZ7] [^116d529F].

Mastitis management in breastfeeding patients focuses on **continued breastfeeding or milk removal** [^1153uCKX] to relieve milk stasis and prevent complications [^111q9yLk]. First-line antibiotics are **dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cephalexin** [^111e2HYH]; use **clindamycin** or **TMP/SMX** if MRSA is suspected or in penicillin-allergic patients [^1133TwZA]. Supportive care includes **NSAIDs and ice** [^116jffmR]; avoid **heat** [^115TCGQV] and **deep massage** [^111bFrFW].

If no improvement in **48 hours**, obtain milk culture [^113HAQcj] and consider ultrasound to evaluate for abscess [^112Drvzq] [^116d529F]. For a confirmed abscess, perform **ultrasound-guided needle aspiration** [^116oUaB2] with fluid culture and continue breastfeeding [^1155ARCA]; surgical drainage is reserved for refractory cases [^1111q63U]. Educate patients [^114UMaAr] on proper latch, avoid excessive pumping [^113hG1ev] [^116ejoDh], and use a well-fitting bra to reduce recurrence [^116c3oAT].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

- **Clinical features**: Localized breast pain, tenderness, erythema, warmth, swelling, and systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise, and flu-like symptoms [^113H1epL] [^114S5XTN].

- **Diagnosis**: Primarily clinical; consider milk culture [^113HAQcj] if no improvement after 48 hours of antibiotics [^115BaQDt] or in recurrent cases.

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound [^112Drvzq] if abscess is suspected or symptoms persist despite treatment [^116d529F].

---

## Initial management and supportive care

- **Continued breastfeeding**: Encourage continued breastfeeding or milk removal to relieve milk stasis and prevent complications [^1153uCKX] [^111q9yLk].

- **Supportive care**: NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen 800 mg TID or acetaminophen 1,000 mg TID) and ice application for symptomatic relief [^116jffmR].

- **Avoidance**: Avoid heat application [^115TCGQV] and deep breast massage, as they can exacerbate inflammation [^111bFrFW].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

- **First-line antibiotics**: Dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cephalexin [^111e2HYH] [^1133TwZA].

- **Second-line antibiotics**: Clindamycin or TMP/SMX if MRSA is suspected or in penicillin-allergic patients [^111e2HYH].

- **Duration**: Typically 10–14 days, but shorter courses may be considered if rapid resolution occurs [^1123XHo6].

---

## Management of complications

### Breast abscess

First-line management of a breast abscess is **ultrasound-guided needle aspiration** with fluid culture and sensitivity; repeated aspirations may be necessary [^116oUaB2]. Continued breastfeeding from the affected breast is encouraged after aspiration or drain placement [^1155ARCA]. Surgical drainage is reserved for refractory cases or when needle aspiration is not feasible [^1153Qk97].

---

### Recurrent mastitis

Recurrent mastitis warrants **assessment of breastfeeding technique**, pumping practices, and underlying risk factors [^115RPRbs]. Daily probiotics containing Lactobacillus fermentum or Lactobacillus salivarius may be considered for prevention [^117TEvqa] [^115Phwj9]. Arrange follow-up to ensure resolution [^113Caion] and consider radiologic evaluation for multiple recurrences [^112DHhbp].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Patient education and prevention focus on **correct breastfeeding technique**, including proper latch and positioning to prevent nipple trauma and milk stasis [^114UMaAr]. Advise breastfeeding on demand [^116dEPeb] and avoiding excessive pumping or routine breast emptying [^113hG1ev] [^11598Lqa]. Recommend well-fitting supportive bras to prevent engorgement and discomfort [^116c3oAT]. Provide reassurance and psychosocial support [^1153uCKX] to prevent early weaning and address perinatal mood disorders [^111cxzqo].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Indications for specialist referral include a **suspected or confirmed abscess** requiring surgical or interventional radiology evaluation [^116oUaB2]. Referral is also warranted for multiple recurrences of mastitis [^112DHhbp]. Severe systemic symptoms, immunocompromised status, or atypical presentations should also prompt specialist evaluation [^116d529F].

### Breast disease in the pregnant and lactating patient: Radiological-pathological correlation [^112Drvzq]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial mastitis will either resolve with antibiotic therapy or evolve into an abscess if treatment is delayed or inadequate. Approximately 4.8–11% of lactation-related mastitis cases are complicated by breast abscesses. The infection is most commonly due to S. aureus, with increasing cases of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Streptococcus. The patient typically presents with fever, chills, tenderness, and breast erythema.

- **Imaging and diagnosis**: Imaging with ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis, provide a means to drain the collection to tailor antibiotic therapy, and can be safely used for regular follow-up of the abscess. Ultrasound is the modality of choice and typically reveals a complex hypoechoic cystic mass of varied shape, commonly multiloculated with indistinct margins, peripheral vascularity, and posterior acoustic enhancement; however, there should be no vascularity within the fluid collection. Mammography is performed only if the diagnosis is unclear and may show signs such as mass, distortion, asymmetric density, and skin thickening, which are not specific to cancer. The presence of suspicious calcifications is more specific for cancer.

- **Treatment**: Percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic therapy provides effective treatment. In some cases, multiple drainages are required. Warm compresses and frequent breastfeeding also help to shorten the duration of symptoms. The presence of mastitis and/or an abscess poses no risk to the breastfeeding infant. Cessation of breastfeeding is necessary only when treatment with an antibiotic contraindicated for the newborn is prescribed (e.g. tetracycline).

### Experimental autoimmune breast failure: A model for lactation insufficiency, postnatal nutritional deprivation, and prophylactic breast cancer vaccination [^111akNcZ]. The American Journal of Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Mastitis is a substantial clinical problem in lactating women that may result in severe pain and abrupt termination of breastfeeding, thereby predisposing infants to long-term health risks. Many cases of mastitis involve no known infectious agent and may fundamentally be due to autoimmune-mediated inflammation of the breast. Herein, we develop a murine model of autoimmune mastitis and provide a detailed characterization of its resulting phenotype of breast failure and lactation insufficiency. To generate breast-specific autoimmunity, we immunized SWXJ mice with recombinant mouse α-lactalbumin, a lactation-dependent, breast-specific differentiation protein critical for the production of lactose.

Mice immunized with α-lactalbumin showed extensive T-cell-mediated inflammation in lactating normal breast parenchyma but none in nonlactating normal breast parenchyma. This targeted autoimmune attack resulted in breast failure characterized by lactation insufficiency and decreased ability to nurture offspring. Although immunization with α-lactalbumin had no effect on fertility and birth numbers, pups nursed by α-lactalbumin-immunized mice showed significantly disrupted growth, often accompanied by kwashiorkor-like nutritional abnormalities, including alopecia, liver toxicity, and runting.

This experimental model of autoimmune breast failure has useful applications for prophylactic breast cancer vaccination and for addressing inflammatory complications during breastfeeding. In addition, this model is suited for investigating nutritionally based "failure-to-thrive" issues, particularly regarding lactation insufficiency.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^111J24zt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Lactational mastitis constitutes one of the main medical causes of premature weaning due to pain and discomfort or as a result of inappropriate advice from a health professional. Since breastfeeding provides a wide range of health benefits for the mother-infant pair, mastitis constitutes a relevant public health issue. Some epidemiologic studies have been carried out to investigate the incidence and potential risk factors that could be involved in infectious lactational mastitis. Risk factors that have been suggested to be strongly associated with mastitis include, among others, mastitis with a previous child, cracked or sore nipples, use of ointments, inappropriate breastfeeding practices, and peripartum antibiotherapy.

In Spain, the most recent National Survey of Health available (2011–2012) showed that the estimated prevalence of exclusive (mixed) breastfeeding was 66.2% (72.4%), 53.6% (66.6%), and 28.5% (46.9%) at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively, after birth. On the other hand, Spain ranks 24 out of 36 in the Breastfeeding Policy Scorecard for Developed Countries published recently according to maternity leave laws and the right to daily nursing breaks, among other indicators. Furthermore, the number of centers that hold the Baby Friendly Hospital designation as institutions that promote breastfeeding, as well as the breastfeeding support groups, has increased during the last decade. However, in contrast to this renewed interest that breastfeeding and human milk are receiving nowadays, lactational mastitis still remains widely unknown.

Regarding medical management for lactational mastitis, particularly in the management of abscesses, the ABM 2022 guidelines recommend considering drain placement as the initial intervention for definitive management at the time of the index procedure. It is advised to refer patients to interventional radiology for drain placement if necessary. Drains or skin stents should be placed to gravity rather than suction. Adaptations with supplies such as Foley catheters or glove fingers can be used based on local resources if a formal drain is not available. The use of vacuum-assisted wound devices on a lactating breast should be avoided.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^111B1cU7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025).

- **Attitude for breastfeeding and mastitis**: The practice dimension showed that 61.73% of patients reported the ability to find necessary breastfeeding information (P1), while 61.85% committed to maintaining nipple cleanliness during breastfeeding (P2). Additionally, 60.56% can discuss breastfeeding's importance with their spouse (P3), and 60.95% feel confident discussing breastfeeding-related issues with healthcare professionals (P4). Moreover, 59.97% can schedule breastfeeding even during busy times (P5), and 58.92% prepare breast milk for others to feed their baby (P8). Furthermore, 61.29% are committed to breastfeeding despite mild discomfort (P9), and 65.1% promptly address breast engorgement by allowing the baby to suckle (P13). In addition, 47.93% relax and remain comfortable while breastfeeding, even with family present (P14). Lastly, 62.76% accept the temporary limitations on their freedom due to breastfeeding (P15), 62.61% choose to breastfeed even if their spouse is unwilling (P16), and 60.85% wear appropriate nursing bras during the breastfeeding period (P18).

- **Practice on breastfeeding and mastitis**: Correlation analysis showed significant positive correlations between breastfeeding-related knowledge and mastitis-related knowledge, breastfeeding-related attitude, mastitis-related attitude, and practice (r = 0.601, P < 0.001; r = 0.168, P < 0.001; r = 0.237, P < 0.001; and r = 0.084, P = 0.028, respectively). Meanwhile, mastitis-related knowledge was positively correlated with breastfeeding-related attitude and mastitis-related attitude.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^114G9zxW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The incidence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication, and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

- **Objectives**: This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (December 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1996 to 2007), and EMBASE (January 1985 to 2007). We contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis were selected.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

- **Main results**: Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as "supportive therap.

### Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis: Imaging update and review [^11523iMX]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare, benign inflammatory condition of the breast first reported by Kessler and Wolloch in 1972. It occurs primarily in women of childbearing age, most often in postpartum or breastfeeding mothers. The etiology of IGM remains elusive. Reports have suggested an association with autoimmune disease or a result of directed responses to trauma, and metabolic or hormonal processes. An association with Corynebacterium species has also been proposed, though by definition, diagnosis necessitates exclusion of bacteria from microbiology and histology specimens. Histologically, IGM is characterized by non-necrotizing granuloma formation with a localized infiltrate of multinucleated giant cells, plasma cells, epithelioid histiocytes, and lymphocytes. A neutrophilic infiltrate may also occur with the formation of organized microabscesses.

A 27-year-old woman presented with an enlarging palpable right breast mass and was admitted to the hospital for intractable joint pain. An erythematous rash was noted on her right breast and extremities. She was 8 months postpartum and experiencing breastfeeding difficulties on the right side. A bilateral mediolateral oblique mammogram (Figure 1a) demonstrates regional asymmetry in the middle depth upper breast. A clinical photograph of the patient's forearm (Figure 1b) shows erythematous areas representing erythema nodosum. A photomicrograph (original magnification ×200; hematoxylin-eosin [H-E] stain) (Figure 1c) reveals non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation composed of histiocytes and giant cells.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: Cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: A randomized treatment trial [^1142cVXb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Mastitis is a common problem for breastfeeding women. Before planning a trial to reduce the number of lactating women who develop mastitis, we reviewed the literature to identify factors that may be associated with it and to examine previous trials. A relatively small number of trials was identified which included mastitis as one of the outcome measures. Using historical controls, prophylactic topical penicillin ointment was found to be ineffective, while hand disinfectant at the mother's bedside appeared to reduce mastitis. A Finnish study examined "breast massage" (which appears to be a variation of "nipple toughening") and found no impact of this practice on mastitis.

The authors of one trial were convinced that their intervention was effective, despite methodological difficulties. Livingstone and Stringer conducted a randomized trial for women with cracked nipples with positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in Canada. They compared topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, and "optimal breastfeeding advice" and found better improvement in nipple healing in the women given oral antibiotics. In addition, they found 16 women out of 65 (25%) given non-systemic treatment developed mastitis within 7 days, compared to 1 of 19 women (5%) given systemic antibiotics (chi-square, p = 0.065) [not 0.005 as stated in their abstract]. The authors have concluded that cracked nipples colonized with S. aureus should be aggressively treated with systemic antibiotics.

### Maternal mastitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome risk from breastfeeding children with scarlet fever: Case report and literature review [^114HhvZ7]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Lactational mastitis is a common condition during breastfeeding, which, in rare cases, can progress to life-threatening necrotising mastitis, particularly in cases where *Streptococcus pyogenes* is involved. The development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is associated with a fatality rate of approximately 50%. In this Grand Round, we present the case of a healthy mother, aged 35 years, breastfeeding a child diagnosed with scarlet fever. The mother subsequently developed lactational mastitis, with a high load of *S. pyogenes*, culminating in skin necrosis and STSS.

This case, along with six more case reports identified in a thorough literature search, underscores the severity of lactational *S. pyogenes* mastitis. In all cases, the only identifiable risk factor for invasive *S. pyogenes* disease was close contact with individuals exhibiting symptoms of scarlet fever. During breastfeeding, the direct contact of the nipple to the child's pharynx, containing *S. pyogenes* in the case of scarlet fever, presents a probable route of transmission, especially when considering the pathogenicity of the bacterium.

Although breastfeeding is generally encouraged, the literature lacks sufficient guidance regarding breastfeeding practices in children with scarlet fever. This Grand Round proposes a simple strategy to minimize maternal risks, offering valuable insights into clinical management and prevention.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^116Prq7q]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). High credibility.

Optimal management for the prevention of mastitis is not known. A Cochrane review specifically aimed to assess the effects of preventative strategies for mastitis and the subsequent effect on breastfeeding duration also showed insufficient evidence as to the effectiveness of a range of interventions. These interventions included education on breastfeeding, changes in breastfeeding habits, hot/cold packs, relaxation techniques, and use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrence. Only three trials examining the effect of antibiotics were included, and although no significant difference in the incidence of mastitis was found, a trend towards a reduced effect was reported (risk ratio (RR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.61).

When one of the trials amongst HIV-infected women was excluded, the two remaining studies reported a 67% and 76% reduction in mastitis with antibiotic prophylaxis, respectively. However, all trials were inadequately powered or prematurely stopped due to concerns related to the adverse harms of antibiotic use, issues related to side effects, patient compliance, and attitudes. The review concluded that the use of antibiotics in the absence of clear indications resulted in no benefit and could lead to harm, not just for the participants, but in the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of the organisms. Authors of the Cochrane review recommended future studies should consider the implementation of strategies to improve adherence, such as extended consultation time with participants when recruiting to explain and reinforce instructions.

### Mastitis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): The calm before the storm [^114LWq2Z]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Post-partum mastitis is a common infection in breastfeeding women, with an incidence of 9.5–16% in recent literature. Over the past decade, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as a significant pathogen in soft-tissue infections presenting to the emergency department. The incidence of mastitis caused by MRSA is unknown at this time but is likely increasing.

- **Objectives**: We review the data on prevention and treatment of mastitis and address recent literature demonstrating increases in MRSA infections in the post-partum population, and how we should change our practices in light of this emerging pathogen.

- **Case report**: We present a case of simple mastitis in a healthcare worker who failed to improve until treated with antibiotics appropriate for a MRSA infection.

- **Conclusion**: Recent evidence suggests that just as MRSA has become the prominent pathogen in other soft-tissue infections, mastitis is now increasingly caused by this pathogen. Physicians caring for patients with mastitis need to be aware of this bacteriologic shift to treat appropriately.

### Interventions for preventing mastitis after childbirth [^116C1QNy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the health benefits of breastfeeding, initiation and duration rates continue to fall short of international guidelines. Many factors influence a woman's decision to wean; the main reason cited for weaning is associated with lactation complications, such as mastitis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of preventive strategies for mastitis and the subsequent effect on breastfeeding duration.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2009), EMBASE (1974 to November 2009), CINAHL (1981 to November 2009), MIDIRS (1971 to November 2009), IPA (1970 to November 2009), AMED (1985 to November 2009), and LILACS (1982 to November 2009).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing mastitis in postpartum breastfeeding women.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently identified relevant studies and assessed the trial quality. We contacted trial authors for missing data and information as appropriate.

- **Main results**: We included five trials (involving 960 women). In three trials of 471 women, we found no significant differences in the incidence of mastitis between the use of antibiotics and no antibiotics (risk ratio (RR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.61), or in one trial of 99 women comparing two doses (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.02 to 9.18). We found no significant differences for mastitis in three trials of specialist breastfeeding education with usual care (one trial).

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^114PitVY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Traditionally, interferences with suckling, such as pacifiers, bottle-feeding, or nipple shields, have been related to breastfeeding problems and should be avoided, at least while the infant is learning to suckle properly. In our study, these practices were reported more frequently by women with mastitis when the initial bivariate analysis of possible risk factors was performed.

A higher prevalence of tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) was found among infants from women with mastitis. However, this condition is not usually considered in infants without breastfeeding difficulties and, consequently, could be underrated in the control group. The relationship between ankyloglossia and breastfeeding problems has been largely debated.

Controversies in this area have arisen from attempts to find an absolute relationship between tongue-tie and breastfeeding difficulties. However, the relationship may be more accurately described as relative, where tongue-tie increases the risk for breastfeeding difficulties. Additionally, the existence of various classification systems for the diagnosis of ankyloglossia is confusing for clinicians.

### Study protocol: Evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: A randomised controlled trial [^112ajhav]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). High credibility.

The primary outcome will be defined as the incidence of mastitis up to 8 weeks following birth as measured by: a clinical diagnosis of mastitis or at least two of the following breast symptoms: pain, redness/inflammation, lump/swelling, and at least one of the following systemic symptoms: flu-like symptoms (body aches, headaches, and chills) or fever ≥ 38°C. These symptoms must be present for at least 24 hours.

Secondary maternal outcomes will include breastfeeding duration (total/partial), recurrence of mastitis, development of breast abscess, cracked nipples, use of antibiotics, overall maternal health and well-being, breastfeeding support, number of doctor's visits for probable mastitis, overall doctor's visits, adverse effects of treatment, and incidence of primary mastitis between 2 and 6 months postpartum. Maternal lifestyle factors which may affect breastfeeding outcomes will also be assessed. Acceptability and compliance of the trial product and the APProve-Lite system will also be examined, as well as preference for the method of postnatal questionnaires.

Secondary infant outcomes will include growth (height and weight) and well-being in the first year of life, measured at 2, 6, and 12 months as assessed via self-report of health conditions including infections (gastrointestinal, respiratory), doctor's visits, admission to hospital, allergic reactions, and/or use of antibiotics.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^115LMj11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication, and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

- **Objectives**: This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis, with or without laboratory investigation.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012), contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials, and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

- **Main results**: Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as 'supportive therapy' versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance o

### Study protocol: Evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^114zQVK4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). High credibility.

Breastfeeding has been consistently shown to be protective against a broad range of immediate and long-term infant and maternal health outcomes. International guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for all babies in the first 6 months of life as it provides the best nutritional start for infants and promotes their healthy growth and development. Given the positive benefits of breastfeeding, it is of concern that the 2010 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Health Survey reported less than 15% of women exclusively breastfeeding at 5 months of age, despite a 96% initiation rate at birth. These findings suggest that more resources and research are required to identify and treat the underlying causes of breastfeeding cessation in order to extend the overall duration and improve long-term maternal and child health outcomes.

Mastitis and the pain associated with the condition have been shown to be associated with the cessation of breastfeeding. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mastitis as an inflammatory condition of the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection. It occurs in 15–21% of breastfeeding mothers in Australia. Most episodes occur in the first 6–8 weeks postpartum but can occur at any time during breastfeeding. Almost one-third of women experience a re-episode, and up to 3% of women with mastitis develop a breast abscess, often necessitating hospitalization.

Little is known about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this common condition. Though not well described, the risk factors appear to be.

### Initial management of breastfeeding [^115KEPC2]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Breast milk is widely accepted as the ideal source of nutrition for infants. To ensure success in breastfeeding, it is important to initiate it as early as possible during the neonatal period. This is facilitated by skin-to-skin contact between the mother and infant immediately following birth. When possible, the infant should be allowed to root and latch on spontaneously within the first hour of life. Many common nursery routines, such as weighing the infant, administration of vitamin K, and application of ocular antibiotics, can be safely delayed until after the initial breastfeeding.

Postpartum care practices that improve breastfeeding rates include rooming-in, anticipatory guidance about breastfeeding problems, and the avoidance of formula supplementation and pacifiers.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^111hwwYH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Initially, a total of 684 questionnaires were collected. Two cases were unwilling to share their data for this study, resulting in a final valid questionnaire sample of 682 cases. Among the participants, the average age was 28.83 ± 4.86 years, and 372 (54.55%) were married. Furthermore, 241 (35.34%) had experienced natural deliveries, while 375 (54.99%) received support from their husbands and families for breastfeeding. A majority, 392 (57.48%), had no other pregnancy-related complications, but 352 (51.61%) did not undergo prenatal assessments for breast conditions.

Additionally, 451 (66.13%) expressed a willingness to engage in exclusive breastfeeding, while 380 (55.72%) had no history of mastitis. Moreover, 383 (56.16%) had not undergone breast surgery, 364 (53.37%) lacked prior experience with breastfeeding, and 355 (52.05%) used nursing bras during their breastfeeding journey.

All variables exhibited skewed distributions and were presented as mean ± SD to enhance data readability.

The mean knowledge score was 8.96 ± 4.66 (possible range: 0–22), the mean attitude score was 51.65 ± 11.55 (possible range: 15–75), and the mean practice score was 63.83 ± 17.05 (possible range: 18–90). In total, 545 participants (79.9%) scored below the knowledge adequacy threshold of 15.4, indicating insufficient knowledge. Regarding attitudes, 458 participants (67.2%) scored ≥ 52.5, indicating a positive attitude. In terms of practices, 499 participants (73.2%) scored ≥ 63, denoting proactive and appropriate breastfeeding practices.

### Mastitis and mammary abscess management audit (MAMMA) [^1111q63U]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Benign breast inflammation and infection account for 5 percent of all breast-related hospital admissions, costing €3584 per admission. Mastitis, defined as inflammation of breast tissue, can be broadly classified as either lactational or non-lactational. Complications, such as severe sepsis resulting in hospital admission and/or the need for surgical incision and drainage, can occur when treatment is delayed, incorrect, or ineffective. Breast abscess, characterized by a localized collection of purulent material within the breast, is a known complication of mastitis and occurs in up to 11 percent of cases. The Mastitis and Mammary Abscess Management Audit (MAMMA) aims to review practices and improve outcomes in the treatment of mastitis and breast abscesses in the UK and Ireland through national adoption of a best-practice protocol.

The accepted standard management of breast abscesses includes antibiotics and minimally invasive ultrasound-guided needle aspiration on an outpatient basis for patients who are well clinically. Surgical incision and drainage represent an archetypal treatment that should be reserved for selected patients only, because it can lead to cosmetic disfigurement and, in lactational mastitis, involves an unnecessary hospital admission, separating the breastfeeding mother from her baby.

The acute nature of this presentation means that patients are more likely to present to the emergency department and/or general practitioners and subsequently be managed by non-breast specialist general surgeons.

### Mastitis and mammary abscess management audit (MAMMA) in the UK and Ireland [^113pFJMr]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Advice to continue breastfeeding was given to 296 (80.7 percent) lactating women. Over three-quarters of patients were treated in the outpatient setting (1,015 patients, 77.4 percent); 295 patients (22.5 percent) were admitted to the hospital for a median of 2 (I.Q.R. 2–4) days. The likelihood of being admitted depended on the diagnosis. Reasons for admission are detailed in supplementary materials. The decision to admit was predominantly made by specialist registrars (174 patients, 59.0 percent) regardless of the time or day of presentation. The odds of admission were significantly higher on the weekend compared to Monday and Friday (OR 2.68, 95 percent C. I. 1.89 to 3.80; χ² = 32.6; P < 0.001). There was significant variation between individual centers regarding the rate of inpatient treatment (χ² = 291.8; P < 0.001). Certain regions admitted about one-third of presenting patients for inpatient treatment.

- **Antibiotics**: Before presenting to secondary care, 882 (67.2 percent) patients were treated with antibiotics, with the majority (679 patients, 77.0 percent) having had one antibiotic course. Oral antibiotics administered in primary care significantly reduced the need for intravenous antibiotics in secondary care (OR = 0.71, 95 percent C. I. 0.54 to 0.94; χ² = 5.6; P = 0.018). Of patients seen in secondary care, 1,055 (80.4 percent) were started on antibiotics, with 767 (72.7 percent) starting on oral antibiotics. Co-amoxiclav and flucloxacillin were the first-line choices.

### Study protocol: Evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: A randomised controlled trial [^115EsyEB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). High credibility.

Interventions that support prolonging breastfeeding duration have the potential to improve human health. Mastitis is a painful and debilitating complication of breastfeeding, which affects 1 in 5 breastfeeding mothers. It is associated with early cessation of breastfeeding and, if severe, may lead to unwarranted hospital admissions for treatment of abscesses, often requiring treatment with antibiotics. At a time when we are experiencing the negative effects of antibiotic overuse, there is an urgent need to explore safe and effective alternatives for preventing infections such as mastitis in lactating women. This trial seeks to provide evidence for such an alternative in the form of probiotics, which may increase breastfeeding duration and potentially provide long-term health, cognitive, and developmental benefits for children, as well as decrease antibiotic usage with benefits to the community and health system.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^116nXfmv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

In this study, mastitis was defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) clinical protocols. Mastitis was identified as an inflammatory condition of the breast characterized by localized tenderness, redness, swelling, and heat, accompanied by fever (≥ 38.3 °C), chills, flu-like aching, and systemic illness. Participants' history of mastitis was self-reported based on this clinical definition, which was clearly explained in the questionnaire, distinguishing it from blocked ducts that present with localized tenderness and redness without systemic symptoms. This definition helps differentiate true mastitis from blocked or clogged milk ducts, which are characterized by the presence of a tender lump without systemic symptoms.

- **Quality control and distribution process**: Questionnaires were distributed to participants through various means, including WeChat groups, face-to-face interactions, and QQ groups. An electronic questionnaire was meticulously designed using the online platform Sojump, and participants were provided with a QR code for convenient access. To ensure the integrity and completeness of the collected data, measures were put in place: each IP address was restricted to a single submission, and all questionnaire items were made obligatory. Participants were guaranteed anonymity during the survey process. A dedicated research team, comprising three doctors trained as research assistants, assumed responsibility for the dissemination and promotion of the questionnaires.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^112BZZZF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Mothers demonstrated inadequate knowledge, suboptimal attitudes, and proactive practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis. Clinical practice may be improved by targeting interventions to enhance breastfeeding knowledge in urban areas, fostering positive attitudes among higher-educated individuals and those with a history of breast surgery, and emphasizing the importance of maternity insurance to support better breastfeeding practices and mastitis prevention.

The main findings of our study revealed significant associations between demographic factors and breastfeeding KAP. Key results include the following:

1. Urban residents demonstrated higher breastfeeding knowledge compared to rural residents.
2. Participants with higher education levels (junior college/bachelor's degree) exhibited more positive attitudes toward breastfeeding.
3. A history of breast surgery negatively impacted both knowledge and attitudes.
4. Maternity insurance was positively associated with breastfeeding practices.

These findings align with previous research by Zaikman, who emphasized the importance of education in shaping breastfeeding attitudes. Similarly, Ahmad et al. reported that education level significantly influenced breastfeeding practices among working mothers. However, our finding regarding the negative impact of breast surgery on breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes differs from Taha et al, who found no significant association between surgical history and breastfeeding outcomes in their United Arab Emirates study. The positive association between maternity insurance and breastfeeding practices underscores its importance in promoting effective breastfeeding.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^1134GvRW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Infectious mastitis is a common condition that affects up to 33% of women during lactation, although its incidence may be underestimated because of differences in case definition and reporting. However, most studies have not reported the true mastitis incidence at the time of writing, as it is necessary to define a time limit for data collection and to know the size of the at-risk population, namely breastfeeding mothers in the area of study.

The term "infectious mastitis" has often been applied only to acute cases, which present with both local symptoms (such as breast redness, engorgement, and pain) and systemic symptoms. In contrast, subacute mastitis, which includes only local symptoms and is often characterized by reduced milk secretion, has been systematically underreported. Additionally, human milk cultures are rarely performed, resulting in a lack of standardized sampling and analysis procedures.

### Interventions for preventing mastitis after childbirth [^113mCBUh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Despite the health benefits of breastfeeding, initiation and duration rates continue to fall short of international guidelines. Many factors influence a woman's decision to wean; the main reason cited for weaning is associated with lactation complications, such as mastitis. Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast, with or without infection. It can be viewed as a continuum of disease, from non-infective inflammation of the breast to infection that may lead to abscess formation.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of preventive strategies (e.g. breastfeeding education, pharmacological treatments, and alternative therapies) on the occurrence or recurrence of non-infective or infective mastitis in breastfeeding women post-childbirth.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) as of 3 October 2019, as well as reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of interventions for preventing mastitis in postpartum breastfeeding women. Quasi-randomized controlled trials and trials reported only in abstract form were eligible. We attempted to contact the authors to obtain any unpublished results, wherever possible. Interventions for preventing mastitis may include probiotics, specialist breastfeeding advice, and holistic approaches.

### Study protocol: Evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: A randomised controlled trial [^115auMSv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). High credibility.

The underlying biological pathogenesis of mastitis is important when considering management options. Mastitis is characterized by the presence of the main etiological agents of infection, staphylococci and streptococcal organisms. The mastitis-causing strains, mainly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermidis, usually display two common properties: resistance to antibiotics and a high ability to form biofilms. These properties may explain their resistance to a wide range of antibiotic therapies and the resultant recurrence of disease. A recent WHO report outlines the growing public health concern related to antimicrobial resistance. The report stresses that resistance of common bacteria to antimicrobial drugs has reached alarming levels, with available options for treating infections becoming increasingly ineffective. Furthermore, authors stress the importance of actively seeking safe and effective alternatives to antibiotics.

Probiotics, with their increasing recognition and use in recent years, may provide one such alternative. Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, are thought to confer a beneficial effect to the host. Research indicates that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant anti-inflammatory properties comparable to a therapeutic pharmaceutical agent and supports their potential use as immunomodulatory agents. Given that gut microbiota is a critical stimulus for the adequate maturation and function of the immune system, oral administration of probiotics to women during the early postnatal period to modulate microbiota composition may be beneficial.

### Study protocol: Evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: A randomized controlled trial [^112xTUXN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). High credibility.

Mastitis and accompanying pain have been associated with the cessation of breastfeeding. Mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the breast and may result from decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection. It affects up to one in five breastfeeding women, with most episodes occurring in the first 6–8 weeks postpartum. Antibiotics are often used in the treatment of mastitis but have not been popular or proven effective as a preventative agent. The WHO has highlighted significant concerns relating to adverse harms of antibiotic use, specifically the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of disease organisms. Increasing research suggests that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant anti-inflammatory properties and support their potential use as immunomodulatory agents. While animal studies have shown promising results regarding the use of probiotics to prevent mastitis, their use in human trials has had limited investigation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral probiotics in the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women.

- **Methods**: APProve (Can Probiotics Improve Breastfeeding Outcomes?) is a double-blind randomized controlled trial designed to assess outcomes between breastfeeding women ingesting a probiotic versus a placebo daily for 8 weeks following birth. A total of 600 women — 300 in each arm — who intend to breastfeed will be randomized after the birth of a term, healthy infant. Daily and weekly surveys for 8 weeks and follow-up surveys at 2, 6, and 12 months after birth will assess the primary outcome.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^115c82Ng]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a comprehensive approach to infant feeding, advocating for exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the initial 6 months, followed by the introduction of complementary feeding at 6 months, while continuing breastfeeding up to 2 years and beyond. This practice, when adhered to during the first half-year of a child's life, has demonstrated a substantial reduction in infant morbidity and mortality, with well-documented positive impacts on child growth and maternal well-being. WHO research underscores the protective nature of breastfeeding, being twice as effective in ensuring child health during the first year compared to non-breastfeeding practices.

Despite these recommendations, global statistics indicate suboptimal compliance, with only 39% of infants in developing countries exclusively breastfed for the initial 6 months, while 6% were never breastfed. Furthermore, 86% and 68% of infants and children continued breastfeeding at 6–11 months and 12–23 months, respectively. The practice of breastfeeding is influenced not only by socio-demographic factors but also by maternal knowledge and attitudes toward optimal breastfeeding practices.

Regarding lactational mastitis, it can be categorized into various types, with acute mastitis (AM) and sub-acute mastitis (SAM) being the most prevalent among breastfeeding women. Recognizing the factors associated with mastitis is imperative as it can hinder optimal breastfeeding practices, potentially prompting premature supplementary feeding and leading to breastfeeding cessation.

### Neonatal mastitis: Clinical presentation and approach to evaluation and management [^111y3fjS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Low credibility.

Mastitis is an uncommon but potentially serious infection in neonates. Characteristic findings include erythema, induration, and tenderness around the breast bud. Fluctuance and purulent drainage may be present with abscess formation. Fever and signs of systemic illness may occur, or there may only be signs of localized soft tissue infection.

Until recently, there have been very few cohort studies of neonatal mastitis in high-income countries, and no literature available regarding the incidence of concurrent serious bacterial infections such as meningitis or urinary tract infection. A recent large, multicenter study suggests that most neonatal mastitis presents as localized soft tissue infection, with very low rates of concurrent serious bacterial infection or adverse outcomes.

Treatment of neonatal mastitis consists primarily of antibiotic administration. Surgical intervention, such as incision and drainage or intraoperative debridement, may be needed for frank abscesses. While antibiotics are typically administered intravenously, there may be a role for oral antibiotics in some lower-risk infants with mastitis.

### Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis diagnosed during pregnancy associated with successful breastfeeding experience [^114eoV6x]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare benign breast condition with a course that is often rapidly progressive and slow to resolve. There is no consensus on management, especially during pregnancy and lactation. A 30-year-old at 33 weeks presented with mastalgia, induration, and galactorrhea in the left breast. There was no improvement with antibiotics. Initial workup was negative, and a core needle biopsy showed findings consistent with the diagnosis of IGM. She was treated with steroids antepartum and was co-managed by rheumatology and her obstetrician/breastfeeding medicine specialist postpartum. She was treated with azathioprine, breastfed exclusively for 6 months, and continued breastfeeding through the first year. A multidisciplinary team approach is crucial in diagnosing, treating, and facilitating successful breastfeeding in patients with IGM.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^116uRszH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The distribution of knowledge dimensions regarding breastfeeding and mastitis revealed both areas of strength and potential misconceptions among the participants. Notably, a substantial percentage of respondents correctly recognized the benefits of breastfeeding for infant intellectual and growth development, the association between low mood and mastitis risk, and the role of breastfeeding in enhancing infants' immunity to infections and diseases like childhood asthma. These findings are consistent with existing literature, highlighting the awareness of these crucial aspects of breastfeeding.

However, it is concerning that a significant number of participants incorrectly believed that mothers with other related diseases during pregnancy cannot breastfeed, that breastfeeding should cease when mastitis occurs, and that babies need to be breastfed on a strict schedule. These misconceptions can have negative implications for breastfeeding initiation and duration.

In light of these results, clinical practice can be improved by addressing and correcting these misconceptions through targeted educational programs. Healthcare providers should emphasize the safety and importance of breastfeeding for mothers with certain medical conditions during pregnancy, provide guidance on managing mastitis while continuing to breastfeed, and promote responsive feeding rather than rigid schedules to encourage successful breastfeeding experiences. These efforts may contribute to a more informed and confident breastfeeding population, ultimately leading to improved maternal and infant health outcomes.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^1169CttG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards breastfeeding and mastitis. This cross-sectional study was conducted between March and August 2023 in Author's Hospital, using a self-administered questionnaire.

A total of 682 valid questionnaires were collected, with participants averaging 28.83 ± 4.86 years of age. Among them, 372 (54.55%) were married. The mean scores for knowledge, attitude, and practice were 8.96 ± 4.66 (possible range: 0–22), 51.65 ± 11.55 (possible range: 15–75), and 63.83 ± 17.05 (possible range: 18–90), respectively.

- **Factors associated with knowledge**:
	- Urban area (OR = 2.031, 95% CI: 1.194–3.454, P = 0.009)
	- High school or vocational school (OR = 0.355, 95% CI: 0.153–0.825, P = 0.016)
	- Non-working status (OR = 0.484, 95% CI: 0.31–0.756, P = 0.001)
	- History of breast surgery (OR = 0.572, 95% CI: 0.361–0.906, P = 0.017)

- **Factors associated with attitude**:
	- Junior college or bachelor's degree (OR = 2.288, 95% CI: 1.365–3.836, P = 0.002)
	- Monthly household income more than 10,000 CNY (OR = 1.538, 95% CI: 1.013–2.336, P = 0.044)
	- History of breast surgery (OR = 0.595, 95% CI: 0.428–0.829, P = 0.002)

- **Factors associated with practice**:
	- Attitude (OR = 1.016, 95% CI: 1.001–1.03, P = 0.032)
	- Maternity insurance (OR = 1.435, 95% CI: 1.02–2.019, P = 0.038)

In conclusion, mothers exhibited inadequate knowledge, suboptimal attitudes, and proactive practices towards breastfeeding and mastitis. It is recommended that interventions target improving breastfeeding knowledge in urban areas and enhancing attitudes among high-risk groups.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^116omCUo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Regarding attitude, 55.72% believed that the benefits of breastfeeding are only present in the infant being breastfed (A1), while 56.01% agreed that exclusive breastfeeding is achievable regardless of nipple conditions (A2). Additionally, 54.55% recognized the positive impact of longer breastfeeding duration on a child's growth and development (A3), and 54.84% acknowledged that formula-fed babies are more prone to overfeeding than breastfed babies (A4). Notably, 52.78% supported formula feeding as a practical choice for working mothers (A5).

Furthermore, respondents emphasized the emotional significance of breastfeeding, with 58.5% considering it very important (A6) and 57.19% feeling emotionally close to their babies through breastfeeding (A7). A strong consensus (57.92%) affirmed that breastmilk is the ideal food for infants (A8), and 58.23% expressed agreement that breastfed babies are healthier than formula-fed babies (A10). However, 28.89% thought that breastfeeding was a burden for them (A9).

The importance of preventing lactational mastitis was highlighted by 58.51% (A11). Additionally, 58.65% believed that most cases of lactational mastitis can be avoided (A12), and 59.09% expressed a willingness to acquire knowledge about preventing lactational mastitis (A14). Finally, 57.18% agreed to recognize early symptoms of mastitis (A13), and 58.13% recognized the necessity of providing training to pregnant and postpartum women on preventing lactational mastitis (A15).

### Mastitis: Rapid evidence review [^116d529F]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Mastitis represents a spectrum of inflammatory conditions. Lactational mastitis is the most common, with an approximate incidence of 10% in the United States, and it usually occurs in the first three months postpartum. Diagnosis is made clinically based on the presence of symptoms such as fever, malaise, focal breast tenderness, and overlying skin erythema or hyperpigmentation without the need for laboratory tests or imaging. However, obtaining milk cultures should be considered to guide antibiotic therapy, and ultrasonography should be performed to identify abscesses in immunocompromised patients or those with worsening symptoms.

Because most cases of mastitis are caused by inflammation and not a true infection, a one- to two-day trial of conservative measures (i.e. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice application, feeding the infant directly from the breast, and minimizing pumping) is often sufficient for treatment. If there is no improvement in symptoms, narrow-spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed to cover common skin flora (e.g. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics; however, if the condition worsens or there is a concern for sepsis, intravenous antibiotics and hospital admission may be required. Use of probiotics for treatment or prevention is not supported by good evidence.

Factors that increase the risk of mastitis include overstimulation of milk production and tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage. Therefore, frequent overfeeding, excessive pumping to empty the breast, and heat application should be avoided.

### Treatments for breast abscesses in breastfeeding women [^1153Qk97]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The benefits of breastfeeding are well known, and the World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and continuing breastfeeding until age two. However, many women stop breastfeeding due to lactational breast abscesses. A breast abscess is a localized accumulation of infected fluid in breast tissue. Abscesses are commonly treated with antibiotics, incision and drainage (I&D), or ultrasound-guided needle aspiration, but there is no consensus on the optimal treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different treatments for the management of breast abscesses in breastfeeding women.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trial Register (27 February 2015). In addition, we searched African Journals Online (27 February 2015), Google Scholar (27 February 2015), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Databases (27 February 2015), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal (27 February 2015). We also checked reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field as well as relevant pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating any intervention for treating lactational breast abscesses compared with any other intervention. Studies published in abstract form, quasi-RCTs, and cluster-RCTs were not eligible for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

### Descriptive study of mastitis in postpartum women in Taiwan: Incidence and related factors [^111jvL5P]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Low credibility.

Mastitis is a common disorder among postpartum women. The discomfort and pain caused by mastitis may lead to the discontinuation of breastfeeding. Large-scale epidemiological studies examining mastitis are limited. Accordingly, the present study used a nationwide population-based database to collect information about all postpartum women in Taiwan to determine the incidence of and related factors for mastitis.

- **Materials and methods**: This retrospective population-based study used the National Health Insurance Research Database to collect records of patients with mastitis during 2008–2017 and then linked the collected data to the Taiwan Birth Registry. We included women diagnosed as having lactational mastitis within 6 months of delivery. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to compare the risk of mastitis between parity in multiparous women.

- **Results**: We identified 1,686,167 deliveries in 1,204,544 women. A total of 19,794 women with 20,163 deliveries had a medical claim for mastitis. The incidence proportion of mastitis for 6 months postpartum was approximately 1.19%, being highest during the first month after delivery. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that multiparous women with a history of mastitis were likely to experience mastitis again after subsequent deliveries (adjusted odds ratio = 5.86; 95% confidence interval = 5.21–6.58). The Kaplan-Meier curve indicated that primiparous women had a higher risk of mastitis than multiparous women (log-rank test, p < 0.001). Mastitis generally occurred during the first month postpartum.

### Breast disease in the pregnant and lactating patient: Radiological-pathological correlation [^115Ra8wt]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mastitis as an inflammatory condition of the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection. It is most commonly seen during lactation, with a reported incidence of 6.6–33%. Various etiologies likely exist, such as milk stasis, blocked ducts, engorgement, or physical injury to the breast. However, a common theory suggests that poor attachment of the infant to the breast leads to cracking of the nipple epithelium, creating a retrograde path for bacteria to enter the breast tissue. Milk stasis provides a medium for bacterial growth.

The most common causative organism of lactation-related mastitis and abscess is Staphylococcus aureus. Patients can present with breast pain, redness, and swelling, and may have flu-like symptoms. Imaging on ultrasound may reveal skin thickening, areas of decreased parenchymal echogenicity or increased fat echogenicity, increased vascularity on colour Doppler, and reactive or enlarged axillary nodes.

Because the organism is usually β-lactamase producing, penicillinase-resistant antibiotics should be used. Treatment typically entails antibiotics and frequent breastfeeding or breast emptying to limit milk stasis. Treating mastitis promptly prevents abscess formation. If the patient's symptoms do not resolve within two weeks or are recurrent, mammography may be indicated to exclude an underlying malignancy.

### Risk factors, symptoms, and treatment of lactational mastitis [^113H1epL]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Lactational mastitis is a spectrum of inflammatory conditions of the breast in breastfeeding women, characterized by milk stasis, hyperlactation, and/or mammary dysbiosis, which can lead to infection.

- **Pathophysiology**: The primary factor in the pathophysiology of lactational mastitis is milk stasis due to poor milk drainage or ductal obstruction, which triggers an inflammatory response. Disruption of the milk microbiome is another contributing factor. Acute bacterial mastitis is often caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus strains.

- **Epidemiology**: Lactational mastitis is estimated to occur in 2–33% of breastfeeding women.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for lactational mastitis include nipple trauma or fissures, plugged milk ducts, wearing a tight bra, deep breast massage, hyperlactation, frequent breast pumping, abrupt weaning, history of mastitis in previous pregnancies, as well as maternal obesity and smoking.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of lactational mastitis typically begins with localized breast pain, tenderness, erythema, and warmth, progressing to systemic symptoms if untreated.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for lactational mastitis is generally good with appropriate management. Most cases resolve within 48–72 hours of initiating treatment. However, recurrence is possible, particularly in the presence of underlying risk factors.
