## Question

Screening autoantibodies in type 1 diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach screening for autoantibodies in type 1 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical rationale and staging framework that justify presymptomatic screening. Then, I should verify which autoantibodies to test and why. Next, I will examine who to screen and how to operationalize screening logistics. After that, I need to check result interpretation, confirmation, and staging. Then, I will review monitoring and management pathways, including when to consider disease-modifying therapy. Finally, I should consider special populations, assay quality, and implementation barriers, and close with a concise, staged clinical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale and staging framework, because if I get this wrong, downstream decisions will be off. Type 1 diabetes is now staged from stage 1 (multiple islet autoantibodies with normoglycemia) to stage 2 (multiple autoantibodies with dysglycemia) to stage 3 (clinical hyperglycemia), and this taxonomy is codified in ADA Standards and scientific statements, which also note that persistent multiple autoantibodies confer very high progression risk and that early detection can reduce DKA at diagnosis, aligning with the rationale for screening and early management planning [^114uG7vK] [^111xJAvG] [^1154zEUM].

> Wait, let me verify the therapeutic implication that changes the risk-benefit calculus. The FDA-approved anti-CD3 therapy teplizumab delays progression from stage 2 to stage 3 by a median of about 2–3 years, which operationalizes a disease-modifying indication in presymptomatic individuals and strengthens the case for identifying stage 2 disease through screening and staging, particularly in those with elevated genetic risk or family history [^114qqY48] [^114HHizc].

> I need to check which autoantibodies to include in the panel and why. The core panel comprises GAD65, IA-2 (and IA-2β), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and ZnT8; ICA is less standardized and not recommended for routine clinical screening, and I should confirm that IAA is most relevant before insulin exposure and less useful after treatment starts, which guides assay selection and timing in suspected cases [^114HHizc] [^116m1rx9] [^113Tae3y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about population screening; I should confirm who benefits most now. ADA 2025 recommends considering autoantibody screening in relatives of people with T1D or those with otherwise known elevated genetic risk, and it supports using autoantibodies to classify diabetes in adults with overlapping phenotypes; general population screening is being piloted but is not yet standard of care, so prioritizing first-degree relatives and genetically high-risk individuals is prudent while programs mature [^114HHizc] [^112aaJ57] [^112Qn9Rt].

> Let me think about operationalizing screening logistics, because feasibility determines uptake. Programs should standardize ordering and coding, use high-quality assays with IASP participation, and build workflows for sample handling, confirmation testing, and referral; practical guidance emphasizes a champion, team-based implementation, and clear communication plans, which I should align with consensus monitoring guidance for follow-up after results [^113tNqFB] [^113VtRxh].

> I should double-check result interpretation and the need for confirmation. A single autoantibody has low positive predictive value in the general population and can revert, so any first positive result should be confirmed with a second sample within about 3 months in an IASP-qualified lab; multiple confirmed autoantibodies define stage 1, and progression risk escalates with the number and type of antibodies, with particularly high risk when IA-2 or ZnT8 are present and when titers are high or affinity is strong [^111xJAvG] [^112WGGoH] [^116m1rx9].

> Next, I should review metabolic staging to distinguish stage 1 from stage 2, because that determines eligibility for disease-modifying therapy. Stage 2 is identified by the presence of multiple autoantibodies plus dysglycemia on OGTT (IFG 100–125 mg/dL, IGT 140–199 mg/dL, A1C 5.7–6.4%, or trial-defined early dysglycemia criteria), and ADA Standards recommend periodic A1C and annual OGTT in presymptomatic individuals, with frequency tailored to age and antibody profile [^114uG7vK] [^11177rvH].

> I will now examine monitoring and management once early-stage disease is identified, because this is where patient safety and outcomes improve. For stage 1, biannual glucose and A1C checks in children and annual in adolescents/adults are reasonable; for stage 2, more frequent visits and home glucose monitoring are advised, with education on DKA symptoms and sick-day rules; continuous glucose monitoring can detect early dysglycemia and may be considered in stage 2, and all individuals should have a written action plan and access to ketone testing [^113QoXed] [^113pq7Kz] [^113VtRxh].

> But wait, what about disease-modifying therapy access and timing; I should confirm eligibility. Teplizumab is indicated for individuals aged 8 years and older with stage 2 T1D, so confirmed stage 2 patients should be counseled and referred to centers experienced in its administration and monitoring; shared decision-making should address benefits, uncertainties, and the need for ongoing surveillance given variable progression [^114qqY48] [^114HHizc].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with adults, where misclassification is common. Adults with suspected T1D should have GAD as the primary autoantibody with IA-2 and ZnT8 added as available, recognizing that up to 10–15% of true T1D can be autoantibody negative and that LADA is frequently GADA-positive with slower progression; C-peptide helps adjudicate type in later disease, with nonfasting values > 0.6 nmol/L favoring retained endogenous insulin and < 0.2 nmol/L suggesting severe deficiency, guiding therapy and expectations [^112qWkrZ] [^113Tae3y] [^115CkNSu].

> I need to ensure assay quality and standardization are addressed, because false positives and false negatives derail care. Testing should be performed in accredited labs participating in proficiency programs such as IASP, panels should include at least three autoantibodies (GAD, IA-2, ZnT8) with IAA when appropriate, and sequential strategies can start with GAD followed by others if negative; high specificity thresholds and repeat testing reduce misclassification and are emphasized in laboratory guidance [^111xJAvG] [^116m1rx9] [^115FcTzs].

> Hold on, I should verify implementation barriers and mitigation strategies, since uptake depends on systems. Key barriers include limited provider awareness, uncertain reimbursement, workforce capacity, and psychosocial impacts of risk disclosure; solutions include education campaigns, clear referral pathways, integration with existing preventive care, and structured counseling to contextualize risk, especially for single autoantibody results that often do not progress [^113tNqFB] [^116Q8rQp].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical recommendation to ensure internal consistency. For high-risk relatives and those with elevated genetic risk, offer a standardized four-antibody panel with a built-in confirmation pathway, stage metabolically with OGTT and A1C, monitor per consensus guidance, and refer for teplizumab consideration if stage 2 is confirmed; for adults with atypical diabetes phenotypes, use autoantibodies to classify disease and avoid misdiagnosis; for the general population, support research programs and consider opportunistic screening in select settings while evidence on cost-effectiveness and logistics matures [^114HHizc] [^113VtRxh] [^112aaJ57].

Autoantibody screening for type 1 diabetes should target **high-risk individuals** (first-degree relatives, those with HLA risk alleles, or other autoimmune diseases) using a **standardized panel** (GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8, and IAA) [^114HHizc] with assays meeting IASP quality standards [^111xJAvG]. Single autoantibody positivity has low predictive value and should be confirmed within 3 months [^111xJAvG]; **multiple autoantibodies indicate high risk** and warrant referral for metabolic staging and consideration of disease-modifying therapy [^113VtRxh] [^114qqY48]. Population screening is not yet routine due to cost, logistics, and psychosocial impacts, but early detection can reduce DKA and enable timely intervention [^114izeCM] [^113tNqFB].

---

## Autoantibodies targeted in screening

The primary autoantibodies screened for T1D include:

- **Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65)**: Present in ~70–80% of new-onset T1D; persists longer than other antibodies [^115FcTzs].

- **Insulinoma-associated antigen 2 (IA-2)**: Present in ~60–70% of new-onset T1D; strongly associated with rapid progression [^112WGGoH].

- **Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8)**: Present in ~60–70% of new-onset T1D; useful when other antibodies are negative [^116m1rx9].

- **Insulin autoantibodies (IAA)**: Common in children, especially when detected before age 5; less specific in older individuals [^115FcTzs].

---

## Clinical significance of autoantibody positivity

Autoantibody positivity indicates **autoimmune beta-cell destruction** and a heightened risk of T1D [^116ThjiS]. The risk of progression depends on the **number and type of antibodies**:

| **Autoantibody status** | **Risk of progression to t1d** |
|-|-|
| Single antibody | Low (14.5% at 10 years) |
| Multiple antibodies | High (69.7% at 10 years) |

---

Persistent multiple autoantibodies confer a near-certain lifetime risk of T1D, whereas single antibodies often revert and carry lower risk [^111xJAvG] [^114zEq3v].

---

## Populations recommended for screening

Screening is **recommended for high-risk groups**, including:

- **First-degree relatives**: ~15-fold increased risk compared to the general population [^111L7m5C].

- **Individuals with HLA risk alleles**: HLA-DR3/DR4 or HLA-DQ2/DQ8 increase risk [^115FcTzs].

- **Individuals with other autoimmune diseases**: Such as celiac or autoimmune thyroid disease [^112Qn9Rt].

Routine population screening is **not currently recommended** due to low prevalence, cost, and psychosocial impacts [^116ThjiS] [^116Q8rQp].

---

## Screening methods and assays

Autoantibody screening uses **standardized assays** that meet Islet Autoantibody Standardization Program (IASP) criteria [^111xJAvG]. Radiobinding assays are preferred for their high sensitivity and specificity [^notfound]. Point-of-care or non-invasive tests are under development but are not yet validated for routine use [^115aQ97f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend:

- **ADA 2025**: Consider screening in relatives or those with elevated genetic risk; confirm positive results within 3 months; refer for metabolic staging if multiple antibodies are present [^114HHizc] [^111xJAvG].

- **ISPAD 2022**: Emphasize standardized assays, confirmation of results, and structured follow-up for antibody-positive individuals [^notfound].

- **AACE 2022**: Use autoantibodies to distinguish T1D from T2D, especially in adults with atypical features [^114GWfD5].

---

## Benefits and limitations of screening

### Benefits

Benefits include **early detection**, enabling timely intervention to reduce DKA and complications [^117EhRYd], and the opportunity for **disease-modifying therapy**, such as teplizumab, to delay progression in stage 2 T1D [^114qqY48]. Screening also provides time for education and psychosocial preparation [^115o44sG].

---

### Limitations

Limitations include **false positives**, as single antibodies can cause anxiety and unnecessary follow-up [^1154mB6i], and **false negatives**, since ~10–15% of T1D cases are antibody-negative [^112qWkrZ]. Ethical and logistical challenges include cost, access, and counseling needs [^114izeCM].

---

## Follow-up and management of positive results

Positive results require **confirmatory testing** within 3 months [^111xJAvG] and metabolic staging with A1C and OGTT to define stage 1–2 disease [^114uG7vK]. Individuals should receive education on symptoms, DKA prevention, and glucose monitoring [^113VtRxh], and those with stage 2 disease may be eligible for teplizumab or clinical trials [^114qqY48].

---

## Current research and future directions

Research focuses on improving **predictive models** by integrating genetics, autoantibodies, and metabolic markers [^1148FM8c] [^113W2px5]. Efforts also target expanding screening to the general population through cost-effective, scalable programs [^115o44sG] and developing new assays with higher specificity and less invasiveness [^116qGfjS] [^115aQ97f].

---

Autoantibody screening is a **cornerstone of early T1D detection**, enabling risk stratification, early intervention, and potential disease modification. It is most impactful in high-risk groups, with ongoing efforts to optimize assays, expand access, and address ethical and logistical challenges.

### Establishing screening programs for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes: practical guidance for diabetes care providers [^113tNqFB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease with two presymptomatic stages (stages 1 and 2) that precede its clinical onset (stage 3). The presymptomatic stages of T1D are characterized by circulating autoantibodies that can be reliably detected by autoantibody screening panels. Identifying people in the presymptomatic stages of T1D can allow for monitoring and prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. A disease-modifying therapy that has been shown to delay onset of stage 3 T1D is now also available for individuals with stage 2 disease, highlighting the importance of early detection. This intervention may delay the onset of stage 3 T1D. Updated guidance and protocols are needed to integrate autoantibody screening into standard practice. This report provides guidance for endocrinology providers on establishing clinical autoantibody screening programs within their practices, institutions, healthcare networks, and/or communities. Key steps include nominating a champion for the program, building a team to implement screening, and motivating other providers to participate. Implementation of screening requires standardizing several steps in the screening process, including communicating with individuals at risk, integrating screening into existing workflows, and streamlining logistics such as ordering and coding for autoantibody panels. Providers must have a plan to interpret and communicate results and to ensure that individuals may be appropriately followed in the future. Here, common barriers to screening are addressed, and practical solutions to facilitate the adoption and success of screening initiatives are offered.

### Type 1 diabetes risk factors, risk prediction and presymptomatic detection: evidence and guidance for screening [^1115S6rh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is recognized as a chronic disease with a presymptomatic phase that does not require insulin therapy and a clinical phase where insulin treatment becomes necessary. The presymptomatic phase is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies targeting pancreatic islet beta cell antigens (islet autoantibodies). This phase is further classified into three stages: Stage 1, defined by normoglycaemia; Stage 2, characterized by dysglycaemia; and Stage 3, marked by hyperglycaemia, which typically presents clinically and necessitates insulin therapy. The prospect of therapies to delay the onset of clinical disease and insulin treatment has been a driver of research into the presymptomatic phase since the discovery of islet autoantibodies. With the recent approval of teplizumab as a therapy to delay disease progression, attention has increasingly focused on diagnosing individuals with Stage 1 and Stage 2 type 1 diabetes. However, diagnosing an asymptomatic condition that affects fewer than 1 in 200 individuals poses significant challenges. As we enter this new era of diagnosis, it is crucial to refine diagnostic approaches to ensure accuracy and effectiveness. This review summarizes current evidence and guidance while emphasizing the need for continued research alongside broader application of screening. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that affects approximately 0.5% of individuals. In this publication, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of strategies for identifying individuals in the pre-symptomatic, early stages of the disease. Early-stage type 1 diabetes can be detected by the presence of autoantibodies against specific proteins in the blood, signaling an ongoing disease process before clinical symptoms appear. Genetic factors also contribute to the development of these autoantibodies and the disease itself. The paper explores how these markers are used for early identification, emphasizing optimal screening ages and the role of confirmation tests in preventing misdiagnosis. A key consideration in early diagnosis is that disease progression varies-some individuals develop clinical diabetes rapidly, while others may take many years. The authors discuss additional tests that can help predict how soon a diagnosed individual may require insulin treatment. Finally, the paper highlights ongoing challenges in optimizing screening for wider application and the complexities of integrating research-based screening into routine clinical practice.

### Screening and prevention of type 1 diabetes: where are we? [^117EhRYd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the subsequent requirement for exogenous insulin treatment is associated with considerable acute and chronic morbidity and a substantial effect on patient quality of life. Importantly, a large body of work suggests that early identification of presymptomatic T1D can accurately predict clinical disease, and when paired with education and monitoring, can yield improved health outcomes. Furthermore, a growing cadre of effective disease-modifying therapies provides the potential to alter the natural history of early stages of T1D. In this mini review, we highlight prior work that has led to the current landscape of T1D screening and prevention, as well as challenges and next steps moving into the future of these rapidly evolving areas of patient care.

2. Screening.

Only about 15% of patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes have a first-degree relative with the disease. The risk of developing type 1 diabetes in relatives of patients with the disease is approximately 5%, which is 15-fold higher than the risk in the general population (1 in 250–300 lifetime risk). Screening relatives of type 1 diabetic patients for islet cell autoantibodies can identify those at high risk for the disease; however, as many as 1%–2% of healthy individuals have a single autoantibody against insulin, IA-2, GAD65, or ZnT8 and are at low risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Because of the low prevalence of type 1 diabetes (approximately 0.3% in the general population), the positive predictive value of a single islet cell autoantibody will be low. The presence of multiple islet cell autoantibodies (IAA, GAD65A, IA-2A/IA-2βA, or ZnT8A) is associated with a > 90% risk of type 1 diabetes; however, until cost-effective screening strategies can be developed for young children and until effective intervention therapy to prevent or delay the onset of the disease becomes available, such testing cannot be recommended outside of a research setting.

Children with certain HLA-DR and/or HLA-DQB1 chains (*0602/*0603/*0301) are mostly protected from type 1 diabetes, but not from developing islet cell autoantibodies. Because islet cell autoantibodies in these individuals have substantially reduced predictive significance, they are often excluded from prevention trials.

Approximately 5%–10% of adult Caucasian patients who present with a type 2 diabetes phenotype also have islet cell autoantibodies, particularly GAD65A, which predict insulin dependency. This condition has been termed "latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood" (LADA), "type 1.5 diabetes", or "slowly progressive IDDM". Although GAD65A-positive diabetic patients progress faster to absolute insulinopenia than do antibody-negative patients, many antibody-negative (type 2) diabetic adults also progress (albeit more slowly) to insulin dependency with time. Some of these patients may show T-cell reactivity to islet cell components. Islet cell autoantibody testing in patients with type 2 diabetes has limited utility, because the institution of insulin therapy is based on glucose control.

RECOMMENDATION: THERE IS CURRENTLY NO ROLE FOR MEASUREMENT OF ISLET CELL AUTOANTIBODIES IN THE MONITORING OF PATIENTS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. ISLET CELL AUTOANTIBODIES ARE MEASURED IN RESEARCH PROTOCOLS AND IN SOME CLINICAL TRIALS AS SURROGATE END POINTS B (low).

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111xJAvG]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes risk — presentation, autoantibody progression, and confirmation are described as follows: People with type 1 diabetes often present with acute symptoms of diabetes and markedly elevated blood glucose levels, and 25–50% are diagnosed with life-threatening DKA; the majority, ~90%, of individuals who develop type 1 diabetes do not have a known relative with the disease. Of the 585 children who developed more than two autoantibodies, nearly 70% developed type 1 diabetes within 10 years and 84% within 15 years. Such screening, coupled with education about diabetes symptoms and close follow-up, has been shown to enable earlier diagnosis and to prevent DKA. In several cohort studies, up to 50% of children with only a single autoantibody revert to being islet autoantibody negative during follow-up; therefore, it is recommended that the first autoantibody-positive test be confirmed with a second test within 3 months, preferably in a laboratory that meets the performance standards set by the Islet Autoantibody Standardization Program (IASP). In a simulation using one such genetic risk score, the majority of those who would go on to develop type 1 diabetes, > 77%, could be identified within just 10% of the general population.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114HHizc]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes — presymptomatic screening and classification recommendations indicate that screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes may be done by the detection of autoantibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), islet antigen 2 (IA-2), or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8); autoantibody-based screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes should be considered in relatives of people with a family history of type 1 diabetes or otherwise known elevated genetic risk; having multiple confirmed islet autoantibodies is a risk factor for clinical diabetes and, when multiple islet autoantibodies are identified, referral to a specialized center for further evaluation and/or consideration of a clinical trial or approved therapy to potentially delay development of clinical diabetes should be considered; and standardized islet autoantibody tests are recommended for classification of diabetes in adults who have phenotypic risk factors that overlap with those for type 1 diabetes (e.g., younger age at diagnosis, unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, or short time to insulin treatment).

### Managing adults with screen-detected islet autoantibody positivity: a pragmatic framework [^114qL1Gu]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

New disease-modifying therapies, such as teplizumab, offer opportunities to delay the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes but require islet autoantibody screening to identify individuals at increased risk of progression to diabetes. As type 1 diabetes screening programmes expand, clinicians will increasingly encounter a new group of people: adults who test positive for islet autoantibodies but have not yet been diagnosed with diabetes. Although international guidelines outline management for both children and adults, considerable uncertainties remain, particularly for adults. In adults with islet autoantibody positivity, the lower risk of progression to type 1 diabetes compared with children, combined with the high background prevalence of mild non-autoimmune dysglycaemia, presents substantial challenges for clinical management. This Personal View aims to add clarity to international consensus guidelines, proposing a pragmatic framework for managing adults with islet autoantibody positivity. Although fitting within a UK National Health Service setting, we feel this framework is also relevant to other health systems.

### Establishing screening programs for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes: practical guidance for diabetes care providers [^114ZJPtL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease with 2 presymptomatic stages (stages 1 and 2) that precede its clinical onset (stage 3). The presymptomatic stages of T1D are characterized by circulating autoantibodies that can be reliably detected by autoantibody screening panels. Identifying people in the presymptomatic stages of T1D can allow for monitoring and prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. A disease-modifying therapy that has been shown to delay onset of stage 3 T1D is now also available for individuals with stage 2 disease, highlighting the importance of early detection. This intervention may delay the onset of stage 3 T1D. Updated guidance and protocols are needed to integrate autoantibody screening into standard practice. This report provides guidance for endocrinology providers on establishing clinical autoantibody screening programs within their practices, institutions, healthcare networks, and/or communities. Key steps include nominating a champion for the program, building a team to implement screening, and motivating other providers to participate. Implementation of screening requires standardizing several steps in the screening process, including communicating with individuals at risk, integrating screening into existing workflows, and streamlining logistics such as ordering and coding for autoantibody panels. Providers must have a plan to interpret and communicate results and to ensure that individuals may be appropriately followed in the future.

C. Screening for type 1 diabetes

Generally, people with type 1 diabetes present with acute symptoms of diabetes and markedly elevated blood glucose levels, and most cases are diagnosed soon after the onset of hyperglycemia. However, evidence from type 1 prevention studies suggests that measurement of islet autoantibodies identifies individuals who are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Such testing may be appropriate in high-risk individuals, such as those with prior transient hyperglycemia or those who have relatives with type 1 diabetes, in the context of clinical research studies (see, for example). Widespread clinical testing of asymptomatic low-risk individuals cannot currently be recommended, as it would identify very few individuals in the general population who are at risk. Individuals who screen positive should be counseled about their risk of developing diabetes. Clinical studies are being conducted to test various methods of preventing type 1 diabetes, or reversing early type 1 diabetes, in those with evidence of autoimmunity.

1. Diagnosis.

In type 1 diabetes, the pancreatic islet β-cells are destroyed and lost. In the vast majority of these patients, the destruction is mediated by an autoimmune attack. This disease is termed "type 1A" or "immune-mediated diabetes" (Table 1). Islet cell autoantibodies comprise autoantibodies to islet cell cytoplasm (ICA), to native insulin [referred to as "insulin autoantibodies" (IAA)], to the 65-kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65A), to two insulinoma antigen 2 proteins [IA-2A and IA-2βA (also known as phogrin)], and to three variants of zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A). Autoantibody markers of immune destruction are usually present in 85% to 90% of individuals with type 1 diabetes when fasting hyperglycemia is initially detected. Autoimmune destruction of β-cells has multiple genetic predispositions and is modulated by undefined environmental influences. The autoimmunity may be present for months or years before the onset of hyperglycemia and subsequent symptoms of diabetes. After years of type 1 diabetes, some antibodies fall below detection limits, but GAD65A usually remains increased. Patients with type 1A diabetes have a significantly increased risk of other autoimmune disorders, including celiac disease, Graves disease, thyroiditis, Addison disease, and pernicious anemia. As many as 1 in 4 females with type 1 diabetes have autoimmune thyroid disease, whereas 1 in 280 patients develop adrenal autoantibodies and adrenal insufficiency. A minority of patients with type 1 diabetes (type 1B, idiopathic) have no known etiology and no evidence of autoimmunity. Many of these patients are of African or Asian origin.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113DKC3A]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes natural history and progression risk indicate that stage 1, defined by the presence of two or more autoantibodies and normoglycemia, carries a 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes of ~44%. In stage 2, risk is ~60% by 2 years and ~75% within 5 years of developing a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A consensus group provides expert recommendations on what should be monitored and how often these factors should be monitored in individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes.

### Consensus guidance for monitoring individuals with islet autoantibody-positive pre-stage 3 type 1 diabetes [^113VtRxh]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the proven benefits of screening to reduce diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) likelihood at the time of stage 3 type 1 diabetes diagnosis, and emerging availability of therapy to delay disease progression, type 1 diabetes screening programs are being increasingly emphasized. Once broadly implemented, screening initiatives will identify significant numbers of islet autoantibody-positive (IAb+) children and adults who are at risk for (confirmed single IAb+) or living with (multiple IAb+) early-stage (stage 1 and stage 2) type 1 diabetes. These individuals will need monitoring for disease progression; much of this care will happen in nonspecialized settings. To inform this monitoring, JDRF, in conjunction with international experts and societies, developed consensus guidance. Broad advice from this guidance includes the following: 1) partnerships should be fostered between endocrinologists and primary care providers to care for people who are IAb+; 2) when people who are IAb+ are initially identified, there is a need for confirmation using a second sample; 3) single IAb+ individuals are at lower risk of progression than multiple IAb+ individuals; 4) individuals with early-stage type 1 diabetes should have periodic medical monitoring, including regular assessments of glucose levels, regular education about symptoms of diabetes and DKA, and psychosocial support; 5) interested people with stage 2 type 1 diabetes should be offered trial participation or approved therapies; and 6) all health professionals involved in monitoring and care of individuals with type 1 diabetes have a responsibility to provide education. The guidance also emphasizes significant unmet needs for further research on early-stage type 1 diabetes to increase the rigor of future recommendations and inform clinical care.

### Screening for type 1 diabetes in the general population: a status report and perspective [^112aaJ57]. Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Most screening programs to identify individuals at risk for type 1 diabetes have targeted relatives of people living with the disease to improve yield and feasibility. However, ∼90% of those who develop type 1 diabetes do not have a family history. Recent successes in disease-modifying therapies to impact the course of early-stage disease have ignited the consideration of the need for and feasibility of population screening to identify those at increased risk. Existing population screening programs rely on genetic or autoantibody screening, and these have yielded significant information about disease progression and approaches for timing for screening in clinical practice. At the March 2021 Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Steering Committee meeting, a session was held in which ongoing efforts for screening in the general population were discussed. This report reviews the background of these efforts and the details of those programs. Additionally, we present hurdles that need to be addressed for successful implementation of population screening and provide initial recommendations for individuals with positive screens so that standardized guidelines for monitoring and follow-up can be established.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114zEq3v]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes — autoantibody natural history and early detection highlight that the persistent presence of two or more islet autoantibodies is a near-certain predictor of clinical diabetes; in at-risk cohorts followed from birth or a very young age, seroconversion rarely occurs before 6 months of age with a peak between 9 and 24 months of age; and glucose and A1C changes (e.g., changes in fasting plasma glucose [FPG] or 2-h plasma glucose [2-h PG]) can occur about 6 months before diagnosis, enabling diagnosis before clinical onset.

6 COUNSELLING, EDUCATION AND MONITORING

The diagnosis of early‐stage type 1 diabetes must be accompanied by appropriate care. Several consensus groups have proposed guidelines, ranging from minimal care to more intensive research protocols. A practical framework for care is one that considers the likelihood of imminent progression to clinical type 1 diabetes while minimizing the intensity of testing for individuals.

Counselling and education are often underappreciated aspects of clinical care. One of the challenges we face, particularly with genetic pre‐screening, is the substantial number of individuals who require counselling after receiving information about their elevated risk for type 1 diabetes. While we acknowledge the potential negative psychosocial effects of informing families that their child may have a disease with no current symptoms, — one that may not manifest for many years — there are also clear benefits to early‐stage diagnosis. If islet autoantibody testing is done properly, the majority of those diagnosed (approximately 0.3%–0.5% of the population) will eventually develop clinical type 1 diabetes. This is not the case for genetic pre‐screening, where 10%–20% of screened individuals may be selected for follow‐up testing and informed about a risk for type 1 diabetes that is 1.5%–2.5%, leading to more widespread counselling.

3.2 Diagnosis of diabetes

At symptomatic stages, diabetes diagnosis is traditionally made based on measurements of dysglycaemia. This includes elevated haemoglobin A1c levels, as well as elevated fasting or random plasma glucose levels (Table 2). The haemoglobin A1c is a measure of glycated haemoglobin, an indirect measure of glucose exposure, that can estimate the average glucose level over the preceding 2–3 months. Although convenient as a screening tool, it has lower sensitivity than other methods and limited utility in individuals with certain hemoglobinopathies or increased red blood cell turnover, such as pregnant women or those with anaemia. It can also be affected by liver or kidney disease and certain medications. Diagnosis can also be made based on plasma glucose levels measured fasting, as part of an oral glucose tolerance test, or with elevated random levels in the setting of symptomatic hyperglycaemia. Given that fasting and random glucose levels can also be influenced by transient factors such as physical activity levels, illness, or acute stress response, oral glucose tolerance testing may be required to identify individuals with mild or moderate hyperglycaemia.

TABLE 2
Clinical tools used for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes.

The oral glucose tolerance test is typically performed by measuring plasma glucose levels 2 hours after administering a 75‐gram glucose load to a fasting patient. The increased sensitivity makes the oral glucose tolerance test preferable for screening certain individuals, including those at risk for cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes and post‐transplant diabetes. It is also the recommended diagnostic tool for gestational diabetes, although the glucose loads, timing, and diagnostic criteria differ for gestational diabetes. Oral glucose tolerance testing is also now being used to screen individuals with positive islet autoantibodies for dysglycaemia, aiming to identify individuals with Stage 2 type 1 diabetes who may benefit from teplizumab therapy to delay the onset of symptomatic diabetes. Multiple strategies have been suggested to implement screening programmes to identify high‐risk individuals who would benefit from ongoing autoantibody and oral glucose tolerance test screening for early‐stage type 1 diabetes and dysglycaemia. Although continuous glucose monitors are now widely used in the management of diabetes, they are not currently recommended for use in diagnosis. However, there is increasing evidence that because they provide more longitudinal data, the use of continuous glucose monitors may be more effective, even than oral glucose tolerance testing, in detecting early dysglycaemia in early stages of type 2 diabetes and in other high‐risk populations.

### Highlighting the new consensus guidelines for managing people at risk of, and with early-stage type 1 diabetes-relevance to clinical care in the UK [^113Xbu2C]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Type one diabetes (T1D) can be identified before the need for insulin through the measurement of islet autoantibodies. The presence of a single islet autoantibody indicates risk whereas two or more, even in the absence of hyperglycaemia, is sufficient to define early‐stage T1D.T1D now can therefore be classified into the early‐stage 'presymptomatic' and later insulin requiring 'symptomatic' stages. Since autoantibodies can appear years before symptomatic presentation and the need for insulin, individuals identified with presymptomatic T1D will need education, support and monitoring leading up to insulin initiation. The recent consensus statement initiated by Breakthrough T1D (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) with endorsement from other societies (see original publication) provides some guidance on how we should do so. The aim of this commentary is to highlight this article and explore how it best applies to clinical care in the UK.

Diagnosing T1D early has advantages; it reduces presentation in diabetic ketoacidosis, reduces glycaemic exposure prior to diagnosis and facilitates glucose control in the years that follow, and provides time to prepare for a life with insulin and the associated reduction in anxiety. Furthermore, the availability of immunotherapy to delay T1D (in the United States and potentially soon in the UK) is increasing interest in screening programmes to identify patients suitable for clinical intervention. Research screening programmes are now established internationally, through the ELSA (Early Surveillance for Autoimmune diabetes,) and T1DRA (Type 1 Diabetes Risk in Adults,) in the UK, and through a nationally sanctioned screening programme in Italy. Over and above this, many of us have patients identified early through clinical care or through reclassification of adults with dysglycaemia originally thought to be type 2 diabetes. The management of these patients has not previously followed any formal structure, and these consensus guidelines are therefore welcome.

7 THE FUTURE AND WHAT IS STILL NEEDED

Islet autoantibody screening has now been successfully rolled out in several countries, including Italy, where a law allows for reimbursement of screening costs. However, there remain several valid criticisms and concerns. Our stance has always been that screening will inevitably become more widespread, and we must be prepared to implement it with care and least harm for those being screened. As treatment for early‐stage type 1 diabetes is approved in additional countries, screening will likely become more routine. Without clear guidelines and a well‐structured and informed screening approach, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. Fortunately, there have been considerable efforts in studying genetically at‐risk individuals, as well as the general population, to guide the screening process so that its introduction into regular care can proceed. Nevertheless, many important questions remain unanswered, and several areas still need improvement. As such, it is crucial that study protocols continue to run parallel to screening activities. Areas for further investigation include the following:
Assess the harm and changes in behaviour associated with screening and identifying early‐stage type 1 diabetes.
Accurately determine the cost and cost benefit of screening for delaying clinical type 1 diabetes onset or reducing complications and hospitalization at presentation. This includes efforts to reduce costs and increase the ease of screening assays and procedures such as introducing less invasive tests without compromising accuracy.
How to most effectively perform screening to identify those who will develop clinical diabetes in adulthood, with consideration of whether to notify, counsel and monitor those with single islet autoantibodies.
Adapt screening to globally diverse populations and settings. Factors such as ethnic differences, genetic variability and environmental influences can impact the effectiveness of screening strategies. It is crucial to tailor screening protocols to different regions and populations to ensure the highest accuracy and relevance.
Guidelines, communication and infrastructure required for a safe and efficient transition into real‐world testing.

### Establishing screening programs for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes: practical guidance for diabetes care providers [^114qqY48]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a progressive autoimmune disease that is often discovered upon presentation of clinical symptoms. However, before clinical onset (stage 3), there are presymptomatic stages (stages 1 and 2) that are characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies (AAbs). Individuals with stage 1 T1D have positivity for 2 or more AAbs, are presymptomatic, and are normoglycemic. In stage 2 T1D, individuals have 2 or more AAbs and subclinical dysglycemia. By stage 3, symptoms and overt hyperglycemia are present, and individuals meet the standard diagnostic criteria for diabetes. Therefore, screening for T1D-associated AAbs is a reliable way to identify individuals with presymptomatic T1D prior to clinically significant beta cell loss and the need for exogenous insulin.

There are several potential benefits of AAb screening (Fig. 1). First, screening that leads to early detection of T1D gives clinicians an opportunity to intervene with disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Teplizumab is the first DMT approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that can alter the course of an autoimmune endocrine disease. Compared with placebo, teplizumab was shown to delay the onset (stage 3) of T1D by ∼2.7 years. The availability of teplizumab for people 8 years of age and older with stage 2 T1D is a significant development and has intensified discussions on the need for general population screening.

Aim

To improve the diagnosis and classification of patients who fail to satisfy current type 1 diabetes diagnostic criteria.

Methods

Review of the literature and current diagnostic guidelines.

Discussion

We propose a novel, clinically useful classification based on islet autoantibody status and non-fasting C-peptide levels. Notably, we discuss the subgroup of latent autoimmune diabetes in the young and propose a new subgroup classification of autoantibody negative type 1 diabetes in remission.

Conclusion

A novel classification system is proposed. Further work is needed to accurately diagnose and manage minority type 1 diabetes subgroups.

### Predicting type 1 diabetes using biomarkers [^113C5AXq]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical type 1 diabetes is preceded by an asymptomatic phase that can be identified by serum islet autoantibodies. This perspective proposes that there is now sufficient evidence to allow a broader use of islet autoantibodies as biomarkers to diagnose type 1 diabetes that is already at an asymptomatic stage, so that attempts to prevent clinical hyperglycemia become a feature of disease management. Prediction would first, therefore, shift toward the use of genetic and other biomarkers to determine the likelihood that islet autoimmunity will develop in an infant, and second, toward metabolic assessment to stage and biomarkers to determine the rate of progression to hyperglycemia in children in whom islet autoimmunity is diagnosed. A case is presented for future comprehensive risk assessment that commences at birth and includes attempts to predict, stage, and prevent initiation and progression of the disease process at multiple stages. The biomarkers required achieving this level of sophistication and dissemination are discussed.

### The pathophysiology, presentation and classification of type 1 diabetes [^115wL2Gh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is characterised by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to an absolute or near-absolute insulin deficiency. Although traditionally associated with childhood onset, it can manifest at any age, and it is increasingly recognised that there is significant heterogeneity in its clinical presentation. This review examines the intricate interplay between genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and autoimmune mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. The role of clinical phenotype, along with diagnostic and clinical measurements of autoantibodies and C-peptide, in the classification of type 1 diabetes is discussed, alongside the challenges in diagnosing and classifying the disease. Emerging insights from studies into the heterogeneity of type 1 diabetes phenotypes and mechanistic endotypes underscore the need for refined diagnostic criteria, particularly in identifying autoimmunity in individuals initially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The impact of obesity and insulin resistance on disease progression and clinical management is also examined. Overall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of type 1 diabetes, highlighting critical areas for future research and potential therapeutic approaches tailored to individual patient profiles. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body does not produce insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. Traditionally thought to start in children and young adults, type 1 diabetes can occur at any age. However, many factors contribute to when someone develops type 1 diabetes and how rapidly the disease progresses, including a person's combination of genetic factors, including specific genes that can either be protective or high-risk for the development of type 1 diabetes. Although it is widely assumed that a triggering event or events initiate the autoimmune process, the trigger or triggers remain unknown. However, it is this autoimmune process that causes progressive destruction of insulin-producing Β-cells in the pancreas that eventually leads to high blood sugar and the diagnosis of diabetes. Although we have several tools to diagnose and classify diabetes, including measuring autoimmune markers (antibodies) in the blood, there is significant variation in how individuals with type 1 diabetes can present, which can make recognizing and appropriately treating type 1 diabetes more challenging. Finding better ways to characterize the unique characteristics of each subgroup of individuals may provide new insights into how we can best tailor treatment to each of these patient groups.

### Insights into knowledge and attitudes about autoantibody screening from people affected by type 1 diabetes: a brief report [^1141iusb]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) has increased worldwide. In children, early signs of T1D are often misinterpreted as more common acute illnesses, and many are not diagnosed until they show symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Although historically perceived as a pediatric condition, adults are also at risk for T1D, and nearly half newly diagnosed T1D cases occur in adulthood. Similar to misinterpreted symptoms in childhood, misunderstanding about T1D in adulthood contributes to many adults initially being misdiagnosed, delaying treatment, and increasing the risk for life-threatening complications, such as DKA.

Advances in medicine have identified islet-specific autoantibodies which, when combined with other individual factors, can help to identify T1D in adults. Current clinical guidance suggests measuring autoantibodies in symptomatic individuals when a T1D diagnosis is suspected or when a type 2 diabetes mellitus progression occurs faster than expected. Yet, autoantibody screening can also be a powerful tool to identify children and adults without symptoms who are at higher risk of developing T1D. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care recognizes presymptomatic stages of T1D and recommends screening for autoantibodies before clinical symptoms appear.

Yet, there is currently no consensus on whom to test for T1D autoantibodies in presymptomatic individuals to identify those who may be at risk. Though some experts call for general population screening, significant hurdles remain before population-based screening can be implemented. Individuals with a family history of T1D are nearly 15 times more likely to develop T1D themselves, thus other experts believe screening first-degree relatives of individuals with T1D remains important.

Increased awareness of one's lifetime risk of T1D may help reduce misdiagnosis and hospitalizations. Although some researchers have also highlighted the potential for screening to also reduce the risk of DKA, recent research in pediatric samples is mixed on whether screening without ongoing monitoring provides the same benefits. To date, T1D autoantibody screening efforts in the United States have been somewhat limited to children, such as The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY). TrialNet has screened both at-risk children and adult relatives and T1Detect of Breakthrough T1D (formerly Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) is expanding educational efforts for population screening. However, perceptions of T1D autoantibody screening outside of the scientific community are largely unknown.

The purpose of this descriptive study was to fill this gap by beginning to understand knowledge, attitudes, and experiences with T1D autoantibody screening in a sample of individuals with a personal or close family history of T1D.

### Clinical care advice for monitoring of islet autoantibody positive individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes [^113QoXed]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/Aim

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that involves the development of autoantibodies against pancreatic islet beta-cell antigens, preceding clinical diagnosis by a period of preclinical disease activity. As screening activity to identify autoantibody-positive individuals increases, a rise in presymptomatic type 1 diabetes individuals seeking medical attention is expected. Current guidance on how to monitor these individuals in a safe but minimally invasive way is limited. This article aims to provide clinical guidance for monitoring individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes to reduce the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis.

Methods

Expert consensus was obtained from members of the Fr1da, GPPAD, and INNODIA consortia, three European diabetes research groups. The guidance covers both specialist and primary care follow-up strategies.

Results

The guidance outlines recommended monitoring approaches based on age, disease stage and clinical setting. Individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes are best followed up in specialist care. For stage 1, biannual assessments of random plasma glucose and HbA1c are suggested for children, while annual assessments are recommended for adolescents and adults. For stage 2, 3-monthly clinic visits with additional home monitoring are advised. The value of repeat OGTT in stage 1 and the use of continuous glucose monitoring in stage 2 are discussed. Primary care is encouraged to monitor individuals who decline specialist care, following the guidance presented.

Conclusions

As type 1 diabetes screening programs become more prevalent, effective monitoring strategies are essential to mitigate the risk of complications such as DKA. This guidance serves as a valuable resource for clinicians, providing practical recommendations tailored to an individual's age and disease stage, both within specialist and primary care settings.

5.5 Single islet autoantibodies

There is ongoing debate about whether the presence of a single islet autoantibody warrants monitoring for early‐stage type 1 diabetes. The controversy stems from balancing the risk of missing individuals who may progress to clinical disease with the potential for over‐notifying individuals who will never develop type 1 diabetes.

Progression rates for individuals with single islet autoantibodies vary depending on the specific islet autoantibody present, the individual's age and genetic risk. It is well established that the highest progression rates are seen in those with single IA‐2 autoantibodies, high‐affinity antibodies, higher antibody titres, younger age and an elevated genetic risk for type 1 diabetes. In children with elevated genetic risk for islet autoantibodies, progression to early‐stage type 1 diabetes (manifested by multiple islet autoantibodies) usually occurs within 2–3 years from seroconversion to single islet autoantibodies. For children with single islet autoantibodies, further genetic testing may be considered. For those with single islet autoantibodies, elevated genetic risk and normoglycaemia, monitoring for progression to multiple islet autoantibodies should continue for 3 years and could be achieved using capillary blood samples. If no progression occurs and the individual remains positive for a single islet autoantibody, further monitoring may be stopped.

5. Emerging considerations

Immunoassays for IAA, GAD65A, IA-2A/IA-2βA, and ZnT8A are now available, and a panel of these autoantibodies is currently used in screening studies. Because ICA assays are difficult to standardize, their use has declined substantially.

It is likely that other islet cell antigens will be discovered, and such discoveries could lead to additional diagnostic and predictive tests for type 1 diabetes. Autoantibody screening of dried spots obtained from finger-stick blood samples appears quite feasible in the future. For individuals who are positive for islet cell autoantibodies, HLA-DR / HLA-DQ genotyping will help define the absolute risk of type 1 diabetes.

Several clinical trials to prevent or intervene with type 1 diabetes are being actively pursued. Such trials can now be done with relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes or in the general population on the basis of the islet cell autoantibody and HLA-DR / HLA-DQ genotype status. Risk can be assessed by islet cell autoantibodies alone, without the need for evaluating endogenous insulin reserves, as was done for the U.S. DPT-1 trial. Rates of islet cell autoantibody positivity are distinctly lower in the general population than in relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes; consequently, trials with the latter group are more economical. Potential interventional therapies (for type 1 diabetes) undergoing clinical trials include oral insulin or nasal insulin given to nondiabetic (but islet cell autoantibody–positive) relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes or to children with islet cell autoantibodies and HLA genotypes conferring increased risk. Phase II clinical trials with alum-formulated GAD65 have reported no adverse events and some preservation of endogenous insulin production in GAD65A-positive diabetic patients. Additional trials of other antigen-based immunotherapies, adjuvants, cytokines, and T-cell accessory molecule–blocking agents are likely in the future. Decreased islet cell autoimmunity will be one important outcome measure of these therapies.

ALBUMINURIA (FORMERLY MICROALBUMINURIA)

Albuminuria (formerly microalbuminuria) are a well-established cardiovascular risk marker, in which increases over time to macroalbuminuria (> 300 mg/day) are associated with kidney disease and an increased risk for progression to end-stage renal disease. Annual testing for albuminuria is recommended by all major guidelines for patients with diabetes and/or kidney disease. To be useful, semiquantitative or qualitative screening tests must be shown to be positive in > 95% of patients with albuminuria. Positive results of such tests must be confirmed by quantitative testing in an accredited laboratory.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^115QtX4t]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Class II MHC molecules are involved in antigen presentation to CD4 helper cells, and the associations outlined above are likely to be explained by defective affinities to islet cell antigenic peptides, leading to persistence of T-helper cells that escape thymic ablation. Class I HLA molecules are also implicated in type 1 diabetes. Multiple non-HLA loci also contribute to susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. For example, the variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) upstream from the INS gene on chromosome 11q is useful for predicting the development of type 1 diabetes, with alleles with the longest VNTR having protective effects. Typing newborn infants for both HLA-DR and HLA - DQ — and to a lesser degree the INS gene — allows prediction of type 1 diabetes to better than 1 in 10 in the general population. The risk of type 1 diabetes in HLA-identical siblings of a proband with type 1 diabetes is 1 in 4, whereas siblings who have HLA haplotype identity have a 1 in 12 risk and those with no shared haplotype have a 1 in 100 risk. Genome-wide association studies have confirmed that the following non-HLA genetic factors increase the risk for type 1 diabetes, both in first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetic patients and in the general population: INS, VNTR, CTLA4, PTPN22, and others.

5. Emerging considerations

The sequencing of the human genome and the formation of consortia have produced advances in the identification of the genetic bases for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This progress should ultimately lead to family counseling, prognostic information, and the selection of optimal treatments.

No therapeutic intervention that will prevent diabetes has been identified. Therefore, although several islet cell autoantibodies have been detected in individuals with type 1 diabetes, their measurement has limited use outside of clinical studies. Currently, islet cell autoantibodies are not used in routine management of patients with diabetes. This section focuses on the pragmatic aspects of clinical laboratory testing for islet cell autoantibodies.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^116Bt1Gg]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

B. Monitoring/prognosis.

No acceptable therapy has been demonstrated to prolong the survival of islet cells once diabetes has been diagnosed or to prevent the clinical onset of diabetes in islet cell autoantibody–positive individuals. Thus, the use of repeated testing for islet cell autoantibodies to monitor islet cell autoimmunity is not clinically useful at present. In islet cell or pancreas transplantation, the presence or absence of islet cell autoantibodies may clarify whether subsequent failure of the transplanted islets is due to recurrent autoimmune disease or to rejection. When a partial pancreas has been transplanted from an identical twin or other HLA-identical sibling, the appearance of islet cell autoantibodies may raise consideration regarding the use of immunosuppressive agents to try to halt the recurrence of diabetes. Notwithstanding these theoretical advantages, the value of this therapeutic strategy has not been established.

Some experts have proposed that testing for islet cell autoantibodies may be useful in the following situations: 1) to identify a subset of adults initially thought to have type 2 diabetes but who have islet cell autoantibody markers of type 1 diabetes and who progress to insulin dependency; 2) to screen nondiabetic family members who wish to donate a kidney or part of their pancreas for transplantation; 3) to screen women with GDM to identify those at high risk of progression to type 1 diabetes; and 4) to distinguish type 1 from type 2 diabetes in children to institute insulin therapy at the time of diagnosis. For example, some pediatric diabetologists now treat children thought to have type 2 diabetes with oral medications but treat autoantibody-positive children immediately with insulin. It is possible, however, to follow patients who are islet cell autoantibody positive to the point of metabolic decompensation and then institute insulin therapy. The Diabetes Prevention Trial of Type 1 Diabetes (DPT-1) study failed to show a protective effect of parenteral insulin.

Results

Literature search and screening results

Of the 11,192 papers evaluated, 152 ultimately met inclusion criteria for extraction (Fig. 1). We categorized studies based on clinically relevant timepoints assessed: 91 characterized differences in rates of progression and clinical features prior to stage 3 T1D and were categorized as "prior to diagnosis" (Supplementary Data 1); 44 assessed differences in metabolic or immune features at stage 3 T1D onset and were categorized as "at diagnosis" (Supplementary Data 2; abbreviations and references for supplementary data provided in Supplementary Data 4 and 5, respectively); 11 characterized metabolic decline after diagnosis and were categorized as "after diagnosis" (Table 2); and 13 assessed differences in responses to disease-modifying therapies tested in clinical trials and were categorized as "treatment response" (Table 3). Of note, some papers included multiple studies of several outcomes; therefore, a total of 159 studies were identified from 152 papers. While the size prohibited inclusion of the list of studies from the "prior to diagnosis" and "at diagnosis" periods in the main text, a list of key themes extracted from all studies is included as Table 1.

### Adult-onset type 1 diabetes: current understanding and challenges [^112Nacov]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent epidemiological data have shown that more than half of all new cases of type 1 diabetes occur in adults. Key genetic, immune, and metabolic differences exist between adult- and childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, many of which are not well understood. A substantial risk of misclassification of diabetes type can result. Notably, some adults with type 1 diabetes may not require insulin at diagnosis, their clinical disease can masquerade as type 2 diabetes, and the consequent misclassification may result in inappropriate treatment. In response to this important issue, JDRF convened a workshop of international experts in November 2019. Here, we summarize the current understanding and unanswered questions in the field based on those discussions, highlighting epidemiology and immunogenetic and metabolic characteristics of adult-onset type 1 diabetes as well as disease-associated comorbidities and psychosocial challenges. In adult-onset, as compared with childhood-onset, type 1 diabetes, HLA-associated risk is lower, with more protective genotypes and lower genetic risk scores; multiple diabetes-associated autoantibodies are decreased, though GADA remains dominant. Before diagnosis, those with autoantibodies progress more slowly, and at diagnosis, serum C-peptide is higher in adults than children, with ketoacidosis being less frequent. Tools to distinguish types of diabetes are discussed, including body phenotype, clinical course, family history, autoantibodies, comorbidities, and C-peptide. By providing this perspective, we aim to improve the management of adults presenting with type 1 diabetes.

Historically, screening has been undertaken through research programmes, but increasingly in the UK, children and young people are also being tested in clinical care. This identifies children before the onset of clinical disease through measurement of four islet autoantibodies (IAb): anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase; anti-insulin; anti-IA2 tyrosine phosphatase; and anti-zinc transporter-8. Otherwise well individuals confirmed to have ≥ 2 IAb have early-stage T1D, meaning that they are in the pre-symptomatic phase of the disease. This is categorised into stages, where stage 1 indicates ≥ 2 IAb and normoglycaemia, and stage 2 the presence of ≥ 2 IAb and dysglycaemia. Stage 3 T1D indicates that the diagnostic threshold for T1D has been reached, which may occur with or without symptoms of diabetes. The goal of screening and monitoring programmes is to reduce the adverse clinical consequences of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis and to identify children who may benefit from disease-modifying therapies to delay or reverse progression to insulin requirement. Additional benefits include avoiding hospitalisation and preparation for the 'softer landing' into T1D. To seek these benefits, children should be monitored; yet many individuals decline follow-up in a research context. We therefore describe a pathway suitable for children identified from both screening programmes and clinical care settings. The pathway consists of 5 themes (IAb confirmation, monitoring of individuals in early-stage T1D, starting insulin, monitoring in single IAb positivity, and audit standards against which the pathway can be assessed during implementation).

### Advances in type 1 diabetes prediction using islet autoantibodies: beyond a simple count [^116TRFps]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Islet autoantibodies are key markers for the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Since their discovery, they have also been recognized for their potential to identify at-risk individuals prior to symptoms. To date, risk prediction using autoantibodies has been based on autoantibody number; it has been robustly shown that nearly all multiple-autoantibody-positive individuals will progress to clinical disease. However, longitudinal studies have demonstrated that the rate of progression among multiple-autoantibody-positive individuals is highly heterogenous. Accurate prediction of the most rapidly progressing individuals is crucial for efficient and informative clinical trials and for identification of candidates most likely to benefit from disease modification. This is increasingly relevant with the recent success in delaying clinical disease in presymptomatic subjects using immunotherapy, and as the field moves toward population-based screening. There have been many studies investigating islet autoantibody characteristics for their predictive potential, beyond a simple categorical count. Predictive features that have emerged include molecular specifics, such as epitope targets and affinity; longitudinal patterns, such as changes in titer and autoantibody reversion; and sequence-dependent risk profiles specific to the autoantibody and the subject's age. These insights are the outworking of decades of prospective cohort studies and international assay standardization efforts and will contribute to the granularity needed for more sensitive and specific preclinical staging. The aim of this review is to identify the dynamic and nuanced manifestations of autoantibodies in type 1 diabetes, and to highlight how these autoantibody features have the potential to improve study design of trials aiming to predict and prevent disease.

### Type 1 diabetes presenting in adults: trends, diagnostic challenges and unique features [^1126aLb3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been historically regarded as a childhood-onset disease; however, recent epidemiological data indicate that adult-onset T1D accounts for a substantial proportion of cases worldwide. There is evidence that adult-onset T1D is associated with the classic T1D triad of elevated genetic risk, the presence of islet-specific autoantibodies and progression to severe insulin deficiency. In this article, we review our understanding of the commonalities and differences between childhood and adult-onset T1D, and we highlight significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of the diagnosis, incidence, trajectory and treatment of adult-onset T1D. Compared to children, adults presenting with T1D exhibit differences in genetic risk, immunologic profiles and metabolic outcomes, including differences in the type and number of autoantibodies present, genetic associations and total genetic burden, rates of C-peptide decline, the persistence of C-peptide in long-duration disease and glycaemic control. In addition, obesity and metabolic syndrome are increasingly common in adults, which not only blurs the clinical distinction of adult-onset T1D from type 2 diabetes (T2D) but also likely contributes to differences in metabolic outcomes and rates of progression. Because T2D is so prevalent in the adult population, adult-onset T1D is misclassified as T2D in at least one in three cases, leading to delays in appropriate treatment. Current diagnostic tools, including autoantibody testing and C-peptide measurement, are underutilised or lack specificity in distinguishing adult-onset T1D from atypical T2D. Additionally, the impact of different responses to disease-modifying therapy between adults and children is unclear. Addressing these knowledge gaps requires expanded epidemiological studies, diverse patient registries and refined classification criteria to improve early detection and treatment strategies. A deeper understanding of adult-onset T1D will be critical to reduce the burden of misdiagnosis, lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment and optimise population-based screening approaches in this under-recognised population. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that causes metabolic and nutritional complications due to the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β cells. T1D was formerly known as "juvenile diabetes" because it was assumed that most cases occurred in childhood; however, recent epidemiological data show that nearly half of all T1D cases are diagnosed in adulthood. Despite the high prevalence of adult-onset T1D, there are challenges with correctly diagnosing T1D in adulthood, and significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the incidence, trajectory, and treatment of adult-onset T1D. In this article, we summarize the current understanding of commonalities and differences between childhood and adult-onset T1D. Particularly, we highlight age-related differences in genetic risk, immunologic profiles, and metabolic outcomes and complications. Finally, we highlight key gaps in our understanding of adult-onset T1D that need to be addressed to reduce the burden of misdiagnosis and allow for better screening and treatment of T1D in adulthood.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^112cp2tj]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially.

Approach

An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for laboratory analysis in screening, diagnosis, or monitoring of diabetes. The overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated. The draft consensus recommendations were evaluated by invited reviewers and presented for public comment. Suggestions were incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors (see Acknowledgments). The guidelines were reviewed by the Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and by the Professional Practice Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the blood. Glycemic control is monitored by the people with diabetes measuring their own blood glucose with meters and/or with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and also by laboratory analysis of HbA1c. The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of ketones, autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide are addressed.

Summary

The guidelines provide specific recommendations based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes are found to have minimal clinical value at the present time, and measurement of them is not recommended.

Finally, children affected by one or more AIDs need well-coordinated multidisciplinary care, and support is necessary for patients and their families.

Many steps forward are needed to assess the prevalence of these disorders, the genes involved, the optimal screening and to tailor treatment for each patient. However, a deeper understanding of the commonalities and differences between autoimmune conditions will accelerate progress, through the cross-fertilization of knowledge, toward an earlier diagnosis and more effective tailored management.

### Autoimmune type 1 diabetes in the era of disease-modifying immune therapy [^115o44sG]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to avoiding many of the worst outcomes associated with T1D, there is value for many individuals and caregivers to have time to prepare for a chronic disease. Patients also may value being able to contribute to research to help others with the disease, including potentially their own family members, who are at high risk. Additionally, the stress for patients and caregivers is reduced with an earlier awareness of diagnosis in presymptomatic stages compared with a sudden and unexpected clinical diagnosis. Screening also gives individuals the opportunity to discuss their results with and receive continuing education and monitoring from healthcare providers. An earlier diagnosis also gives individuals the opportunity to receive novel therapeutics that can alter the disease course.

Screening initiatives are currently underway in areas such as the US, Europe, and Australia in high‐risk populations and in the general population. Table 1 summarises the largest ongoing screening programs. Screening a larger pool of people — beyond those with a family history of T1D — with the goal of early detection and intervention, can potentially reduce long‐term healthcare costs associated with managing complications of undiagnosed autoimmune T1D. Large‐scale programs, such as the Combined Antibody Screening for Celiac and Diabetes Evaluation (CASCADE) programme in the US, use leftover samples from the Washington State Newborn Screening to test for genetic and islet autoantibody markers that estimate a child's risk of developing T1D and coeliac disease. The programme is free and does not require a blood draw or an appointment, but parents need to enrol. The cost‐effectiveness of screening programs for large populations is being assessed. For example, Autoimmune Screening for Kids (ASK), an ongoing, large‐scale, presymptomatic, autoimmune T1D screening programme, assesses cost‐effectiveness as part of its outcomes.

TABLE 1
Screening programs for T1D in the US, Europe and Australia.

Although ongoing efforts are being made to identify individuals at risk for T1D development, it is crucial that all healthcare providers — primary care providers, pediatricians, and specialists — are aware of the risk for individuals with preexisting autoimmune disease or family history of T1D or other autoimmune diseases.

### Diabetes mellitus: diagnosis and screening [^113SQes2]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Based on etiology, diabetes is classified as type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, latent autoimmune diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of youth, and miscellaneous causes. The diagnosis is based on measurement of A1C level, fasting or random blood glucose level, or oral glucose tolerance testing. Although there are conflicting guidelines, most agree that patients with hypertension or hyperlipidemia should be screened for diabetes. Diabetes risk calculators have a high negative predictive value and help define patients who are unlikely to have diabetes. Tests that may help establish the type of diabetes or the continued need for insulin include those reflective of beta cell function, such as C peptide levels, and markers of immune-mediated beta cell destruction (e.g., autoantibodies to islet cells, insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine phosphatase [IA-2a and IA-2beta]). Antibody testing is limited by availability, cost, and predictive value.

2 DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES AND UNIQUE FEATURES

As the prevalence and burden associated with adult‐onset T1D is better recognised, the question of how to most accurately identify disease in adults becomes increasingly important. Identification of adult‐onset T1D is important because the hallmark of progressive autoimmune β cell loss commonly necessitates the use of exogenous insulin as the mainstay of treatment. The erroneous treatment of those with adult‐onset T1D with therapeutics normally used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D), including dietary modification or oral agents, leads to poor glycaemic control and a higher risk of acute and chronic complications. In addition to allowing for correct therapeutic management, an accurate diagnosis for T1D in adulthood is clinically important for several additional reasons: (1) qualification for treatment with emerging immunotherapies for T1D, (2) optimal family screening and monitoring, (3) qualification for continuous glucose monitors and other diabetes technology, which may be restricted by third party and government payers, and (4) proper monitoring for additional associated autoimmune conditions in affected individuals.

The most prevalent form of diabetes in adults is T2D, which accounts for 90%–95% of all diabetes cases in adults. This proportion is in contrast to paediatric diabetes, where T1D accounts for > 90% of all diabetes cases. The low prior odds of a person with newly diagnosed adult‐onset diabetes having T1D raises a real challenge for accurately identifying T1D in adults. As a result, many cases of adult‐onset T1D are initially incorrectly diagnosed as T2D in clinical care. Additionally, the difference in prior odds of T1D between children and adults means that individual features that are either highly suggestive or confirmatory of paediatric diabetes are less discriminative on their own in adults. Features considered to be associated with T1D (lower body mass index, ketoacidosis at presentation, islet autoantibodies) can also be present in T2D. In adults, presentation with any of these features on their own is more likely to be associated with 'atypical' T2D rather than classical T1D, due to the overwhelming prior odds of T2D in this age group.

5.3 The future may not mirror the past

Prediction models often assume that the future will follow the patterns of the past. However, the incidence of type 1 diabetes has varied considerably across the globe over the last 50 years. As such, what we have learned from studies conducted 20 or 30 years ago may not be entirely applicable to the present or to type 1 diabetes diagnoses in the coming decades.

Changes in the environment, such as the emergence of new viruses (e.g. the COVID‐19 pandemic), shifts in pollution levels and climate changes, all interact with genetic susceptibility and may influence the incidence and progression of type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the weight of specific susceptibility genes and the accuracy of PRS could change over time as environmental factors evolve. Therefore, prediction models should be regularly updated, and continuous research monitoring should remain an integral part of future clinical guidelines. By doing so, we can ensure that our predictive tools remain relevant and accurate in light of ongoing global and environmental changes.

5.4 Screening in adults

Much of the current understanding of early‐stage type 1 diabetes screening has focused on children and adolescents. However, around half of clinical type 1 diabetes diagnoses occur in adulthood. Some of these adults may have already developed multiple islet autoantibodies in childhood or adolescence, but it is likely that many would be missed (islet autoantibody negative) if they had been screened during childhood.

Screening in adulthood has been performed in reasonable numbers in relatives of patients, women with gestational diabetes, and in the general population. Screening has also been performed in adults with associated diseases such as thyroid autoimmune disease. The messages that emerge are that we have fewer islet autoantibodies to rely on to identify early‐stage type 1 diabetes in adults and progression to clinical type 1 diabetes appears to be slower than in children with early‐stage type 1 diabetes. In adults, insulin autoantibodies (a key marker in childhood) are infrequently detected, and the autoantibody profile often consists primarily of single GAD autoantibodies. These antibodies are less specific for type 1 diabetes and are found in other autoimmune diseases. In children with pre‐existing genetic risk, the presence of single GAD autoantibodies is associated with a 20% progression to clinical disease over a 15‐year period. Given this, identifying true early‐stage type 1 diabetes in adults requires multiple layers of testing, including immune, genetic and metabolic markers, and further research is needed to refine these strategies.

### Optimizing type 1 diabetes screening in people with family history: a German perspective [^112oSmCk]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals with a family history of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at significantly higher risk of developing T1D compared to the general population. Before its clinical onset, individuals with T1D can be identified through islet autoantibody (IAb) testing which, if multiple IAbs are detected, justifies the diagnosis of early-stage T1D. Amid rising global T1D incidence, we outline Germany's strategy for early detection and management focused on individuals with a family history and, where informative, implementation lessons are illustrated using findings from the German Fr1da general-population study. Genetic risk factors for T1D development in individuals with family history are discussed, as well as impacts of positive screening results including influence on diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) rates and psychological aspects. In parallel, recommendations and consensus guidelines from other national screening efforts are introduced. Building on this, we address challenges in nationwide T1D family-based screening integration and explore leveraging health care systems for cost-effective implementation. We also provide practical aspects to overcome barriers for family-based T1D screening and introduce monitoring strategies in individuals with early-stage T1D. With the advent of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for delaying T1D progression, there is now a rationale at hand that offers an IAb screening incentive. Collectively, we emphasize the critical role of early detection and monitoring among at-risk relatives in mitigating the burden of T1D on individuals, families, and health care systems.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114uG7vK]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Table 2.4 — Staging of type 1 diabetes defines three stages by autoimmunity and glycemia. Stage 1 includes autoimmunity with normoglycemia and is presymptomatic, with multiple islet autoantibodies and no impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), normal A1C. Stage 2 includes autoimmunity with dysglycemia and is presymptomatic; diagnostic criteria include islet autoantibodies (usually multiple) plus dysglycemia defined by IFG: FPG 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), or IGT: 2-h PG 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L), or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) or ≥ 10% increase in A1C. Stage 3 includes autoimmunity with overt hyperglycemia and symptomatic disease; diagnostic criteria are diabetes by standard criteria, and autoantibodies may become absent. Alternate additional stage 2 criteria used in trials are 30-, 60-, or 90-min plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) with confirmatory testing in those aged ≥ 18 years; dysglycemia can be defined by one or more criteria.

4. Interpretation

GAD65A may be present in approximately 60%–80% of patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, but the frequency varies with sex and age. GAD65A is associated with HLA DR3–DQA1*0501–DQB1*0201 in both patients and healthy individuals. IA-2As may be present in 40%–50% of patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, but the frequency is highest in the young. The frequency decreases with increasing age. IA-2As are associated with HLA DR4–DQA1*0301–DQB1*0302. IAA positivity occurs in > 70%–80% of children who develop type 1 diabetes before 5 years of age but occurs in < 40% of individuals who develop diabetes after the age of 12 years. IAAs are associated with HLA DR4–DQA1*0301–DQB1*0302 and with INS VNTR. ICA is found in about 75%–85% of new-onset patients.

The ICA assay is labor-intensive and difficult to standardize, and marked interlaboratory variation in sensitivity and specificity has been demonstrated in workshops. Few clinical laboratories are likely to implement this test. The immunoassays are more reproducible and are amenable to standardization. Measurement of T-cell reactivity in peripheral blood is theoretically appealing, but the imprecision of such assays precludes their use from a clinical setting. Autoantibody positivity (by definition) occurs in healthy individuals despite an absence of a family history of autoimmune diseases. Islet cell autoantibodies are no exception. If one autoantibody is found, the others should be assayed, because the risk of type 1 diabetes increases if an individual tests positive for two or more autoantibodies.

The following suggestions have been proposed as a rational approach to the use of autoantibodies in diabetes: 1) antibody assays should have a specificity > 99%; 2) proficiency testing should be documented; 3) multiple autoantibodies should be assayed; and 4) sequential measurement should be performed. These strategies will reduce false-positive and false-negative results.

### Strategies for the prevention of autoimmune type 1 diabetes [^1128e939]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

European experts on autoimmune Type 1 diabetes met for 2 days in October 2010 in Cambridge, to review the state-of-the-art and to discuss strategies for prevention of Type 1 diabetes (http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/todd/sub_pages/T1D_prevention_Cambridge_workshop_20_21Oct2010.pdf). Meeting sessions examined the epidemiology of Type 1 diabetes; possible underlying causes of the continuing and rapid increase in Type 1 diabetes incidence at younger ages; and lessons learned from previous prevention trials. Consensus recommendations from the meeting were: 1. Resources such as national diabetes registries and natural history studies play an essential role in developing and refining assays to be used in screening for risk factors for Type 1 diabetes. 2. It is crucial to dissect out the earliest physiological events after birth, which are controlled by the susceptibility genes now identified in Type 1 diabetes, and the environmental factors that might affect these phenotypes, in order to bring forward a mechanistic approach to designing future prevention trials. 3. Current interventions at later stages of disease, such as in newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes, have relied mainly on non-antigen-specific mechanisms. For primary prevention-preventing the onset of autoimmunity-interventions must be based on knowledge of the actual disease process such that: participants in a trial would be stratified according the disease-associated molecular phenotypes; the autoantigen(s) and immune responses to them; and the manipulation of the environment, as early as possible in life. Combinations of interventions should be considered as they may allow targeting different components of disease, thus lowering side effects while increasing efficacy.

### Establishing screening programs for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes: practical guidance for diabetes care providers [^1154mB6i]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Processes following positive/negative screening test results

A plan for appropriate care and follow-up after screening results are received is critical to any successful screening program. Since the approval of teplizumab, consensus guidelines for monitoring individuals after antibody screening have been published by the American Diabetes Association, the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD), and Breakthrough T1D, and are listed in Table 7. These resources describe follow-up screenings (for negative tests), confirmation of screening results (for positive tests), metabolic monitoring of people with positive tests, and recommended communication with patients/caregivers. All relevant staff, including clinical and support staff, should be trained in the screening process and should know what discussions need to take place following screening. For individuals with positive autoimmune profiles, the institution where the screening program is taking place will determine the desired patient flow either within the organization or community.

Table 7.
Guidelines and resources on screening and monitoring for T1D

Accurate and timely discussion of the clinical implications of screening results with patients and family is essential. It may be important to explain to patients the risk associated with single vs multiple autoantibody positivity. One study estimated that the risk of children progressing to T1D after 10 years following a positive test for a single AAb is ∼14.5% and following a positive test for multiple AAbs is ∼69.7%, with the risk being even higher in children who test positive under the age of 3 years. Discussing this before screening occurs may help prevent undue distress in people who screen positive for a single antibody if results are viewable before discussion with their physician. T1D also can progress more rapidly in younger children with multiple AAbs. When there is confirmed positivity for T1D AAbs, providers may refer patients to a specialist in T1D for further education, metabolic monitoring, consideration of DMT, and opportunities to participate in clinical research.

It will be important to consider cultural factors that could influence how patients and their families perceive an AAb screen result or a T1D diagnosis. A study on the perceptions and experiences of Hispanic adolescents in the United States with T1D reported some culturally specific themes, including a higher emphasis on familial well-being, parental concerns about cultural foods exacerbating T1D, and the positive influence of having a Spanish-speaking member of their healthcare team.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune condition resulting from immune‐mediated destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells, and a lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin therapy. Islet‐specific autoantibodies predate clinical T1D by 10–15 years. These autoantibodies can be detected in peripheral blood within the first few years of life. The presence of two or more islet autoantibodies indicates an almost lifetime certainty of future insulin‐requiring T1D. Children identified with two or more autoantibodies can subsequently be staged with oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT): normoglycaemia (stage 1), dysglycaemia (stage 2), or stage 3 T1D, either asymptomatic (stage 3a) or insulin‐requiring (stage 3b). International guidelines recognise these early stages of T1Dand diagnostic codes (SNOMED, ICD‐10) are now available for these presymptomatic stages (1 and 2).

### Lessons from prediction and prevention of type 1 diabetes [^111rRiSY]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Two major accomplishments in the field of prediction and prevention have had important implications for type 1 diabetes (T1D), as well as other immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). First, individuals destined to develop T1D can now be identified by testing for the presence of autoantibodies, long before signs or symptoms of clinical disease. Second, there is now an FDA-approved therapy to delay disease progression. These accomplishments were made possible by more than 4 decades of multicenter research, sustained commitments from funders, a culture of collaboration that enabled international standardization of autoantibody measurements, and common entry criteria and outcome measures for clinical trials. Robust data find that essentially everybody with 2 or more autoantibodies will eventually progress to clinical disease. This concept is now codified as stages of T1D, whereby those with multiple autoantibodies are considered to have early-stage disease. This provided a pathway for regulatory approval by clarifying that therapy was aimed at treating people with disease in contrast to preventing disease in healthy individuals and has helped antibody-positive individuals understand risk. Translating these scientific accomplishments into clinical practice remains challenging, but the availability of an approved therapy to delay T1D onset suggests that such translation is on the horizon for T1D and ultimately for other immune-mediated diseases.

### The pathophysiology, presentation and classification of type 1 diabetes [^114ZwFdB]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite this complexity, certain characteristics in presentation and clinical tools can be utilized for the classification and phenotypic characterization of individual patients, guiding clinical decision‐making (see Table 2). Although both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can present at any age, the age of onset and initial presentation often help in classifying type 1 diabetes. Most individuals with type 1 diabetes present with symptoms of hyperglycaemia, but younger patients present more commonly with diabetic ketoacidosis. At initial diagnosis, 25%–50% of children present in diabetic ketoacidosis, as opposed to 6%–21% of adults. Though use of GRS has not yet been incorporated into standard clinical practice, measuring serum levels of islet autoantibodies and confirming low C‐peptide levels can also aid in classifying type 1 diabetes. Some of these classic phenotypic features, including age, body mass index, and race, have even been shown to predict autoantibody positivity in individuals with type 1 diabetes upon presentation. Current recommendations for classification in adults acknowledge the importance of incorporating multiple tools in patients who are autoantibody negative, including clinical features, C‐peptide testing, and, in some cases, genetic testing for monogenic diabetes.

Variability in the intensity and timing of autoimmune β‐cell destruction is a significant source of heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes. Many individuals experience a brief period of partial remission, known as the honeymoon period, after initiating insulin therapy. However, disease in younger children appears to be commonly associated with a higher number of autoantibodies, fewer insulin‐containing islets, and lower serum C‐peptide concentrations. These individuals also tend to have high‐risk HLA haplotypes. While a more intense autoimmune attack is often associated with a younger age at diagnosis, it is unclear whether increased susceptibility of the developing islets and β‐cells may also contribute to earlier decline in functional β‐cell mass. In contrast, adults diagnosed with type 1 diabetes often have a slower time course of autoimmune β‐cell destruction, leading to older age at onset of symptoms. Some of these adults with classic presenting symptoms and absolute insulin deficiency do not have autoantibodies on diagnosis and are referred to as having idiopathic type 1 diabetes. Although it is presumed that their pathology is due to autoimmunity, with potential negative seroconversion, it is unclear whether some of these cases represent alternative β‐cell pathology. However, to distinguish these individuals from those with monogenic diabetes, genetic testing for monogenic diabetes can be considered in paediatric or adult individuals who are antibody negative and have a milder clinical course, with lower insulin requirements and without ketosis.

Background

Multiple laboratory tests are used to diagnose and manage patients with diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these tests varies substantially.

Approach

An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for the use of laboratory testing for patients with diabetes. A new system was developed to grade the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. Draft guidelines were posted on the Internet and presented at the 2007 Arnold O. Beckman Conference. The document was modified in response to oral and written comments, and a revised draft was posted in 2010 and again modified in response to written comments. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry and the Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine Committee of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry jointly reviewed the guidelines, which were accepted after revisions by the Professional Practice Committee and subsequently approved by the Executive Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

In addition to long-standing criteria based on measurement of plasma glucose, diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased blood hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) concentrations. Monitoring of glycemic control is performed by self-monitoring of plasma or blood glucose with meters and by laboratory analysis of HbA(1c). The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, and other analytes are addressed.

Summary

The guidelines provide specific recommendations that are based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes have minimal clinical value at present, and their measurement is not recommended.

### The broad clinical phenotype of type 1 diabetes at presentation [^114NWt31]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Immune-mediated (auto-immune) Type 1 diabetes mellitus is not a homogenous entity, but nonetheless has distinctive characteristics. In children, it may present with classical insulin deficiency and ketoacidosis at disease onset, whereas autoimmune diabetes in adults may not always be insulin dependent. Indeed, as the adult-onset form of autoimmune diabetes may resemble Type 2 diabetes, it is imperative to test for diabetes-associated autoantibodies to establish the correct diagnosis. The therapeutic response can be predicted by measuring the levels of autoantibodies to various islet cell autoantigens, such as islet cell antibodies (ICA), glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), insulin, tyrosine phosphatase (IA-2) and IA-2β, and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) and evaluating β-cell function. A high risk of progression to insulin dependency is associated with particular genetic constellations, such as human leukocyte antigen risk alleles, young age at onset, the presence of multiple autoantibodies, including high titres of anti-GAD antibodies; such patients should be offered early insulin replacement therapy, as they respond poorly to diet and oral hypoglycaemic drug therapy. Hence, considering the broad spectrum of phenotypes seen in adult-onset diabetes, treatment targets can only be reached by identification of immune-mediated cases, as their management differs from those with classical Type 2 diabetes.

### Staging presymptomatic type 1 diabetes: a scientific statement of JDRF, the endocrine society, and the American diabetes association [^1154zEUM]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Insights from prospective, longitudinal studies of individuals at risk for developing type 1 diabetes have demonstrated that the disease is a continuum that progresses sequentially at variable but predictable rates through distinct identifiable stages prior to the onset of symptoms. Stage 1 is defined as the presence of β-cell autoimmunity as evidenced by the presence of two or more islet autoantibodies with normoglycemia and is presymptomatic, stage 2 as the presence of β-cell autoimmunity with dysglycemia and is presymptomatic, and stage 3 as onset of symptomatic disease. Adoption of this staging classification provides a standardized taxonomy for type 1 diabetes and will aid the development of therapies and the design of clinical trials to prevent symptomatic disease, promote precision medicine, and provide a framework for an optimized benefit/risk ratio that will impact regulatory approval, reimbursement, and adoption of interventions in the early stages of type 1 diabetes to prevent symptomatic disease.

### Islet autoantibodies as precision diagnostic tools to characterize heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^115TcbBV]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Islet autoantibodies form the foundation for type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis and staging, but heterogeneity exists in T1D development and presentation. We hypothesized that autoantibodies can identify heterogeneity before, at, and after T1D diagnosis, and in response to disease-modifying therapies.

Methods

We systematically reviewed PubMed and EMBASE databases (6/14/2022) assessing 10 years of original research examining relationships between autoantibodies and heterogeneity before, at, after diagnosis, and in response to disease-modifying therapies in individuals at-risk or within 1 year of T1D diagnosis. A critical appraisal checklist tool for cohort studies was modified and used for risk of bias assessment.

Results

Here we show that 152 studies that met extraction criteria most commonly characterized heterogeneity before diagnosis (91/152). Autoantibody type/target was most frequently examined, followed by autoantibody number. Recurring themes included correlations of autoantibody number, type, and titers with progression, differing phenotypes based on order of autoantibody seroconversion, and interactions with age and genetics. Only 44% specifically described autoantibody assay standardization program participation.

Conclusions

Current evidence most strongly supports the application of autoantibody features to more precisely define T1D before diagnosis. Our findings support continued use of pre-clinical staging paradigms based on autoantibody number and suggest that additional autoantibody features, particularly in relation to age and genetic risk, could offer more precise stratification. To improve reproducibility and applicability of autoantibody-based precision medicine in T1D, we propose a methods checklist for islet autoantibody-based manuscripts which includes use of precision medicine MeSH terms and participation in autoantibody standardization workshops.

### Development and recalibration of a multivariable type 1 diabetes prediction model for type 1 diabetes across multiple screening studies [^1148FM8c]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Teplizumab, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stage 2 pre-clinical type 1 diabetes, has been shown to delay the onset of stage 3 (clinical) disease by a median of 3 years. The need to identify individuals eligible for therapy, coupled with growing evidence for lower risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals identified in early stages of pre-clinical type 1 diabetes, has driven heightened interest in screening and risk prediction for type 1 diabetes. The stages of pre-clinical type 1 diabetes include individuals with multiple islet autoantibodies (stage 1), and individuals with evidence of dysglycaemia in addition to islet autoantibodies (stage 2). A combination of variables, including genetics, age, number and specificity of islet autoantibodies, and metabolic measures, affect the risk of progression to clinical stage 3 type 1 diabetes and account for the majority of type 1 diabetes risk.

Autoantibody screening for pre-clinical type 1 diabetes has been performed in natural history studies with a variety of designs. These designs include family studies, such as the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study (TrialNet), birth cohort studies of genetically high-risk infants, e.g. The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, and cross-sectional population screening of children, such as Fr1DA. Several methods to stratify individuals for future type 1 diabetes risk have been developed and tested in these studies. However, there are few assessments of whether models developed in one screening setting (e.g. longitudinal natural history studies) can be used in other approaches (e.g. cross-sectional studies of relatives at risk). The transferability of a predictive model would support its validity, robustness, and generalizability and facilitate accurate risk prediction in a range of settings. Furthermore, the translation of predictive models into clinical research and practice requires freely accessible, user-friendly tools that provide individual risk prediction. Characteristics such as initial risk, age of screening, monitoring intensity and methods, genetic selection, and other study-specific variables may further influence the accuracy, calibration, and overall performance of prediction models. The availability of tools that incorporate multiple predictive variables for type 1 diabetes is currently limited but is common in other diseases (e.g. Q-risk for cardiovascular disease risk) and is likely to play a significant role as screening for type 1 diabetes exapands.

Screening and diagnosis — testing modalities and autoimmune evaluation: Fasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and A1C can be used to test for prediabetes or diabetes in children and adolescents, and children and adolescents with overweight or obesity in whom the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is being considered should have a panel of pancreatic autoantibodies tested to exclude the possibility of autoimmune type 1 diabetes.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult: current knowledge and uncertainty [^113BU3yV]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with adult-onset autoimmune diabetes have less Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA)-associated genetic risk and fewer diabetes-associated autoantibodies compared with patients with childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes. Metabolic changes at diagnosis reflect a broad clinical phenotype ranging from diabetic ketoacidosis to mild non-insulin-requiring diabetes, also known as latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA). This latter phenotype is the most prevalent form of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes and probably the most prevalent form of autoimmune diabetes in general. Although LADA is associated with the same genetic and immunological features as childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes, it also shares some genetic features with Type 2 diabetes, which raises the question of genetic heterogeneity predisposing to this form of the disease. The potential value of screening patients with adult-onset diabetes for diabetes-associated autoantibodies to identify those with LADA is emphasized by their lack of clinically distinct features, their different natural history compared with Type 2 diabetes and their potential need for a dedicated management strategy. The fact that, in some studies, patients with LADA show worse glucose control than patients with Type 2 diabetes, highlights the need for further therapeutic studies. Challenges regarding classification, epidemiology, genetics, metabolism, immunology, clinical presentation and treatment of LADA were discussed at a 2014 workshop arranged by the Danish Diabetes Academy. The presentations and discussions are summarized in this review, which sets out the current ideas and controversies surrounding this form of diabetes.

What's new?

Latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA) is an autoimmune diabetes defined by adult-onset, presence of diabetes associated autoantibodies, and no insulin treatment requirement for a period after diagnosis.
Immunologically, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibodies are by far the most common autoantibody in adult-onset diabetes.
LADA is the most prevalent form of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes and probably the most prevalent form of autoimmune diabetes in general.
LADA shares genetic features with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Phenotypically, LADA patients are often misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes.
LADA patients generally have worse HbA1c levels than type 2 diabetes patients.
Clinically, LADA patients tend to have a lower mean age at diabetes onset, lower body mass index and more frequent need for insulin treatment than patients with type 2 diabetes.
Management of LADA may require a dedicated strategy, yet currently there is a paucity of randomized controlled trial data.

### Type 1 diabetes risk factors, risk prediction and presymptomatic detection: evidence and guidance for screening [^1157PjUu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Decision trees and the 2 × 2 × 2 principle to diagnose early‐stage type 1 diabetes

The application of sequential testing in screening resembles a decision tree with a series of AND and OR commands. Certain factors, such as family history of type 1 diabetes or age, can be considered early in the decision tree without requiring a sample or test. The sequence of tests is usually determined by factors such as cost, ease of application and test sensitivity. Highly sensitive tests are often used sequentially with AND commands, while less sensitive tests can be combined using OR commands to improve overall sensitivity. For example, 'first‐degree relative with type 1 diabetes' alone has low sensitivity but combining it with 'PRS > 90th percentile' in an OR command yields high sensitivity for detecting early‐stage type 1 diabetes. Decision trees should be simple and practical. Two examples of childhood screening strategies are discussed (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2
Early‐stage type 1 diabetes screening strategy decision tree options. Option A starts with islet autoantibody testing in all children with a series of AND commands leading to second assays and samples depending upon the screening test and confirmation test results. Option B includes an a priori selection based on genetic risk with OR commands that identify a subset of the population to be tested for islet autoantibodies following the AND command decision tree. The efficiency of screening, and in particular for option B, is dependent upon the recall rates achieved for autoantibody testing.

The first approach begins with autoantibody testing. Timing is critical: screening too late misses cases of clinical type 1 diabetes that manifest early, while screening too early fails to capture those who seroconvert later. Current estimates, suggest:
Screening at age 3 years identifies ~35% of cases progressing to clinical type 1 diabetes by age 18.
Screening at ages 2 and 6 years captures ~65% of cases.
Screening at ages 2, 6 and 10 years identifies approximately 80% of cases.

### Islet autoantibodies as precision diagnostic tools to characterize heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^1179N8Z3]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of T1D was considered an applicable outcome 91% (138/152) of papers and of these, 126/138 (91%) included valid and reliable measures of T1D diagnosis. For the 111 papers with dichotomous outcomes over a period of follow-up, 90% (100/111) clearly described methods to ensure that participants were free of the outcome at study start. 111 studies included longitudinal follow-up. Specific descriptions of the follow-up period were typically included; this was most commonly over > 5 years (61/111, 55%), with 30% (33/111) followed for 2–5 years, and 11% (12/111) followed for < 2 years. Duration of follow-up was clearly described in 106/111 (95%). Loss to follow up was much less commonly described. Specifics were only included in 29% (32/111) of applicable papers, and strategies to address loss to follow-up were only described in 19% (21/111) of applicable papers.

### Management of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: a consensus statement from an international expert panel [^115CkNSu]. Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

A substantial proportion of patients with adult-onset diabetes share features of both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). These individuals, at diagnosis, clinically resemble T2D patients by not requiring insulin treatment, yet they have immunogenetic markers associated with T1D. Such a slowly evolving form of autoimmune diabetes, described as latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA), accounts for 2–12% of all patients with adult-onset diabetes, though they show considerable variability according to their demographics and mode of ascertainment. While therapeutic strategies aim for metabolic control and preservation of residual insulin secretory capacity, endotype heterogeneity within LADA implies a personalized approach to treatment. Faced with a paucity of large-scale clinical trials in LADA, an expert panel reviewed data and delineated one therapeutic approach. Building on the 2020 American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus for T2D and heterogeneity within autoimmune diabetes, we propose "deviations" for LADA from those guidelines. Within LADA, C-peptide values, proxy for β-cell function, drive therapeutic decisions. Three broad categories of random C-peptide levels were introduced by the panel: 1) C-peptide levels < 0.3 nmol/L: a multiple-insulin regimen recommended as for T1D; 2) C-peptide values ≥ 0.3 and ≤ 0.7 nmol/L: defined by the panel as a "gray area" in which a modified ADA/EASD algorithm for T2D is recommended; consider insulin in combination with other therapies to modulate β-cell failure and limit diabetic complications; 3) C-peptide values > 0.7 nmol/L: suggests a modified ADA/EASD algorithm as for T2D but allowing for the potentially progressive nature of LADA by monitoring C-peptide to adjust treatment. The panel concluded by advising general screening for LADA in newly diagnosed non-insulin-requiring diabetes and, importantly, that large randomized clinical trials are warranted.

### Prevention of type 1 diabetes: the time has come [^1147soiU]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus has completely changed our view of this disease in the past 25 years-from an acute, fulminant disease, to a chronic, autoimmune process. Information on genetic and serologic markers has increased our ability to identify individuals at risk. Prospectively gathered data indicate that, with a combination of immunologic and metabolic studies, children with a 6-year risk of disease higher than 90% can be identified due to an ongoing immune process. They differ from children with overt disease only in the time it will take for glucose levels to rise above a diagnostic threshold. Therapies to change the progression of beta-cell loss have been tested in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. With improved predictive capabilities and agents that can have longer-lasting effects than those tested more than 10 years ago, new prevention studies are underway. These studies are large and costly but the risks posed by such interventions compare favorably with those of developing hyperglycemia and of future complications portended by the diagnosis of diabetes. In this Review we discuss risk-stratification techniques and how they are applied, other diagnostic criteria, and outcomes from diabetes-prevention trials.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^112uQTtY]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The appropriate interval between tests is not known. The rationale for the 3-year interval is that false negatives will be repeated before substantial time elapses, and there is little likelihood that an individual will develop significant complications of diabetes within 3 years of a negative test result.

Because of the need for follow-up and discussion of abnormal results, testing should be carried out within the health care setting. Community screening outside a health care setting is not recommended because people with positive tests may not seek, or have access to, appropriate follow-up testing and care. Conversely, there may be failure to ensure appropriate repeat testing for individuals who test negative. Community screening may also be poorly targeted, i.e. it may fail to reach the groups most at risk and inappropriately test those at low risk (the worried well) or even those already diagnosed.

B. Testing for type 2 diabetes in children

The incidence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents has increased dramatically in the last decade, especially in minority populations, although the disease remains rare in the general pediatric population. Consistent with recommendations for adults, children and youth at increased risk for the presence or the development of type 2 diabetes should be tested within the health care setting. The recommendations of the ADA consensus statement on type 2 diabetes in children and youth, with some modifications, are summarized in Table 5.

Table 5
Testing for type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic children

C. Screening for type 1 diabetes

Generally, people with type 1 diabetes present with acute symptoms of diabetes and markedly elevated blood glucose levels, and most cases are diagnosed soon after the onset of hyperglycemia. However, evidence from type 1 diabetes prevention studies suggests that measurement of islet autoantibodies identifies individuals who are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Such testing may be appropriate in high-risk individuals, such as those with prior transient hyperglycemia or those who have relatives with type 1 diabetes, in the context of clinical research studies (see, for example). Widespread clinical testing of asymptomatic low-risk individuals cannot currently be recommended, as it would identify very few individuals in the general population who are at risk. Individuals who screen positive should be counseled about their risk of developing diabetes. Clinical studies are being conducted to test various methods of preventing type 1 diabetes or reversing early type 1 diabetes in those with evidence of autoimmunity.

### Autoimmune type 1 diabetes in the era of disease-modifying immune therapy [^116qGfjS]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Because of the need to reduce the risk of DKA at diagnosis, coupled with advances that now enable individuals to delay clinical onset of T1D with immune therapy, a renewed focus should be placed on early identification and screening. Screening children for islet autoantibodies would facilitate the detection of T1D at the earliest disease stages. Autoantibodies, as markers of T1D, may develop before 1 year of age but can also appear later in childhood. Thus, autoantibody screening may need to occur at multiple timepoints throughout childhood.

The affinity level of islet autoantibodies also influences an individual's risk of developing clinical T1D. The presence of lower‐affinity single islet autoantibodies has been associated with no increased risk of developing clinical T1D, and these autoantibodies tend to be lost over time. Nonetheless, radiobinding assays that are widely used to detect islet autoantibodies can detect these low‐affinity autoantibodies, resulting in false‐positive results. Therefore, confirmation of single antibody positivity in a separate test by using newer assays that detect only high‐affinity autoantibodies that are more predictive of clinical T1D development may increase the likelihood of identifying individuals at risk.

### Children and adolescents: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117C93xt]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune conditions in type 1 diabetes — general assessment notes that clinicians should assess for additional autoimmune conditions soon after diagnosis and if clinically relevant (B), and because other autoimmune diseases are increased in type 1 diabetes, screening for thyroid dysfunction and celiac disease should be considered; periodic screening in asymptomatic individuals has been recommended, but the optimal frequency is unclear. Although less common than thyroid and celiac disease, other autoimmune conditions occur more commonly in youth with type 1 diabetes than in the general pediatric population and should be assessed and monitored as clinically indicated.

### Risk of new-onset type 1 diabetes in individuals with celiac disease and thyroid disease-an observational study [^114Zpb5R]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the increased risk of developing T1D, screening for islet autoantibodies in those with celiac disease, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism could be beneficial for diagnosing T1D in presymptomatic stages: stage 1 (presence of autoantibodies and normal blood glucose levels), stage 2 (presence of autoantibodies and dysglycaemia) or Stage 3a (asymptomatic hyperglycaemia). Early detection of autoimmune diseases that can have severe clinical presentations, such as T1D (typically with diabetic ketoacidosis) and Addison's disease, can help individuals avoid these traumatic experiences. Diagnosis of T1D in presymptomatic stages allows for metabolic monitoring to track disease progression and reduce the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and associated complications. Early diagnosis also enables the opportunity to receive disease‐modifying therapy to preserve beta‐cell function and the opportunity to participate in prevention trials that are underway in T1D. Current professional society guidelines on the management of autoimmune diseases (aside from primary adrenal insufficiency) lack guidance on T1D screening in individuals with existing autoimmune diseases and in those with family members with autoimmune diseases. Additionally, despite the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines mentioning that individuals with a family or personal history of other related autoimmune diseases are at increased risk of developing T1D compared to the general population, the most recent guidelines provide no recommendation to screen these individuals for presymptomatic T1D. While additional population‐based studies are necessary to confirm the generalisability of these results, findings from the present study may help inform future updates to guidelines.

### Executive summary: guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114F16N1]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially. An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for laboratory analysis in patients with diabetes. The overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated. The draft consensus recommendations were evaluated by invited reviewers and presented for public comment. Suggestions were incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors (see Acknowledgments in the full version of the guideline). The guidelines were reviewed by the Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and by the Professional Practice Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the blood. Glycemic control is monitored by the patients measuring their own blood glucose with meters and/or with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring devices and also by laboratory analysis of HbA1c. The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring; genetic testing; and measurement of ketones, autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide are addressed.

Summary

The guidelines provide specific recommendations based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes are found to have minimal clinical value at the present time, and measurement of them is not recommended.

### Islet autoantibodies as precision diagnostic tools to characterize heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^117Swhko]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The Precision Medicine in Diabetes Initiative (PMDI) was established in 2018 by the ADA in partnership with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). The ADA/EASD PMDI includes global thought leaders in precision diabetes medicine who are working to address the burgeoning need for better diabetes prevention and care through precision medicine. This T1D Diagnostics-focused Systematic Review is written on behalf of the ADA/EASD PMDI as part of a comprehensive evidence evaluation in support of the 2nd International Consensus Report on Precision Diabetes Medicine.

Multiple observational studies and clinical trials have investigated the impact of genetics, immune markers, metabolic function, and environmental factors, on the development and progression of T1D. Some of these works have identified subgroups of individuals who may theoretically derive greater benefit than others from particular therapies. In this systematic review, we sought to identify aspects of precision medicine that have the potential to be adopted into clinical practice over the next 10 years. Given the substantial body of work focused on optimization, reproducibility, and validation of islet autoantibodies as biomarkers of islet autoimmunity –, and their increased use in clinical practice since the development of the T1D staging system, we chose to focus on islet autoantibodies as an individual feature of disease. We explored and summarized evidence that islet autoantibodies can be used to identify unique phenotypes of disease presentation and progression at four clinically-relevant timepoints: prior to clinical (stage 3) T1D diagnosis, at stage 3 T1D onset, after stage 3 T1D diagnosis, and in response to disease-modifying therapy at diagnosis (new onset trials) or before the time of stage 3 T1D diagnosis (prevention trials).

Here we show that autoantibody type/target was most frequently examined, followed by autoantibody number. Recurring themes included correlations of autoantibody number, type, and titers with progression, differing phenotypes based on order of autoantibody seroconversion, and interactions with age and genetics. Our findings suggest that the application of autoantibody features, specifically in relation to age and genetic risk, prior to diagnosis has the most potential to more precisely define and understand differences in T1D progression. To improve reproducibility and applicability of autoantibody-based precision medicine in T1D, we propose a methods checklist for islet autoantibody-based manuscripts which includes use of precision medicine MeSH terms and participation in autoantibody standardization workshops.

### Expanding the role of continuous glucose monitoring in modern diabetes care beyond type 1 disease [^113pq7Kz]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

CGM in Guidelines for Diabetes Management

Use of CGM has rapidly become an accepted part of clinical guidelines for the treatment of diabetes. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and care Excellence (NICE) recommended access to isCGM for subgroups of people with T1DM on insulin therapy as early as 2017 and current guidelines now recommend either isCGM or real-time CGM for all adults and children with T1DM and people with T2DM on intensive insulin therapy. Diabetes technology was included in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of medical care in diabetes for the first time only in 2019, at which point stand-alone CGM was suggested for "consideration" in children and adolescents with T1DM and indicated as a "useful tool" for adults with T1DM. By 2022, the same guidelines simply state: " Use of CGM devices should be considered from the outset of the diagnosis of diabetes that requires insulin management ". This has been echoed in the consensus guidelines for management of T1DM from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the ADA, which indicate that CGM is the preferred option for glucose monitoring in newly diagnosed T1DM in adults, and should be considered for adults with established T1DM, even if they are meeting glycemic targets.

While recognizing and supporting the value of using CGM for children with T1DM, the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) does not make a specific recommendation to initiate CGM at the point of diagnosis for children with T1DM. We propose that this step should be taken, even in low-resource settings. The long-term benefits of proactive glucose control with CGM for children with T1DM are compelling.

Similarly, CGM can be used as part of a targeted screening and monitoring strategy in individuals identified as at-risk for T1DM as a consequence of family history or detectable islet autoantibodies. As they progress to stage 1, stage 2, and pre-symptomatic stage 3 in T1DM, use of CGM can detect abnormal glucose metabolism as individuals progress to stage 2. Proactive screening in this way can reduce the incidence of DKA and rates of hospitalization as symptoms become overt.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114XweXS]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–related diabetes is characterized by fulminant onset of type 1 diabetes that can occur with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and low or undetectable C-peptide; fewer than half of these individuals have autoantibodies typical of type 1 diabetes. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors for cancer has led to immune system activation precipitating autoimmune disease, and type 1 diabetes as an immune-mediated adverse event occurs in just under 1% of checkpoint inhibitor–treated individuals, most commonly with programmed death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 pathway blockade alone or combined with other checkpoint inhibitors. To date, the majority of immune checkpoint inhibitor–related cases of type 1 diabetes occur in people with high-risk HLA susceptibility haplotype for type 1 diabetes.

2.4.2 Autoantibody confirmation test

If the 3‐screen result is ≥ 20 IU, the parent is informed by telephone and invited to a regional paediatric hospital (Figure 2) for a venous sample to test for each of the four diabetes autoantibodies. Here, 4‐10 mL serum is obtained and an additional sample (up to 4 mL) for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is processed locally. The autoantibody serum is stored at 4°C and returned within 24 h of sample collection to the CIS laboratory at the University of Birmingham.

FIGURE 2
ELSA regional hospitals. ELSA hospitals offer venous autoantibody confirmation and OGTT. These are strategically located across all four UK nations to minimise travel burden for families. Image obtained from Google My Maps:

Signs of haemolysis in the returned samples are recorded and serum is centrifuged and aliquoted on arrival and stored at 4°C prior to analysis. Serum is tested for anti‐GAD, anti‐IA‐2A, anti‐ZnT8 and anti‐insulin (IAA) autoantibodies using individual ELISA assays (Euroimmun IA2, GAD and ZnT8, and Orgentec Launch Diagnostics Insulin IgG ELISA).

Parents of single autoantibody positive children are contacted by telephone, education offered, and results letter sent to the parent and GP. Children with two or more autoantibodies are informed by an ELSA clinician and referred for metabolic staging within 4 weeks.

2.4.3 Metabolic testing

Metabolic testing is undertaken through an OGTT. A glucose solution, equivalent to 1.75 g of glucose per kg body weight (maximum 75 g), is ingested within 10 min. Venous glucose is collected at −20, 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Children are staged according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and International Society for Adolescent and Pediatric Diabetes (ISPAD) criteria (Table 1). Stage 3 cases are referred to the local paediatric diabetes centre for management of clinical T1D. Stage 1 and 2 cases are invited for education and a results letter sent to the family and the GP.

### Newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes in a 93 year old [^115GAaWe]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is typically a disease of young but can present at any age. We present a case of a 93-year-old woman who presented with 10 days history of feeling lethargic, polydipsia and decreased appetite. Her capillary blood glucose was raised at 25 mmol/L with significant ketonaemia and venous blood gas showing metabolic acidosis. She had a background of primary hypothyroidism and vitamin B 12 deficiency with weakly positive parietal cell antibodies. Laboratory investigations confirmed diabetes with HbA1c of 117 mmol/mol (12.9%). In view of high clinical suspicion of type 1 diabetes, her diabetes autoantibodies were checked which showed strongly positive anti-GAD antibody with titre of > 2000 IU/mL (range < 10) confirming our diagnosis. She was treated with diabetic ketoacidosis protocol with intravenous fluids and intravenous insulin. On recovery, she was discharged home on once daily insulin with aim to self-manage diabetes with support from district nurses and to avoid hypoglycaemia.

### Islet autoantibodies as precision diagnostic tools to characterize heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^114JWH77]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence for use of antibodies at, after, and in response to disease-modifying therapies was less robust, and far fewer studies were identified. At diagnosis, the presence or absence of specific islet autoantibodies was also correlated with age, which might be expected given the differences in autoantibody presentation at seroconversion. However, multiple studies suggested that the primary autoantibodies at seroconversion had often disappeared at the time of diagnosis,–; this is an open question in the field. While some evidence suggested that declining islet autoantibody titers and numbers after diagnosis corresponded to preserved residual C-peptide, we did not find convincing evidence to support the use of islet autoantibodies to define heterogeneity in metabolic outcomes after stage 3 diagnosis. Evidence for use of islet autoantibody features to predict responses to disease-modifying therapies was modest. One potential explanation for this finding could be epitope spreading and neoantigen expansion that accompanies T1D disease progression, making the impact of a specific antigen (and its corresponding autoantibody) less significant by the time an individual has reached more advanced stages of disease.

Type 2 diabetes risk factors and consideration of alternate etiology — The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity; it occurs more frequently in individuals with prediabetes, prior gestational diabetes mellitus, or polycystic ovary syndrome, is more common in people with hypertension or dyslipidemia and in certain racial, ethnic, and ancestral subgroups, and is often associated with a strong genetic predisposition or family history in first-degree relatives. In adults without traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes and/or of younger age, consider islet autoantibody testing (e.g. GAD autoantibodies) to exclude the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.

### A combined risk score enhances prediction of type 1 diabetes among susceptible children [^113W2px5]. Nature Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D)-an autoimmune disease that destroys the pancreatic islets, resulting in insulin deficiency-often begins early in life when islet autoantibody appearance signals high risk 1. However, clinical diabetes can follow in weeks or only after decades, and is very difficult to predict. Ketoacidosis at onset remains common 2,3 and is most severe in the very young 4,5, in whom it can be life threatening and difficult to treat 6–9. Autoantibody surveillance programs effectively prevent most ketoacidosis 10–12 but require frequent evaluations whose expense limits public health adoption 13. Prevention therapies applied before onset, when greater islet mass remains, have rarely been feasible 14 because individuals at greatest risk of impending T1D are difficult to identify. To remedy this, we sought accurate, cost-effective estimation of future T1D risk by developing a combined risk score incorporating both fixed and variable factors (genetic, clinical and immunological) in 7,798 high-risk children followed closely from birth for 9.3years. Compared with autoantibodies alone, the combined model dramatically improves T1D prediction at ≥ 2years of age over horizons up to 8years of age (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ≥ 0.9), doubles the estimated efficiency of population-based newborn screening to prevent ketoacidosis, and enables individualized risk estimates for better prevention trial selection.

### Diagnosing type 1 diabetes in adults: guidance from the UK T1D immunotherapy consortium [^113Tae3y]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Combining laboratory tests with clinical features.

Measurement of beta‐cell autoantibodies and C‐peptide are valuable in distinguishing T1D from other forms of diabetes. However, neither is perfect and we strongly advise that these tests are used and interpreted within the context of time since diagnosis and clinical likelihood of T1D to minimise false positives and negatives (Figure 1).
Beta‐cell autoantibodies. Measurement of autoantibodies to beta‐cell antigens (GADA, IA2A and ZnT8A) is valuable at diagnosis(or no later than 3 years after diagnosis when measurement of C‐peptide level is more appropriate — see below) in adults who are likely to have T1D on clinical criteria or have rapid glycaemic progression following diagnosis of T2D. Patients with positive beta‐cell autoantibodies in this context are likely to have autoimmune T1D. Whilst negative beta‐cell autoantibodies do not exclude T1D (sensitivity with the three autoantibodies is approximately 90%), they should prompt consideration of T2D in older adults, and of MODY in those diagnosed in the age ≤ 35. The probability of MODY based on clinical features can be assessed using the MODY calculator (app/ModyCalculator). We do not recommend routine testing in the absence of clinical suspicion of T1D or deteriorating glucose control, as false positives are common. Islet cell antigen (ICA) antibody measurement is not recommended, as this test is difficult to standardize, has poor sensitivity and does not offer additional information above the combination of GADA, IA‐2A and ZnT8A. We recommend testing all three autoantibodies to minimise the possibility of false negatives. Where there are logistic difficulties, a sequential approach is acceptable with testing for GADA first, as this identifies 60%–80% of T1D patients. Where GADA is negative or borderline, additional testing is recommended for IA2A and ZnT8A as this clarifies diagnosis in a further 10%–20% of people.
C‐peptide. Beta‐cell autoantibody positivity declines with diabetes duration, and as time passes from diagnosis, the diagnosis of T1D and need for insulin therapy is best determined by the level of insulin deficiency rather than the presence of autoimmunity. Hence, C‐peptide is the preferred initial test in patients with long duration diabetes. Beyond 3 years after diagnosis, where there is uncertainty about the diabetes type, and a patient is insulin treated, measurement of serum C‐peptide levels is valuable to establish treatment requirements. We recommend that C‐peptide is assessed on a non‐fasting blood sample, ideally within 1–5 h of a carbohydrate containing meal. Glucose should be measured alongside C‐peptide. C‐peptide values are approximately 2.5 times higher post meal compared to fasting. If the glucose is < 8mmol/L and C‐peptide < 0.6 nmol consider repeating the test, as falsely low levels may result from inadequate stimulation. Very low levels (< 0.08 nmol/L) do not need to be repeated.C‐peptide should not be tested during a period of hypoglycaemia or within 2 weeks of a hyperglycaemic emergency, as levels may be temporarily suppressed. Absolute cut‐off values are hard to define. However, non‐fasting serum C‐peptide = > 0.6 nmol/L (or equivalent urine C‐peptide creatinine ratio (UCPCR)) more than 3 years after diagnosis is strongly suggestive of T2D and lack of requirement for insulin. In this situation, replacement of insulin with other agents should be consideredwith careful monitoring of glycaemic control. A non‐fasting serum C‐peptide level of = < 0.2 nmol/l in the absence of hypoglycaemia (at the time of testing) is suggestive of severe insulin deficiency and should be considered to be secondary to T1D in the absence of severe underlying pancreatic pathology. More than 3 years after diagnosis, serum values of > 0.2 nmol/L should prompt consideration of MODY in the presence of negative beta‐cell autoantibodies and age of diagnosis < 35 years.C‐peptide testing may assist management before 3 years; however, a high C‐peptide level at this time should be treated with considerable caution when differentiating between diabetes types as T1D patients may still produce substantial amounts of endogenous insulin shortly after diagnosis.

### Type 1 diabetes presenting in adults: trends, diagnostic challenges and unique features [^115cvnX5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Adult‐onset T1D has similar autoantibody associations as childhood‐onset T1D, with GAD65, IA2, ZnT8, insulin and islet cell autoantibodies all being present in adult‐onset T1D. However, adults diagnosed with T1D most often present with GAD65 positivity, and adults are more likely to be single autoantibody positive at diagnosis compared to both children and adolescents. Importantly, high levels of GAD65 positivity are closely associated with a rapid decline in C‐peptide, deteriorating metabolic control and the need for insulin treatment, suggesting that measurement of GAD65 autoantibodies is valuable both as a diagnostic and prognostic tool. Additionally, while reversion of multiple autoantibody status occurs in slightly more than 4% of people overall, adults were more likely than children to become zero or single antibody positive after being identified as multiple antibody positive. It is worth noting that for some autoantibodies, there is evidence that normal ranges may be different in adults and children. For example, ZnT8 autoantibodies have a higher normal range in individuals < 30 years of age. It is also important to note that a significant proportion of a background population will be autoantibody positive based on the way normal ranges and positive tests are defined (commonly by an autoantibody titre > 97.5th or 99th percentile of a reference population). Thus, caution must be applied when analysing data from cohorts where there is the possibility of a false‐positive autoantibody test. Furthermore, at the individual level, autoantibody false positives can have a tremendous impact on screening efforts that are increasingly being applied in the general population.

6 WHEN TO SUSPECT A DIAGNOSIS OFIN CHILDREN MAY NOT BE CORRECT?

Features that suggest monogenic diabetes in children initially thought to have T1D are listed below. Except for the age of diagnosis less than 6 months, none of these are pathognomonic and should be considered together rather than in isolation:
Diabetes presenting before 6 months of age (as T1D is extremely rare in this age group), or consider NDM if the diagnosis is between 6 and 12 months and there is no evidence of autoimmunity or if the person with diabetes has other features such as congenital defects, or an unusual family history.
Family history of diabetes in one parent and other first‐degree relatives of that affected parent.
Absence of islet autoantibodies, especially if checked at diagnosis.
Preserved β‐cell function, with low insulin requirements and detectable C‐peptide (either in blood or urine) over an extended partial remission phase (at least 5 years after diagnosis).

2.2 Modifiers of genetic risk

The background genetic risk for type 1 diabetes varies substantially across populations, influenced by geographic location (space) and ancestry. However, absent major disruptions such as widespread lethal infections, mass emigration or immigration, the genetic architecture of a population or ancestral group remains relatively stable over decades (time). In contrast, the incidence of type 1 diabetes has increased significantly over recent decades, indicating the influence of non‐genetic factors. Although data on early‐stage type 1 diabetes are limited, it is reasonable to infer similar trends. The identification of non‐genetic modifiers of risk has been less successful than the elucidation of the genetic architecture of type 1 diabetes. Nevertheless, clear and strong modifiers of genetic risk have been identified, and some of these are relevant to screening for early‐stage type 1 diabetes.

Age is likely the most significant modifier of genetic risk. The incidence of clinical type 1 diabetes varies by age, peaking around adolescence. More striking, however, is the age‐related onset of autoimmunity that defines early‐stage type 1 diabetes. Autoimmunity is rare in the first 6 months of life but peaks dramatically between 1 and 2 years of age, followed by a decline to a steady, lower incidence throughout childhood and into the teenage years. This age‐related pattern is largely determined by the development of insulin autoantibodies and is strongly associated with HLA genotypes, particularly the presence of HLA DR4‐DQ8. However, the overall risk of developing islet autoantibodies declines exponentially between 6 months and 6 years of age for all HLA risk genotypes. Furthermore, the genetic risk associated with INS genotype and PRS also diminishes with age, making age a critical factor in modifying genetic susceptibility to early‐stage type 1 diabetes. This has important implications for determining the optimal timing of screening. Additionally, age interacts with the number and type of islet autoantibodies present in the presymptomatic phase of type 1 diabetes. Adults who progress to clinical type 1 diabetes often exhibit fewer islet autoantibodies, predominantly GAD antibodies, compared to children. Consequently, screening and diagnostic strategies may need to differ between adults and children.

### Islet autoantibodies as precision diagnostic tools to characterize heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^113nzBdL]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This work explored and summarized evidence that islet autoantibodies could be used to identify and define specific phenotypes prior to, at, and after stage 3 T1D diagnosis, and in response to disease-modifying therapy. We systematically reviewed the application of antibody measurements to define heterogeneity at diagnostic timepoints before and after the onset of clinically symptomatic disease in 152 papers published over the past 10 years. The large majority of studies identified assessed antibody features prior to diagnosis, suggesting that overall, the application of antibody features to T1D precision diagnostics will be most impactful on defining differences in T1D phenotypes during this period of disease development.

Although multiple individual features (immune signatures, genetics, metabolic measures) could be applied to differentiate disease phenotypes, in this effort, we chose to focus on autoantibodies because standardized measures are currently available and their implementation as precision diagnostic tools in T1D has the potential to be rapidly implemented. As a well-established marker of islet autoimmunity, autoantibodies benefit from prior harmonization efforts, existing standardization workshops that compare assays using clinical samples, and for the most-established assays, easy accessibility to clinicians –. Indeed, the application of autoantibody number as a precision diagnostic tool that stratifies future disease risk has moved beyond the T1D research field, as the with the T1D staging systemwhich is now being applied as part of clinical care guidelines to define stages of T1D. Our review supports broad application of T1D staging using autoantibody number to guide individuals and clinicians on T1D risk. Furthermore, our findings support conclusions that have been drawn by othersthat additional antibody features, such as antibody titer, type, and order of appearance, could be utilized together and in concert with autoantibody number to more precisely stratify the current staging paradigm.

### How do I diagnose maturity onset diabetes of the young in my patients? [^113GgaLd]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

3 IF DIAGNOSING MODY IS IMPORTANT, WHO SHOULD I REFER FOR MODY GENETIC TESTING?

This is the most important question for clinicians diagnosing MODY in paediatric and young adult populations — how to identify patients for MODY genetic testing from the much higher background prevalence of young onset polygenic type 1 and type 2 diabetes. There are no simple clinical criteria that will accurately identify all MODY patients, and there is overlap with young onset polygenic type 1 and type 2 diabetes with regard to age of diabetes onset, BMI, history of parental diabetes, HbA1c levels and treatment. The traditional clinical diagnostic criteria for MODY (diagnosed < 25 years, not insulin treated and a parent affected with diabetes) results in a genetic diagnosis in less than half of cases. Diagnosis is further hindered by the fact that within routine diabetes care there is a lack of genetics training and awareness of MODY, with an emphasis on treatment rather than diagnosis. As a result, the majority of MODY patients go unrecognized and are managed suboptimally.

Diabetes in children is predominantly autoimmune mediated, and the most common consideration is the discrimination between type 1 diabetes and MODY. Islet autoantibodies are a highly sensitive and specific biomarker of type 1 diabetes; they are detected in ~90% of children with type 1 diabetes but are detected in only 1% with a genetic diagnosis of MODY. Systematic screening strategies for MODY in paediatric populations using antibody tests are therefore highly effective; in the ~10% of children with negative antibodies at diagnosis, approximately one in seven will have a genetic diagnosis of MODY. Positivity for a single antibody should be exclusion criteria for MODY testing. A minimum of three antibodies should be tested — GAD, IA2 and ZnT8 are preferred. IAA is not widely performed and cannot be used once insulin treatment is given, and ICA antibody testing using primate or rodent pancreatic tissue should not be performed due to a high false‐negative rate. Clinicians should seek additional antibody testing if only GAD and/or ICA are offered. Laboratories should determine the thresholds for antibody positivity based on centiles derived from nondiabetic and type 1 diabetes populations to avoid false‐positive results.

If testing for all 4 AAbs initially is not feasible or practical in a given country or region, screening should be streamlined to include 3 AAbs in a single panel. For example, testing for ZnT8 may not be covered by public health insurance in certain regions. This approach may result in not capturing a proportion of individuals with single AAb positivity. A study of people with recent-onset T1D showed that 26% of those considered AAb negative when testing for GAD, IAA, and IA-2 were positive for ZnT8. In addition, a recent systematic review found that the presence of certain AAbs may influence risk of progression to T1D. In people with single AAb positivity, the presence of ZnT8 was associated with a higher risk of progression to T1D than in those with single AAb positivity for GAD, IAA, or IA-2. In addition, ZnT8 may be a useful marker in older individuals, as IAA levels can decline with age.

A screen for islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs) is one of the original assays for T1D-associated autoimmunity that has been and continues to be used in the research setting but is less available in clinical practice. ICAs are measured by an indirect immunofluorescence assay on pancreatic tissue and can detect multiple undefined antigens. Although ICAs can assist in risk determination, confirmation testing with "biochemical" AAbs (GAD, IAA, IA-2, and ZnT8) is recommended in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care and Breakthrough T1D (formerly JDRF) consensus guidance document.

Thyroid disease in youth with type 1 diabetes — screening and follow-up include screening for thyroid disease by measuring TSH, thyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies soon after diagnosis (B), measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations at diagnosis when clinically stable or soon after optimizing glycemia, and if normal, rechecking every 1–2 years or sooner when antibodies are positive or symptoms/signs suggest dysfunction, thyromegaly, abnormal growth, or unexplained glycemic variability (B). Autoimmune thyroid disease occurs in 17–30% of individuals with type 1 diabetes, and at diagnosis ~25% of children have thyroid autoantibodies; hyperthyroidism occurs in ~0.5% of people with type 1 diabetes. Thyroid function tests may be misleading at diagnosis; if slightly abnormal at diagnosis, they should be repeated soon after metabolic stability and achievement of glycemic goals. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with increased risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia and dyslipidemia and reduced linear growth rate, while hyperthyroidism usually causes deterioration of glycemia.

### Protocol for a feasibility and acceptability study for UK general population paediatric type 1 diabetes screening-the earLy surveillance for autoimmune diabetes (ELSA) study [^114TyckN]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

The EarLy Surveillance for Autoimmune (ELSA) study aims to explore the feasibility and acceptability of UK paediatric general population screening for type 1 diabetes.

Methods

We aim to screen 20,000 children aged 3–13years for islet-specific autoantibodies through dried blood spot sample collection at home, hospital or community settings. Children with two or more autoantibodies are offered metabolic staging via oral glucose challenge testing. Feasibility assessments will compare recruitment modalities and uptake according to demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity, level of deprivation and family history of diabetes) to determine optimal approaches for general population screening. The study is powered to identify 60 children (0.3%) with type 1 diabetes (stage 1–3). Parents are invited to qualitative interviews following ELSA completion (child screened negative or positive, single autoantibody or multiple, stage 1–3) to share their screening experience, strengths of the programme and any areas for improvement (acceptability assessments). Parents who decline screening or withdraw from participation are invited to interview to explore any concerns. Finally, we will interview professional stakeholders delivering the ELSA study to explore barriers and facilitators to implementation.

Conclusion

Early detection of type 1 diabetes allows insulin treatment to be started sooner, avoids diagnosis as an emergency, gives families time to prepare and the opportunity to benefit from future prevention trials and treatments. ELSA will provide essential feasibility and acceptability assessments for UK general population screening to inform a future national screening programme for paediatric type 1 diabetes.

### Type 1 diabetes presenting in adults: trends, diagnostic challenges and unique features [^112qWkrZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Nonetheless, in adults with suspected T1D, guidelines suggest that the first step should be autoantibody testing, beginning with the measurement of GAD antibodies. If GAD is negative, IA‐2 and ZnT8 should be measured. Measurement of insulin antibodies can be added in those not treated previously with insulin. A positive autoantibody result is taken to be indicative of a T1D diagnosis; however, in individuals < 35 years of age who lack clinical features of T2D or monogenic diabetes, a negative autoantibody result should not influence the diagnosis, as up to 15% of true T1D cases will be autoantibody negative. Additionally, for these autoantibody negative individuals < 35 years of age, monogenic diabetes must be considered based on the presence of one or more features: (1) haemoglobin A1C < 58 mmol/mol (< 7.5%) at diagnosis; (2) a parent with diabetes; (3) clinical features of monogenic diabetes, including renal cysts, partial lipodystrophy, maternally inherited deafness and severe insulin resistance in the absence of obesity or (4) a probability of having monogenic diabetes per the Exeter MODY calculator that exceeds 5%. If one or more of these features is present, testing should proceed with measurement of C‐peptide in those individuals treated with insulin. If the result is > 200 pmol/L, genetic testing for monogenic diabetes should be undertaken. A C‐peptide level < 200 pmol/L is consistent with a diagnosis of T1D. For those lacking features of either monogenic diabetes or T2D, T1D is likely confirmed.

The diagnostic approach is less clear for those > 35 years of age, especially in those with mixed clinical features. In this case, clinical decision‐making is suggested, with the acknowledgement that a trial of non‐insulin therapy may be appropriate. Such a decision should come with education and counselling about the signs and symptoms of worsening metabolic status and ketoacidosis. Measurement of C‐peptide can be undertaken in those with disease duration of more than 3 years. If C‐peptide is > 600 pmol/L, a diagnosis of T2D is more likely, while a value < 200 pmol/L is consistent with a diagnosis of T1D. For those with intermediate values (> 200 pmol/L but < 600 pmol/L), the guidelines suggest rechecking when the individual is > 5 years from diagnosis.

3 APPROACHES FOR CLASSIFICATION: PRACTICAL AND ASPIRATIONAL

Given the high rate of initial disease misclassification, how then does the practicing clinician reliably identify individuals with adult‐onset T1D? A high level of vigilance is necessary, and the simple AABBCC mnemonic can serve as a reminder to consider age, other autoimmunity, BMI, background (i.e. family history), control and comorbidities when considering diabetes aetiology. The development of actual data‐driven tools to identify adult‐onset T1D is needed and under active development. Among single features, age at diagnosis (< 40 years), low BMI (< 25 kg/m 2) and progression to insulin therapy within 3 years of diagnosis are the best predictors of T1D. Classification models that integrate several key features are increasingly being applied and tested. In one study, the use of five variables, including clinical features (age of diagnosis, body mass index) and biomarkers (autoantibodies and GRS) had high accuracy in identifying recently diagnosed adults who had a rapid insulin requirement.

A recent consensus report from the EASD and the ADA includes a staged approach to diagnosing adults with suspected T1D, and this diagnostic algorithm appeared in the 2025 ADA Standards of Care. Caveats to this approach include the acknowledgement that most recommendations have been based on data from White European populations, and limited information is available from more diverse populations. Secondly, while features such as age of onset, BMI, history of autoimmunity, the presence of classical symptoms and severity of hyperglycaemia are useful in building a case for an individual, no single clinical feature can accurately distinguish T1D from T2D. Thus, overlap in the clinical features between T1D, T2D, and even atypical and monogenic diabetes subtypes may often lead to continued uncertainty of diagnosis, even when autoantibodies and C‐peptide measurements are available. In this setting, longitudinal monitoring of C‐peptide may allow for detection of progression to severe insulin deficiency, which necessitates treatment with insulin, whatever the clinical diagnosis. Finally, elements of the approach are opinion‐driven, reflecting a lack of rigorous and validated data to drive clinical decision‐making. For example, the idea of false‐positive autoantibody results, either biological or technical, is not considered in the guidelines but has been an area of significant controversy. Additional studies are needed to understand if increased attention to adult‐onset T1D and these new diagnostic algorithms will reduce misclassification in the future.

### Islet autoantibodies as precision diagnostic tools to characterize heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^112C2VcU]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our analysis supports existing evidence of the strong impact of age on heterogeneity of T1D development. Specifically, our analysis confirms that younger age at seroconversion increases risk and rate for progression to stage 3 T1D, and this age-related risk can be further stratified using islet autoantibody type, titer, combined with number at seroconversion. The significant impact of age when considering use of autoantibodies to stratify risk suggests that (1) recommendations for use of autoantibodies in screening and prediction studies will need to consider stratification by age groups, and (2) that the analytic approach to autoantibody studies should include strategies to address impacts of age.

While most studies on autoantibodies in the period before Stage 3 T1D diagnosis focused on autoantibody number, type, or timing of seroconversion, fewer studies that passed our criteria for review assessed the immune responses that drive these changes. Therefore, there is continued need to understand how and when tolerance is broken in the context of clinical studies and how this leads to heterogeneous phenotypes. The few studies that did assess immune signatures – in multiple autoantibody positive relatives revealed both proinflammatory and partially regulated (protective) phenotypes, which were also associated with autoantibody number. Interestingly, autoantibody negative relatives were characterized by the partially regulated phenotype, suggesting that progression to T1D may be the result of insufficient suppressive mechanisms, rather than differences in antigen targets. Immunoregulatory signatures were also identified in high HLA-risk siblings of subjects with T1D who were autoantibody negative, though this study was excluded from our review due to sample size.

Precision diagnostics has particular utility in stratifying risk beyond autoantibody number in single autoantibody positive individuals, a group that is considered lower risk for T1D progression overall, and consequently, often do not meet inclusion criteria for clinical trials that require multiple positive autoantibodies. Studies of ECL vs. RBA assays suggest that ECL assays can identify a subset of higher risk, single autoantibody positive individuals. Autoantibody type was identified in this review as a common approach to stratify risk among single autoantibody positive individuals. For example, given the rarity of IA-2A as the initial autoantibody at seroconversion in birth cohorts, individuals who are cross-sectionally single autoantibody positive for IA-2A may reflect a higher risk group that has reverted to single autoantibody positivity, and are at higher risk of progression to multiple autoantibody positivity and ultimately T1D. The T1DI analysis of over 24,000 children at increased genetic risk for T1D from prospective cohort studies in Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the US, revealed that HLA-DR-DQ genotypes can stratify risk progression among children retaining a single autoantibody.

### Autoimmune type 1 diabetes in the era of disease-modifying immune therapy [^112Qn9Rt]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Most T1D screening efforts have focused on screening relatives of individuals with clinical T1D because relatives have an approximate 15‐fold increase in risk compared with those without a relative with T1D. While this group should be screened, approximately 80%–85% of those who will be diagnosed with T1D do not have a family history, highlighting the narrow approach of screening those with a family history. This may lead to a reduced ability to influence the severity of the disease at diagnosis, including DKA, and the opportunity to preserve beta cells with DMTs.

Screening programs for early T1D in the general population have been suggested as the long‐term goal. But until they are more widely implemented, healthcare providers outside structured screening programs will bear the responsibility of screening high‐risk individuals. Those considered at high risk of T1D development could be expanded beyond those with first‐degree relatives to include individuals with other autoimmune conditions. As previously mentioned, the presence of one autoimmune disease may confer increased risk for the subsequent development of T1D. There is robust evidence suggesting that the presence of coeliac disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, Addison's disease, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis makes individuals high‐risk for development of T1D, particularly for coeliac disease and thyroid disease. Indeed, the American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee Roundtable Report recommended screening for T1D in children and adolescents with autoimmune thyroid or coeliac disease. However, the red flag in clinical practice to screen for presymptomatic T1D could come from the presence of any autoimmune disease, since there is varying evidence for many additional diseases conferring high risk for development of T1D due to shared genetic susceptibility and predisposition. The co‐occurrence of autoimmune diseases has been well documented, with 25% of individuals with an autoimmune disease expected to develop additional autoimmune disorders. Nonetheless, a more practical course of action for clinics/institutions with limited resources for screening could be to take a risk stratification approach in which individuals with relatives with T1D are given highest priority for screening, followed by individuals with a personal or family history of other autoimmune diseases, and then lastly, individuals in the general population at specified ages or concurrently with other routine screening tests.

### Prediction of progression to type 1 diabetes with dynamic biomarkers and risk scores [^112sSE5w]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Identifying biomarkers of functional β-cell loss is an important step in the risk stratification of type 1 diabetes. Genetic risk scores (GRS), generated by profiling an array of single nucleotide polymorphisms, are a widely used type 1 diabetes risk-prediction tool. Type 1 diabetes screening studies have relied on a combination of biochemical (autoantibody) and GRS screening methodologies for identifying individuals at high-risk of type 1 diabetes. A limitation of these screening tools is that the presence of autoantibodies marks the initiation of β-cell loss, and is therefore not the best biomarker of progression to early-stage type 1 diabetes. GRS, on the other hand, represents a static biomarker offering a single risk score over an individual's lifetime. In this Personal View, we explore the challenges and opportunities of static and dynamic biomarkers in the prediction of progression to type 1 diabetes. We discuss future directions wherein newer dynamic risk scores could be used to predict type 1 diabetes risk, assess the efficacy of new and emerging drugs to retard, or prevent type 1 diabetes, and possibly replace or further enhance the predictive ability offered by static biomarkers, such as GRS.
