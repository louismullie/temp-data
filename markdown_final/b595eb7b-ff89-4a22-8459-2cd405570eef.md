## Question

What is the most effective treatment approach for somatic tinnitus associated with temporomandibular joint disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most effective treatment approach for somatic tinnitus associated with temporomandibular joint disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining somatic tinnitus and confirming its link to TMD. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence base, especially randomized trials and guidelines. Next, I will examine which specific interventions within a multidisciplinary orofacial approach are most effective. After that, I need to assess the strength and certainty of evidence and acknowledge limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized recommendation and note adjunctive options and implementation considerations, ensuring I continuously check claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct and pathophysiology. Somatic tinnitus is characterized by modulation of tinnitus with jaw, neck, or head movements, reflecting convergence of somatosensory and auditory pathways, and in patients with TMD this often manifests as jaw-clenching or mandibular movement–sensitive tinnitus, supporting a mechanistic rationale for treating the masticatory and cervical musculoskeletal generators to reduce tinnitus burden [^1155G1SD] [^116WZ2ed].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence signal before drawing conclusions. The 2025 VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline explicitly recommends a multidisciplinary approach for bothersome tinnitus with TMD or cervical spine dysfunction to reduce functional impact, and it bases this on two 2020 randomized trials showing benefit of orofacial physical therapy and of cervico-mandibular manual therapy added to exercise/education, respectively, even though the overall confidence in evidence quality is rated low, which still supports a "weak for" recommendation given favorable benefit–harm balance and patient-reported improvements [^114QEVYM] [^112s41Hy] [^1155G1SD].

> I will now examine the first RCT signal. The 2020 randomized trial in patients with tinnitus attributed to TMD found that adding targeted cervico-mandibular manual therapy to a physiotherapy program produced larger improvements than exercise/education alone across tinnitus severity, TMD pain, tinnitus handicap, disability, mood, and mandibular range of motion, with large effect sizes and sustained benefits at 3 and 6 months, which strengthens the case for including manual therapy within a multimodal plan [^1174Fciy].

> Hold on, I should verify the second RCT and its mediation analysis. The 2022 Otology & Neurotology study showed that multidisciplinary orofacial treatment reduced tinnitus severity and that approximately 35% of the improvement in tinnitus was mediated by reductions in TMD pain, reinforcing a causal pathway whereby treating the TMJ and masticatory pain generators meaningfully reduces tinnitus burden, even though the total evidence quality remains limited [^112VJ6fu].

> Let me consider the specific components that likely drive benefit. Effective programs combine orofacial physical therapy focused on TMJ and cervical musculature, manual therapy techniques targeting masticatory and neck structures, TMJ-specific exercises and stretching, and patient education on jaw posture, parafunction, and self-management; occlusal splints may be added selectively when parafunction or bruxism is prominent, though splints alone are not curative and should be embedded in a broader conservative program rather than used in isolation [^1174Fciy] [^112VJ6fu] [^114GiHm8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought occlusal splints were a core pillar here, but I should double-check that nuance. The VA/DoD guideline emphasizes multidisciplinary orofacial and cervical care rather than splint monotherapy, and contemporary TMD pain guidelines provide conditional recommendations against reversible splints alone, supporting the idea that splints, if used, should be adjunctive within a comprehensive plan rather than standalone therapy for tinnitus reduction [^114QEVYM] [^114GiHm8].

> Next, I should review the certainty and limitations of the evidence. The guideline's confidence in evidence quality is low, largely due to small trials, heterogeneity, and risk of bias, yet the directionality is consistent across RCTs and aligns with mechanistic plausibility; a recent systematic review of manual and exercise therapy for TMD-related otological symptoms likewise concluded potential benefit but rated certainty as very low, underscoring the need for larger, rigorously controlled trials while still permitting pragmatic clinical adoption given minimal harm and meaningful patient-reported gains [^114QEVYM] [^115m14J5].

> I need to ensure the recommendation is framed correctly. The most effective, evidence-aligned approach for somatic tinnitus with TMD is a multidisciplinary orofacial and cervical spine program that includes orofacial physical therapy, cervico-mandibular manual therapy, TMJ and neck exercises, and education, with selective use of occlusal splints for parafunction; this is a conditional recommendation with low-to-moderate certainty but consistent benefit signals and a favorable safety profile compared with invasive or irreversible options [^114QEVYM] [^1174Fciy] [^112VJ6fu].

> But wait, what about adjuncts like CBT or sound therapy. I should confirm their roles. CBT remains first-line for reducing tinnitus distress broadly and can be layered onto somatic-focused care, and sound therapy may be offered as an adjunct for symptom relief, yet neither targets the somatic generator directly; thus, for TMD-related somatic tinnitus, these should complement rather than replace the orofacial–cervical rehabilitation core [^116cgkg5] [^111C4tjw] [^1136bxoD].

> I should double-check implementation and access considerations. Therapists require specialized training in orofacial and cervical manual techniques, and coordinated care across audiology, dentistry, and physical therapy can be constrained by availability; nonetheless, the guideline operationalizes this via non-urgent referrals to dental/orofacial providers and physical therapy, and encourages outcome tracking with validated measures like TFI or THI to monitor response and sustain engagement [^113QxSLg] [^113KEie9] [^114kuQSd].

> Let me reconsider whether any competing modality challenges this hierarchy. Neuromodulation approaches such as rTMS or tDCS have insufficient evidence for routine tinnitus care, and invasive TMJ surgeries are reserved for refractory structural pathology rather than somatic tinnitus per se, so they do not supersede conservative multidisciplinary rehabilitation as first-line for this phenotype [^116DJzrq] [^115gKWVZ].

> In summary, after verifying the evidence and weighing certainty, the most effective approach for somatic tinnitus associated with TMD is a structured, multidisciplinary orofacial and cervical rehabilitation program incorporating manual therapy, targeted exercises, and education, with selective splint use for parafunction, and with CBT or sound therapy as adjuncts to address global distress and functional impact; this strategy is supported by convergent RCTs and guideline endorsement despite low-to-moderate certainty, and it prioritizes treating the somatic pain generators that mediate tinnitus severity reduction [^114QEVYM] [^1174Fciy] [^112VJ6fu].

---

The most effective treatment for somatic tinnitus associated with temporomandibular joint disorder is a **multidisciplinary approach** [^notfound] that combines orofacial physical therapy, manual therapy, and occlusal splints [^notfound], with CBT and sound therapy as adjuncts [^116cgkg5] [^111C4tjw]. This strategy reduces tinnitus severity by addressing TMD pain and dysfunction [^112VJ6fu], with **manual therapy plus exercises** showing the largest effect [^notfound] and **CBT** reducing distress and improving quality of life [^1167mFRc]. Evidence is moderate [^notfound], and care should be individualized with close monitoring of outcomes [^114kuQSd].

---

## Evidence supporting multidisciplinary care

Recent guidelines and studies support a **multidisciplinary approach** for somatic tinnitus with TMD, integrating physical therapy, manual therapy, dental/occlusal management, and behavioral interventions [^114QEVYM] [^112s41Hy].

---

### Orofacial physical therapy and manual therapy

Orofacial physical therapy, including manual therapy targeting the TMJ and cervical muscles, significantly reduces tinnitus severity and TMD pain [^1174Fciy]. A randomized trial showed that adding cervico-mandibular manual therapy to exercise/education produced **larger improvements** in tinnitus severity, TMD pain, and related disability than exercise/education alone [^1174Fciy]. A 2022 mediation analysis found that **35% of tinnitus improvement** after orofacial treatment was mediated by reductions in TMD pain, underscoring the link between TMD pain relief and tinnitus reduction [^112VJ6fu].

---

### Occlusal splints

Occlusal splints are commonly used for TMD and can reduce TMJ load, muscle hyperactivity, and bruxism, indirectly benefiting tinnitus. Although evidence is mixed, splints may help when parafunction or bruxism contribute to symptoms [^115gKWVZ]. They are best used within a **comprehensive plan** that includes physical therapy and behavioral strategies [^114xzrEo].

---

### Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

CBT reduces tinnitus distress and improves quality of life, even when loudness is unchanged [^1167mFRc]. It is recommended for persistent, bothersome tinnitus, including somatic tinnitus with TMD, to address distress and coping [^116cgkg5].

---

### Sound therapy

Sound therapy can reduce tinnitus perception and improve sleep and concentration [^111GPSps]. It is often combined with CBT and education in multidisciplinary care [^notfound].

---

## Comparative effectiveness of interventions

| **Intervention** | **Effectiveness** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Orofacial physical therapy | High | Moderate |
| Manual therapy | High | Moderate |
| Occlusal splints | Moderate | Low |
| CBT | High | High |
| Sound therapy | Moderate | Moderate |

---

Manual therapy plus exercises shows the **largest effect** on tinnitus severity and TMD pain, whereas CBT has the strongest evidence for reducing distress and improving quality of life [^1167mFRc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

The VA/DoD guideline recommends a **multidisciplinary approach** for bothersome tinnitus with TMD, including orofacial physical therapy, manual therapy, dental/occlusal management, and behavioral interventions [^114QEVYM] [^112s41Hy]. This consensus reflects moderate-quality evidence and the need to address both somatic and psychological drivers [^113NUcGW].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment should be **individualized** based on:

- **TMD severity**: More severe TMD may need intensive physical/manual therapy and splints.
- **Psychological comorbidities**: Anxiety/depression favor CBT and behavioral strategies [^116cgkg5].
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making improves adherence and outcomes [^notfound].
- **Access and resources**: Availability of trained providers may limit options [^113QxSLg].

---

## Potential risks and limitations

- **Manual therapy**: Generally safe; mild soreness or transient symptom worsening possible.
- **Occlusal splints**: Potential discomfort, cost, and limited efficacy if used alone.
- **CBT**: Requires trained providers; access may be limited.
- **Evidence quality**: Moderate overall; more high-quality RCTs needed [^115m14J5].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up with **validated measures** (TFI, THI) [^114kuQSd] is essential to track outcomes and guide care [^1136bxoD]. Adjustments should be based on patient-reported progress and preferences [^1136bxoD].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A **multidisciplinary approach** — orofacial physical therapy, manual therapy, occlusal splints as indicated, CBT, and sound therapy — is the most effective strategy for somatic tinnitus with TMD [^notfound]. Manual therapy plus exercises yields the **largest effect** on tinnitus and TMD pain, while CBT addresses distress and quality of life [^1174Fciy] [^11374mg7]. Care should be individualized, with close monitoring and shared decision-making to optimize outcomes [^1136bxoD].

Background

Successful orofacial treatment can reduce tinnitus severity in patients with somatic tinnitus (ST). However, it is still unclear to what extent the degree of reduction in temporomandibular disorders (TMD) actually contributes to the decrease in tinnitus severity after orofacial treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the mediating effect of reduction in TMD pain on the improvement of tinnitus severity after multidisciplinary orofacial treatment.

Methods

A total of 80 patients with moderate to severe ST attributed to the temporomandibular region, were recruited from a tertiary tinnitus clinic. At baseline, patients were randomly assigned to the orofacial treatment group or to the control group. Both groups received a minimum of information and advice regarding their tinnitus complaints. The orofacial treatment group received orofacial physical therapy complemented with occlusal splints when needed, while the control group received no other treatment. A mediation analysis was performed according to the steps described by Baron and Kenny and the proportion of the mediating effect was calculated for the potential mediator: "change in TMD pain", measured by a one-point decrease in TMD pain screener score.

Results

Our analysis showed that 35% of the observed decrease in tinnitus severity can be attributed to a reduction in TMD pain. A significant total effect of orofacial treatment compared with control on the change in tinnitus functional index (TFI) score was found (B = 0.253 p = 0.025 Cl for B = 1.265–18.576). Orofacial treatment was also significantly related to the change in TMD pain (Exp (B) = 2.800, p = 0.034 Cl for Exp B 1.081–7.251). Additionally, the change in TMD pain screener score was significantly related to the change in TFI score (B = -0.273 p = 0.016 Cl for B = -19.875 to -2.119).

Conclusion

Reduction of TMD pain is a mediating factor in the decrease of tinnitus severity after multidisciplinary orofacial treatment.

Practical Implications

Orofacial treatment can be used to decrease tinnitus severity in patients with TMD related somatic tinnitus.

### Effects of cervico-mandibular manual therapy in patients with temporomandibular pain disorders and associated somatic tinnitus: a randomized clinical trial [^1174Fciy]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This randomized clinical trial investigated the effects of adding cervico-mandibular manual therapies into an exercise and educational program on clinical outcomes in individuals with tinnitus associated with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs).

Methods

Sixty-one patients with tinnitus attributed to TMD were randomized into the physiotherapy and manual therapy group or physiotherapy alone group. All patients received six sessions of physiotherapy treatment including cranio-cervical and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) exercises, self-massage, and patient education for a period of one month. Patients allocated to the manual therapy group also received cervico-mandibular manual therapies targeting the TMJ and cervical and masticatory muscles. Primary outcomes included TMD pain intensity and tinnitus severity. Secondary outcomes included tinnitus-related handicap (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory [THI]), TMD-related disability (Craniofacial Pain and Disability Inventory [CF-PDI]), self-rated quality of life (12-item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12]), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-II]), pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), and mandibular range of motion. Patients were assessed at baseline, one week, three months, and six months after intervention by a blinded assessor.

Results

The adjusted analyses showed better outcomes (all, P < 0.001) in the exercise/education plus manual therapy group (large effect sizes) for TMD pain (η²P = 0.153), tinnitus severity (η²P = 0.233), THI (η²P = 0.501), CF-PDI (η²P = 0.395), BDI-II (η²P = 0.194), PPTs (0.363 < η²P < 0.415), and range of motion (η²P = 0.350), but similar changes for the SF-12 (P = 0.622, η²P = 0.01) as the exercise/education alone group.

Conclusions

This clinical trial found that application of cervico-mandibular manual therapies in combination with exercise and education resulted in better outcomes than application of exercise/education alone in individuals with tinnitus attributed to TMD.

Somatosensory tinnitus — definition and therapy evidence — is described as a subtype in which tinnitus characteristics can be modulated by voluntary movements of the eyes, head, neck, or jaw, and there is no clinical consensus regarding its definition or diagnostic criteria; a hallmark is influence by auditory, somatosensory, and sensorimotor systems, and the evidence for the related recommendation comes from two RCTs and one SR. In patients with bothersome tinnitus and temporomandibular disorder (TMD), an RCT in 2020 showed that orofacial physical therapy improved outcomes and reported a statistically significant reduction in tinnitus severity, emphasizing multidisciplinary care. Another RCT in 2020 investigating cervico‑mandibular manual therapy combined with exercise and education found statistically significant improved outcomes compared with education and exercises alone in tinnitus with co‑occurring TMD. A 2022 systematic review evaluating quality of life (QoL) included three RCTs (Delgado de la Serna 2020, Bonaconsa 2010, Michiels 2016) and suggests that manual therapy combined with home exercises to address cervical spine dysfunction is helpful in reducing tinnitus functional impact, although the evidence was determined to be weak and effects in the 2016 RCT were small.

### Tinnitus with temporomandibular joint disorders: a specific entity of tinnitus patients? [^116WZ2ed]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Tinnitus is frequently associated with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction. However, the nature of the relationship is not fully understood. Here the authors compared 30 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of temporomandibular joint dysfunction and tinnitus to a group of 61 patients with tinnitus but without any subjective complaints of TMJ dysfunction with respect to clinical and demographic characteristics.

Study Design

Case-control study.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Subjects

Tinnitus patients with and without TMJ dysfunction presenting at the Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and th: Tinnitus Clinic at the University of Regensburg.

Results

Tinnitus patients with TMJ disorder had better hearing function (P < .0005), lower age (P = 0.001), and lower age at tinnitus onset (P = 0.002) and were more frequently female (P = 0.003). Their subjectively perceived tinnitus loudness was lower (P = 0.01), and more of them could modulate their tinnitus by jaw or neck movements (P = 0.001).

Conclusion

Classical risk factors for tinnitus (age, male gender, hearing loss) are less relevant in tinnitus patients with TMJ disorder, suggesting a causal role of TMJ pathology in the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. Based on this finding, treatment of TMJ disorder may represent a causally oriented treatment strategy for tinnitus.

### Dual-site transcranial direct current stimulation to treat tinnitus: a randomized controlled trial [^1167mFRc]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tinnitus, defined as the perception of a sound with no corresponding external source, is a highly prevalent symptom present in 12 to 30% of the worldwide adult population. Whereas some subjects suffer from objective tinnitus and perceive sounds generated by physiological events within the body, the large majority of patients experience subjective tinnitus, perceiving a sound without any corresponding sound source. The severity of tinnitus and its accompanying symptoms varies greatly. Subjects suffering from tinnitus may experience one or a combination of a plethora of accompanying non-specific symptoms, such as annoyance, irritability, anxiety, depression, hyperacusis, hearing impairment, insomnia and cognitive difficulties. An estimated 1% of the total population perceives their tinnitus as a significant burden with a considerable impact on quality of life.

There is no curative treatment for tinnitus, and currently, the only evidence-based tinnitus management strategy is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Psycho-social treatment options such as CBT are indeed able to reduce tinnitus-associated distress. However, they cause little or no reduction of the underlying tinnitus loudness, and evidence for their long-term effects is lacking. The success of other tinnitus treatments often depends on the presence and severity of accompanying symptoms. For instance, patients for whom tinnitus is paired with varying degrees of hearing loss may experience significant tinnitus relief when using hearing aids, cochlear implants or auditory brainstem implants. Meanwhile, subjects with concomitant cervical or temporomandibular dysfunctions can achieve beneficial results with physical therapy such as orofacial treatment. Thus, the large heterogeneity in tinnitus presentation requires a personalized, patient-tailored treatment plan. Overall, existing management strategies more often target accompanying symptoms other than the underlying pathophysiology of the tinnitus percept itself.

Comparisons to Other Treatments

Other studies have used either unimodal or bimodal sound stimulation paradigms to treat tinnitus, with mixed outcomes. In a study by Hall et al, acoustic coordinated reset neuromodulation, a unimodal auditory stimulation paradigm that was hypothesized to desynchronize pathological brain activity, led to no significant improvement for participants who used it, which was consistent with animal-model studies that have reported auditory-only treatment to be ineffective in reducing tinnitus. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the tongue combined with auditory stimuli resulted in statistically but not clinically significant reduction in the TFI scores 9 to 12 weeks after receiving treatment. Changing the stimuli halfway through the treatment resulted in an additional mean reduction to reach a clinically significant decrease at the 12-week point. Spencer et alused transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the head, neck, or the temporomandibular joint combined with tone-burst auditory stimuli that were pitch-matched to the participants' tinnitus frequency. The treatment led to a statistically but not clinically significant reduction in TFI score of 6.9 points 9 to 12 weeks after treatment. Of 29 participants, only 6 could modulate their tinnitus (eg, somatic tinnitus), and the study was insufficiently powered to compare the effect of bisensory stimulation on patients with vs without somatic tinnitus.

None of these studies used a control or sham group or nontreatment group; thus, all participants were aware that they were receiving an active treatment, increasing the risk for placebo effects. In contrast, the current trial had a control or sham group that received auditory-only stimulation. In addition, the current study used a psychoacoustic tinnitus loudness measurement as a primary outcome measure in addition to the TFI and THI surveys. While the TFI and THI questionnaires are both validated and widely used in tinnitus research and are important measures of tinnitus distress, the addition of a robust psychoacoustic tinnitus loudness measurement further validated the perceived reductions in tinnitus distress surveys.,

The majority of withdrawals were due to the burden of coming on site for weekly visits (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Most adverse events (98 of 101) were not severe and were not associated with any treatment arm (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). Participants were informed that the electrical stimulation would be faint or barely perceptible during treatment. All participants were reminded of the double-blinding of the treatment phase (active vs control); therefore, we did not know if they would feel stimulation at any given time during their treatment sessions.

### Effectiveness of manual therapy and exercise therapy on otological symptoms of individuals with temporomandibular disorders: a systematic review [^115m14J5]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze the effectiveness of manual therapy and exercise therapy on otological symptoms in individuals with temporomandibular disorders.

Methods

A systematic review of clinical trials compared exercise and manual therapy with standard care or placebo/control for individuals with temporomandibular disorders. Otological-related symptoms (tinnitus, earache, ear fullness, vertigo, dizziness, and hypo/hyperacusis) were assessed. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach. Qualitative data synthesis was performed through evidence tables and graphs.

Results

A total of 4,356 articles were screened, and six studies reported in nine manuscripts were included. Manual therapy combined with exercises targeted to the neck and jaw reduced tinnitus severity and tinnitus-related quality of life after treatment, and at three- and six-month follow-up when compared to exercises alone. Earache and ear fullness improved after orofacial myofunctional therapy and oral motor exercises compared to no treatment. The overall certainty of the evidence was rated as very low.

Conclusions

The combination of neck and jaw exercises with manual therapy potentially reduce otological symptoms in individuals with temporomandibular disorders. Studies with higher methodological quality are needed, due to a very low certainty of evidence. Implications for rehabilitationExercises and manual therapy techniques aimed at the jaw and neck potentially improve otological symptoms related to TMD; Clinicians and researchers should design TMD interventions considering otological symptoms as an important complaint while planning the protocols, A standardization of the tools used to assess otological symptoms is needed.

Somatosensory tinnitus care — implementation considerations and therapeutic focus — Before administering this treatment, physical therapists would need specialized training with associated time and costs. Providing combined care in this way would involve a multidisciplinary team, which sometimes necessitates a referral to a specialist and might be infeasible for all patients to receive, even if warranted, and access would be limited due to few providers with adequate training and overall a lack of familiarity with assessment and treatment options for somatosensory tinnitus. The literature emphasizes that therapeutic approaches for somatosensory tinnitus target the co-occurring musculoskeletal condition.

Tinnitus is a common symptom. Standard therapies aim at improving the quality of life and reducing the psychological stress associated with tinnitus. Most interventions have little or no effect on the main symptom. Those affected subjects, however, want such a change and prefer a specific solution, such as pharmacologic therapy to other modalities. Scientific efforts have not yet led to significant improvement in the range of therapies. This article outlines existing efforts and develops ideas on how research for improved tinnitus therapy might look in the future.

### Combining sound with tongue stimulation for the treatment of tinnitus: a multi-site single-arm controlled pivotal trial [^113q8uyB]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Participants

The study recruited participants who were 18 years and over at the time of consent with subjective, chronic tinnitus (≥ 3 months and ≤ 10 years) with a THI score of greater than or equal to 38 points. An eligible participant had to be able to read and understand Dutch/Flemish/English or German (depending on the clinical site), was willing and able to provide and understand informed consent, and was willing to commit to the full duration of the investigation. Participants were required to have no more than a maximum hearing loss of 40 dB HL in the measurement frequencies in the range of 250 Hz to 1 kHz or of 80 dB HL in the measurement frequencies in the range of 2–8 kHz either unilaterally or bilaterally.

Potential participants were excluded if they had objective or pulsatile tinnitus, or showed abnormal otoscopy or tympanometry that may be contributing to or causing the tinnitus. Meniere's disease, temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), burning mouth syndrome (BMS), previously diagnosed with psychosis or schizophrenia, or hospitalization or visit to a physician for head or neck injury in the previous 12 months were also exclusion criteria. Further exclusions included commencement of usage of hearing aid within the last 90 days, pregnancy, oral piercings that cannot or will not be removed for the second stage of the investigation, neurological condition that may lead to seizures or loss of consciousness, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score less than 20 (severe cognitive impairment), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of greater than 120, any type of electro-active implanted device, initiated or ceased prescription medications or treatments in the previous three months that may impact the outcomes of the investigation, or being involved in relevant medico-legal cases. Candidates were also excluded if they had previously used Lenire, had previously been involved in a clinical investigation for tinnitus, or had an experimental or surgical treatment for tinnitus; or if the site principal investigator deemed the candidate to be unsuitable for the investigation for other reasons not listed above.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^1153WrAR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Tinnitus is the perception of sound without an external source. More than 50 million people in the United States have reported experiencing tinnitus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10% to 15% in adults. Despite the high prevalence of tinnitus and its potential significant effect on quality of life, there are no evidence-based, multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines to assist clinicians with management. The focus of this guideline is on tinnitus that is both bothersome and persistent (lasting 6 months or longer), which often negatively affects the patient's quality of life. The target audience for the guideline is any clinician, including nonphysicians, involved in managing patients with tinnitus. The target patient population is limited to adults (18 years and older) with primary tinnitus that is persistent and bothersome.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing patients with tinnitus. This guideline provides clinicians with a logical framework to improve patient care and mitigate the personal and social effects of persistent, bothersome tinnitus. It will discuss the evaluation of patients with tinnitus, including selection and timing of diagnostic testing and specialty referral to identify potential underlying treatable pathology. It will then focus on the evaluation and treatment of patients with persistent primary tinnitus, with recommendations to guide the evaluation and measurement of the effect of tinnitus and to determine the most appropriate interventions to improve symptoms and quality of life for tinnitus sufferers.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with nonbothersome tinnitus. The development group made a strong recommendation against obtaining imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus, specifically to evaluate tinnitus that does not localize to 1 ear, is nonpulsatile, and is not associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or an asymmetric hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: Clinicians should (a) perform a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with presumed primary tinnitus to identify conditions that if promptly identified and managed may relieve tinnitus; (b) obtain a prompt, comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (≥ 6 months), or associated with hearing difficulties; (c) distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions about natural history and follow-up care; (d) educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus about management strategies; (e) recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients who have persistent, bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss; and (f) recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The panel recommended against (a) antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; (b) Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements for treating patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; and (c) transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided the following options: Clinicians may (a) obtain an initial comprehensive audiologic examination in patients who present with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status); and (b) recommend sound therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.

### Management of chronic pain associated with temporomandibular disorders: a clinical practice guideline [^114GiHm8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the comparative effectiveness of available therapies for chronic pain associated with temporomandibular disorders (TMD)?

Current Practice

TMD are the second most common musculoskeletal chronic pain disorder after low back pain, affecting 6–9% of adults globally. TMD are associated with pain affecting the jaw and associated structures and may present with headaches, earache, clicking, popping, or crackling sounds in the temporomandibular joint, and impaired mandibular function. Current clinical practice guidelines are largely consensus-based and provide inconsistent recommendations.

Recommendations

For patients living with chronic pain (≥ 3 months) associated with TMD, and compared with placebo or sham procedures, the guideline panel issued: (1) strong recommendations in favour of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with or without biofeedback or relaxation therapy, therapist-assisted mobilisation, manual trigger point therapy, supervised postural exercise, supervised jaw exercise and stretching with or without manual trigger point therapy, and usual care (such as home exercises, stretching, reassurance, and education); (2) conditional recommendations in favour of manipulation, supervised jaw exercise with mobilisation, CBT with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), manipulation with postural exercise, and acupuncture; (3) conditional recommendations against reversible occlusal splints (alone or in combination with other interventions), arthrocentesis (alone or in combination with other interventions), cartilage supplement with or without hyaluronic acid injection, low level laser therapy (alone or in combination with other interventions), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, gabapentin, botulinum toxin injection, hyaluronic acid injection, relaxation therapy, trigger point injection, acetaminophen (with or without muscle relaxants or NSAIDS), topical capsaicin, biofeedback, corticosteroid injection (with or without NSAIDS), benzodiazepines, and β blockers; and (4) strong recommendations against irreversible oral splints, discectomy, and NSAIDS with opioids.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international guideline development panel including patients, clinicians with content expertise, and methodologists produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC) provided methodological support. The panel approached the formulation of recommendations from the perspective of patients, rather than a population or health system perspective.

The Evidence

Recommendations are informed by a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis summarising the current body of evidence for benefits and harms of conservative, pharmacologic, and invasive interventions for chronic pain secondary to TMD.

Understanding The Recommendation

These recommendations apply to patients living with chronic pain (≥ 3 months duration) associated with TMD as a group of conditions, and do not apply to the management of acute TMD pain. When considering management options, clinicians and patients should first consider strongly recommended interventions, then those conditionally recommended in favour, then conditionally against. In doing so, shared decision making is essential to ensure patients make choices that reflect their values and preference, availability of interventions, and what they may have already tried. Further research is warranted and may alter recommendations in the future.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^114CEAaL]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Tinnitus — etiologies, noise exposure effects, and neuroimaging are described: Tinnitus can arise from infections (bacterial, viral, fungal), autoimmune hearing loss, Meniere's disease, endolymphatic hydrops; neoplasms (vestibular schwannoma or cholesteatoma); head or neck trauma/injury; genetic predisposition; ototoxicity from medications such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, valproate, cisplatin, loop diuretics, or heavy metals such as lead; and from cardiovascular conditions (hypertension, arteriosclerosis, cerebral aneurysm, cerebrovascular accident), metabolic conditions (anemia, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus), and musculoskeletal abnormalities such as temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Acute tinnitus immediately after exposure to loud sounds — such as gunfire, explosions, or very loud music — results from mechanical damage to stereocilia on the tops of hair cells within the cochlea, and repeated exposures without the proper use of protective devices (e.g., earplugs, earmuffs) can cause permanent damage to cochlear structures or permanent hearing loss that can contribute to the onset and persistence of chronic tinnitus. Imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron-emission tomography have demonstrated that the perception of chronic tinnitus usually occurs as a result of abnormal hyperactivity within central auditory areas of the human brain, especially the auditory cortex.

### Temporomandibular joint disorders [^113fXLtt]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular joint disorders are common in adults; as many as one third of adults report having one or more symptoms, which include jaw or neck pain, headache, and clicking or grating within the joint. Most symptoms improve without treatment, but various noninvasive therapies may reduce pain for patients who have not experienced relief from self-care therapies. Physical therapy modalities (e.g., iontophoresis, phonophoresis), psychological therapies (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy), relaxation techniques, and complementary therapies (e.g., acupuncture, hypnosis) are all used for the treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders; however, no therapies have been shown to be uniformly superior for the treatment of pain or oral dysfunction. Noninvasive therapies should be attempted before pursuing invasive, permanent, or semi-permanent treatments that have the potential to cause irreparable harm. Dental occlusion therapy (e.g., oral splinting) is a common treatment for temporomandibular joint disorders, but a recent systematic review found insufficient evidence for or against its use. Some patients with intractable temporomandibular joint disorders develop chronic pain syndrome and may benefit from treatment, including antidepressants or cognitive behavior therapy.

VA/DoD tinnitus — referrals: Based on the case history, audiological evaluation, and patient needs, the audiologist should develop a follow-up action plan to include specialized audiological testing. Patients may be referred to other appropriate health care providers or services as needed but should be evaluated urgently by an otolaryngology provider or referred to the emergency department if they report sudden onset hearing loss with or without accompanying sudden onset tinnitus. If a medical risk factor is identified or if tinnitus is unilateral or pulsatile, the patient should be referred to an otolaryngology provider, although not all patients with tinnitus require an evaluation by an otolaryngology provider. The otolaryngology provider will obtain a thorough case history, examine the ear (using an otoscope or microscope), and might perform auxiliary examinations to screen hearing status, such as tuning fork tests. Patients who report risk factors for a behavioral/mental health disorder should be referred to a behavioral/mental health provider, and patients who report suicidal ideation should be referred immediately to a behavioral/mental health provider or an emergency department in the absence of available behavioral/mental health support. A non-urgent referral to a dental provider, an orofacial provider, or both is suggested for patients with TMD, and a non-urgent referral to a physical therapist or physiotherapist is suggested for patients with neck complaints or a whiplash-like trauma preceding the onset of tinnitus.

Tinnitus is a significant medical problem affecting approximately 50 million Americans, 12 million of them severely. Once a thorough evaluation has been performed by a qualified otolaryngologist, and no life-threatening pathology has been identified, the opportunity for treatment exists. Treatment options are extensive and range from approved protocols to anecdotal remedies. Although tinnitus may not miraculously disappear, many therapeutic options exist that may help to make the tinnitus more manageable.

### Reversing synchronized brain circuits using targeted auditory-somatosensory stimulation to treat phantom percepts: a randomized clinical trial [^115KqN2o]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Given that LTD in the DCN circuit is not apparent with auditory-only stimulation, the second possibility is that the unimodal effects in this study and the pilot studywere placebo effects. The correlation between TFI scores and tinnitus loudness decreases during the active treatment but not the control treatment and supports the possibility of placebo contributions to the unimodal sound treatment effects. We included only participants who demonstrated a somatosensory component to their tinnitus in that they could modulate their tinnitus with a somatic maneuver. Studies on somatic tinnitus found that somatic tinnitus occurred in 60% to 80% of individuals with tinnitus. Among the maneuvers that resulted in a change in tinnitus (either increase or decrease in tinnitus loudness level), jaw or neck movements were predominant. Notably, 75% of screened participants demonstrated a modulation score of 3 or higher for at least 1 jaw, head, or neck motion. Furthermore, there was a significant association between TFI score improvements and the number of somatic maneuvers producing a change in tinnitus during the active treatment phase but not the control treatment or washout phases (eFigure 7 in Supplement 2). The association between somatic tinnitus strength and bisensory treatment outcome was not surprising, as the treatment was based on auditory-somatosensory interactions in the brain and participants showing somatosensory involvement in their tinnitus were the participants of choice for this trial. Nonetheless, this finding does not necessarily mean that participants who cannot modulate their tinnitus might not be able to benefit from this bisensory treatment given that animal studies have shown that the upregulation in somatosensory inputs to the cochlear nucleus after cochlear damage occurs in all animals, not just those that develop tinnitus.

### Tinnitus treatment trends [^1126WKE9]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) recently published guidelines on the treatment of tinnitus. This paper examines the possible impact of those guidelines on otologic practice.

Design

A survey was sent to the members of the American Neurotology Society before and after the publication of Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus. The goals of this study were to see if the guidelines changed attitudes of otologists, confirm what treatments and explanations are being used in the field before and after the guidelines were published.

Main Outcomes

Five hundred fifty-eight surveys were sent out and there were 216 responses. Otologists generally seemed to practice in accordance with the recommendations of the guidelines even before these were published. Drugs and sound therapies were not commonly used for primary tinnitus either before or after publication of the guidelines. One treatment that otologists seemed to have confidence in that was omitted from the guidelines was surgical treatment of hearing loss.

Conclusion

Opinions regarding the treatment of tinnitus vary considerably. The AAO-HNS clinical practice guideline: tinnitus has not significantly altered the practices of otologists, but the guidelines provide meaningful, important information for other clinicians who deal infrequently with tinnitus.

### Meta-analysis of surgical treatments for temporomandibular articular disorders [^112CC52T]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Temporomandibular joint articular disorders may cause severe pain and dysfunction. We addressed the following questions. Can any surgical procedures effectively treat these disorders? If so, which procedures are most effective?

Materials and Methods

We performed meta-analyses of surgical trial results to determine whether certain surgical procedures are effective in specific patient groups. To compensate for the lack of parallel control groups in published studies and for the improvement that has been observed in untreated patients, we used historical data from nonsurgical trials to derive 3 estimates of historical control group improvement (0%, 37.5%, and 75%). To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analytic evaluation of surgical treatments for temporomandibular joint disorders.

Results

Among patients refractory to nonsurgical therapies, surgical arthrocentesis and arthroscopy were effective for patients with disc displacement without reduction at all assumed control group improvement rates. Disc repair/repositioning had a statistically significant effect at all but the highest improvement rate. In patients with disc displacement with reduction, arthroscopy and disc repair/repositioning had statistically significant effects at all but the highest assumed rate of control group improvement. There were no statistically significant differences between the effects of any treatments.

Conclusions

Surgical treatments appear to provide some benefit to patients refractory to nonsurgical therapies. The most reliable evidence supports the effectiveness of arthrocentesis and arthroscopy for patients with disc displacement without reduction. Better designed trials are needed before one can accurately determine the magnitude of the benefits of surgery.

### Outcome of otologic symptoms after temporomandibular joint arthrocentesis [^117WdDFf]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of otologic complaints in patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) closed lock (CL), and to evaluate the efficacy of arthrocentesis in temporomandibular disorder (TMD) patients with otologic symptoms. Fifty-seven patients with TMJ CL were included in this study. The pre-treatment evaluations included assessment of the maximum mouth opening (MMO); pain level in palpation of the affected TMJ; pain level with function; and otologic complaints, including otalgia, tinnitus, vertigo, and hearing loss. Arthrocentesis treatment was performed for all the patients, and post-treatment data were recorded 1 month later. Before arthrocentesis and lavage, the mean MMO was 24.67 ± 4.61 mm; the mean tenderness score was 7.02 ± 1.09; and the mean score for pain in function was 6.86 ± 1.31. Following TMJ arthrocentesis and lavage, the mean MMO was 39.81 mm ± 4.56 mm; the mean tenderness score was 2.37 ± 0.65; and the mean score for pain in function was 2.45 ± 0.69. Seventeen (29.82%) patients reported at least 1 otologic complaint, 17 (29.82%) patients reported otalgia, and 8 (14.04%) patients reported tinnitus. Vertigo was noted in 5 (8.77%) patients. Complaints of hearing loss were not noted in any of the patients. After treatment, 14 patients no longer complained of otalgia, 5 patients no longer complained of tinnitus, and 2 patients no longer complained of vertigo. This represented a significant improvement in the patients' condition, especially in patients with otalgia (P < 0.0006). As evident from the results of this study, arthrocentesis procedures reduce both TMD symptoms and otologic complaints.

### Comparative efficacy of different acupuncture-related therapies for primary tinnitus: a systematic review and network meta-analysis protocol [^112ytLXV]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Given the treatment of primary tinnitus is complex and challenging, diverse kinds of acupuncture-related methods are available in clinical practice. Moreover, a specific acupuncture method can be used alone, or used in combination with other acupuncture methods or guideline-recommended active therapies (eg, Western medication, sound therapy, CBT, education, and counseling). Therefore, it is of clinical importance to rank the relative efficacy of different acupuncture-related methods through evidence-based methods.

Although several SRs and meta-analysis studies have been published in recent years with promising results favoring the effect of acupuncture for tinnitus, the bulk of them use the traditional meta-analysis method to compare the efficacy of just one form of acupuncture-related therapy with other active treatments. Thus far, the relative effectiveness of these acupuncture approaches and their integrated use has been little understood, thereby making it difficult for clinicians to choose the best one to employ in clinical practice. For addressing these gaps, it is important to perform a comparative study to determine the optimal acupuncture method or combination. NMA is a suitable method for this purpose, as it can achieve the integration of both direct and indirect comparisons across various kinds of treatments in a single analysis. This method has been increasingly used in recent years to rank the efficacy of multiple acupuncture therapies for various diseases, including knee osteoarthritis, postherpetic neuralgia, chronic aspecific low back pain, and major depressive disorder.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115QeaAz]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Several potential limitations should be considered. First, this NMA may have been underpowered due to the heterogeneity of the participants (e.g. comorbidities, mood disorder, baseline severity of tinnitus, duration of tinnitus onset, wearing hearing-aids, treatment duration in each study and follow-up duration), variety in the definition of response, variety in tinnitus severity or quality-of-life rating scales, and high risk of bias in 'Random sequence generation' and 'Blinding of participants' in some of the included RCTs. In order to overcome the potential bias on the primary outcome, we arranged subgroup to exclude RCTs without placebo-control, in which the main results would not change. Further, in the subgroup of different duration of tinnitus symptoms, there was no significant difference of placebo effect between the subgroups with different disease duration of tinnitus symptom (p = 0.80), which suggest potentially less impact by the different duration of tinnitus symptom on the primary outcome. As for the heterogeneity of the outcome reporting (i.e. variety in tinnitus severity or quality-of-life rating scales), this was an unavoidable limitation of any NMA investigating subjective outcomes. The tinnitus, just like the depressive symptoms, quality of life, or pain symptoms, was a subjective symptom and lack of objective measurement to measure its severity or to define its treatment response. Currently, there had not been any conclusive golden rating scales to measure its severity. Also, there had been no conclusive evidence to approve the superiority of one rating scales to the others. The choice or selection of one specific rating scales would become an potential source of bias in the network meta-analysis of subjective symptoms. Based on this limitation, we highly recommend future studies to address the need for a gold standard measurement of tinnitus severity, which would appear to be a significant limitation in the tinnitus research field. Further, the results of the future study would be recommended to be rated according to a standardized multi-measure scale. Therefore, the clinicians may pay attention when applied the results of current study in their clinical practice because of the potential difference between the rating scales and the variety of definition of response rate. Second, although the most of the RCTs included a placebo control in their study design, some of the included trials applied waiting list as their control groups. However, the main findings were unchanged after excluding those trials (Suppl. B, eFig. 1D-1E and 2D-2E). Third, given the relatively small number of patients and RCTs, the main results of this NMA should perhaps be conservatively applied in clinical practice. Fourth, despite some heterogeneity among RCTs regarding the control group, when trials were restricted to an oral form of placebo therapy, results were similar. Further, the potential placebo effect was an unavoidable issue in any clinical studies investigating disease of subjective symptoms, such as tinnitus. The overall placebo of the injection form placebo and oral form placebo were 26.4% and 24.5%, which was relatively low compared to that of neuropsychiatric disease, such as depression (i.e. 35%−40%). Fifth, because of small numbers of included RCTs and insufficient direct/indirect comparison between treatment arms, there would be different findings between the primary outcome (i.e. changes of tinnitus severity) and secondary outcome (i.e. response rate). Sixth, although the De Ridder et al. (2021)had provided the clear concept of "tinnitus disorder", the most included RCTs (published from 1993 to 2020) in the current NMA did not apply the concept of "tinnitus disorder". Therefore, we could not make distinguish between the target of "tinnitus vs tinnitus disorder" in the current study. Finally, we only investigated the drop-out rate but not by an adverse events profile because too few studies provided data about adverse events to form a network. Also, there were some other important factors associated with the baseline tinnitus severity, such as quality of life, anxiety mood, depressive mood, and so on. However, we could only perform network meta-analysis of quality of life but not the others because there were too few RCTs providing such data to form a network structure.

Tinnitus — intervention and service research priorities include the following directives: conduct surveys to determine utilization of hearing aids and audiology evaluation for tinnitus and to determine frequency of patient education and counseling in community and academic settings. Conduct studies on acamprosate and other "promising" medical interventions and conduct additional studies on anticonvulsant medications for tinnitus treatment. Conduct studies comparing the effectiveness of CBT, ACT, and bibliotherapy, and conduct clinical trials comparing different counseling treatments; conduct clinical trials on new therapies such as cochlear implantation and deep brain stimulation, and conduct clinical trials on auditory training strategies that could include bone conduction devices or middle ear implants. Conduct studies comparing the effectiveness, as well as cost-benefits, of in-person versus Internet-based CBT; ensure that patient cohorts are stratified by concurrent depression and anxiety in controlled trials of antidepressant and anxiolytic medications. Study a variety of brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation; investigate rTMS using longer-duration schedules or in combination with other methods; and study acupuncture, including electroacupuncture and responses in patients with somatic head and neck disorders.

Vicious circle of symptoms in tinnitus — Tinnitus severity is positively correlated with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and other psychosocial factors, which can form a "vicious circle" of symptoms, and tinnitus that has been present for six months or more is likely to persist; the treatment of chronic tinnitus is more accurately described in terms of management rather than cure. For some patients, tinnitus can exacerbate co-occurring anxiety, depression, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and these co-occurring conditions can affect the severity of tinnitus; effective treatment of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or PTSD might decrease the severity of tinnitus and improve quality of life (QoL). Effective interventions should include management of tinnitus functional impact and associated co-occurring conditions, and when tinnitus negatively impacts patients' health-related QoL, multidisciplinary interventions are often required.

Management of TMD

A suitable therapeutic approach for TMD should be aimed at alleviating the main signs and symptoms of this condition. The most relevant signs of TMD are the presence of joint sounds (clicking and crepitation), reduced mouth opening, and disrupted jaw movements. However, pain is the primary problem of this pathology, and it is typically the reason these patients request medical care. Also, it is likely the reason that most studies have been aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of various intervention measures related to pain as the main variable.

Conservative treatments for TMD include medication, physiotherapy, occlusal splints, self-management strategies, and interventions based on cognitive behavioral approaches.–At present, a conservative treatment approach prevails over surgery, given it is less aggressive and usually results in satisfactory clinical outcomes in mild–moderate TMD.–In fact, the evidence for the greatest effectiveness of surgical versus conservative intervention to reduce short-term pain in arthrogenic TMD is controversial and inconclusive.–Indications for the application of each of the interventions, as well as their potential effects for the treatment of patients with TMD, are described in the following sections.

### Tinnitus [^11374mg7]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Tinnitus is a common medical symptom that can be debilitating. Risk factors include hearing loss, ototoxic medication, head injury, and depression. At presentation, the possibilities of otological disease, anxiety, and depression should be considered. No effective drug treatments are available, although much research is underway into mechanisms and possible treatments. Surgical intervention for any otological pathology associated with tinnitus might be effective for that condition, but the tinnitus can persist. Available treatments include hearing aids when hearing loss is identified (even mild or unilateral), wide-band sound therapy, and counselling. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is indicated for some patients, but availability of tinnitus-specific CBT in the UK is poor. The evidence base is strongest for a combination of sound therapy and CBT-based counselling, although clinical trials are constrained by the heterogeneity of patients with tinnitus.

### Tinnitus in the side with better hearing [^1146y5od]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to confirm the characteristics of patients with tinnitus in the better-hearing side.

Materials and Methods

Among the 778 patients who visited the tinnitus clinic complaining of unilateral tinnitus at a local university hospital between March 2014 and December 2017, we recruited 62 patients who showed tinnitus in the better-hearing side on pure-tone audiometry. The mean hearing threshold was calculated using the arithmetic mean of the pure tone thresholds at 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz. In addition, patients' medical history, tinnitus questionnaires, and other audiologic test results were thoroughly analyzed together for diagnosis.

Results

Fluctuating hearing loss without vertigo or Ménière's disease were the most common etiologies (n = 16, 25.8%), followed by high-frequency hearing loss (n = 13, 21.0%), sudden idiopathic hearing loss (n = 6, 9.7%), and presbycusis (n = 6, 9.7%). Somatosensory tinnitus was also observed in seven patients. Neck pain was associated with tinnitus in five patients (8.1%), and two other patients (3.2%) experienced temporomandibular disorder in the same side as the tinnitus.

Conclusion

Tinnitus was associated with deterioration of hearing even when it occurred in the better-hearing side. Among the possible etiologies, fluctuating hearing loss in the tinnitus side was the most common audiologic finding. Assessment of hearing level at each frequency was more effective in detecting high-frequency hearing loss rather than the use of the mean hearing level. In addition, somatosensory tinnitus should not be ignored.

### Temporomandibular joint syndrome from an ear versus dental-related standpoint [^1112AxB9]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a prominent reason for visits to medical providers. The presentation of headaches within this population remains a challenging diagnosis, given the prevalence and overlap of symptomatology of both conditions. The literature demonstrates an undeniable association between headaches and TMD. Regardless of causality and etiology, the literature supports that prompt diagnosis and treatment results in improvement or resolution of symptoms, including headaches. Treatment of TMD headaches should begin with conservative measures, including medical management with NSAIDs, heat therapy, and muscle-stretching exercises.

### Management of pain in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD): challenges and solutions [^112j1L8J]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Current literature suggests that psychological and psychosocial factors have an important association with the duration of symptoms and their perpetuation in cases of chronic pain. Psychological factors, such as pain catastrophizing, psychological distress, fear-avoidance beliefs, beliefs related to painful perception, depressed or anxious mood,–self-efficacy, and passive coping,–are related to increased pain perception, increased levels of disability, and movement disorders in patients with chronic painful TMD. On the other hand, it has been noted that some psychosocial factors have also been identified as predictors of treatment outcome in patients with TMD. We consider that somatic awareness is an important sensory-discriminative factor to be taken into account, since it has been related to an increased risk of suffering a TMD.

The abundant current scientific evidence shows that the mechanistic biomedical model is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis or accurate treatment to manage patients with chronic painful TMD. A change in approach toward a more comprehensive and integral vision is necessary. We propose a diagnostic and therapeutic approach based on a biobehavioral approach. Many authors share this thought,–even suggesting that from an ethical point of view a compulsory change is needed, given the application of unnecessary and irreversible interventions due to traditional management could endanger the patient's well-being.

The biobehavioral model for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic painful TMD recognizes the importance of psychological factors, such as pain history, current emotional and cognitive status, beliefs, learned behaviors, and coping skills, in interaction with the physiological alterations that determine the pain experience. From the therapeutic point of view, the model allows the patients to acquire the ability to self-manage the pain, allowing an improvement in general functioning.

Based on the current clinical and scientific context, we propose a diagnostic and intervention model to address patients with painful TMD based on four dimensions (affective–motivational, sensory–discriminative, cognitive–evaluative, and motor behavior) integrated in a biobehavioral approach (Figure 1). This model has been termed the biobehavioral model of pain perception and motor behavior, and although we have designed it to study any musculoskeletal disorder, in this article we adapt it to TMD. Table 1 presents information about all of these approaches, grade of evidence, and magnitude of effects.

### A case report on red ear syndrome with tinnitus successfully treated with transcranial random noise stimulation [^115PwKbZ]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The red ear syndrome represents a rare symptom complex consisting of auricular erythema associated with painful and burning sensations. It has been described in combination with tinnitus rarely. It has been hypothesized to be etiologically related to altered trigeminal afferent input, temporomandibular disorders, and thalamic dysfunction.

Objectives

The initial objective of applying transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) in a case of red ear syndrome in combination with tinnitus was the alleviation of the phantom sounds.

Study Design

This is a case report on the successful treatment of red ear syndrome with tinnitus by means of transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) and a short review on the published cases of this condition.

Setting

We present the case of a 50-year-old woman reporting a simultaneous onset of constant left-sided tinnitus and feelings of warmth accompanied by an intermittent stabbing and/or oppressive pain stretching from the ipsilateral ear to the head/neck/shoulder region, occasionally accompanied by nausea/vomiting and dizziness. After failure of pharmacological treatment attempts, either because of lacking clinical effects (gabapentin, zolmitriptan, and indomethacin) or because of adverse reactions (pregabaline), the patient was offered an experimental neuromodulatory treatment with bitemporal tRNS primarily targeting the tinnitus complaints of the patient.

Methods

tRNS was conducted in 2–3 day sessions (stimulation site: bilateral temporal cortex/2.0 mA/10 s on-and-off-ramp/offset 0 mA/20 min/random frequencies 101–640 Hz / NeuroConn Eldith DC-Stimulator plus).

Results

In 3 consecutive pain attacks repeated sessions of tRNS resulted in substantial alleviation of pain intensity and a prolongation of the interval between attacks. This was an expected finding as the proposed tRNS treatment was initially offered to the patient aiming at an alleviation of the tinnitus complaints (which remained unaffected by tRNS).

Limitations

The reported data derive from compassionate use treatment in one single patient. Application of a sham condition would have been desirable, but is not possible in the context of compassionate use treatment. Nevertheless, we would consider it rather unlikely that the reported effects are purely unspecific as the patient did exclusively report symptom alleviation of pain-related parameters without affecting the tinnitus.

Conclusions

This case report demonstrates the feasibility and therapeutic potential of applying neuromodulatory treatment approaches in red ear syndrome, a rare form of trigemino-autonomal headache. Therefore, it deserves detailed observation in clinical routine applications as well as controlled trials further investigating its neurobiological effects. Key words: Red ear syndrome, pain, trigemino-autonomal headache, chronic tinnitus, transcranial electrical stimulation, random noise stimulation.

### Combining sound with tongue stimulation for the treatment of tinnitus: a multi-site single-arm controlled pivotal trial [^1134VAST]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

As described by McCombe et al. tinnitus patients in the moderate THI severity group and above (THI ≥ 38) have tinnitus that interferes with their ability to carry out normal daily activities and often encounters a disturbed sleep pattern that can be associated with emotional distress, mood disorders, somatic pain, stress responsivity, and reduced quality of life. In comparison, patients in the none/slight and mild groups (THI < 38) experience but are not generally troubled by their tinnitus. The tinnitus is often easily masked by environmental sounds and easily forgotten with activities. The tinnitus may occasionally interfere with sleep but not daily activities. Based on these severity categories, it is anticipated that patients within the moderate group and above (THI of 38 to 100) are more bothered by their tinnitus and would be more likely to seek treatment at clinics. Similar to the TENT-A2 study and to be able to assess clinical efficacy in participants with bothersome enough tinnitus with room for improvement with an intervention, an inclusion criterion requiring participants to have a THI ≥ 38 at the screening visit was also implemented in the TENT-A3 study.

In addition to THI, two additional endpoint measures were included in the study: TFI and HUI3. The TFI was used as a secondary endpoint measure and the HUI3 was included as an exploratory endpoint measure for the study. The TFI assesses a range of tinnitus-related functional complaints experienced over the past week prior to assessment. Each of the 25 items is assessed on an 11-point Likert scale, and the sum of the scores is normalized to give a global score from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a greater negative impact of tinnitus. The MCID reported for TFI is 13 points and represents a clinically meaningful change in tinnitus symptoms. The HUI3 is a quality-of-life assessment with 40 questions and provides descriptive evidence on multiple dimensions of health status, a score for each dimension of health, and a health-related quality-of-life score for overall health. The utility scores for each dimension have interval-scale properties. The HUI3 total score ranges from 0.0 (considered dead) to 1.0 (healthy).

### Temporomandibular disorders: old ideas and new concepts [^114xzrEo]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Background Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is an umbrella term for pain and dysfunction involving the masticatory muscles and the temporomandibular joints (TMJs). TMD is the most common orofacial pain condition. Its prominent features include regional pain in the face and preauricular area, limitations in jaw movement, and noise from the TMJs during jaw movements. TMD affects up to 15% of adults and 7% of adolescents. Chronic pain is the overwhelming reason that patients with TMD seek treatment. TMD can associate with impaired general health, depression, and other psychological disabilities, and may affect the quality of life of the patient. Assessment Evaluations indicate that the recently published Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD) are reliable and valid. These criteria cover the most common types of TMD, which include pain-related disorders (e.g., myalgia, headache attributable to TMD, and arthralgia) as well as disorders associated with the TMJ (primarily disc displacements and degenerative disease). As peripheral mechanisms most likely play a role in the onset of TMD, a detailed muscle examination is recommended. The persistence of pain involves more central factors, such as sensitization of the supraspinal neurons and second-order neurons at the level of the spinal dorsal horn/trigeminal nucleus, imbalanced antinociceptive activity, and strong genetic predisposition, which also is included in DC/TMD. Conclusion The etiology is complex and still not clearly understood, but several biological and psychosocial risk factors for TMD have been identified. Several studies indicate that patients with TMD improve with a combination of noninvasive therapies, including behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and occlusal appliances. More stringently designed studies, however, are needed to assess treatment efficacy and how to tailor treatment to the individual patient.

### Understanding tinnitus symptom dynamics and clinical improvement through intensive longitudinal data [^115dLtSd]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Looking at which symptoms change, most predictive for clinical improvement were changes in tinnitus-related thoughts, jaw tension, momentary tinnitus loudness, daily tinnitus distress, maximum tinnitus loudness, and happiness (relevance in descending order). Those symptoms that are usually applied as outcome measures, i.e. tinnitus distress and loudness, are accompanied by psychological and somatic symptoms. This finding adds an interesting dimension to the understanding of clinical improvement in tinnitus, as it underscores the importance of considering general health symptoms alongside tinnitus-specific indicators. While the main mechanism of established tinnitus therapies typically involves reducing tinnitus-related distress, it is noteworthy that patients may prioritize loudness reduction or complete relief from tinnitus. Thus, the implementation of patient-centered, personalized EMA, wherein clinically relevant symptoms are identified by the patient and assessments are tailored accordingly, holds promise for enhancing clinical diagnostics and care.

The sensitivity analysis demonstrated the stability of key predictors (e.g. t-thoughts_linearity and jawbone_linearity) as well as consistent model fit across varying compliance rates. McFadden R² remained stable around 0.8 for compliance rates of 50–60% and 75–90%, suggesting robust modeling of clinical improvement using EMA data even in less compliant samples, which often reflect real-world scenarios. However, models with compliance rates of 65% and 70% appeared overfitted, as evidenced by smaller penalization factors (lambda), larger coefficients, and lower fit on the test set. It is important to note that the overall compliance in our study was lower than the typical 79% seen in pure EMA studies, likely because the daily diary was a secondary aspect of the clinical trial. A comparison of the 50%-compliance subsample with the entire RCT sample revealed variation only in age, while other baseline characteristics and CGI-I distributions were comparable. Although our findings highlight the feasibility of obtaining robust models from less compliant samples, efforts to increase compliance rates in EMA remain essential. Higher compliance not only improves data quality and statistical power but also enhances representativeness of the sample. EMA experts recommend strategies like improving instructions, encouraging questions, practice, and providing feedback to enhance both compliance and data quality.

### Pharmacologic treatment for temporomandibular and temporomandibular joint disorders [^111FyccZ]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular joint disorder is defined by pain and/or loss of function of the temporomandibular joint and its associated muscles and structures. Treatments include noninvasive pharmacologic therapies, minimally invasive muscular and articular injections, and surgery. Conservative therapies include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. Minimally invasive injections include botulinum toxin, corticosteroids, platelet-rich plasma, hyaluronic acid, and prolotherapy with hypertonic glucose. With many pharmacologic treatment options and modalities available to the oral and maxillofacial surgeon, mild to moderate temporomandibular joint disorder can be managed safely and effectively to improve symptoms of pain and function of the temporomandibular joint.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^112zkhhm]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD tinnitus guideline — research priorities in complementary and integrative health and pharmacotherapy emphasize evaluating nonpharmacologic and drug-related approaches for tinnitus. Complementary and integrative health priorities are to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of different types of acupuncture as a tinnitus intervention, evaluate the comparative effectiveness of different types of complementary and integrative whole health approaches to improve quality of life (QoL) with tinnitus, and evaluate the effectiveness of biofeedback to reduce tinnitus functional impact. Pharmacotherapy research priorities are to use tinnitus assessments (perception and functional impact) as outcome measures in clinical trials of medications designed to regenerate or reactivate hair cells and restore cochlear functions, and to conduct large clinical trials to determine whether effective pharmacological treatment of behavioral/mental health disorders is associated with reductions in tinnitus severity for patients who experience these co-occurring conditions.

### Tinnitus retraining therapy for patients with tinnitus and decreased sound tolerance [^112hDemh]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Our experience has revealed the following: (1) TRT is applicable for all types of tinnitus, as well as for decreased sound tolerance, with significant improvement of tinnitus occurring in over 80% of the cases, and at least equal success rate for decreased sound tolerance. (2) TRT can provide cure for decreased sound tolerance. (3) TRT does not require frequent clinic visits and has no side effects; however, (4) Special training of health providers involved in this treatment is required for this treatment to be effective.

### Diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular disorders… [^115gKWVZ]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Computed tomography is superior to plain radiography for evaluation of subtle bony morphology. Magnetic resonance imaging is the optimal modality for comprehensive joint evaluation in patients with signs and symptoms of TMD. Although there is a 78% to 95% correlation between magnetic resonance imaging findings and joint morphology in symptomatic patients, 15, 19–21 false-positive findings occur in 20% to 34% of asymptomatic patients. 22 Magnetic resonance imaging is typically reserved for patients with persistent symptoms, those in whom conservative therapy has been ineffective, or in those with suspected internal joint derangement. Ultrasonography is a noninvasive, dynamic, low-cost technique to diagnose internal derangement of the TMJ when magnetic resonance imaging is not readily available.
23. DIAGNOSTIC INJECTIONS Injections of local anesthetic at trigger points involving the muscles of mastication can be a diagnostic adjunct to distinguish the source of jaw pain.

This procedure should be performed only by physicians and dentists with experience in anesthetizing the auriculotemporal nerve region. When performed correctly, complication rates are low. Persistent pain after appropriate nerve blockade should alert the clinician to reevaluate TMD symptoms and consider an alternative diagnosis.
24. OCCLUSAL SPLINTS AND ADJUSTMENTS The use of occlusal splints is thought to alleviate or prevent degenerative forces placed on the TMJ, articular disk, and dentition. 58 These devices may benefit a select population of patients with severe bruxism and nocturnal clenching. Systematic reviews have shown conflicting results on the preferred occlusal device for relieving TMD symptoms. 59, 60 Dental consultation should be obtained to determine the optimal occlusal device. Occlusal adjustments have no benefit in the management or prevention of TMD.
61.

Referral Referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is recommended if the patient has a history of trauma or fracture to the TMJ complex, severe pain and dysfunction from internal derangement that does not respond to conservative measures, or pain with no identifiable source that persists for more than three to six months. 10, 14, 62 Surgery is rarely required for treatment of TMD and is usually reserved for correction of anatomic or articular abnormalities. 1 Surgical options include arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, diskectomy, condylotomy, and total joint replacement.
