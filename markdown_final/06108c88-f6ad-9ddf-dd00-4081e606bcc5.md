## Question

Oral alternative to zosyn?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about oral alternatives to Zosyn (piperacillin-tazobactam). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Zosyn covers and when it is typically used. Then, I should verify which oral agents can match that spectrum and in which syndromes. Next, I will review high-quality evidence and guidelines to prioritize options. After that, I need to check safety, resistance, and step-down criteria. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations by clinical scenario and highlight what to avoid or when IV therapy remains necessary.

> Let me first confirm Zosyn's role and spectrum so I don't jump to conclusions. Zosyn is a broad-spectrum IV beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor with reliable activity against many Gram-negatives, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes, and it is used for intra-abdominal infections, skin and soft tissue infections, nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia, and pelvic infections, often as empiric therapy in moderate-to-severe disease or when polymicrobial coverage is needed [^114XnT82] [^113XTchg].

> Now, I should identify oral agents with comparable breadth, but wait, let me verify the reality here. There is no single oral agent that fully replicates Zosyn's anti-pseudomonal and anaerobic coverage; therefore, oral "alternatives" are typically narrower-spectrum agents chosen to match the pathogen and clinical syndrome after initial IV therapy or in carefully selected milder cases, with step-down guided by cultures and clinical stability [^111Hu8AB].

> Next, I will examine oral options for intra-abdominal infections, since this is a common Zosyn indication. Fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole can provide Gram-negative and anaerobic coverage and have been studied as sequential therapy after initial IV treatment; in a randomized trial of complicated intra-abdominal infection, sequential IV-to-oral moxifloxacin was noninferior to IV piperacillin-tazobactam followed by oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, supporting oral step-down in clinically improving patients [^112TPsLv]. Hold on, I should verify the anaerobic piece: yes, moxifloxacin has intrinsic anaerobic activity, though many guidelines still prefer adding metronidazole when anaerobes are a concern, especially if the clinical picture suggests prominent anaerobic involvement [^116QgqRJ].

> For complicated urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis, I need to check which oral agents are preferred. IDSA guidance recommends fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as first-line oral therapy when susceptibility allows, with amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral cephalosporins as alternatives in select contexts; notably, nitrofurantoin and oral fosfomycin are not appropriate for pyelonephritis because they do not achieve adequate renal parenchymal and blood levels, so I should avoid suggesting those for this indication [^1144icsw] [^11642ttZ]. Let me reconsider whether piperacillin-tazobactam itself is ever used orally; it is not, so oral step-down must rely on agents like ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, TMP-SMX, or amoxicillin-clavulanate depending on susceptibilities and severity [^1144icsw].

> For skin and soft tissue infections, I should confirm which oral regimens can replace IV Zosyn after initial stabilization. Options include amoxicillin-clavulanate, doxycycline or minocycline (if MRSA risk is present), TMP-SMX plus a beta-lactam for polymicrobial coverage, or a fluoroquinolone when appropriate; IDSA SSTI guidance supports tailoring oral therapy to culture results and local epidemiology, and in animal bite infections, amoxicillin-clavulanate is specifically recommended for its Pasteurella and anaerobic coverage [^116gvyY5] [^114gfxEA]. Wait, I initially thought doxycycline alone might suffice for polymicrobial SSTIs, but I should correct that: for broad coverage including anaerobes, adding metronidazole or choosing amoxicillin-clavulanate is often prudent unless the pathogen mix is clearly narrow [^114gfxEA].

> For pneumonia, I need to ensure I align with HAP/VAP guidance. In non-ventilator HAP, several regimens are reasonable, and while piperacillin-tazobactam is among effective empiric choices, oral step-down should be guided by cultures and clinical response; no single oral agent matches Zosyn's full spectrum, so oral therapy typically uses a fluoroquinolone, a beta-lactam, or TMP-SMX depending on the pathogen and severity, with step-down once the patient is stable and susceptibilities return [^1168MErD] [^111Hu8AB]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to VAP as well; VAP generally requires initial IV therapy with antipseudomonal coverage, and oral step-down is reserved for patients who improve and have susceptible pathogens identified [^1168MErD].

> I will now examine special populations and stewardship constraints. In critically ill patients, piperacillin-tazobactam is associated with nephrotoxicity, particularly with concomitant vancomycin, so if an oral alternative is feasible after clinical improvement, switching can mitigate IV-related risks; this reinforces the principle of early IV-to-oral conversion when criteria are met [^111pdpLN] [^111Hu8AB]. For low-risk febrile neutropenia, oral ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin-clavulanate has been shown to be noninferior to IV piperacillin-tazobactam in selected patients, supporting oral strategies in carefully chosen scenarios with close follow-up [^1168aDsG].

> But wait, what if the infection involves ESBL-producing organisms or high-risk Gram-negatives. I should double-check guidance here. For ESBL bloodstream infections, piperacillin-tazobactam is generally not recommended as definitive therapy, and carbapenems are preferred; however, for step-down in stable patients with susceptible urinary-source ESBL infections, oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin can be considered if susceptibility is documented, whereas piperacillin-tazobactam should be avoided for ESBL bacteremia [^115rp3Xo] [^113u3k1t]. For infections caused by organisms with inducible AmpC, piperacillin-tazobactam is discouraged for serious disease, again underscoring that oral step-down must be pathogen-specific and guided by susceptibilities [^114sctJP].

> Next, I should review practical step-down criteria so I don't overgeneralize. Safe transition to oral therapy generally requires clinical stability, improving symptoms, hemodynamic normalization, ability to absorb and tolerate oral medications, and, ideally, microbiologic data supporting an active oral agent; IDSA guidance emphasizes these principles across syndromes, and stewardship programs often operationalize them to reduce IV days without compromising outcomes [^111Hu8AB] [^115dvMVh]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to bacteremia as well; recent data support early switch to appropriate oral therapy in selected Gram-negative bacteremias with good outcomes, reinforcing the concept when strict stability criteria are met [^116vT8Jq].

> Let me synthesize by scenario, keeping the spectrum gaps explicit. For intra-abdominal infection after initial IV therapy, moxifloxacin monotherapy or ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole are reasonable oral step-down options if the patient is improving and cultures support activity; amoxicillin-clavulanate is an alternative when local susceptibility allows, though it lacks anti-pseudomonal coverage and should be selected carefully [^112TPsLv]. For cUTI/pyelonephritis, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or TMP-SMX are preferred oral agents when susceptible, with amoxicillin-clavulanate or an oral cephalosporin as conditional alternatives; avoid nitrofurantoin and oral fosfomycin for pyelonephritis [^1144icsw] [^11642ttZ]. For SSTI, amoxicillin-clavulanate, doxycycline or minocycline (add a beta-lactam if broader coverage is needed), TMP-SMX plus a beta-lactam, or a fluoroquinolone can be used based on MRSA risk, severity, and culture results [^116gvyY5] [^114gfxEA]. For pneumonia, oral step-down should mirror the identified pathogen and typically involves a fluoroquinolone, a beta-lactam, or TMP-SMX once the patient stabilizes and susceptibilities return [^1168MErD] [^111Hu8AB].

> Finally, I need to ensure I state what to avoid and when IV therapy remains necessary. There is no oral agent that reliably covers Pseudomonas aeruginosa, so for proven Pseudomonas infections or high-risk settings where Pseudomonas is likely, IV therapy with an antipseudomonal agent is indicated until the patient is clearly improving and a narrower oral regimen can be justified by cultures and clinical course [^113nXuxT]. Likewise, severe sepsis, unstable hemodynamics, inability to take or absorb oral medications, or concerns for inadequate source control should delay oral conversion until those issues resolve [^111Hu8AB].

There is **no direct oral equivalent** to Zosyn (piperacillin-tazobactam) because no oral agent matches its broad-spectrum, anti-pseudomonal, and anaerobic coverage. For step-down therapy, use **amoxicillin-clavulanate** for polymicrobial infections without Pseudomonas, **fluoroquinolones** (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) for Gram-negative coverage, and add **metronidazole** if anaerobes are suspected. For Pseudomonas, **no reliable oral alternative** exists; IV therapy is required. Choose oral agents based on culture results, clinical stability, and local resistance patterns [^111Hu8AB] [^1144icsw].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

- **Spectrum of activity**: Zosyn combines piperacillin (a broad-spectrum penicillin) with tazobactam (a β-lactamase inhibitor), providing coverage against Gram-positive, Gram-negative (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and anaerobic organisms [^114XnT82].

- **Oral bioavailability**: Piperacillin and tazobactam have poor oral bioavailability, necessitating intravenous administration for therapeutic efficacy.

- **Clinical indications**: Zosyn is commonly used for severe infections such as nosocomial pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and febrile neutropenia [^114XnT82].

## Oral alternatives by clinical scenario

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended oral alternatives** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Complicated intra-abdominal infections | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) + metronidazole | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate covers Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms [^notfound] <br/> - Fluoroquinolones provide broad Gram-negative coverage, and metronidazole covers anaerobes [^notfound] |
| Skin and soft tissue infections | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Doxycycline or minocycline (if MRSA suspected) <br/> - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (if MRSA suspected) | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate is effective against common pathogens <br/> - Doxycycline and TMP-SMX cover MRSA [^notfound] |
| Community-acquired pneumonia | - Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) <br/> - Macrolides (azithromycin or clarithromycin) | - Choice depends on local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors [^notfound] |
| Febrile neutropenia (low-risk patients) | - Ciprofloxacin + amoxicillin-clavulanate | - Effective in low-risk patients with close follow-up [^1168aDsG] |

---

## Limitations of oral alternatives

- **Pseudomonas coverage**: No reliable oral agent provides consistent coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, limiting oral alternatives in infections involving this pathogen.

- **Anaerobic coverage**: While amoxicillin-clavulanate covers anaerobes, some oral alternatives may require combination therapy (e.g. fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole) to ensure adequate anaerobic coverage [^notfound].

- **Resistance patterns**: Local resistance data must guide oral agent selection to ensure therapeutic efficacy [^111Hu8AB].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

IDSA guidance supports transitioning to **oral therapy** when patients are clinically stable, susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, and there are no concerns about absorption or adherence [^111Hu8AB]. Stewardship programs emphasize **early IV-to-oral conversion** to reduce costs, length of stay, and adverse effects without compromising outcomes [^115dvMVh].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no direct oral equivalent** to Zosyn; oral alternatives must be tailored to the clinical scenario, pathogen susceptibility, and patient factors. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolones, and metronidazole are common oral options for step-down therapy, but Pseudomonas infections generally require continued IV therapy.

5.6	Nephrotoxicity in Critically Ill Patients

The use of ZOSYN was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with ZOSYN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Combined use of piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin may be associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

5.7	Electrolyte Effects

ZOSYN contains a total of 2.84 mEq (65 mg) of Na+(sodium) per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. This should be considered when treating patients requiring restricted salt intake. Periodic electrolyte determinations should be performed in patients with low potassium reserves, and the possibility of hypokalemia should be kept in mind with patients who have potentially low potassium reserves and who are receiving cytotoxic therapy or diuretics.

5.8 Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ZOSYN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.9	Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing ZOSYN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of development of drug-resistant bacteria.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

If a dose of ZOSYN is required that does not equal 2.25 g, 3.375 g, or 4.5 g, ZOSYN injection in GALAXY Containers is not recommended for use and an alternative formulation of ZOSYN should be considered.

2.2 Dosage in Adult Patients With Indications Other Than Nosocomial Pneumonia

The usual total daily dosage of ZOSYN for adult patients with indications other than nosocomial pneumonia is 3.375 g every six hours [totaling 13.5 g (12.0 g piperacillin and 1.5 g tazobactam)], to be administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The usual duration of ZOSYN treatment is from 7 to 10 days.

2.3 Dosage in Adult Patients With Nosocomial Pneumonia

Initial presumptive treatment of adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia should start with ZOSYN at a dosage of 4.5 g every six hours plus an aminoglycoside, [totaling 18.0 g (16.0 g piperacillin and 2.0 g tazobactam)], administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The recommended duration of ZOSYN treatment for nosocomial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days. Treatment with the aminoglycoside should be continued in patients from whom P. aeruginosa is isolated.

2.4 Dosage in Adult Patients With Renal Impairment

In adult patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min) and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of ZOSYN should be reduced based on the degree of renal impairment. The recommended daily dosage of ZOSYN for patients with renal impairment administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes is described in Table 1.

For patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dose is 2.25 g every twelve hours for all indications other than nosocomial pneumonia and 2.25 g every eight hours for nosocomial pneumonia. Since hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of the administered dose, an additional dose of 0.75 g ZOSYN (0.67 g piperacillin and 0.08 g tazobactam) should be administered following each dialysis period on hemodialysis days. No additional dosage of ZOSYN is necessary for CAPD patients.

7.1	Aminoglycosides

Piperacillin may inactivate aminoglycosides by converting them to microbiologically inert amides.

In vivo inactivation:

When aminoglycosides are administered in conjunction with piperacillin to patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, the concentrations of the aminoglycosides (especially tobramycin) may be significantly reduced and should be monitored.

Sequential administration of ZOSYN and tobramycin to patients with either normal renal function or mild to moderate renal impairment has been shown to modestly decrease serum concentrations of tobramycin but no dosage adjustment is considered necessary.

In vitro inactivation:

Due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by piperacillin, ZOSYN and aminoglycosides are recommended for separate administration. ZOSYN and aminoglycosides should be reconstituted, diluted, and administered separately when concomitant therapy with aminoglycosides is indicated. ZOSYN, which contains EDTA, is compatible with amikacin and gentamicin for simultaneous Y-site infusion in certain diluents and at specific concentrations. ZOSYN is not compatible with tobramycin for simultaneous Y-site infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

7.2	Probenecid

Probenecid administered concomitantly with ZOSYN prolongs the half-life of piperacillin by 21% and that of tazobactam by 71% because probenecid inhibits tubular renal secretion of both piperacillin and tazobactam. Probenecid should not be co-administered with ZOSYN unless the benefit outweighs the risk.

7.3	Vancomycin

Studies have detected an increased incidence of acute kidney injury in patients concomitantly administered piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin as compared to vancomycin alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Monitor kidney function in patients concomitantly administered with piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin.

No pharmacokinetic interactions have been noted between piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin.

7.4	Anticoagulants

Coagulation parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly during simultaneous administration of high doses of heparin, oral anticoagulants, or other drugs that may affect the blood coagulation system or the thrombocyte function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients

Clinical studies of ZOSYN in pediatric patients suggest a similar safety profile to that seen in adults.

In a prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label clinical trial of pediatric patients, 2 to 12 years of age, with intra-abdominal infections (including appendicitis and/or peritonitis), 273 patients were treated with ZOSYN 112.5 mg/kg given IV every 8 hours and 269 patients were treated with cefotaxime (50 mg/kg) plus metronidazole (7.5 mg/kg) every 8 hours. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 146 patients, 73 (26.7%) in the ZOSYN group and 73 (27.1%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group. Six patients (2.2%) in the ZOSYN group and 5 patients (1.9%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group discontinued due to an adverse event.

In a retrospective, cohort study, 140 pediatric patients 2 months to less than 18 years of age with nosocomial pneumonia were treated with ZOSYN and 267 patients were treated with comparators (which included ticarcillin-clavulanate, carbapenems, ceftazidime, cefepime, or ciprofloxacin). The rates of serious adverse reactions were generally similar between the ZOSYN and comparator groups, including patients aged 2 months to 9 months treated with ZOSYN 90 mg/kg IV every 6 hours and patients older than 9 months and less than 18 years of age treated with ZOSYN 112.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours.

5.6 Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions

As with other penicillins, piperacillin and tazobactam may cause neuromuscular excitability or seizures. Patients receiving higher doses, especially patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for central nervous system adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment or seizure disorders for signs and symptoms of neuromuscular excitability or seizures [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Nephrotoxicity in Critically Ill Patients

The use of piperacillin and tazobactam was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with piperacillin and tazobactam [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Combined use of piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin may be associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

5.8 Electrolyte Effects

Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection contains a total of 2.35 mEq (54 mg) of Na+(sodium) per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. This should be considered when treating patients requiring restricted salt intake. Periodic electrolyte determinations should be performed in patients with low potassium reserves, and the possibility of hypokalemia should be kept in mind with patients who have potentially low potassium reserves and who are receiving cytotoxic therapy or diuretics.

1.3	Skin and Skin Structure Infections

ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated skin and skin structure infections, including cellulitis, cutaneous abscesses and ischemic/diabetic foot infections caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Staphylococcus aureus.

1.4	Female Pelvic Infections

ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of postpartum endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Escherichia coli.

1.5	Community-acquired Pneumonia

ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (moderate severity only) caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Haemophilus influenzae.

1.6	Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZOSYN and other antibacterial drugs, ZOSYN should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients

Clinical studies of ZOSYN in pediatric patients suggest a similar safety profile to that seen in adults.

In a prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label clinical trial of pediatric patients, 2 to 12 years of age, with intra-abdominal infections (including appendicitis and/or peritonitis), 273 patients were treated with ZOSYN 112.5 mg/kg given IV every 8 hours and 269 patients were treated with cefotaxime (50 mg/kg) plus metronidazole (7.5 mg/kg) every 8 hours. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 146 patients, 73 (26.7%) in the ZOSYN group and 73 (27.1%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group. Six patients (2.2%) in the ZOSYN group and 5 patients (1.9%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group discontinued due to an adverse event.

In a retrospective, cohort study, 140 pediatric patients 2 months to less than 18 years of age with nosocomial pneumonia were treated with ZOSYN and 267 patients were treated with comparators (which included ticarcillin-clavulanate, carbapenems, ceftazidime, cefepime, or ciprofloxacin). The rates of serious adverse reactions were generally similar between the ZOSYN and comparator groups, including patients aged 2 months to 9 months treated with ZOSYN 90 mg/kg IV every 6 hours and patients older than 9 months and less than 18 years of age treated with ZOSYN 112.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When piperacillin and tazobactam for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by piperacillin and tazobactam for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113vaxgM]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Zander and colleagues have provided new information on target attainment of PIP concentrations in a heterogeneous group of critically ill patients. Among patients without severe renal dysfunction, there are concerns of not reaching PK/PD targets using traditional TID dosing of PIP-TAZ. There also is high inter- and intra-patient variability in PIP concentrations. Alternative dosing strategies that optimize PIP-TAZ therapy are needed and may include the use of prolonged infusions. Importantly, there is strong rationale for the use of regular TDM to be the cornerstone for individualizing PIP-TAZ therapy and maximize efficacy.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical Trials in Adult Patients

During the initial clinical investigations, 2621 patients worldwide were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in phase 3 trials. In the key North American monotherapy clinical trials (n = 830 patients), 90% of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. However, in 3.2% of the patients treated worldwide, piperacillin and tazobactam for injection was discontinued because of adverse events primarily involving the skin (1.3%), including rash and pruritus; the gastrointestinal system (0.9%), including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; and allergic reactions (0.5%).

Nosocomial Pneumonia Trials

Two trials of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections were conducted. In one study, 222 patients were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in a dosing regimen of 4.5 g every 6 hours in combination with an aminoglycoside and 215 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg/500 mg every 6 hours) in combination with an aminoglycoside. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 402 patients, 204 (91.9%) in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 198 (92.1%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Twenty-five (11%) patients in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 14 (6.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group (p > 0.05) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

5.5 Hematologic Adverse Reactions

Bleeding manifestations have occurred in some patients receiving beta-lactam drugs, including piperacillin. These reactions have sometimes been associated with abnormalities of coagulation tests such as clotting time, platelet aggregation and prothrombin time, and are more likely to occur in patients with renal failure. If bleeding manifestations occur, Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted.

The leukopenia/neutropenia associated with piperacillin and tazobactam administration appears to be reversible and most frequently associated with prolonged administration.

Periodic assessment of hematopoietic function should be performed, especially with prolonged therapy, i.e., ≥ 21 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.6 Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions

As with other penicillins, piperacillin and tazobactam may cause neuromuscular excitability or seizures. Patients receiving higher doses, especially patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for central nervous system adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment or seizure disorders for signs and symptoms of neuromuscular excitability or seizures [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Nephrotoxicity in Critically Ill Patients

The use of piperacillin and tazobactam was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Combined use of piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin may be associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Evaluating outcomes associated with alternative dosing strategies for piperacillin / tazobactam: a qualitative systematic review [^112PESiN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To perform a qualitative systematic review of the evidence comparing traditional strategies against prolonged intermittent or continuous infusion strategies for piperacillin/tazobactam, based on clinical and pharmacodynamic outcomes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1950-September 2011), EMBASE (1980-September 2011), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2011) were searched, using the terms piperacillin, tazobactam, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, dosing, and infusion. Reference lists from relevant publications were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles evaluating the administration of piperacillin/tazobactam to adults and comparing at least 2 dosing regimens (1 of which included the traditional, manufacturer-recommended 30-minute infusion; the other, a prolonged or continuous infusion strategy) were included. Prespecified clinical outcomes of interest included mortality, clinical cures, and adverse events. The pharmacodynamic endpoint of interest was percent time of unbound drug concentration remaining above the minimum inhibitory concentration.

Data Synthesis

Twelve studies were included in this review, 7 of which assessed clinical outcomes and 5 that assessed pharmacodynamic endpoints using Monte Carlo simulations. Prolonged or continuous infusions of piperacillin/tazobactam consistently achieved higher pharmacodynamic endpoints than did traditional infusions. The association of prolonged or continuous infusions with improved clinical outcomes, however, is unclear. Two retrospective studies found improved mortality rates with prolonged infusions (1 in a subgroup of patients with higher APACHE II [Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II] scores), while another retrospective study found improved clinical cure rates with continuous infusions in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. These clinical benefits have not been substantiated in prospective randomized trials. No study has provided evidence of reduced adverse effects with prolonged or continuous infusions.

Conclusions

The limited evidence available does not firmly support widespread adoption of administering piperacillin/tazobactam as prolonged intermittent or continuous infusions to improve clinical outcomes despite the achievement of higher pharmacodynamic targets in simulated studies. Retrospective studies indicate that critical care patients are the subgroup most likely to benefit from these dosing strategies. Well-designed prospective clinical trials are required to confirm potential benefits observed in retrospective studies.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam added to vancomycin increases risk for acute kidney injury: fact or fiction? [^111J7bdd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam are 2 of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in hospitals. Recent data from multiple meta-analyses suggest that the combination increases the risk for vancomycin-induced kidney injury when compared to alternative viable options. However, these studies are unable to prove biologic plausibility and causality as randomized controlled trials have not been performed. Furthermore, these studies define acute kidney injury according to thresholds of serum creatinine rise. Serum creatinine is not a direct indicator of renal injury, rather a surrogate of glomerular function. More reliable, specific, and sensitive biomarkers are needed to truly define if there is a causal relationship with increased toxicity when piperacillin-tazobactam is added to vancomycin. This viewpoint will explore the available evidence for and against increased acute kidney injury in the setting of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam coadministration.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113bGebD]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Administering PIP-TAZ as a prolonged infusion — that is, either administering the antibiotic over half the dosing interval (e.g. over 3 h if given QID), or administering the total daily dose as a continuous infusion over 24 h after an initial loading dose — may help overcome subtherapeutic PIP concentrations in the critically ill. There are now observational studies as well as randomized controlled trial (RCT) data that show increased likelihood of PIP concentrations being maintained above the MIC of pathogens using the prolonged infusion strategy. Furthermore, there were higher rates of clinical cure associated with PIP-TAZ administered as a continuous infusion in the RCTs. Both of the RCTs included patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, and so, coupled with the results from the study by Zander et al. showing PK/PD target attainment being problematic in these groups of patients via intermittent bolus dosing, the use of prolonged infusions may be a simple strategy that ICUs can employ. Notably, however, prolonged infusions may still not achieve therapeutic targets in certain groups of patients, such as those displaying ARC. In these circumstances, dose up-titration may also be advisable, but can only be comfortably performed with use of TDM.

### Oral antibiotics with early hospital discharge compared with in-patient intravenous antibiotics for low-risk febrile neutropenia in patients with cancer: a prospective randomised controlled single centre study [^1168aDsG]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Neutropenic sepsis remains a potentially life-threatening complication of anticancer chemotherapy. However, it is possible to identify patients who are at low risk for serious complications and for whom less-intensive, more-convenient treatment may be appropriate. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of oral antibiotics in conjunction with early hospital discharge in comparison with standard in-patient intravenous antibiotics in patients with low-risk neutropenic fever. In all, 126 episodes of low-risk neutropenic fever occurred in 102 patients. Patients were randomised to receive either: an oral regimen of ciprofloxacin (750 mg 12 hourly) plus amoxicillin-clavulanate (675 mg 8 hourly) for a total of 5 days, or a standard intravenous regimen of gentamicin and tazocin (piperacillin/tazobactam) until hospital discharge. Patients randomised to oral antibiotics were eligible for discharge following 24 h of hospitalisation, if clinically stable and symptomatically improved. The efficacy of the two arms was similar: initial treatment was successful without antibiotic modification in 90% of episodes in the intravenous arm and 84.8% of episodes in the oral arm, P = 0.55, absolute difference between the groups 5.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference -7 to 17.3%. Only one episode in the oral arm was associated with significant clinical deterioration: this occurred within the initial in-patient assessment period. The median in-patient stay was 4 days in the intravenous arm (range 2–8) and 2 days in the oral arm (range 1–16 days), P& < 0.0005. The reduction in hospital stay led to significant cost-savings in the oral arm. In conclusion, this study suggests that oral antibiotics in conjunction with early hospital discharge for patients who remain stable after a 24 h period of in-patient monitoring offers a feasible and cost-effective alternative to conventional management of low-risk neutropenic fever.

### Meropenem and piperacillin / tazobactam prescribing in critically ill patients: does augmented renal clearance affect pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic target attainment when extended infusions are used? [^112qwKu6]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The findings from this study suggest that an even more sophisticated method of optimization may be necessary in selected patients - patient-tailored antibiotic therapy - which is the adaptation of antibiotic therapy to the need of the individual patient in order to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity through therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adaptation. Unfortunately, TDM of β-lactam antibiotics is currently challenging with long turnaround times, expensive equipment, logistical problems related to the instability of the antibiotics in the samples and the need for well-trained personnel. Efforts to overcome these limitations, and clinical studies to assess utility in the clinical setting are urgently needed.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

To compare the safety and efficacy of sequential intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) moxifloxacin treatment against a standard antimicrobial regimen of IV piperacillin-tazobactam followed by PO amoxicillin-clavulanate for the treatment of adults with complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI).

Summary Background Data

cIAIs are commonly due to mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and require both source control and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.

Methods

A prospective, double-blind, randomized, phase III comparative trial. Patients with cIAI were stratified by disease severity (APACHE II score) and randomized to either IV/PO moxifloxacin (400 mg q24 hours) or comparator (IV piperacillin-tazobactam [3.0/0.375 g q6 hours] ± PO amoxicillin-clavulanate [800 mg/114 mg q12 hours]), each for 5 to 14 days. The primary efficacy variable was clinical cure rate at the test-of-cure visit (days 25–50). Bacteriologic outcomes were also determined.

Results

Of 656 intent-to-treat patients, 379 (58%) were valid to assess efficacy (183 moxifloxacin, 196 comparator). Demographic and baseline medical characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Clinical cure rates at test-of-cure were 80% (146 of 183) for moxifloxacin versus 78% (153 of 196) for comparator (95% confidence interval, -7.4%, 9.3%). The clinical cure rate at test-of-cure for hospital-acquired cIAI was higher with moxifloxacin (82%, 22 of 27) versus comparator (55%, 17 of 31; P = 0.05); rates were similar for community-acquired infections (80% [124 of 156] versus 82% [136 of 165], respectively). Bacterial eradication rates were 78% (117 of 150) with moxifloxacin versus 77% (126 of 163) in the comparator group (95% confidence interval, -9.9%, 8.7%).

Conclusions

Once daily IV/PO moxifloxacin monotherapy was as least as effective as standard IV piperacillin-tazobactam/PO amoxicillin-clavulanate dosed multiple times daily for the treatment of cIAIs.

Randomization and Masking

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either 6 g ZTI-01 infused over 60 minutes every 8 hours [q8h] or 4.5 g PIP-TAZ (4 g PIP/0.5 g TAZ) infused over 60 minutes q8h. The PIP-TAZ dosage was based on labeled guidelines for cUTI/AP in the current Summary of Medicinal Product Characteristics, with no dosage adjustment necessary. ZTI-01 doses were adjusted for patients with CrCl < 50 and ≥ 20 mL/min (Supplementary Appendix). Subjects with baseline CrCl < 20 mL/min were excluded from the study. Randomization was stratified by region (US vs Rest of World), baseline diagnosis (cUTI vs AP), and prior antibiotic therapy (single dose of short-acting antibiotic vs no prior antibiotic therapy). At least 30% of patients were intended to have a diagnosis of AP at study entry.

Patients received ZTI-01 and PIP-TAZ as 1-hour infusions 3 times daily for a fixed 7 days, except in patients with concurrent bacteremia who could receive up to 14 days at the investigator's discretion. Oral step-down therapy was prohibited.

Study Procedures

Procedures included baseline urine collection for quantitative culture and blood cultures. Routine monitoring occurred for signs and symptoms of cUTI/AP and adverse events (AEs), and prespecified collection of laboratory data including chemistry panels, complete blood counts, and urine/blood cultures (Supplementary Appendix).

Baseline urine cultures growing ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL and any positive blood cultures were sent to the central laboratory (JMI Laboratories, North Liberty, Iowa) for identification, quantification, susceptibility testing, and further characterization of the organism(s). Fosfomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined at a central lab using the agar dilution reference method.

### Does piperacillin-tazobactam increase mortality risk compared to cefepime? Collider bias and the importance of assumptions in instrumental variable analyses [^112sxRse]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Instrumental variable (IV) analysis is a statistical method allowing causal inference under certain assumptions. A recent high-profile IV analysis suggested cefepime was superior to piperacillin-tazobactam in treating sepsis. This study used a worldwide piperacillin-tazobactam shortage as an IV to infer mortality effects. However, this result starkly contrasts with the well-powered ACORN trial, which showed no effect. We discuss important limitations of the IV study potentially explaining this discrepancy.

Methods

We used causal diagrams and the potential outcomes framework to describe potential biases. We identified two sources: (1) statistical adjustment for metronidazole treatment, leading to collider bias, and (2) operationalization of the treatment variable (exposure coarsening). We performed simulations demonstrating collider bias can explain the results. Finally, we used summary data from the original paper to obtain alternative causal estimates robust to these biases.

Results

Adjusting for metronidazole, a choice influenced by both the IV (via initial antibiotic) and underlying factors like disease severity, induces collider bias. Analyses not adjusting for metronidazole show no strong evidence for a mortality difference. However, bias risk from exposure coarsening remains even without adjustment. Re-analysing summary data provides no compelling evidence for a benefit of cefepime over piperacillin-tazobactam.

Conclusions

The recent IV analysis does not support a mortality benefit for cefepime; results appear dependent on incorrect analytical choices introducing bias. Clinicians should be aware of IV analysis complexities and assumptions when making causal inferences from observational data, especially when results contradict high-quality trials and antibiotic choice is the exposure.

### Fosfomycin for injection (ZTI-01) versus piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection including acute pyelonephritis: ZEUS, A phase 2 / 3 randomized trial [^117PgEvR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

ZTI-01 (fosfomycin for injection) is an epoxide antibiotic with a differentiated mechanism of action (MOA) inhibiting an early step in bacterial cell wall synthesis. ZTI-01 has broad in vitro spectrum of activity, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, and is being developed for treatment of complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) and acute pyelonephritis (AP) in the United States.

Methods

Hospitalized adults with suspected or microbiologically confirmed cUTI/AP were randomized 1:1 to 6 g ZTI-01 q8h or 4.5 g intravenous (IV) piperacillin-tazobactam (PIP-TAZ) q8h for a fixed 7-day course (no oral switch); patients with concomitant bacteremia could receive up to 14 days.

Results

Of 465 randomized patients, 233 and 231 were treated with ZTI-01 and PIP-TAZ, respectively. In the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (m-MITT) population, ZTI-01 met the primary objective of noninferiority compared with PIP-TAZ with overall success rates of 64.7% (119/184 patients) vs 54.5% (97/178 patients), respectively; treatment difference was 10.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.4, 20.8). Clinical cure rates at test of cure (TOC, day 19–21) were high and similar between treatments (90.8% [167/184] vs 91.6% [163/178], respectively). In post hoc analysis using unique pathogens typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, overall success rates at TOC in m-MITT were 69.0% (127/184) for ZTI-01 versus 57.3% (102/178) for PIP-TAZ (difference 11.7% 95% CI: 1.3, 22.1). ZTI-01 was well tolerated. Most treatment-emergent adverse events, including hypokalemia and elevated serum aminotransferases, were mild and transient.

Conclusions

ZTI-01 was effective for treatment of cUTI including AP and offers a new IV therapeutic option with a differentiated MOA for patients with serious Gram-negative infections.

Piperacillin–tazobactam dosing ratios and susceptibility breakpoints — In a 4.5 g dose of piperacillin-tazobactam there is an 8:1 ratio of piperacillin to tazobactam (ie, 4 grams of piperacillin and 0.5 grams of tazobactam), whereas in a 3 g dose of cefotolozane there is a 2:1 ratio of cefotolozane to tazobactam. The piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoint for Enterobacterales has been based on PK/PD considerations and a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL of tazobactam in testing wells. In 2022, the CLSI lowered the piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints for Enterobacterales: MICs of ≤ 8/4 μg/mL are considered susceptible and a MIC of 16 μg/mL is considered susceptible, dose-dependent; in the clinical trial mentioned in Question 1.3, 94% of isolates would have been considered susceptible or susceptible dose-dependent under the revised breakpoints, indicating that in the presence of ESBL production, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam may not correlate with clinical success.

Exploratory outcomes

Antibiotic utilisation

Use of any antibiotic was identified in 33 (82%) of the intervention arm patients and 37 (92%) of the control arm prior to randomisation and in 25 (62%) patients in each arm after randomisation. Pre-randomisation, 4/40 (10%) of the intervention arm and 3/40 (7.5%) of the control arm had received an alternate penicillin antibiotic (not implicated in their penicillin allergy label).

In-hospital use of any penicillin after randomisation was noted in 13 (32%) of the intervention arm and 4 (10%) of the control arm, (odds ratio (OR) 4.33, 95% CI [1.27, 14.78] p = 0.019). Post-randomisation use of a narrow-spectrum penicillin was noted in 3 (8%) of the intervention arm vs. 1 (2%) of the control arm (OR 3.16, 95% CI [0.31, 31.78] p = 0.328).

Post-randomisation use of restricted antimicrobials (3rd-/4th-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides) was noted in 15 (38%) of the intervention arm and 18 (45%) of the control arm (OR 0.73, 95% CI [0.30, 1.79] p = 0.496).

### Prospective evaluating the appropriate use of piperacillin / tazobactam in cardiac center of a tertiary care hospital [^111xUUUk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as Pip/Taz, play an essential role in the empirical therapy of serious infections.

Pip /taz is a combination of β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor and has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity including most Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria and is effective for many polymicrobial infections.

Pip/Taz is useful against a variety of respiratory infection, intra-abdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, febrile neutropenia, and bloodstream infections (BSI) which are among the most frequent complications in neutropenic cancer patients caused by Gram-negative rods which associated with high mortality.

Improper use of these antibiotics is common and costly, as physicians often use broad-spectrum antibiotics when a narrower-spectrum agent would work. Overuse of broad-spectrum agents also has an important role in growing worldwide bacterial resistance which has become a serious problem and adds to the overall costs of medical care with increased side effects.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has published stewardship guidelines to optimize antibiotic use, using cost-effective interventions, to minimize antibiotic resistance, minimize side effects and control Clostridium difficile infections.

Various strategies have offered for antimicrobial stewardship programs. Like staff education, formulary restrictions and substitutions, early de-escalating, early converting parenteral to oral, and practice guidelines that consider local microbiology and resistance.

One useful strategy is to decrease inappropriate use of broad spectrum antibiotics by restricting its use to infectious diseases consultant to get approval for dispensing.

By identifying the inappropriate use of pip /taz, further regulations can be implemented to optimize the use of this medication and thus decreasing the antimicrobial drug resistance which contribute to better patient outcomes. In addition, if appropriate use of Pip/Taz is established, unnecessary hospital costs can be reduced. Hence, we conducted this study to estimate the appropriate use of Pip/Taz utilization in the surgical cardiac unit using Antibiotic stewardship guidelines as a reference.

### Effect of meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam on clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication in complicated urinary tract infection: the TANGO I randomized clinical trial [^114umekd]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Meropenem-vaborbactam is a combination carbapenem/beta-lactamase inhibitor and a potential treatment for severe drug-resistant gram-negative infections.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and adverse events of meropenem-vaborbactam in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical trial (TANGO I) conducted November 2014 to April 2016 and enrolling patients (≥ 18 years) with complicated UTI, stratified by infection type and geographic region.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive meropenem-vaborbactam (2g/2g over 3 hours; n = 274) or piperacillin-tazobactam (4g/0.5g over 30 minutes; n = 276) every 8 hours. After 15 or more doses, patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin if they met prespecified criteria for improvement, to complete 10 days of total treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point for FDA criteria was overall success (clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication composite) at end of intravenous treatment in the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Primary end point for European Medicines Agency (EMA) criteria was microbial eradication at test-of-cure visit in the microbiologic modified ITT and microbiologic evaluable populations. Prespecified noninferiority margin was -15%. Because the protocol prespecified superiority testing in the event of noninferiority, 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated.

Results

Among 550 patients randomized, 545 received study drug (mean age, 52.8 years; 361 [66.2%] women; 374 [68.6%] in the microbiologic modified ITT population; 347 [63.7%] in the microbiologic evaluable population; 508 [93.2%] completed the trial). For the FDA primary end point, overall success occurred in 189 of 192 (98.4%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 171 of 182 (94.0%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 4.5% [95% CI, 0.7% to 9.1%]; P < .001 for noninferiority). For the EMA primary end point, microbial eradication in the microbiologic modified ITT population occurred in 128 of 192 (66.7%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 105 of 182 (57.7%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 9.0% [95% CI, -0.9% to 18.7%]; P < .001 for noninferiority); microbial eradication in the microbiologic evaluable population occurred in 118 of 178 (66.3%) vs 102 of 169 (60.4%) (difference, 5.9% [95% CI, -4.2% to 16.0%]; P < .001 for noninferiority). Adverse events were reported in 106 of 272 (39.0%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 97 of 273 (35.5%) with piperacillin-tazobactam.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis and growth of a baseline pathogen, meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in a composite outcome of complete resolution or improvement of symptoms along with microbial eradication that met the noninferiority criterion. Further research is needed to understand the spectrum of patients in whom meropenem-vaborbactam offers a clinical advantage.

### Treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamases infections: what is the current role of new β-lactams / β-lactamase inhibitors? [^111cEhug]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The widespread diffusion of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Enterobacteriales currently represents a major threat for public health worldwide. Carbapenems are currently considered the first-line choice for serious ESBL infections. However, the dramatic global increase in ESBL prevalence has led to a significant overuse of carbapenems that has promoted the selection and spread of carbapenemases, which might further prejudicated our ability to treat infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, strategies to limit the use of carbapenems should be implemented.

Recent Findings

Although piperacillin-tazobactam should no longer be considered an alternative to carbapenems for definitive treatment of bloodstream infections due to ESBL-producing strains, it might still represent an alternative for step-down therapy or for low-to-moderate severity infection originating from urinary or biliary sources and when piperacillin-tazobactam minimum inhibitory concentration of 4mg/l or less. Ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam are both carbapenem sparing agents that appear interesting alternatives for treatment of serious ESBL infections. New β-lactams/β-lactamase inhibitors (BL/BLI), including cefepime-enmetazobactam, ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam, aztreonam-avibactam and cefepime-zidebactam, are also promising agents for treatment of ESBL infections, but further clinical data are needed to establish their efficacy relative to carbapenems. The role of carbapenems/β-lactamase inhibitors remain to be clarified.

Summary

New BL/BLI have distinctive specificities and limitations that require further investigations. Future randomized clinical trials are required to define the best strategy for their administering for ESBL infections.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^1144icsw]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric antibiotic selection uses a four-step approach: "Assess (1) severity of illness, (2) risk factors for resistance, (3) patient-specific considerations, and (4) if septic, consider the antibiogram". For sepsis with or without shock, preferred agents are "Third or fourth generation cephalosporins, * carbapenems,# piperacillin-tazobactam, fluoroquinolones&" with alternatives "Novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors,+ cefiderocol, plazomicin, or older aminoglycosides%". Without sepsis using an IV route, preferred agents are "Third or fourth generation cephalosporins, * piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones&" and alternatives are "Carbapenems,# newer agents (novel beta lactams-beta lactamase inhibitors,† cefiderocol, plazomicin), or older aminoglycosides%". Without sepsis using an oral route, preferred therapy is "Fluoroquinolones& or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole" with alternatives "Amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral cephalosporins (see Table 3.1)". Sepsis is described as "identified by SOFA score of 2 or higher" and screening tools "may be useful"; in step 4 choose antibiotics with susceptibilities "at least 90%" for sepsis with shock and "at least 80%" for sepsis without shock. The page also notes that "Difficult-to-treat resistant pathogens may require use of drugs not listed here (e.g., colistin); refer to IDSA Antimicrobial Resistance guidance" and that "nitrofurantoin and oral fosfomycin are generally not appropriate choices for cUTI because they may not achieve adequate levels in renal parenchyma and blood".

### Can probiotics be an alternative to chlorhexidine for oral care in the mechanically ventilated patient? A multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled open trial [^115ZSoph]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Results

After screening, a total of 150 patients (50 from the initial cohort + 100 in the extended investigation) were included in the present analysis, and 69 patients (23 initial cohort + 46 extended investigation) in the Lp group and 68 patients (21 initial cohort + 47 extended investigation) in the control group completed the study. Thirteen patients were excluded because they had < 24 h of mechanical ventilation or consent was withdrawn. Five and eight Lp and control patients respectively were tracheotomised. One patient in the control group was transferred to another hospital, but all of the others completed their study participation with the respective treatment.

We found no significant differences between the Lp group and the control group with respect to demographic data, number of ventilator days, length of stay (LOS) or ICU and in-hospital mortality (Table 1). Furthermore, we observed no major disparities regarding laboratory test results, severity scores or drug treatments. Cephalosporins, imipenem/cilastatin and piperacillin/tazobactam were the most frequently used antibiotics.

Microbiological results

The total number of new emerging bacteria or fungi did not differ significantly between the two groups. Thus, the numbers of patients with new enteric bacteria in the Lp299 and CHX groups were similar (Table 2); 31 and 29 for oropharyngeal cultures, and 19 and 17 for tracheal cultures, respectively. The distribution of patients without and with one, two and three new emerging enteric bacteria respectively are shown in Fig. 1. Cultures with positive results for the oropharynx and tracheal secretions are presented in Table 3. Risk ratios for the four microbe groups show a difference in emerging fungi for oropharyngeal cultures (Table 4) in favour of the Lp treatment. There was no difference in day of appearance of the first finding of pathogens. There were no obvious trends for either type of culture or patient group (Fig. 2). Participants without any new microbial findings were 30 and 22 patients for the Lp and control groups for oropharyngeal cultures, and 31 and 30 patients for the tracheal secretion cultures, respectively.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (BLBLI), including ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, have an in vitro activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobe organisms. However, increasing antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae including community-acquired isolates, during the last decade, has compromised clinical utility of these agents for empirical therapy of serious Gram-negative infections. This is likely due to excessive use of amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate in both children and adults, particularly in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection. The combination of over use of these oral antibiotics in the community and potential for household transmission of resistant E. coli strains among family members make ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate resistance unpredictable. Fortunately, most isolates remain susceptible to other beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors such as piperacillin/tazobactam. Broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam, including anti-pseudomonal and anaerobic coverage, still make it an attractive option in the management of severe IAIs.

A meta-analysis of PubMed and Scopus databases providing data for mortality among patients treated with carbapenems, BLBLI or non- BLBLI (mainly cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones), preferably as monotherapy was published in 2013. The study reported no statistically significant difference in mortality between carbapenems and BLBLI administered as either empiric or definitive therapy. The authors concluded that the role of BLBLI should be further evaluated for definitive treatment. In a recent study of 331 unique patients with ESBL bacteremia, piperacillin/tazobactam appeared inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of ESBL bacteremia; the use of piperacillin/tazobactam in ESBLs infections is still controversial.

Tazobactam is less effective at protecting β-lactams from AmpC hydrolysis than newer β-lactamase inhibitors such as avibactam, relebactam, and vaborbactam, and the role of piperacillin-tazobactam in treating Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production remains uncertain. A 2019 meta-analysis of observational studies did not identify a difference in mortality between patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for bacteremia caused by Enterobacter spp. Citrobacter spp., or Serratia spp., though significant heterogeneity and confounding by indication likely existed. A pilot unblinded clinical trial randomized 72 patients with bloodstream infections to piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 grams IV every 6 hours as a standard infusion) or meropenem (1 gram IV every 8 hours as a standard infusion) and found no significant differences in the primary composite outcome, with notable and seemingly conflicting findings among individual components.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^115ug61s]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Another innovative therapeutic approach is being suggested and recommended in several studies worldwide to reduce the use of antibiotics in the clinical management of these uncomplicated cases. Antibiotic treatment should be used in selected cases such as patients with signs of generalized infection, immunosuppressed patients, or conservative nonantibiotic treatment failure. Two systematic reviews have called antibiotic usage into question. The first systematic review identified three RCTs and reported that antibiotic use did not reduce the duration of symptoms or prevent subsequent complications or recurrence. However, we note that the quality of evidence from the included trials was low because of a high risk of bias, and only patients with modified Hinchey stage Ia and Ib were included, thus excluding immunocompromised patients, those with symptoms of sepsis, or significant comorbidity. Data from a RCT by Chabok and colleagues found that antibiotics may reduce complication risk during treatment [relative risk (RR) 0.49; 95% CI 0.12–1.95], but with no statistical significance. A recent systematic review including eight studies with over 2400 patients found no difference in complication rates between patients taking antibiotics and nonantibiotic usage, with only increasing length of hospital stay without antibiotics. Also, a recent multicenter RCT of systemic antibiotic treatment (1.2 g of amoxicillin clavulanic acid/6 h intravenously for a minimum of 48 h and then switched to oral administration of 625 mg/8 h) versus observation with no antibiotics for a first episode of uncomplicated AD showed that the observational arm was not associated with poorer outcomes.

Recommended antibiotic regimens include ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole, penicillin derivatives such as ampicillin or piperacillin/tazobactam, and third-generation cephalosporin to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. Data do not support intravenous antibiotic treatment over oral treatment, and duration of treatment from 4 days to over 7 days does not seem to have any advantage related to clinical outcomes. It should be emphasized, however, that the choice of antimicrobials is entirely empiric, since no trial has compared the efficacy of the different regimens mentioned above.

### Is piperacillin-tazobactam effective for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms? [^112wumTy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist regarding the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) for the management of nonbacteremic pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter observational study comparing clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized with ESBL-producing pyelonephritis who were receiving TZP versus carbapenems, using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Patients were eligible for inclusion if all of the following criteria were met: (1) urine cultures growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, or Proteus mirabilis at ≥ 50 000 colony-forming units/mL; (2) identification of an ESBL gene; (3) pyuria (≥ 10 white blood cells per high powered field in the urine); and (4) dysuria and fever plus at least 1 of the following symptoms: emesis, rigors, hypotension, or flank pain.

Results

There were 186 patients included in the propensity score-weighted cohort; 45 (24%) received TZP and 141 (76%) received a carbapenem. Of these 186 patients, 27% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 48% were immunocompromised, and 45% had underlying urologic abnormalities. There were no differences between the 2 groups in the proportion of patients (20% vs 25%) with recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis with the same ESBL-producing organism within 30 days (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, .31–1.81; P = 0.52). There were no differences in the resolution of clinical symptoms by Day 7 or in 30-day mortality. There was 1 (2%) patient in the TZP arm and 11 (8%) patients in the carbapenem arm who had incident carbapenem-resistant organisms isolated within 30 days (P = 0.09).

Conclusions

TZP may be a reasonable alternative to carbapenems for the management of ESBL-producing pyelonephritis and may mitigate the risk of emergence of carbapenem-resistant organisms, compared with carbapenem therapy.

### Comparative pharmacodynamics of intermittent and prolonged infusions of piperacillin / tazobactam using monte carlo simulation and steady-state pharmacokinetic data from hospitalized patients [^113CiDae]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

With increasing antibiotic resistance in gram-negative pathogens, dosing strategies that optimize pharmacodynamic parameters of currently available antibiotics play an important role in treatment. The likelihood of success with piperacillin/tazobactam, a widely used broad-spectrum antibiotic, can be manipulated by increasing the amount of time that unbound drug concentrations remain above the pathogen's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). However, this success depends greatly on knowing the MIC value as well as accurately estimating the individual's pharmacokinetic parameters. Clinicians should carefully factor these variables into their decision-making process when considering prolonged infusion strategies with piperacillin/tazobactam.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^113nXuxT]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Nonfermenters

For nonfermenters such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fluoroquinolones are not recommended as initial treatment after debridement because of the high rate of resistance that can develop. Although the bactericidal action of beta-lactams appears inferior to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactam antibiotics such as piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, or a carbapenem (except ertapenem) should be used as the initial therapy. There is some in vitro evidence of a decrease in the rate of bacterial killing with a high inoculum, and so, the addition of an aminoglycoside for 2–5 days can be considered.

If P. aeruginosa is resistant to fluoroquinolones, there are no other suitable oral agents and beta-lactams need to be continued intravenously according to susceptibility testing.

Pseudomonas spp. and other nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter spp. may be multiresistant but sensitive to colistin. Colistin should be used in combination therapy with careful monitoring of renal function and trough serum dosages, as it is associated with a high risk of nephrotoxicity. Tigecycline may be an alternative for some organisms, but not for P. aeruginosa because of intrinsic resistance to the agent. Expert microbiology advice should be sought for any of these infections.

Treatment of Anaerobes

In the group of Gram-positive anaerobes, Cutibacterium (previously Propionibacterium) acnes is most frequently isolated). Cutibacterium acnes is highly susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics except metronidazole; however, resistance is emerging against macrolides, clindamycin, doxycycline, or minocycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. – In biofilm-related infections, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin are less effective, while rifampicin, daptomycin, and ceftriaxone have demonstrated biofilm activity in animal models. In combination, rifampicin and levofloxacin show good efficacy. We recommend starting with benzylpenicillin or ceftriaxone, followed by oral treatment of rifampicin in combination with amoxicillin, doxycycline, or quinolones. For other Gram-positive anaerobes (eg, Finegoldia magna, Peptostreptococcus species, and Clostridium species), there are no studies to guide treatment. Penicillin (or ceftriaxone) would be a good initial therapy, and treatment should be guided by speciation, susceptibilities, and microbiological advice.

Gram-negative anaerobes should be treated with IV ampicillin/sulbactam or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid based on availability, followed by oral metronidazole.

### Clinafloxacin versus piperacillin / tazobactam in the treatment of severe skin and soft-tissue infections in adults at a veterans affairs medical center [^113XrCj5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Severe skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs), particularly diabetic foot infections, are a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy may contribute to the increasing emergence of bacterial resistance, as well as to increased health care costs. Thus, there is a continuing search for reasonably safe, well-tolerated, and effective antimicrobial agents that are less susceptible to the development of resistance than older agents.

Objective

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, was I site in a multicenter, Phase III, randomized, investigator-blinded clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of clinafloxacin with those of piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of adult patients with SSTI.

Methods

Over an 18-month period, patients aged ≥ 18 years with physical findings of acute bacterial SSTI requiring hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial therapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clinafloxacin 200 mg IV every 12 hours or piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g IV every 6 hours. After a minimum of 3 days of intravenous therapy, a switch to oral therapy with clinafloxacin 200 mg PO every 12 hours or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg PO every 8 hours could be made in the respective treatment groups.

Results

The center enrolled 84 patients (42 in each group), all but I of whom were male, reflecting the typical VA medical center population. The mean age was 60 years (range, 36–80 years) in the clinafloxacin group and 65 years (range, 35–87) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the latter group was significantly older (P = 0.0482), which could have affected recovery rates. Sixty-six patients were white and 18 were black. The mean (± SD) duration of treatment was 10.69 ± 5.34 days in the clinafloxacin group and 12.07 ± 5.06 days in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the mean length of stay was 10.83 ± 10.28 days and 14.95 ± 19.20 days, respectively. Fifty-three (63%) patients were switched to oral therapy (21 in the clinafloxacin group, 32 in the piperacillin/tazobactam group). The most commonly isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae. Clinical cure rates and microbiologic eradication rates were similar between the 2 treatments. The piperacillin/ tazobactam arm experienced more all-cause adverse events than the clinafloxacin arm, although the difference was not statistically significant. The clinafloxacin arm experienced significantly more adverse events (eg, photosensitivity) that were judged by the investigator to be drug related (P = 0.034).

Conclusions

In this study population of hospitalized adults, clinafloxacin was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of complicated SSTIs. Appropriate precautions must be taken against exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light in patients receiving clinafloxacin, and adequate monitoring is necessary. Further investigation is necessary into how the phototoxic effects of the flu oroquinolones can be limited.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^115dvMVh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship — alternative dosing strategies based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles for hospitalized patients on broad-spectrum β-lactams and vancomycin are addressed as follows: "In hospitalized patients, we suggest ASPs advocate for the use of alternative dosing strategies vs standard dosing for broad-spectrum β-lactams to decrease costs (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)", and "Considering the limited evidence, we cannot give any recommendation about the utility of alternative dosing strategies for vancomycin". For β-lactams, "one meta-analysis showed decreased mortality (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, .41–.83) among patients receiving continuous infusions of carbapenems or piperacillin-tazobactam vs standard infusions", though "This meta-analysis included 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that comprised only 25% of the patient outcomes analyzed". In contrast, "another meta-analysis that included 14 RCTs did not support improved outcomes" and "A Cochrane review [104] and a recent randomized trial [105] in critically ill patients of continuous infusions of β-lactam antibiotics compared with standard intermittent dosing also did not demonstrate benefits in outcome". For vancomycin, "continuous infusion has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in adults but has been associated with decreased nephrotoxicity in a meta-analysis", and in children continuous infusion "has been associated with fewer adverse effects and no nephrotoxicity". Cost data indicate that "Alternative dosing strategies for β-lactam antibiotics [108] and vancomycin [109] were associated with significantly lower costs than intermittent infusions in randomized studies".

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^1136ebsk]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics, community-acquired pyelonephritis, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, piperacillin/tazobactam, or a fluoroquinolone for initial management of patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, using the four-step assessment, rather than carbapenems and newer agents such as novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin, or older aminoglycosides.
Recognize that other agents, such as TMP/SMX, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first- or second-generation cephalosporins, are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of complicated UTI.

Table 5.
Patients With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (≥ 2% of Patients in Any Treatment Group) by System Organ Class and Preferred Term (Population: Safety)

Most common laboratory abnormality TEAEs were increased ALT and AST (Table 5). None of the aminotransferase elevations were symptomatic or treatment-limiting. No patient met Hy's law criteria. All cases exhibiting ALT or AST > 3×ULN were adjudicated by an independent, blinded Transaminase Elevation Adjudication Committee; most ALT/AST elevations were deemed mild and possibly related to the study drug (23 ZTI-01, 5 PIP-TAZ cases).

Hypokalemia occurred in 71/232 (30.6%) ZTI-01 and 29/230 (12.6%) PIP-TAZ patients. Most cases were mild-to-moderate in severity; shifts in potassium levels from normal at baseline to hypokalemia were more frequent in the ZTI-01 group for mild (17.7% vs 11.3%), moderate (11.2% vs 0.9%), and severe (1.7% vs 0.4%) categories of hypokalemia. Hypokalemia was deemed a TEAE in 6.4% ZTI-01 and 1.3% PIP-TAZ, and all cases were transient and asymptomatic (Table 5). Although no significant cardiac AEs were observed, postbaseline QTcF of > 450 to ≤ 480 msec (baseline QTcF of ≤ 450 msec) occurred at a higher frequency in ZTI-01 patients (7.3%) compared with PIP-TAZ (2.5%). In the ZTI-01 arm, these appear to correlate with the hypokalemia associated with IV formulation salt load. Only 1 patient (PIP-TAZ group) had a baseline QTcF of ≤ 500 msec and postbaseline QTcF of > 500 msec.

### Effect of cefepime / enmetazobactam vs piperacillin / tazobactam on clinical cure and microbiological eradication in patients with complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis: a randomized clinical trial [^113ozfZZ]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cefepime/enmetazobactam is a novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination and a potential empirical therapy for resistant gram-negative infections.

Objective

To evaluate whether cefepime/enmetazobactam was noninferior to piperacillin/tazobactam for the primary outcome of treatment efficacy in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) or acute pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, noninferiority clinical trial conducted at 90 sites in Europe, North and Central America, South America, and South Africa. Recruitment occurred between September 24, 2018, and November 2, 2019. Final follow-up occurred November 26, 2019. Participants were adult patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by gram-negative urinary pathogens.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized to receive either cefepime, 2 g/enmetazobactam, 0.5 g (n = 520), or piperacillin, 4 g/tazobactam, 0.5 g (n = 521), by 2-hour infusion every 8 hours for 7 days (up to 14 days in patients with a positive blood culture at baseline).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in the primary analysis set (patients who received any amount of study drug with a baseline gram-negative pathogen not resistant to either treatment and ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL in urine culture or the same pathogen present in concurrent blood and urine cultures) who achieved overall treatment success (defined as clinical cure combined with microbiological eradication [< 103 CFU/mL in urine] of infection). Two-sided 95% CIs were computed using the stratified Newcombe method. The prespecified noninferiority margin was -10%. If noninferiority was established, a superiority comparison was also prespecified.

Results

Among 1041 patients randomized (mean age, 54.7 years; 573 women [55.0%]), 1034 (99.3%) received study drug and 995 (95.6%) completed the trial. Among the primary analysis set, the primary outcome occurred in 79.1% (273/345) of patients receiving cefepime/enmetazobactam compared with 58.9% (196/333) receiving piperacillin/tazobactam (between-group difference, 21.2% [95% CI, 14.3% to 27.9%]). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 50.0% (258/516) of patients treated with cefepime/enmetazobactam and 44.0% (228/518) with piperacillin/tazobactam; most were mild to moderate in severity (89.9% vs 88.6%, respectively). A total of 1.7% (9/516) of participants who received cefepime/enmetazobactam and 0.8% (4/518) of those who received piperacillin/tazobactam did not complete the assigned therapy due to adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by gram-negative pathogens, cefepime/enmetazobactam, compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, met criteria for noninferiority as well as superiority with respect to the primary outcome of clinical cure and microbiological eradication. Further research is needed to determine the potential role for cefepime/enmetazobactam in the treatment of complicated UTI and pyelonephritis.

### Piperacillin sodium (pipracil) [^1151mtfh]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Laboratory Tests

While piperacillin
possesses the characteristic low toxicity of the penicillin group
of antibiotics, periodic assessment of organ system functions, including
renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, during prolonged therapy is advisable.

All patients with gonorrhea
should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis.
Patients treated with piperacillin should have a follow-up serologic
test for syphilis after 3 months.

Drug Interactions

Aminoglycosides

The mixing
of piperacillin with an aminoglycoside in vitro can result in substantial inactivation of the
aminoglycoside.

Vecuronium

When used
in the perioperative period, piperacillin has been implicated in the
prolongation of the neuromuscular blockade of vecuronium. Caution
is indicated when piperacillin is used perioperatively. In one controlled
clinical study, the ureidopenicillins, including piperacillin, were
reported to prolong the action of vecuronium. Due to their similar
mechanism of action, it is expected that the neuromuscular blockade
produced by any of the non-depolarizing muscle relaxants could be
prolonged in the presence of piperacillin.

Probenecid

The oral
combination of probenecid before intramuscular injection of PIPRACIL
produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.

Anticoagulants

Coagulation
parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly
during simultaneous administration of high doses of heparin, oral
anticoagulants, or other drugs that may affect the blood coagulation
system or the thrombocyte function.

Methotrexate

Piperacillin
sodium may reduce the excretion of methotrexate. Therefore, serum
levels of methotrexate should be monitored in patients to avoid drug
toxicity.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

As with other penicillins,
the administration of PIPRACIL may result in a false-positive reaction
for glucose in the urine using a copper-reduction method. It is recommended
that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be
used.

There
have been reports of positive test results using the Bio-Rad Laboratories
Platelia Aspergillus EIA test
in patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam injection who were subsequently
found to be free of Aspergillus infection. Cross-reactions with non- Aspergillus polysaccharides and polyfuranoses with the
Bio-Rad Laboratories Platelia Aspergillus EIA test have been reported.

Therefore, positive test results in patients receiving piperacillin
should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed by other diagnostic
methods.

CONCLUSIONS

In this study, ZTI-01 met the primary objective of NI compared with PIP-TAZ in treatment of hospitalized patients with cUTI/AP. ZTI-01 provides a differentiated MOA with a broad spectrum of activity inclusive of Gram-negative pathogens, including ESBL producing and MDR Enterobacteriaceae.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^116QgqRJ]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics

Most antibiotic regimens were consistent with 2010 and 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Surgical Infection Society (SIS) guidelines for treatment of mild-to-moderate community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. Initial parenteral antibiotic regimens used included a second- or third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. cefmetazole, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone) plus metronidazole (or tinidazole) or single-agent regimens of amoxicillin-clavulanate (or ampicillin-sulbactam), piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem (ertapenem or meropenem). Oral (and alternative parenteral) regimens, started upon hospital discharge, included a fluoroquinolone or an advanced generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Four trials (12%) used intravenous and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (or ampicillin-sulbactam), which are recommended against by IDSA and SIS guidelines. In three pediatric trials, ciprofloxacin was used. One pilot RCT allowed outpatient management facilitated by administration of long-acting ertapenem. Daily-dosed ceftriaxone and metronidazole have also been used. Conservatively managed patients have been shown to experience more, mostly mild, antibiotic-related side effects compared with appendectomy patients.

Total intravenous and oral antibiotic duration ranged from 4 to 15 days. The most common total antibiotic duration was 10 days, which was used in 12 trials (35%).; seven trials (21%) used 7 days. The shortest duration was 4 days, used in four trials (12%).,

Pain Control

Although worsening or persistent pain were criteria for antibiotic nonresponse leading to appendectomy, pain control regimens generally were not specified in published trials, with only six (18%) reporting analgesia, and none describing extent of pain control. Three trials (9%) used a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac, as a scheduled regimen, two (6%) used morphine, and one (3%) an unspecified narcoticas needed, and one (3%) used paracetamol and dextropropoxyphene for outpatients.

### Early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia [^116vT8Jq]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility criteria included hospitalization, age of 18 years or older, growth of gram-negative bacteria on blood culture, and evidence of infection. Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment had to be initiated within 24 hours of the first blood culture. Participants had to be clinically stable within 4 days of the initial blood culture (temperature ≤ 37.8 °C, systolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg, heart rate < 100/min, respiratory rate < 24/min, and peripheral oxygen saturation > 90%), with an available susceptibility report on day 4. Individuals who were immunosuppressed (receiving corticosteroid treatment with ≥ 20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for > 14 days, HIV positive, having received chemotherapy for < 28 days, neutropenia [< 1000 /μL], organ transplant recipient, or receiving biological response modifier therapy), transitioned to hospice care within 4 days of the initial blood culture, had an established uncontrolled focus of infection, or had a blood culture with polymicrobial growth or growth of either Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Brucella, or Fusobacterium species were excluded. Additionally, individuals who ended antibiotic treatment before or on the index date were excluded.

Treatment Strategy and Assignment

Early switch to oral antibiotics was defined as transitioning to oral antibiotic therapy within 4 days of blood culture. Prolonged IV treatment was defined as a minimum of 5 days of IV antibiotic treatment.

The index date was set to 4 days after the initial blood culture, mimicking the time of randomization in the target trial. Participants were allocated into 1 of the 2 treatment groups according to the antibiotic treatment strategy with which their data were compatible at the index date.

Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was defined as initiation of either piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin in combination with gentamicin, mecillinam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, meropenem, ertapenem, or tobramycin. Choice of IV and oral antibiotic agent after availability of the susceptibility report was at the discretion of the treating physician but had to comply with the susceptibility result. Antibiotic treatment had to be maintained for 7 to 14 days.

Follow-Up and Outcomes

Follow-up started at randomization and ended on day 90 or at the time of death, whichever occurred first. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113snNGb]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Zander et al. have recently conducted a prospective observational study to describe the variability of piperacillin (PIP) concentrations and target attainment in a heterogeneous cohort of 60 critically ill patients. An intermittent bolus dosing regimen of piperacillin-tazobactam (PIP-TAZ) was used 4.5 g three times daily (TID) or twice daily (BID), depending on renal function.

As PIP-TAZ is largely renally excreted, it was unsurprising that the investigators found that no patient within the highest quartile of creatinine clearance (CrCl) attained specified pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets (trough concentrations ≥ 22.5 mg/L) on days 1 or 4. These results are consistent with previous data showing that 'augmented renal clearance' (ARC), defined as a CrCl ≥ 130 mL/min, is frequently being associated with subtherapeutic PIP concentrations, even when dosing PIP-TAZ four times daily (QID). Of more interest, however, was that the investigators found that 0% and 55% of patients with a CrCl > 65 mL/min and 30–65 mL/min, respectively, attained the target PIP trough concentrations. This is a very important finding as it highlights that initiating TID PIP-TAZ dosing as a blanket strategy in critically ill patients with 'normal' renal function or even mild to moderate renal impairment will not reliably attain PK/PD targets. In line with these findings, and perhaps reflective of the ongoing challenges with dose optimization in this group of patients, previous work has shown QID dosing of PIP-TAZ to be insufficient in achieving free PIP concentrations that are four times the target minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 50% of the dosing interval (50% f T > 4xMIC), even in patients not displaying ARC. Solutions for target non-attainment of PIP-TAZ in intensive care unit (ICU) patients include use of prolonged infusions and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).

### Effect of piperacillin-tazobactam vs meropenem on 30-day mortality for patients with E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance: a randomized clinical trial [^112BoJV8]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases mediate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Significant infections caused by these strains are usually treated with carbapenems, potentially selecting for carbapenem resistance. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be an effective "carbapenem-sparing" option to treat extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers.

Objectives

To determine whether definitive therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam is noninferior to meropenem (a carbapenem) in patients with bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or K pneumoniae.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Noninferiority, parallel group, randomized clinical trial included hospitalized patients enrolled from 26 sites in 9 countries from February 2014 to July 2017. Adult patients were eligible if they had at least 1 positive blood culture with E coli or Klebsiella spp testing nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone but susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Of 1646 patients screened, 391 were included in the study.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, 4.5 g, every 6 hours (n = 188 participants) or meropenem, 1 g, every 8 hours (n = 191 participants) for a minimum of 4 days, up to a maximum of 14 days, with the total duration determined by the treating clinician.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days after randomization. A noninferiority margin of 5% was used.

Results

Among 379 patients (mean age, 66.5 years; 47.8% women) who were randomized appropriately, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and were included in the primary analysis population, 378 (99.7%) completed the trial and were assessed for the primary outcome. A total of 23 of 187 patients (12.3%) randomized to piperacillin-tazobactam met the primary outcome of mortality at 30 days compared with 7 of 191 (3.7%) randomized to meropenem (risk difference, 8.6% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 14.5%]; P = 0.90 for noninferiority). Effects were consistent in an analysis of the per-protocol population. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 5 of 188 patients (2.7%) in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 3 of 191 (1.6%) in the meropenem group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with E coli or K pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance, definitive treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam compared with meropenem did not result in a noninferior 30-day mortality. These findings do not support use of piperacillin-tazobactam in this setting.

Penicillin–β-lactamase inhibitor combinations — agent-specific guidance and risk stratification are provided: Do not use ampicillin-sulbactam routinely for empiric therapy (Grade 2-B). Do not use IV amoxicillin-clavulanic acid routinely for empiric therapy (Grade 2-B). Consider use of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid as an option for empiric therapy of lower-risk adults and children, if this agent again becomes available (Grade 2-B). Use piperacillin-tazobactam for empiric therapy of adults and children (Grade 1-A), but reserve this agent primarily for higher-risk patients because of its broader-spectrum antimicrobial activity (Grade 2-C).

AOS implementation

Prior to the development of the AOS, no clinical pathways or institutional ID management guidelines existed at our institution. In September 2018, our ASP implemented empiric AOS for pneumonia (community-acquired and hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated), urinary tract infection (UTI), intra-abdominal or gastrointestinal infection, skin and soft-tissue infection, bone and joint infection, meningitis and encephalitis, neutropenic fever, endovascular infection, pelvic infection, and oral cavity or neck infection. Antibiotic selection was based on guidance from IDSA when available, our antibiogram, and hospital formulary. All AOSs were directly incorporated into Epic software (Epic, Verona, WI). To increase visibility and awareness, AOSs were accessible by entering numerous keywords including any antibiotic order (eg, piperacillin-tazobactam) or by keying the word 'antibiotic' into the order queue, which would create a 'pop-up' for the AOS to be selected. Clinicians then selected the infection that they were managing, navigated through subheadings within the infection type, and applied patient-specific factors as appropriate. The AOS included drug names, dose, route, frequency, and suggested duration (ie, not limited to a single dose). Durations could later be truncated or extended as appropriate by the treating clinician. The AOS also incorporated patient-specific factors as appropriate. For example, the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) AOS is subcategorized into those with or without risk factors for multidrug-resistant bacteria, alternative antibiotics for patients with a severe penicillin allergy, and dose adjustments for patients with renal dysfunction (Fig. 1). Antibiotic therapy could subsequently be de-escalated and/or adjusted as needed based on the patient's clinical response and evolving microbiology and ID data.

### The effect of generic market entry on antibiotic prescriptions in the United States [^116zmpCs]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results

Descriptive analysis

We identified 13 antibiotics that met the inclusion criteria (Figs. 1 and 2). Cefuroxime axetil was included despite generic availability of cefuroxime sodium, which comes only as an intravenous (IV) drug, whereas cefuroxime axetil is an oral treatment available for outpatient care. Azithromycin had the highest number of prescriptions — approximately three times greater than any other antibiotic — at the time of generic entry, followed by ciprofloxacin, cefdinir, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, and cefuroxime axetil. For all but two antibiotics (aztreonam and piperacillin/tazobactam), prescriptions almost completely consisted of generic products after generic entry. Aztreonam and piperacillin/tazobactam were, together with cefpodoxime, demeclocyline, and meropenem, the antibiotics with only one or two manufacturers of generic products one year after generic entry (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).

### Ertapenem versus piperacillin / tazobactam for diabetic foot infections (SIDESTEP): prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blinded, multicentre trial [^113MyEiv]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diabetic foot infections are a common and serious problem, yet few randomised trials of adequate quality have compared the efficacy of the various antibiotic regimens available for their treatment. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam for foot infections.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blinded, multicentre trial in adults (n = 586) with diabetes and a foot infection classified as moderate-to-severe and requiring intravenous antibiotics. We assigned patients intravenous ertapenem (1 g daily; n = 295) or piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h; n = 291) given for a minimum of 5 days, after which oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (875/125 mg every 12 h) could be given for up to 23 days. Investigators retained the option to administer vancomycin to patients in either group to ensure adequate coverage for potentially antibiotic resistant Enterococcus spp and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a favourable clinical response (cure or improvement) on the day that intravenous antibiotic was discontinued. Analyses were by an evaluable-patient only approach. This study is registered with, number NCT00229112.

Findings

Of the 576 patients treated, 445 were available for assessment at the end of intravenous therapy. Both baseline characteristics and favourable clinical response rates were similar for the 226 who received ertapenem and the 219 who received piperacillin/tazobactam (94%vs 92%, respectively; between treatment difference 1.9%, 95% CI -2.9 to 6.9). Rates of favourable microbiological responses (eradication rates and clinical outcomes, by pathogen) and adverse events did not differ between groups.

Interpretation

Clinical and microbiological outcomes for patients treated with ertapenem were equivalent to those for patients treated with piperacillin/tazobactam, suggesting that this once-daily antibiotic should be considered for parenteral therapy of diabetic foot infections, when deemed appropriate.

### Safety and efficacy of ceftolozane / tazobactam plus metronidazole versus meropenem from a phase 2, randomized clinical trial in pediatric participants with complicated intra-abdominal infection [^112QoZit]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Participants were stratified and dosed by age group as summarized in Table 1. The selected doses were based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations. Treatment duration was 5–14 days. Optional open-label oral step-down therapy with a protocol-defined standard-of-care regimen was permitted after 3 days (9 doses) of IV therapy. Recommended oral step-down therapy options included β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, second- or third-generation cephalosporins in combination with metronidazole, or quinolones (if ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin were chosen, it was to be used in combination with metronidazole), with choice of therapy guided by culture results and based on local antibacterial susceptibility patterns.

TABLE 1.
Summary of Dosing and Pharmacokinetic Sampling Schedule by Age Cohort

Specimen Collection

Details regarding specimen collection and pathogen characterization are provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1. Briefly, specimens were collected at the beginning of the interventional procedure before debridement, removal or disinfection of the primary infection site. Culture of the intra-abdominal specimen, isolation of pathogen(s), initial identification of pathogen(s) and susceptibility testing were conducted by local laboratories. Isolates were submitted to a central laboratory for identification and evaluation of antibacterial susceptibility profiles using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference testing methodology and quality control recommendations. Isolates that displayed predefined minimum inhibitory concentration criteria were screened for the presence of ESBL-encoding genes.

Assessments and End Points

Clinical and microbiologic assessments were performed at the end of the IV treatment visit, which was scheduled < 24 hours after the last IV dose of therapy, the end of treatment (EOT) visit, which was scheduled < 48 hours after the last dose of oral step-down therapy (if applicable), and the test of cure (TOC) visit, which occurred 7–14 days after the last dose of study treatment. The EOT visit only applied to those participants who were switched to oral step-down therapy.

The primary end points were rates of AEs and changes in laboratory values and vital signs from the first dose of study treatment through the last follow-up visit (21–28 days after the last dose) in all participants of the treated population. Key secondary end points were clinical success rate at the EOT and TOC visits, defined as the proportion of participants who had a clinical response of cure, and per-participant microbiologic success rate at the EOT and TOC visits, defined as the proportion of participants who had microbiologic eradication or presumed eradication (defined in Supplemental Digital Content 1,) of all baseline pathogens.

### Outcomes of extended-infusion piperacillin-tazobactam: a retrospective analysis of critically ill patients [^1133kUsT]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Studies evaluating the outcomes of an extended-infusion (EI) piperacillin-tazobactam dosing strategy in specific cohorts of critically ill patients are lacking. A retrospective, pre-implementation and post-implementation study of 148 critically ill patients was conducted to compare EI and traditional infusion piperacillin-tazobactam. In this retrospective study, the EI piperacillin-tazobactam dosing strategy was associated with improved 30-day mortality. EI piperacillin-tazobactam may be an effective alternative to TI of piperacillin-tazobactam among critically ill patients treated for suspected gram-negative infections.

### Research agenda for antibiotic stewardship within the veterans' health administration, 2024–2028 [^114oKkZ8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute-care settings

The acute-care setting was an early target of VA antibiotic stewardship activities, and studies of several inpatient stewardship interventions have demonstrated tangible improvements in the selection, spectrum, duration, and proper dosing of antibiotic therapy.- Meta-analyses and systemic reviews, including one from the VA Evidence Synthesis Program (ESP), have demonstrated that inpatient stewardship activities can safely improve antibiotic-prescribing and reduce antibiotic resistance. - However, limited evidence is available to inform the staffing and information technology resources essential for the success of hospital-based antibiotic stewardship programs, including how these resources should vary by facility size and complexity. Contributing to this knowledge gap is a lack of detail on resources needed to implement successful interventions that have been described in the literature. Future implementation studies should quantify not only outcomes but also resources needed for implementation in an objective manner, including time, expertise and informatic resources [Question 10].

In hospitals that lack on-site infectious disease (ID) physicians and ID pharmacists, telehealth is a promising tool for stewardship, and the VA has specific expertise in how to use telehealth for this purpose. Strategies to advance the implementation and sustainment of telehealth-supported stewardship activities in resource-limited, acute-care settings are needed [Question 9].

Future studies, preferably randomized-controlled clinical trials, could further inform several targets for acute-care stewardship activities. First, while oral antibiotic therapy is gaining greater acceptance for infections traditionally treated with parenteral therapy (eg, osteomyelitis), there is room to better define the optimal selection and dosing of oral agents [Question 3]. Second, more data on the comparative safety profiles of commonly prescribed antibiotic regimens would be valuable. A recent pragmatic trial comparing cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam may serve as a viable model for future investigations. The VA Cooperative Studies Program research infrastructure and clinical trials networks have demonstrated success in the conduct of point-of-care and pragmatic clinical trials. - Thus, the VA is an ideal setting for pursuing similar pragmatic trials designed to compare different standard-of-care antibiotic options. Third, large clinical trials could help identify specific situations where it is safe to decrease the length of recommended antibiotic therapy for common uncomplicated infections [Question 4]. For example, in cases of pneumonia, tools such as multiple polymerase chain reaction panels could improve identification of viral pneumonia and, in turn, identify patients in whom early discontinuation or avoidance of antibiotics is feasible.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use… [^111mumJi]. stacks.cdc.gov (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal- and periapical-related dental pain and intra-oral swelling Supporting Files 11 2019 By Lockhart, Peter B.; Tampi, Malavika P.; Abt, Elliot;. File Language: English. Details Alternative Title: J Am Dent Assoc Personal Author: Lockhart, Peter B.; Tampi, Malavika P.; Abt, Elliot; Aminoshariae, Anita; Durkin, Michael J.; Fouad, Ashraf F.; Gopal, Prerna; Hatten, Benjamin W.; Kennedy, Erinne; Lang, Melanie S.; Patton, Lauren L.; Paumier, Thomas; Suda, Katie J.; Pilcher, Lauren; Urquhart, Olivia; O'Brien, Kelly K.; Carrasco-Labra, Alonso.

Description: Background: An expert panel convened by the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs and the Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry conducted a systematic review and formulated clinical recommendations for the urgent management of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with or without symptomatic apical periodontitis, pulp necrosis and symptomatic apical periodontitis, or pulp necrosis and localized acute apical abscess using antibiotics, either alone or as adjuncts to definitive, conservative dental treatment in immunocompetent adults. Results: The panel formulated five clinical recommendations and two good practice statements, each specific to the target conditions, for settings where DCDT is and is not immediately available. With likely negligible benefits and potentially large harms, the panel recommended against using antibiotics in the majority of clinical scenarios, irrespective of DCDT availability.

They recommended antibiotics in patients with systemic involvement due to the dental conditions, or when the risk of progression to systemic involvement is high. Conclusion and Practical Implications: Evidence suggests that antibiotics for the target conditions may provide negligible benefits and probably contributes to large harms. The expert panel only suggests antibiotics for target conditions when systemic involvement is present, and immediate DCDT should be prioritized in all cases.

### Personalised antimicrobial susceptibility testing with clinical prediction modelling informs appropriate antibiotic use [^115nDhVP]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Personalised AST did not facilitate more Access oral step-downs

The personalised approach provided at least one susceptible Access category result for patients prescribed a Watch category agent in 386 instances, compared to 618 instances using the standard approach — this difference was mainly due to the presence of gentamicin on the standard panel, an Access agent with a relatively low rate of resistance in this dataset (see Supplementary Data 1). The personalised approach provided susceptible results for Access category agents with oral routes of administration (ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin) for patients on parenteral-only agents (ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, meropenem, ceftazidime, gentamicin, and cefazolin) with a similar frequency to the standard approach (648 cases versus 669).

Safety

The mean (SD) duration of IV treatment was 6.1 (2.7) days and 5.7 (2.2) days in the ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem groups, respectively. Overall mean (SD) treatment duration (both IV and oral step-down) in the mMITT population was comparable in both treatment groups [ceftolozane/tazobactam, 10.2 (2.7) days; meropenem, 10.7 (2.1) days]. A total of 50 (70.4%) and 20 (83.3%) participants transitioned to optional oral step-down therapy in the ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem groups, for a mean (SD) duration of 5.8 (1.72) days and 6.0 (1.5) days, respectively. The most common oral step-down treatments (> 10% in either treatment group) were cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium‚ and cefuroxime; choice of oral step-down therapy was determined at the investigator's discretion.

### Empiric antibiotic regimens in adults with non-ventilator-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116N5oUE]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal empiric antibiotic regimen for non-ventilator-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is uncertain.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of alternative empiric antibiotic regimens in HAP using a network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL from database inception to July 06, 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

RCTs.

Participants

Adults with clinical suspicion of HAP.

Interventions

Any empiric antibiotic regimen vs. another, placebo, or no treatment.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Paired reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using a modified Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Paired reviewers independently extracted data on trial and patient characteristics, antibiotic regimens, and outcomes of interest. We conducted frequentist random-effects network meta-analyses for treatment failure and all-cause mortality and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

Thirty-nine RCTs proved eligible. Thirty RCTs involving 4807 participants found low certainty evidence that piperacillin-tazobactam (RR compared to all cephalosporins: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.42, 1.01) and carbapenems (RR compared to all cephalosporins: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.11) might be among the most effective in reducing treatment failure. The findings were robust to the secondary analysis comparing piperacillin-tazobactam vs. antipseudomonal cephalosporins or antipseudomonal carbapenems vs. antipseudomonal cephalosporins. Eleven RCTs involving 2531 participants found low certainty evidence that ceftazidime and linezolid combination may not be convincingly different from cephalosporin alone in reducing all-cause mortality. Evidence on other antibiotic regimens is very uncertain. Data on other patient-important outcomes including adverse events was sparse, and we did not perform network or pairwise meta-analysis.

Conclusions

For empiric antibiotic therapy of adults with HAP, piperacillin-tazobactam might be among the most effective in reducing treatment failure. Empiric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus coverage may not exert additional benefit in reducing mortality.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — empiric antibiotic regimen trials included 10 randomized trials in adult populations in which at least two-thirds of the patients had HAP rather than VAP; four trials compared carbapenems to piperacillin-tazobactam, five compared a cephalosporin to various alternative antibiotics, and two compared a new antimicrobial (telavancin or tigecycline) to an alternative antibiotic, with analysis of 2 of the 4 carbapenem vs piperacillin-tazobactam trials showing no difference in mortality (RR for carbapenems, 0.94; 95% CI, .66–1.34); the remaining 6 trials could not be pooled and overall no specific antimicrobial regimens demonstrated better outcomes than comparative regimens, except for one trial with important limitations in which the difference may not have been clinically significant.
