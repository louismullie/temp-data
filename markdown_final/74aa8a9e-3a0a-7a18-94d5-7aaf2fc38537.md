## Question

Every bedtime, Juwella reads a book. Three nights ago, she read 15 pages. Two nights ago she read twice that many pages, while last night she read 5 pages more than the previous night. She promised to read the remaining pages of the book tonight. If the book has 100 pages, how many pages will she read tonight?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many pages Juwella will read tonight to finish a 100-page book, given how many pages she read over the previous three nights. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact number of pages read each night. Then, I should verify the total pages read so far. Next, I will subtract that total from 100 to find the remaining pages. Finally, I will double-check my arithmetic to ensure there are no mistakes before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the pages read three nights ago. The problem states she read 15 pages, so that is straightforward and I should not overthink it.

> Wait, let me verify the next night. Two nights ago she read twice as many pages as three nights ago, so that is 2 times 15, which equals 30 pages. I should double-check that multiplication to avoid a careless error, and yes, 2 × 15 = 30.

> I will now examine last night's reading. She read 5 pages more than the previous night, and the previous night was 30 pages, so last night she read 30 + 5 = 35 pages. Hold on, I should verify that addition, and 30 + 5 is indeed 35.

> Next, I should review the total pages read so far. Adding 15 + 30 + 35 gives 80 pages. Let me double-check: 15 + 30 is 45, and 45 + 35 is 80, so the total is correct.

> Now, I need to calculate the remaining pages. The book has 100 pages, and she has read 80, so the remaining pages are 100 − 80 = 20. I should confirm that subtraction, and yes, 100 − 80 equals 20.

> Therefore, Juwella will read 20 pages tonight to finish the book. I should confirm there are no hidden constraints or misinterpretations in the wording, but the sequence is clear and the math checks out, so the answer is 20 pages.

---

Juwella will read **20 pages** tonight to finish the book. Here's the breakdown: three nights ago she read 15 pages, two nights ago she read 30 pages (twice 15), and last night she read 35 pages (30 + 5), totaling 80 pages. With 100 pages in the book, **100 − 80 = 20 pages remain** for tonight.

---

## Pages read over the past three nights

- **Three nights ago**: 15 pages
- **Two nights ago**: 2 × 15 = 30 pages
- **Last night**: 30 + 5 = 35 pages

---

## Total pages read so far

Total pages read = 15 + 30 + 35 = **80 pages**

---

## Pages remaining to be read

Pages remaining = Total pages in the book − Total pages read = 100 − 80 = **20 pages**

---

Therefore, Juwella will read **20 pages tonight** to complete the book.

### How many more nights? Diagnosing and classifying obstructive sleep apnea using multinight home studies [^116bVgBM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sleep duration, the proportion of REM and non-REM sleep, body position, and perceived sleep quality alter from night to night. It is not surprising that sleep disordered breathing varies too. Respiratory events may change across the night with the greatest changes in SaO₂ seen during REM sleep. Obstructive apneas are more pronounced in the supine position, and other anatomical features such as nasal patency and upper airway collapse can fluctuate night to night.

For clinical decision-making, any uncertainty in the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) matters as the diagnosis obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its degree of severity are currently classified by simple cutoff values: mild OSA if AHI is 5–15, moderate OSA if AHI is > 15–30, and severe OSA if AHI is > 30.

Night-to-night variation in AHI is well established. Punjabi and colleagues in a three-night study using a type III sleep apnea test showed 93% of those with a normal study on first night and 87% with severe OSA on first night were correctly identified compared with pooled values obtained over three nights. However, ∼20% of patients with mild or moderate OSA on the first night were misdiagnosed or misclassified. A study based on three nights of home testing using peripheral arterial tonometry showed that 24% of patients were misclassified using one night compared with three nights of data. Variability was partially explained by the duration of time spent supine. Notably, these studies, and those included in a meta-analysis and systematic review, observed night-to-night variation in AHI over a handful of nights with relatively small numbers of subjects.

In this issue of the Journal, Lechat and colleagues (pp.) set out to assess the prevalence of OSA (using a cutoff for diagnosis of AHI ⩾15), and night-to-night variation in AHI over a far longer period than in previous studies, and with a large sample size to understand the impact on diagnostic certainty. This was made feasible by using a contactless noninvasive diagnostic device (Withings Sleep Analyzer) placed under the user's mattress at home. Signals of body movement, respiratory rate, heart rate, snoring, and breathing pauses were used to calculate AHI, total sleep time, bedtime and waketime, and AHI using automated algorithms. Study data were obtained from 67,278 participants who used the device for more than 28 days; average use was very significantly longer than previous studies at 170 nights.

### Medicine in the fourth dimension [^111gHKnR]. Cell Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The importance of circadian biology has rarely been considered in pre-clinical studies, and even more when translating to the bedside. Circadian biology is becoming a critical factor for improving drug efficacy and diminishing drug toxicity. Indeed, there is emerging evidence showing that some drugs are more effective at nighttime than daytime, whereas for others it is the opposite. This suggests that the biology of the target cell will determine how an organ will respond to a drug at a specific time of the day, thus modulating pharmacodynamics. Thus, it is now time that circadian factors become an integral part of translational research.

### Let sleeping patients lie, avoiding unnecessary overnight vitals monitoring using a clinically based deep-learning model [^111bfZ5j]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Each patient visit was comprised of sequences of VS measurements with a minimum length of 8 and a maximum of 42 values (Fig. 1). Any gap in measurements of ≥ 24 h resulted in the truncation of the sequence and creation of a new sequence from VS measurements after the gap. Each night's label was represented by a binary variable derived from the highest risk score of the 8-h period following the corresponding patient history; if any score ≥ 7, the label was positive (1), and negative (0) otherwise.

We split the retrospective data into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets by patient visit, so the sequences drawn from one visit were only included in one of the groups (Fig. 2a). While the prediction period was restricted to the night hours in the validation and test sets, we relaxed this restriction in the training set for data augmentation purposes. The prospective data set evaluation emulated an authentic prospective deployment, whereby the model parameters were fixed and predictions were made in a strict chronological order. We further discarded VS for the nights that the algorithm determined as stable, effectively concealing them from the model and avoiding their usage in predictions for subsequent nights.

### Patient-reported outcomes, postoperative pain and pain relief after day case surgery (POPPY): methodology for a prospective, multicentre observational study [^113XP8vN]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary objectives of the POPPY study were to measure short and longer‐term patient‐reported outcomes (see Table 1) in UK patients having day‐case surgery in relation to recovery, post‐surgical pain and analgesic use. The short‐term aims were to describe the quality of recovery in the first postoperative week and longer‐term aims were to establish the prevalence of chronic post‐surgical pain and persistent postoperative opioid use following day‐case surgery. Secondary objectives were to identify patient, medication, anaesthetic and surgical characteristics associated with poor quality of recovery; to describe the acute pain and analgesic use of patients in the first postoperative week; to estimate patient need for further healthcare support in the first postoperative week; to determine the patient‐reported acceptability of SMS‐prompted follow‐up; to determine the difference in quality of life between those patients with and without chronic post‐surgical pain and how this relates to persistent postoperative opioid use; and to investigate the difficulty in reducing opioid use in patients with persistent postoperative opioid use.

Table 1
Outcome measures and timing of data collection.

Each hospital site selected a 5‐day study period, during a predefined 4‐week timeframe from 15 January to 9 February 2024. All adult patients (aged ≥ 18 y on the day of the operation) undergoing day‐case surgery were screened for eligibility. Patients had to be able to read and understand English; have been booked for day‐case surgery as defined by the National Day Surgery Delivery Pack with an anaesthetist present; and the procedure must have involved ≥ 1 of the following modes of anaesthesia: sedation; regional anaesthesia; neuraxial anaesthesia; or general anaesthesia. We did not study patients with any of the following criteria: no access to a smartphone; lacking capacity for consent; prisoners; undergoing diagnostic and/or minimally invasive procedures (such as radiology, endoscopy or cardiology procedures); procedures related to obstetrics or ophthalmology; currently breast feeding; overnight hospital stay on the day of surgery (this included an unplanned overnight admission to hospital after surgery at day 0 only); and/or did not undergo a surgical procedure, as identified by the local research team on day 0 or day 1. The time‐points for patient responses regarding unplanned admission were taken during day 1 and day 7 postoperative questions.

### The reading, writing, and arithmetic of the medical literature, part 1 [^114Yyjan]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To offer suggestions that will help clinicians improve their scrutiny of the medical literature and apply these suggestions to their own medical writings.

Data Sources

Literature searches began at the National Library of Medicine's online database and were traced to primary sources.

Study Selection

All referenced information in this article was cited from primary sources.

Results

Objective criteria should be used when assessing the quality of clinical research reports and writing accurate, substantive reports. When reading or writing a journal article, authors should ask themselves if it meets the following standards of high quality: Is the topic or problem important and relevant to current practice? Is the stated reason for the study design valid? Is the description of the study methods clear enough to allow for replication by other researchers? What interventions are being compared, and is the comparison reasonable? Is the number of patients in the study sufficient to show a statistically significant difference? Do the study results have clinical relevance? Are new findings described in relation to the literature? Are both positive and negative aspects of the study addressed? Is the existing literature cited sufficiently? Do the results support the conclusions?

Conclusion

Reading and interpreting the medical literature require a set of skills that can be learned. Similarly, good medical writing skills can be developed. Achieving these skills should enhance the clinician's practice of medicine.

### Can user testing of a clinical trial patient information sheet make it fit-for-purpose? – a randomized controlled trial [^111ZRwnr]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Procedure

This phase comprised 3 stages:

1. Testing of the original information sheet. The information was tested using participants who were instructed to imagine receiving treatment for leukemia and being asked to take part in a trial to test different drug treatments. They were posted the sheet so that they received it at least 24 hours before testing and were asked to read it carefully (and note how many minutes it took them to read it). When they attended for testing they were given a chance to read it once more (with the reading time recorded) and were left alone to do so. Then each of the 21 user test questions was put in turn and the participant was asked, first, to find the answer in the sheet and, second, to give their answer and, where required, to explain what the information meant. The interviewer judged if the participant had demonstrated understanding by their answer to each question; any uncertainties in scoring were resolved through later discussion among the interviewers and PK, by using the interview transcript. No upper time limit was placed on answering each question and the interviewer moved on to the next question when the participant provided an answer, or if the participant gave up and requested to move on, or when it became clear that they could not find the answer. After the 21 structured questions participants were asked for their general impressions of the sheet, with particular focus on the appearance, wording, print size, headings and organization of information. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed.

2. Re-wording and re-design of the Information Sheet. Revision of the information was based on three sources: participants' user test questionnaire data and their opinions; good practice in information wording and design; the authors' experience and expertise in information writing and design. Care was taken to retain the original meaning of the information, and no information was removed, except in the case of repetition.

3. Testing of the revised Information Sheet (as per stage (1), followed again by participants' evaluative comments.

Data analysis

Data analysis looked at: the scores for each of the 21 questions to determine how many participants could find and then understand the answer to each question and could at least eight of ten participants do so, to match European Commission legislative thresholds for licensed medicine leaflets; how many participants could answer all of the 21 questions correctly (that is, score a clear round); and participants' evaluative comments after the formal questioning.

### Committee opinion no. 676: health literacy to promote quality of care [^112dpbuh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Health literacy — developing written materials for patients — Develop written materials, keep the messages simple, and limit the number of messages (the general guideline is four main messages). Focus on action with specific recommendations based on behavior (eg, "Take a warm-water bath two times a day"). Use the active voice instead of the passive voice, use familiar language and avoid jargon, and use visual aids, such as drawings or models, for key points. Use at least a 12-point type size to make the messages easy to read and leave plenty of white space around margins and between sections.

### Can patients accurately read a visual analog pain scale? [^115cMfPS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was too determine if patients can accurately read a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. A 100-mm visual analog pain scale designed for patient use was printed on the top page of carbonless copy paper with a perfectly aligned hatched scale on the second (bottom) page. Patients over the age of 18 in acute pain were enrolled in this prospective, descriptive study. Patients were asked demographic questions and to indicate their pain severity with a single mark through the 100-mm scale. Once scored, patients were asked to read the number from the hatched bottom scale. Two physician-raters, blinded to patients' and each other's readings, then scored the VAS. Analysis of physician interrater reliability and correlation of patient and physician readings was performed. One hundred forty-five patients were enrolled. Seventy-nine patients (54.5%) read the VAS exactly as physician-readers. One hundred thirty-eight (95.2%) read their VAS within ± 2 mm of physician readings. Ninety-five percent of patients are able to read a VAS within ± 2 mm of physician readings. The data suggests this instrument could be used by discharged patients in longitudinal pain studies or with help in management of chronic pain.

### The relative efficacy of two brief treatments for sleep problems in young learning disabled (mentally retarded) children: a randomised controlled trial [^111EtXBu]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Settling and night waking problems are particularly prevalent, persistent, and generally considered difficult to treat in children with a learning disability, although intervention trials are few. Scarce resources, however, limit access to proven behavioural treatments.

Aims

To investigate the efficacy of a media based brief behavioural treatment of sleep problems in such children by comparing (1) face-to-face delivered treatment versus control and (2) booklet delivered treatment versus controls.

Methods

The parents of 66 severely learning disabled children aged 2–8 years with settling and/or night waking problems took part in a randomised controlled trial with a wait-list control group. Behavioural treatments were presented either conventionally face-to-face or by means of a 14 page easy to read illustrated booklet. A composite sleep disturbance score was derived from sleep diaries kept by parents.

Results

Both forms of treatment were almost equally effective compared with controls. Two thirds of children who were taking over 30 minutes to settle five or more times per week and waking at night for over 30 minutes four or more times per week improved on average to having such settling or night waking problems for only a few minutes or only once or twice per week (H = 34.174, df = 2, p < 0.001). These improvements were maintained after six months.

Conclusions

Booklet delivered behavioural treatments for sleep problems were as effective as face-to-face treatment for most children in this population.

Jet lag management — general tips state to choose a flight that arrives at a time that gives the traveler the optimal amount of timed light exposure and consider use of a jet lag calculator to personalize recommendations on the timing of bright light, avoidance of light, and administration of melatonin. Additional tips include if possible, adjust sleep time to more closely match the sleep period at the destination for a few days prior to the trip; time activities (e.g., meals, sleep, light exposure) based on the destination time zone; stay hydrated because volume depletion can worsen physical symptoms of jet lag; avoid excess alcohol; avoid sedative medications with long half-lives; maximize natural light exposure at the destination; and avoid lengthy naps during the day at the destination because this will make it more difficult to sleep at night; short naps may improve alertness.

### An update in sleep neurology: the latest bedtime stories [^1124C9uP]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

In the 24/7 modern society, sleep disorders and the role of normal amounts and timing of sleep for health are often neglected by both doctors and their patients. Sleep has been said to be "of the brain, by the brain and for the brain" and the most immediate and obvious consequence of disrupted sleep is impaired brain function. This review will cover some of the recent papers published in both the Journal of Neurology and elsewhere in 2013/2014 that have advanced our knowledge of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders.

Working with professional medical interpreters — definition, access, and best practices — notes that "Medical interpretation is the accurate, complete, and objective transmission of oral messages between healthcare professionals and patients who do not share a language. This can be done in person, by phone, or via video", and that "Working effectively with professionally trained medical interpreters is a skill set required for timely and effective communication that can minimize poor health outcomes". Directives include "Provide patients with professional interpretation services even if they have a friend or family member with them who can help communicate. Never use a child as an interpreter", "Make patients aware of their right to professional medical interpreters free of charge with the assurance of confidentiality in the healthcare encounter", and "Always confirm the language and dialect when arranging for an interpreter". Additional practices are "Prepare for extra time. Interpreted encounters tend to take more time than when the healthcare professional and patient speak the same language. Remember that each statement is uttered twice through interpretation, and clarification may be needed", "Allow interpreters to introduce themselves and explain their role in a brief statement to both patient and provider", and "Consider creating specific resources, like glossaries, to improve cross-cultural communication of standardized health terms through a rigorous translation and cultural validation process".

### How to read a case report (or teaching case of the month) [^1124d8C9]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Case reports are of minor importance in evidence-based medicine but can nonetheless make meaningful contributions to both knowledge and education. Although many traditional medical journals publish fewer case reports in this era of space constraints and preoccupation with Impact Factors, new Internet-based journals are appearing that focus exclusively on reports of individual cases. Given the variability of documentation, objectivity, and interpretation among the case reports now accessible by clinicians and trainees, it is important to be able to read them critically and to use the information they contain appropriately. This article discusses factors to consider in evaluating individual case reports, and provides a practical semi-quantitative scheme for assessing their potential validity and educational value.

### Prevalence of impaired functional reading ability and its association with quality of life, daily activity, mobility and social participation among general older adults in Germany [^112sEYGU]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Functional reading ability

The assessment of the functional reading ability included two tests: (1) Nieden's reading charts for the assessment of cognitive reading ability (composed of reading acuity and reading speed), and (2) finding and reporting a pre- determined entry on a phone book page to assess the reading comprehension. The Nieden reading charts are a well-known instrument in everyday clinical practice. They are not often used for scientific analyses. However, they offer the possibility to measure the cognitive reading ability.

(1) Nieden's reading chart was placed at a reading distance of 40 cm (15.75 in.) on a bookend on a table in front of the participants. The test was carried out under standardized conditions, e.g. defined luminance (160–320 cd/m²) and observation of the accurate seating position during the examination by trained and certified study nurses. The Nieden chart consists of seven different texts. The font size decreases and the word count increases between each text. Text no. 7 (visual acuity 0.32 at 40 cm) is written in the largest font size and has the smallest number of words whereas text no. 1 has the smallest font size (visual acuity 1.25 at 40 cm) with the largest number of words (word count from text no. 7 to text no. 1 respectively: 20, 26, 43, 42, 51, 61, 69). The time limit to read one text was 30 s. The test began with the text in the largest font size. If the participants could successfully read the first text, the next smaller text was uncovered.

(2) Secondly, reading comprehension was tested. One page of the local phone book was presented. The participants had to find the phone number of a defined general practitioner. The entry of name and telephone number was printed in font Arial Narrow in font size 7 pt.

Throughout both examinations the participants were asked to use viewing aids (e.g. reading glasses or lens) in case of refractive correction.

Quality of life

Quality of life was assessed via the German Version of the SF-12 questionnaire, a validated and reliable instrument to measure physical and mental factors of quality of life.

Health communication with refugees, immigrants, and migrants (RIM) communities — interpreter use best practices include to "Position yourself physically to speak directly to the patient, not the interpreter" and "Do not use medical jargon or acronyms". Additional instructions are to "Speak in a clear, normal voice" and "Speak in short simple sentences and pause to give the interpreter time to relay the message accurately", to "Minimize gestures to convey meaning" and "Ask only 1 question at a time, and make sure only 1 person is talking at a time". Further guidance is to "Allow your interpreter to ask for a clarification" when needed and to "Confirm understanding by asking the patient to repeat key information back to you". Practical logistics include that "For phone or video interpretation, it can be helpful to provide brief background information or context" and "If speaking over the phone, using a landline rather than a cellphone will ensure you have a stable connection for the entire appointment", plus "For longer appointments, check in with your interpreter to see if they need a break", and the caution "Do not say anything in the encounter that you do not intend for the patient to hear".

### Sleep and circadian difficulties in schizophrenia: presentations, understanding, and treatment [^112fdqyN]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 5: Little difference in activity between night and day. Sometimes patients are simply getting little pockets of sleep through the day and the night. It might sometimes be on the sofa, in a comfortable chair, or on the bed. Between these times, they are often pottering around the house or watching television. They may sleep during the day to avoid voices or be active at night to avoid other people. There is little variation between what the person does at night and during the day – whether that be activity or sleep. When the person does sleep, the quality is poorer because the best sleep is consolidated at nighttime. Therefore, treatment needs to ensure that days and nights are different. The day must contain activities to help build up tiredness. That way, when the person does go to bed at nighttime, they are ready to sleep. If possible, naps are cut out or shortened (often by scheduling activity). Good anchors for the day – such as a rise-up time, meal times, key activities, and a wind-down routine – should be put in place.

Type 6: Sleeping over 9 or 10 h a night and not feeling refreshed. Excessive sleepiness or hypersomnia occurs in a significant minority of patients with psychosis (Reeve, Sheaves, & Freeman). Oversleeping is not healthy; moreover, it may do nothing to lessen feelings of tiredness, fatigue, or sleepiness. Dreams and nightmares are more likely. It can also prevent people from doing daytime activities. There are two interconnected parts to limit oversleeping and to feel less tired. A good amount of sleep is 7–9 h a night. Therefore, it is best to shorten the period of sleep, at least by an hour or two. This can be done in steps over a period of weeks. A realistic time to get up each day needs to be set and then implemented. Once a regular getting up time is achieved, it can be gradually pushed earlier, typically by half an hour at a time, established over days. Crucially, we need people to get up and be active during the day, irrespective of how tired and groggy they may feel at first. We need a strong rise-up routine and a good reason to get up. Therapy becomes focused on daytime activity.

### Committee opinion no. 676: health literacy to promote quality of care [^116SQXx5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Health literacy definition and determinants — Health literacy is defined as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services they need to make appropriate health decisions". In general literacy is described as having "three components: 1) print literacy (writing and reading), 2) oral literacy (listening and speaking), and 3) numeracy (using and understanding numbers)". The abstract notes multiple contributors to understanding, including "cultural factors, a physician's health knowledge and communication skills, the demands of the situation, the environment in which the health information is being conveyed, and time constraints".

### Development and pilot of an online, personalized risk assessment tool for a breast cancer precision medicine trial [^116Q6vq2]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Assessing tool readability

We used the Readability Test Tool from WebFX to determine the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease and Grade Level. Our goal was to ensure the instructions and curated content of primary pages were at an eighth-grade reading level or below.

Participant risk estimates

We used participant survey data and mammographic density data from the WISDOM Study intake questionnaire to determine a woman's 5- and 10-year risk of developing breast cancer. 5- and 10-year risk calculations used the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) score. We additionally used a patient's genetic testing results (including intermediate-high penetrance genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms) to estimate participant's risk of developing breast cancer via a polygenic risk score. This model has been published previously.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 730: fatigue and patient safety [^111vsrU6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 730 — fatigue and patient safety summarizes sleep-related performance effects and scope notes: The National Sleep Foundation recommends 7–9 hours of sleep per night for an adult, and medical literature has shown that even a single night of missed sleep measurably affects cognitive performance. When adults do not sleep at least 5 hours per night, language and numeric skills, retention of information, short-term memory, and concentration all decrease on standardized testing, and speed of performance may be affected more than accuracy. Sleep deprivation may affect mood to a greater degree than it affects cognitive or motor performance, and there are no current guidelines limiting the volume of deliveries and procedures performed by a single individual or on the length of time he or she may be on call.

This British Association for Psychopharmacology guideline replaces the original version published in 2010, and contains updated information and recommendations. A consensus meeting was held in London in October 2017 attended by recognised experts and advocates in the field. They were asked to provide a review of the literature and identification of the standard of evidence in their area, with an emphasis on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials where available, plus updates on current clinical practice. Each presentation was followed by discussion, aiming to reach consensus where the evidence and/or clinical experience was considered adequate, or otherwise to flag the area as a direction for future research. A draft of the proceedings was circulated to all speakers for comments, which were incorporated into the final statement.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115KLsEd]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnostic testing — repeat polysomnography (PSG) after a negative PSG: We suggest that when the initial polysomnogram is negative and there is still clinical suspicion for OSA, a second polysomnogram be considered for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK). Evidence on apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) night-to-night variability shows a meta-analysis of four studies found a mean difference of 0.14 (95% CI: −0.86 to 2.15), which was not statistically or clinically significant, yet subsets crossed diagnostic/treatment thresholds: using an AHI cutoff of ≥ 5, 9.9% to 25% had an AHI ≤ 5 on the first PSG but an AHI ≥ 5 only on the second; with an AHI cutoff of ≥ 15 or 20, 7.6% and 25% crossed this threshold only on the second, and severity classification changed in 26% to 35% across the two nights. The quality of evidence for night-to-night variability was high; however, the TF downgraded the overall quality of evidence supporting this recommendation to very low. Based on clinical judgment, the TF determined that the benefits of a second PSG outweigh the harms, though the certainty that the benefits outweigh the harms is low, and that the majority of well-informed symptomatic patients would choose a second PSG when the initial PSG is negative.

### How to read a systematic review and meta-analysis and apply the results to patient care: users' guides to the medical literature [^113kHcmU]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical decisions should be based on the totality of the best evidence and not the results of individual studies. When clinicians apply the results of a systematic review or meta-analysis to patient care, they should start by evaluating the credibility of the methods of the systematic review, ie, the extent to which these methods have likely protected against misleading results. Credibility depends on whether the review addressed a sensible clinical question; included an exhaustive literature search; demonstrated reproducibility of the selection and assessment of studies; and presented results in a useful manner. For reviews that are sufficiently credible, clinicians must decide on the degree of confidence in the estimates that the evidence warrants (quality of evidence). Confidence depends on the risk of bias in the body of evidence; the precision and consistency of the results; whether the results directly apply to the patient of interest; and the likelihood of reporting bias. Shared decision making requires understanding of the estimates of magnitude of beneficial and harmful effects, and confidence in those estimates.

### Reading aids for adults with low vision [^111PUvhr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of low-vision rehabilitation is to allow people to resume or to continue to perform daily living tasks, with reading being one of the most important. This is achieved by providing appropriate optical devices and special training in the use of residual-vision and low-vision aids, which range from simple optical magnifiers to high-magnification video magnifiers.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different visual reading aids for adults with low vision.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 12); MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; BIREME LILACS, OpenGrey, the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The date of the search was 17 January 2018.

Selection Criteria

This review includes randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared any device or aid used for reading to another device or aid in people aged 16 or over with low vision as defined by the study investigators. We did not compare low-vision aids with no low-vision aid since it is obviously not possible to measure reading speed, our primary outcome, in people that cannot read ordinary print. We considered reading aids that maximise the person's visual reading capacity, for example by increasing image magnification (optical and electronic magnifiers), augmenting text contrast (coloured filters) or trying to optimise the viewing angle or gaze position (such as prisms). We have not included studies investigating reading aids that allow reading through hearing, such as talking books or screen readers, or through touch, such as Braille-based devices and we did not consider rehabilitation strategies or complex low-vision interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. At least two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcome of the review was reading speed in words per minute. Secondary outcomes included reading duration and acuity, ease and frequency of use, quality of life and adverse outcomes. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 11 small studies with a cross-over design (435 people overall), one study with two parallel arms (37 participants) and one study with three parallel arms (243 participants). These studies took place in the USA (7 studies), the UK (5 studies) and Canada (1 study). Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was the most frequent cause of low vision, with 10 studies reporting 50% or more participants with the condition. Participants were aged 9 to 97 years in these studies, but most were older (the median average age across studies was 71 years). None of the studies were masked; otherwise we largely judged the studies to be at low risk of bias. All studies reported the primary outcome: results for reading speed. None of the studies measured or reported adverse outcomes. Reading speed may be higher with stand-mounted closed circuit television (CCTV) than with optical devices (stand or hand magnifiers) (low-certainty evidence, 2 studies, 92 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that reading duration was longer with the electronic devices and that they were easier to use. Similar results were seen for electronic devices with the camera mounted in a 'mouse'. Mixed results were seen for head-mounted devices with one study of 70 participants finding a mouse-based head-mounted device to be better than an optical device and another study of 20 participants finding optical devices better (low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence from three studies (93 participants) suggested no important differences in reading speed, acuity or ease of use between stand-mounted and head-mounted electronic devices. Similarly, low-certainty evidence from one study of 100 participants suggested no important differences between a 9.7" tablet computer and stand-mounted CCTV in reading speed, with imprecise estimates (other outcomes not reported). Low-certainty evidence showed little difference in reading speed in one study with 100 participants that added electronic portable devices to preferred optical devices. One parallel-arm study in 37 participants found low-certainty evidence of higher reading speed at one month if participants received a CCTV at the initial rehabilitation consultation instead of a standard low-vision aids prescription alone. A parallel-arm study including 243 participants with AMD found no important differences in reading speed, reading acuity and quality of life between prism spectacles and conventional spectacles. One study in 10 people with AMD found that reading speed with several overlay coloured filters was no better and possibly worse than with a clear filter (low-certainty evidence, other outcomes not reported).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence supporting the use of a specific type of electronic or optical device for the most common profiles of low-vision aid users. However, there is some evidence that stand-mounted electronic devices may improve reading speeds compared with optical devices. There is less evidence to support the use of head-mounted or portable electronic devices; however, the technology of electronic devices may have improved since the studies included in this review took place, and modern portable electronic devices have desirable properties such as flexible use of magnification. There is no good evidence to support the use of filters or prism spectacles. Future research should focus on assessing sustained long-term use of each device and the effect of different training programmes on its use, combined with investigation of which patient characteristics predict performance with different devices, including some of the more costly electronic devices.

During a nocturnal dream, the authors discover a strange and unknown country, Absurdistan. Absurdistanis main concern appears to be sleep, whether nocturnal or diurnal, rather than wakefulness. They are fond of sleeping in any form, and devote much time to this activity. The authors follow a guide that shows them all kinds of strange sleep habits and keeps explaining the complex as well as the obvious. As the journey evolves, the explanations turn more and more confusing, becoming also amazingly surrealistic. The dream ends with a welcome wakefulness leaving the authors unsure of which is the waking state and which the dream.

Survey of Important Topics in Sleep and Epilepsy

These participants were surveyed prior to the meeting to determine areas of particular research interest (Figure 1). Mechanisms of sleep pertaining to SUDEP arose as the topic of most common interest. Sleep quality in epilepsy and investigations in leveraging sleep to reduce seizures tied as second. Basic mechanisms of clock function (not necessarily tied to epilepsy) and basic mechanisms of sleep tied as third. Finally, cognition as consequence of sleep problems or treatment side effects on sleep tied as fourth.

Figure 1.
Results of expert panel survey on the "the most two important questions in interactions of sleep, circadian rhythms, and epilepsy".

Furthermore, the panel indicated that interactions between sleep, biological timing, and epilepsy have 3 major questions of clinical relevance summarized below. These areas of potential major impact on patients with epilepsy formed the bulk of the discussion and will be featured in these series of proceedings. In short, the draft benchmarks of future research are summarized below:
Can improvements in sleep or more consistent alignment with circadian rhythms decrease seizure frequency?
Can improvements in sleep directly improve the lives of patients and their caregivers by addressing important comorbidities of epilepsy?
Can the mechanisms inherent in sleep be leveraged to decrease mortality in epilepsy, particularly SUDEP?
In addition to these areas, the participants noted that education about sleep was lacking in among patients, their families, and physicians, and that focus on education was an extremely important "low hanging fruit" to harvest to patients' advantages.

The proceedings, detailed in our series of articles, will focus on each of these areas of clinical relevance.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^117B85Xs]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Initial statin conversations — Box 1 strategies for introducing statins emphasize patient education, respectful inquiry, and language considerations; actions include "Provide clear information about the rationale for statin therapy for that individual patient", "Determine whether the patient prefers 'the big picture' or very detailed information", and "Recognize that repeated information sessions may be indicated, particularly because anxiety at the time of diagnosis might interfere with learning". Additional guidance is to "Include family members/caregivers as appropriate and as per patient preference", "Provide patient education in verbal as well as written formats. Written materials should be prepared with a focus on health literacy (8th grade reading level)", and "Direct patients to trusted websites with accurate information about statins (i.e., www.cardiosmart.org/topics/high-cholesterol and lipid.org/patient-tear-sheets)". Communication supports include "Accept responsibility for patient comprehension. Instead of 'Do you understand this information?' ask 'Am I explaining this clearly?'", "Employ motivational interviewing strategies: Inquire about readiness to begin treatment, acknowledge ambivalence, and facilitate problem solving", "Use open-ended language (rather than yes or no questions) to encourage questions and the disclosure of concerns", and "Employ active listening and incorporate teach-back language: 'In your own words, please describe the medication plan that we talked about during today's visit.

Medication list review

As patients arrive, electronic check‐in triggers the printing of their current medication list, accompanied by plain‐language instructions for patients to (1) review medicines; (2) strike out medicines they are not taking; (3) identify if they are taking the remaining medicines as described by the listed instruction (yes, no, only as needed); (4) identify any concerns for each medicine they would like to discuss with their doctors (none, need refill, side effects, cost, other); and (5) add any medicine (prescription, over‐the‐counter, vitamin or other supplement) that they take regularly that is not included in their medical record. A sample of this sheet is provided in Figure 3. These procedures were field‐tested among 150 patients at the Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation General Medicine health center. Nearly all patients (91%) in the intervention arm receive their medicine list at check‐in, 85% of those receiving lists review them with their physicians, and > 90% have discrepancies identified and removed, with an updated list printed and given to patients at discharge. The 20 physicians whose patients received this intervention gave unanimously positive feedback on the value of this process.

Figure 3.
Example of a medication list review sheet.

Med sheets

We created single‐page, plain‐language medication information sheets with content appropriately sequenced from a patient's perspective (drug name, indication, purpose/benefit, how to take and for how long, when to call your doctor, when to stop taking and call your doctor, important information) and following other health literacy best practices. A sample sheet is shown in Figure 4. These sheets are automatically generated for 125 different common chronic disease medications when prescriptions are ordered or refilled and are distributed to patients at checkout along with an after‐visit summary. Lexile analyses on initial information sheets confirmed that each met a < 8th‐grade readability standard. The original content was initially developed by 2 pharmacists, supported by an environmental scan of existing tools. Patients, physicians, and health literacy experts reviewed the material and guided revision. We also provide an educational folder that details to patients what they should do before, during, and after a medical encounter.

### Patient-reported outcome measures in ophthalmology: too difficult to read? [^114yEmJK]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

FORCAST test

The FORCAST test, initially designed for assessing readability of US military technical reading materials, is considered the most appropriate test for assessing forms, questionnaires and lists because it does not rely on text being in sentence format. Rather, it is calculated taking into account frequency of monosyllabic words in the document. As with Flesch-Kincaid, output is in the form of school grade level.

Gunning-Fog index

The Gunning-Fog indexis calculated from the average sentence length, and the number of polysyllabic words in a document. Its output is in the form of grade level. This measure was included because of its wide previous use in literature on readability of written healthcare materials.

Data analysis

The American Medical Association (AMA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend readability of patient materials should not exceed the reading level equivalent of a child in the sixth-grade (aged 11–12, see table 1).(For context, this is the readability level of J K Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.) Number of PROMs requiring a reading level exceeding this threshold using each readability measure was calculated.

### Practical guide to choosing an appropriate data display [^113YsJNT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The primary objective of graphing research data is to communicate key information visually in a rapid, accurate, and concise way. Graphs might be considered visual take-home lessons of the major point(s) of the manuscript. In choosing a graph, it is tempting to concentrate only on ways of illustrating summary statements characterizing the group(s). However, individual patients are unique, and their characteristics or outcomes may not be predicted by a group summary. Consequently, if possible, graphs should demonstrate individual responses as well as group summaries. "Graphical literacy", "graphical excellence", and "graphical acumen" are achievable with work and collaboration. To produce a well-designed graph, a combination of by-subject detail and overall results should be the goal within the same illustration. The practice gap addressed in this article is that little attention from authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers seems to be paid to graphical literacy. The purpose of this article is to present some practical guidelines for choosing or evaluating more appropriate data displays.

### Optimal strategies to consider when peer reviewing a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1125EX5h]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A tip for peer reviewers

The checklist items covered by PRISMA are relevant to any systematic review, not just those summarizing the benefits and harms of a healthcare intervention, although some adjustments should be considered. For example, assessing the risk of bias is a key concept, but the items used to assess this in a diagnostic review are likely to focus on issues such as the spectrum of patients and the verification of disease status, which differ from reviews of interventions.

The PRISMA Statement includes a lengthy explanation and elaboration document explaining to authors why specific information should be included in the report of a systematic review. This paper can also be helpful for peer reviewers. However, since its publication in 2009, the PRISMA Statement has not yet been updated and peer reviewers should be aware of the new and emerging literature regarding methods and specific content, for both clinical and pre-clinical research. Such knowledge adds to the breadth and depth of a peer review. For example, in 2010, Sampson et al. developed the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) to help reduce errors found in published search strategies, a fundamental step in the systematic review process. Another tip for peer reviewers: it is important to assess whether the authors have indicated if their search strategy underwent any type of peer review and seek clarification if this information cannot be found in the manuscript.

A general suggestion is to keep the peer review report to one, single spaced, double-sided page, which equates to approximately 1000 words, sufficient to provide a thoughtful, meaningful, and concise review. There is little evidence as to whether lengthy peer review is more useful than shorter, more concise reports. Another strong suggestion is to keep the peer review as evidence-based as possible; As a peer reviewer it is important to be as complete and transparent in the feedback to the authors, ideally supporting comments with the best available evidence, whenever possible. For example, if the authors of a systematic review do not appear to have assessed for the risk of bias in the included studies, this is problematic as there is strong evidence that inadequate reporting of randomization can exaggerate the estimates of treatment effect. As a peer reviewer, it is appropriate to ask the authors for clarification as to why they did not assess for risk of bias, providing them with an explanation and including references as to why this is important in the conduct of a systematic review. A final general recommendation is keep personal opinion about the systematic review to a minimum, and to never be rude in any comments to the authors.

Each week, half a million readers access the Journal electronically, and our content is now seen online by about four times as many people as those who see the print edition. This mode of information delivery has expanded tremendously since the Journal first went online in 1996.(1) Not so long ago, electronic publishing was viewed as secondary to print publication, basically as a convenient way to deliver the print version of an article. Today, the electronic presentation of scientific articles has become the version of record, with print becoming only one part of the complete publication, which may include video.

### Committee opinion no. 676: health literacy to promote quality of care [^117VrXUE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Patient tasks and system demands related to health literacy — When "patients encounter the health care system, they are expected to understand and apply verbal information pertaining to consent, diagnosis, medical advice, and treatment; have access to and use various forms of technology, including computers and smartphones; calculate and interpret numerical data; and comprehend graphs and visual information". Furthermore, "patients are expected to articulate accurate information about their symptoms, concerns, and medical history". The report cautions that "The current health care system asks consumers to make sophisticated health-related decisions using information relayed in encounters that often are brief and may not consider the individual's distinct information needs".

### Committee opinion no. 676: health literacy to promote quality of care [^1141dHbF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Patient–physician communication — system actions and clinician practices — Much of the available patient-centered education materials are written at a level of literacy above what would be expected for many adults, and tools and methods accessible to all patients, including those with limited health literacy, should be developed to disseminate health-related information. Personnel at all tiers of the medical system and in all settings where patients interact with that system must learn to communicate with patients in a way that takes into account each individual's unique circumstances and abilities for comprehending health-related information, and understanding the unique capabilities and limitations inherent to each patient will make the information provided more accessible. It probably is most beneficial to tailor oral methods of communication with the assumption of low or limited literacy, each member of the medical team should be equipped with the appropriate training and resources to guide every patient through the health care system with appropriate resources to determine that the patient actually comprehends the information, and interpreters should be used for patients who do not speak fluent English or who prefer to communicate in another language.

### Five million nights: temporal dynamics in human sleep phenotypes [^11377AMX]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, we constructed the nightly sleep features following the steps and naming conventions of Katori et al. For each sleep window, we calculated the wake time and sleep time during the window based on the sleep-wake predictions prior to the sleep window construction steps (before step A from the previous paragraph). These are the WT Long and ST Long features for Wake Time and Sleep Time in a long window (WT Short and ST Short for short windows). These features encode the amount of time spent asleep and the amount of time spent awake during a sleep window. We also calculated the total length of the sleep window and called this feature LW Length or SW Length for Long Window length or Short Window length. All these features are measured in time (hours). These features are typically extracted from sleep-wake time series to analyze sleep disorders. We also calculated the number of sleep windows of each type in a night as a feature, with LW Count and SW Count representing Long Window Count and Short Window Count. Multiple short windows often occur on nights with fractured sleep. We interpreted these features to indirectly represent the number of disruptions (> 60 min of wake) in a night. Finally, we constructed Sleep Percentage, which represents sleep efficiency and was calculated as the total sleep time across all long and short windows divided by the duration of the sleep period, from sleep onset to wake onset. This provided 9 nightly sleep features. We chose these features because Katori et al. had shown that these features effectively diversify a variety of observable sleep phenotypes.

### Daylight saving time: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^116qF8Bf]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Position statement: daylight saving time — conclusions state that existing data support the elimination of seasonal time changes in favor of a fixed, year-round time. Daylight saving time (DST) can cause misalignment of the human circadian biological clock and environmental clock, resulting in significant health and public safety-related consequences. A change to permanent standard time is best aligned with human circadian biology and has the potential to produce beneficial effects for public health and safety.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^1152FgyH]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### A history of visual acuity testing and optotypes [^116no6Be]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

First attempts at visual acuity testing by optotypes

Opticians realized earlier than ophthalmologists, that texts and their distance from the eyes were important for prescribing good glasses. These authors sometimes used a standard text or well-known books, such as the Encyclopédie, with the advice to measure the letter height or use a piece of string to keep the correct distance from the eye. Around 1835, the German ophthalmologist Küchler cut out figures of decreasing size from almanacs and pasted them on cardboard. He soon discovered that e.g. dolls were easier to recognize than guns. The next attempt at a more exact VA determination appeared in 1838 in a case report in which the patient could read Cicero print (4.2 mm) at a distance between 5 inches and 3 feet. Küchler complained in 1844 that even in a file of a single patient, differently sized objects were mentioned to record changes in his VA. A German textbook described in 1843 printed texts, points, crosses, or digits drawn on paper or a blackboard, and colored paper strips or discs for testing VA. Küchler was sentenced in 1836 to 3 years in jail for participating in political riots. After his release, he continued his ophthalmic practice and he might have invented in 1843 the world's first optotypes with different font sizes (Fig. 3) in prison. The accompanying manual included instructions (1) to print the types on white paper smoothly pasted on cardboard, (2) to start testing the poorer eye in daylight falling from the side, and (3) to note essential deviations from the weather, light or temporary body conditions, because of their influence on VA. Küchler's more remarkable insights on optotypes were (a) One should be careful not to confuse the eyesight with refractive power. (b) Choroiditis was one of the eye conditions for which optotypes helped to make a diagnosis (this was before the invention of the ophthalmoscope or slitlamp). (c) There is a large variety of test objects but not every doctor can choose his own object. One would wish that doctors of big nations, and if possible, the whole world would agree on a single test object. (d) For such an object there exist three major conditions. (1) Everybody should be able to understand the test object. (2) The test object should have no other differences but its size and the visual angle under which its extreme rays fall on the lens of the patient. (3) The subsequent objects should have as equal as possible a difference in size compared to the previous and next ones.

### How to read a scientific research paper [^115N32cb]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Reading is the most common way that adults learn. With the exponential growth in information, no one has time to read all they need. Reading original research, although difficult, is rewarding and important for growth. Building on past knowledge, the reader should select papers about which he already holds an opinion. Rather than starting at the beginning, this author suggests approaching a paper by reading the conclusions in the abstract first. The methods should be next reviewed, then the results — first in the abstract, and then the full paper. For efficiency, at each step, reasons should be sought not to read any further in the paper. By using this approach, new knowledge will be obtained and many papers will be evaluated, read, and considered.

### Bedtime dosing of antihypertensive medications: systematic review and consensus statement: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^116NwUQf]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive drug therapy is one of the most efficient medical interventions for preventing disability and death globally. Most of the evidence supporting its benefits has been derived from outcome trials with morning dosing of medications. Accumulating evidence suggests an adverse prognosis associated with night-time hypertension, nondipping blood pressure (BP) profile and morning BP surge, with increased incidence of cardiovascular events during the first few morning hours. These observations provide justification for complete 24-h BP control as being the primary goal of antihypertensive treatment. Bedtime administration of antihypertensive drugs has also been proposed as a potentially more effective treatment strategy than morning administration. This Position Paper by the International Society of Hypertension reviewed the published evidence on the clinical relevance of the diurnal variation in BP and the timing of antihypertensive drug treatment, aiming to provide consensus recommendations for clinical practice. Eight published outcome hypertension studies involved bedtime dosing of antihypertensive drugs, and all had major methodological and/or other flaws and a high risk of bias in testing the impact of bedtime compared to morning treatment. Three ongoing, well designed, prospective, randomized controlled outcome trials are expected to provide high-quality data on the efficacy and safety of evening or bedtime versus morning drug dosing. Until that information is available, preferred use of bedtime drug dosing of antihypertensive drugs should not be routinely recommended in clinical practice. Complete 24-h control of BP should be targeted using readily available, long-acting antihypertensive medications as monotherapy or combinations administered in a single morning dose.

### Morning vs bedtime dosing and nocturnal blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension: the Oman randomized clinical trial [^111dHqnA]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical trial of antihypertensive chronotherapy, bedtime dosing provided better control of nocturnal BP and improved circadian rhythm, without reducing the efficacy on mean daytime or 24-hour BP or increasing the risk of nocturnal hypotension. These findings support the potential advantages of bedtime administration and offer new evidence to guide future research on antihypertensive chronotherapy.

### Use of actigraphy for the evaluation of sleep disorders and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114i9tAu]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the use of actigraphy in adult and pediatric patients with suspected or diagnosed sleep disorders or circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assigned strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using the GRADE process. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians using actigraphy in evaluating patients with sleep disorders and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, and only apply to the use of FDA-approved devices. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength ("Strong" or "Conditional"). A "Strong" recommendation (ie, "We recommend… ") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A "Conditional" recommendation (ie, "We suggest… ") reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific care must be made by the treating clinician and the patient, taking into consideration the individual circumstances of the patient, available treatment options, and resources. We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy to estimate sleep parameters in adult patients with insomnia disorder. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy in the assessment of pediatric patients with insomnia disorder. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy in the assessment of adult patients with circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy in the assessment of pediatric patients with circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy integrated with home sleep apnea test devices to estimate total sleep time during recording (in the absence of alternative objective measurements of total sleep time) in adult patients suspected of sleep-disordered breathing. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy to monitor total sleep time prior to testing with the Multiple Sleep Latency Test in adult and pediatric patients with suspected central disorders of hypersomnolence. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy to estimate total sleep time in adult patients with suspected insufficient sleep syndrome. (Conditional). We recommend that clinicians not use actigraphy in place of electromyography for the diagnosis of periodic limb movement disorder in adult and pediatric patients. (Strong).

### Morning vs bedtime dosing and nocturnal blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension: the Oman randomized clinical trial [^113bVWPa]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Secondary Outcomes

The mean BP values for each group during the study are shown in eFigures 1 and 2 in Supplement 2. At week 12, patients in the bedtime dosing group exhibited significantly greater reductions from baseline in nighttime DBP (−1.4 mm Hg [95% CI, −2.8 to −0.1 mm Hg]), morning SBP (−3.1 mm Hg [95% CI, −5.6 to −0.5 mm Hg]), and morning DBP (−2.7 mm Hg [95% CI, −4.4 to −1.0 mm Hg]) (Figure 3). These findings were consistent in the per-protocol population (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).

At week 12, patients in the bedtime dosing group also demonstrated a better nocturnal SBP control rate (79.0% [244 of 309] vs 69.8% [208 of 298]; P = 0.01), and office SBP control rate (88.7% [274 of 309] vs 82.2% [245 of 298]; P = 0.02) compared with the morning dosing group (Figure 4; eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). In addition, patients in the bedtime dosing group showed a greater decrease in nighttime BP load (eTable 8 in Supplement 2). The proportion of patients without a nocturnal BP decrease less than 10% of the daytime mean BP or with increased nocturnal SBP decreased from 53.3% (196 of 368) to 36.9% (114 of 309) in the bedtime dosing group (P < .001), while there was no significant change in the morning dosing group (decreased from 50.9% [179 of 352] to 45.3% [135 of 298]; P = 0.35) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 2). The 24-hour BP patterns at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention for both groups are shown in eFigure 5 in Supplement 2. Nighttime SBP and morning SBP in the bedtime dosing group were lower compared with the morning dosing group, indicating a significant improvement in BP patterns.

### Permanent standard time is the optimal choice for health and safety: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^112hKDKC]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) position statement — permanent standard time is advocated based on circadian biology and public health, and "the United States should eliminate seasonal time changes in favor of permanent standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology". The statement explains that "the yearly change between standard time and daylight saving time introduces misalignment, which has been associated with risks to physical and mental health and safety, as well as risks to public health", and affirms that "evidence supports the distinct benefits of standard time for health and safety, while also underscoring the potential harms that result from seasonal time changes to and from daylight saving time". Mechanistically, it notes that "the human biological clock is regulated by the timing of light and darkness, which then dictates sleep and wake rhythms", and that "when the solar clock is misaligned with the social clock, desynchronization occurs between the internal circadian rhythm and the social clock", with the evidence "suggesting that evidence best supports the adoption of year-round standard time".

### Morning report: how to do it [^115Y4zi3]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Morning report is an important clinical learning activity in many neurological institutions. A long experience of these meetings allows identification of several components to enhance its success. Meetings are best if brief (one or two cases) and held regularly, preferably daily and early in the working day, with full in-person team engagement. A senior clinician should lead the meeting and commit to a single interpretation, without fear of being wrong. Although the environment is relaxed (refreshments typically provided), it is a working meeting and with the essential focus on the patient rather than the learners. The rich learning experience is greatly enhanced by a subsequent confidential email summary and interpretation of the case(s) sent to all participants.

### Read-right: a "web app" that improves reading speeds in patients with hemianopia [^115TiP7c]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Text reading test

In order to evaluate the effect of the Read-Right therapy we developed a novel, online, timed reading test. Test materials consist of six standardized paragraphs of edited newspaper text 49 words in length, spread over seven lines. Patients initiated a countdown timer and then read the whole of the text, signaling when they had finished with a button press, at which point the timer recorded their reading speed. Each text was followed immediately by a short yes/no question, which varied and was related to the passage just read, to encourage patients to read the whole of the text. At each point in time subjects read three texts (a triplet); times were averaged to produce their reading speed. We averaged two measurements at baseline (two triplets containing all six texts between them) to improve precision. The patients correctly answered the comprehension question with an average 91.5% accuracy. Incorrect trials were not excluded from the analysis.

The 6 texts were garnered from 13 examples read by 114 volunteers using the website. We chose the six with the least within- and between-subject variance. A total of 38 age-matched controls from the pool of 114 (mean = 59.7 years) read the six texts at an average speed of 302 wpm (words per minute; SD = 80). The texts were split into two halves (median split: easier three and harder three) and each triplet consisted of a mix of texts from each side of the median split. The order of presentation of the triplets was pseudo-randomized both within and across subjects according to the following rules: for each consecutive pair of points in time, all six texts were used; two easy or two hard texts were included in each triplet; no two adjacent tests had more than one text in common. This lead to 38 triplet types which were combined in a Latin square design across subjects.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline formats, recommendation wording, and implementation — Each guideline is produced in 4 formats, including a full version detailing methods, evidence, and the link between evidence and recommendations; a NICE version that lists the recommendations; a quick reference guide summarizing recommendations for health care professionals; and an "understanding NICE guidance" version for patients, carers, and the general public. The wording of each recommendation is considered carefully to ensure that it is clear and concise, and recommendations are action-based and attempt to be specific about the intervention and the population to which the recommendation applies; justifications are not normally included because they are available in the full version's section describing the link between evidence and recommendations. The guideline development group selects 5 to 10 recommendations as key priorities for implementation; these are not necessarily all "strong" and are chosen as being likely to do at least 1 of the following: result in significant benefits for patients, reduce variation in care and outcomes, lead to more efficient use of National Health Service resources, promote patient choice, or promote more equitable access to health care. The guideline development group also identifies recommendations likely to benefit from implementation support, with criteria including not being part of routine care, requiring changes in service delivery or retraining, needing implementation across several agencies or settings, being potentially contentious, or being difficult to implement. While assessing the evidence and making recommendations for best practice, the group also considers how the recommendations will be implemented, and NICE has set up a team to assist with implementation that helps disseminate guidelines and provides tools to put them into practice.

### Consent documents for oncology trials: does anybody read these things? [^113xonzt]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to assess the readability and length of informed consent documents used in clinical trials in oncology. One hundred seven consent documents from clinical protocols open to accrual at the Emory University Winship Cancer Institute were quantitatively analyzed. These included trials sponsored or organized internally, by commercial interests, and by various cooperative groups. Each form was analyzed using the electronic text version of the consent document approved by the Emory University IRB. Readability software was used to determine the length of each document and 2 measures of readability: The Flesch Reading Ease Score and a grade-level readability estimate using the Gunning Fog Index. The mean length ± SD was 2709 ± 971 words or 10.8 ± 3.8 pages. The mean ± SD Flesch Reading Ease Score was 45.48 ± 5.24. The mean ± SD grade level using the Gunning Fog Index was 11.9 ± 1.53. None of the consent documents were written at or below the 8th-grade reading level; 1.8% were at or below the 9th-grade level; 10.5% were below the 10th-grade level. Results were similar regardless of study sponsor. Consent documents for clinical trials in oncology are lengthy and complex to the point that is unlikely that most patients will be willing to read them or be able to understand the concepts they discuss. IRBs and cooperative group review committees are either unwilling or unable to enforce widely accepted readability standards for the consent document. We discuss the implications of this situation and suggest ways to improve it.
