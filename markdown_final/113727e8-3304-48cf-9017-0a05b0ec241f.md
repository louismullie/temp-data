## Question

Post traumatic headache vs post concussion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the comparison of post-traumatic headache versus post-concussion syndrome, including definitions, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, clinical features, risk factors, prognosis, and management, with explicit reasoning steps and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and nosology. Then, I should verify diagnostic criteria and timing windows. Next, I will examine pathophysiology and whether PTH is a symptom or a syndrome. After that, I will compare clinical features and phenotypes. Then, I should review risk factors and prognostic markers. Next, I will assess prognosis and trajectories. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and highlight key distinctions and overlaps, ensuring I anchor each point to the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate entities. Post-traumatic headache is a secondary headache disorder classified by the International Classification of Headache Disorders as a headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head, with acute onset within 7 days and persistent forms defined by duration beyond 3 months, whereas concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury characterized by transient functional disturbance without structural injury on standard imaging, and post-concussion syndrome denotes a constellation of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms persisting beyond the expected recovery window, typically beyond 3 months, with headache being just one component [^117G7P2i] [^113BGvsE] [^114CunPX] [^1176CJE2] [^1159PyeS].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria and timing windows because this is where misclassification often occurs. For PTH, ICHD-3 requires onset within 7 days of injury or after regaining consciousness or stopping sedating medications, and persistent PTH requires symptoms beyond 3 months. Importantly, the Toronto Concussion Study found 94% of acute PTH began within 24 hours, supporting the 7-day window and even suggesting it could be shortened to 48 hours for precision, whereas PCS lacks a universally accepted definition and is generally a clinical diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out other causes of persistent symptoms beyond about 3 months [^113BGvsE] [^112hV4Qf] [^115tdwt3] [^113RVG42] [^1136pCy9] [^1159PyeS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pathophysiology. I should confirm whether PTH is a symptom within PCS or a distinct entity. PTH is best viewed as a specific symptom or secondary headache disorder that can occur after mTBI, whereas PCS is a broader symptom complex. Mechanistically, PTH reflects impaired descending pain modulation, neurometabolic changes, neuroinflammation, and trigeminal system activation, with imaging studies showing structural and functional differences in pain networks, while PCS likely arises from a heterogeneous mix of neurobiological, psychological, and contextual factors rather than a single pathophysiology [^111RDhiS] [^112K9zb5] [^111tbbYH] [^112Kh7Hi].

> I need to check the clinical features next to avoid overgeneralization. PTH commonly resembles migraine or tension-type headache phenotypes, with frequent photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea, and patients often endorse multiple headache types; importantly, PTH lacks a prototypical quality, location, or trigger profile, underscoring heterogeneity, whereas PCS encompasses headache plus dizziness, balance problems, cognitive complaints, sleep disturbance, and mood symptoms, with substantial overlap that complicates attribution in the acute and subacute phases [^117G7P2i] [^112hV4Qf] [^1176CJE2] [^113JFaAy].

> Let me consider risk factors and modifiers, and I should double-check which predict persistence. For PTH, pre-existing migraine or headache history, female sex, and higher acute symptom burden increase risk of persistence, and a migraine-like PTH phenotype predicts prolonged recovery; for PCS, female sex, prior mental health conditions, early symptom severity, sleep disturbance, and psychosocial stressors are recurrent predictors, though some factors like LOC or PTA inconsistently predict outcomes across studies [^116vPkV2] [^116ZrQUZ] [^116wkJsL] [^116w7NCZ].

> I should confirm prognosis and trajectories to set expectations. Most acute PTH resolves within weeks, but 30–50% persist beyond 3 months in some cohorts, and a migraine-like phenotype is associated with slower recovery; PCS symptoms commonly improve over 1–3 months, yet 10–15% persist beyond 3 months, with a subset experiencing symptoms for years, and persistent symptoms are more likely when multiple domains are involved or when comorbidities are untreated [^115XXnwC] [^116vPkV2] [^112rF3C4] [^113RVG42] [^116w7NCZ].

> Next, I should review management principles and ensure I align with guidelines. For PTH, phenotype-guided care is recommended: treat migraine-like PTH with migraine strategies and tension-type–like PTH with tension-type approaches, limit acute medications to avoid medication overuse, consider preventive therapy if headaches are frequent or disabling, and incorporate nonpharmacologic measures such as sleep hygiene, trigger management, and physical therapy. For PCS, a biopsychosocial, multidisciplinary approach targeting sleep, mood, pain, vestibular/oculomotor, and cognitive contributors is advised, with escalation to neuropsychology or rehabilitation when symptoms persist beyond 30–90 days despite targeted management [^116VGvZj] [^1169VJmy] [^1153WWCq] [^116cxT4s].

> But wait, what if I'm overstating the separateness of these entities? I should verify the key distinctions and overlaps. The key distinction is that PTH is a specific secondary headache diagnosis within the broader post-concussive symptom constellation, whereas PCS is a multifactorial syndrome; the overlap is substantial because headache is the most common PCS symptom and shares features with primary headache disorders, which is why careful phenotyping and exclusion of alternative diagnoses are essential to avoid mislabeling and to guide targeted therapy [^117G7P2i] [^111tbbYH] [^1136pCy9].

> Let me reconsider terminology for a moment, because precision matters for care pathways. Some authors argue that the term "concussion" lacks diagnostic precision and may obscure underlying treatable conditions; in practice, I should confirm TBI severity using standardized criteria and then explicitly diagnose PTH when criteria are met, while simultaneously screening for PCS contributors such as sleep, mood, cervical, vestibular, and cognitive factors to build an individualized plan rather than applying a nonspecific PCS label [^114gkMPC] [^113BGvsE] [^1136pCy9] [^1153WWCq].

> In summary, I need to ensure my clinical framing remains clear: PTH is a common, often heterogeneous secondary headache after mTBI that warrants phenotype-guided acute and preventive strategies, whereas PCS is a broader, multifactorial symptom complex in which headache is one component and that benefits from a multidisciplinary, biopsychosocial approach. Distinguishing these entities enables more accurate prognostication and more effective, targeted interventions [^117G7P2i] [^1153WWCq].

Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is a **secondary headache disorder** that occurs after a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) [^117G7P2i], typically within 7 days of injury [^113BGvsE] and often persisting beyond 3 months in 30–50% of cases [^115XXnwC]. PTH is best understood as a **symptom of concussion** rather than a distinct disease, sharing features with primary headaches but driven by injury-related mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, trigeminal activation, and impaired descending pain modulation [^111RDhiS]. Management is phenotype-guided (migraine-like or tension-type) [^113mwgDU] and emphasizes education, nonpharmacologic care, and judicious use of acute and preventive medications to avoid medication overuse [^116VGvZj] [^1153WWCq].

## Definitions and diagnostic criteria

| **Attribute** | **Post-traumatic headache (pth)** | **Post-concussion syndrome (pcs)** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | PTH is a secondary headache disorder attributed to traumatic injury to the head, classified by the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) as acute (< 3 months) or persistent (≥ 3 months) [^113BGvsE] [^117G7P2i]. | PCS is a constellation of physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep symptoms persisting beyond the expected recovery period after concussion, typically beyond 3 months [^113JFaAy]. |
| Diagnostic criteria | - Headache develops within 7 days after injury or after regaining consciousness or discontinuing medications impairing headache reporting [^113BGvsE] [^11614QxK] <br/> - Acute PTH: resolves within 3 months <br/> - Persistent PTH: lasts ≥ 3 months [^113BGvsE] | - History of concussion <br/> - Multiple symptoms persisting ≥ 3 months, including headache, dizziness, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, and emotional symptoms [^113JFaAy] [^1176CJE2] |

---

## Clinical features and symptomatology

PTH commonly resembles **primary headache disorders**, particularly migraine or tension-type headache, and is often accompanied by photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and dizziness [^113b9fK2] [^112Q9YiY]. PCS encompasses a broader symptom complex, including headache, dizziness, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, and emotional symptoms such as anxiety and depression [^1176CJE2].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

PTH is thought to involve **multiple mechanisms**, including:

- **Neuroinflammation**: Activation of inflammatory pathways following injury [^111RDhiS].
- **Trigeminal activation**: Involvement of the trigeminal sensory system [^111RDhiS].
- **Impaired descending pain modulation**: Alterations in pain processing pathways [^111RDhiS].

PCS involves a **broader range of neurobiological and psychological factors**, including neuroinflammation, axonal injury, and psychological factors such as anxiety and depression [^112Kh7Hi].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

PTH is **highly prevalent** after concussion, occurring in approximately 25–78% of individuals following mTBI [^113b9fK2]. Risk factors for persistent PTH include female sex, pre-existing migraine, psychological factors, and higher initial symptom burden [^115mfNLL] [^111tbbYH]. PCS occurs in approximately 10–15% of individuals following concussion, with similar risk factors identified [^112rF3C4] [^1159PyeS].

---

## Diagnostic approach

PTH diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation, headache history, and **exclusion of other secondary causes** [^112KBEQW]. Imaging is generally not indicated unless **red flags** are present [^114Lbksa]. PCS diagnosis similarly relies on clinical evaluation, **symptom assessment tools**, and exclusion of other causes [^1176CJE2].

---

## Management strategies

PTH management is **phenotype-guided**, with treatment strategies tailored to migraine-like or tension-type-like presentations [^113mwgDU]. Nonpharmacologic interventions include education, sleep hygiene, stress management, and physical therapy [^1153WWCq]. Pharmacologic treatments include acute medications (NSAIDs, triptans) and preventive medications (amitriptyline, topiramate, beta-blockers) [^116VGvZj] [^111iaWDo]. PCS management similarly involves a multidisciplinary approach, addressing physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms through education, cognitive rehabilitation, psychological interventions, and pharmacologic treatments as indicated [^113jAqJW].

---

## Prognosis and recovery

PTH prognosis varies, with many individuals experiencing resolution within months, while others develop **persistent symptoms** lasting years [^115XXnwC]. Recovery is influenced by initial symptom severity, **pre-existing migraine**, psychological factors, and treatment adherence [^116w7NCZ]. PCS similarly has a variable prognosis, with symptoms **persisting beyond 3 months** in a subset of individuals [^113JFaAy].

---

## Controversies and challenges

PTH and PCS share overlapping symptoms and diagnostic criteria, complicating **differentiation and management** [^111tbbYH]. There is a lack of standardized diagnostic criteria and **evidence-based treatment guidelines**, leading to variability in clinical practice [^117G7P2i]. Additionally, psychological and social factors significantly influence symptom persistence and recovery, necessitating a **comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach** [^112rF3C4].

---

Post-traumatic headache is a **common sequela of concussion**, characterized by headache resembling primary headache disorders but driven by injury-related mechanisms. It is best understood as a symptom of concussion rather than a distinct disease, requiring phenotype-guided management and a multidisciplinary approach to address the complex interplay of physical, cognitive, and emotional factors [^117G7P2i].

Head injuries across all age groups represent an extremely common emergency department (ED) presentation. The main focus of initial assessment and management rightly concentrates on the need to exclude significant pathology, that may or may not require neurosurgical intervention. Relatively little focus, however, is given to the potential for development of post-concussion syndrome (PCS), a constellation of symptoms of varying severity, which may bear little correlation to the nature or magnitude of the precipitating insult. This review aims to clarify the aetiology and terminology surrounding PCS and to examine the mechanisms for diagnosing and treating.

### Post-traumatic headaches correlate with migraine symptoms in youth with concussion [^112Q9YiY]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The term "post-traumatic migraine" (PTM) has been used to describe post-traumatic headaches (PTHs) that have associated migraine features, but studies of this relationship are lacking. The objective of the present study was to determine whether PTH correlates strongly with migraine symptoms among youth with concussion.

Methods

Twenty-three symptoms were analyzed from a retrospective cohort of 1953 pediatric patients with concussion. A principal component analysis (PCA) with oblique Promax rotation was conducted to explore underlying symptom relationships in the full cohort and in subcohorts stratified by the presence (n = 414) or absence (n = 1526) of premorbid headache.

Results

The mean patient age was 14.1 years; 63% were male. Headache was the most common postconcussion symptom, acknowledged by 69.4% of patients. When considering the full cohort, the PCA demonstrated clustering of headache with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, dizziness, and neck pain. Similar clustering was present among patients without premorbid headaches. Repeating the analysis in the patients with preconcussion headaches led to elimination of neck pain from the cluster.

Conclusions

PTH correlates strongly with other migraine symptoms among youth with concussion, regardless of premorbid headaches. This clustering of migraine symptoms supports the existence of PTM as a distinct clinical entity in some patients.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for concussion, more specifically with respect to evaluation of prolonged symptoms, LCG 2023 guidelines recommend to recognize that prolonged physical, cognitive, and/or psychological symptoms following concussion can be nonspecific and may overlap. Assess for differential diagnoses carefully and thoroughly, as similar symptoms (headache, pain, fatigue, concentration problems) are common in chronic pain, depression, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, and other medical and psychiatric disorders.

### Rehabilitation of persistent symptoms after concussion [^115t4TYb]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

One of the more challenging aspects beyond acute concussion management occurs when symptoms do not resolve as anticipated over time. The term postconcussion syndrome generally refers to a presentation of multiple ongoing symptoms months to years from injury, typically comprised of physical, cognitive, and emotional complaints such as headaches, poor sleep, poor concentration, dizziness, and irritability. Although individual factors vary, the condition is often regarded as multifactorial. Persistent issues can pose a threat to full community reintegration following concussion and reduce overall quality of life; thus early recognition and treatment are essential to optimize long-term outcomes.

### Post-concussion symptoms rule: derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule for early prediction of persistent symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury [^113oed6d]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), commonly known as concussion, is a frequent problem. The Public Health Agency of Canada recently reported more than 5 million emergency department (ED) visits for head injuries between 2002 and 2017, 70% of which were due to concussions or mTBI. This situation is similar elsewhere; in the United States, approximately 2 million people suffer a mTBI each yearand worldwide, mTBI represents approximately 70–80% of all TBIs. Patients with mTBI often suffer from post-concussion symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and concentration problems, which can impede the return to normal function.

Although post-concussion symptoms are usually transient, prevalence rates of persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) have been reported in between 13 and 62% of patients, depending on diagnostic criteria. Prolonged symptoms lead to time lost from work, social costs, and adverse impact on quality of life. Early interventions, individualized neuropsychological interventions, and interdisciplinary interventions seem to reduce the frequency, intensity, and duration of PPCSand may facilitate the recovery of daily activities and return to work. Unfortunately, predicting long-term mTBI symptoms is challenging in the ED since emergency physicians' diagnostic accuracy for predicting full-recovery or PPCS at 3 months post-injury is no better than chance.

Regarding medical management for concussion, more specifically with respect to management of headache, LCG 2022 guidelines recommend to consider offering acute headache medications to reduce the severity, duration, and disability associated with individual headache attacks. Limit the use of these medications in frequency to minimize the potential for medication overuse headache:

- OTC analgesics (such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, naproxen, effervescent diclofenac), < 15 days/month

- combination of analgesics with caffeine or codeine, < 10 days/month

- triptans for post-traumatic headaches that are migrainous in nature, < 10 days/month.

State of the Science

Severity, sources, and populations

The majority of data classifying TBI focuses on post-concussion symptom predictors and profiles spanning acute through chronic injury. Acute injury was defined for this review as < 2 weeks post-injury. For simplicity, chronic injury includes subacute injury and is defined as any assessment point beyond 2 weeks post-injury. Eight studies focused on the acute phase of injury, whereas 16 focused on chronic indicators. Fourteen studies assessed a range of injury severity, whereas 10 exclusively addressed mild TBI. Some studies noted that missing data precluded authors from categorizing patients based on injury severity.

Population characteristics differed by age and whether participants were civilians, military, or athletes. Ages of participants in the included studies spanned exclusively from pediatric participants, to exclusively adults, to both pediatric and adult populations; the majority of studies described TBI in adults ages ≥ 16 years. Civilian, active military personnel, and/or Veteransas well as participants with sports-specific TBI were assessed in these studies. Data for participants were derived from various sources, including earlier clinical trials, cohort studies, and observational health system data.

Identified phenotypes

Surprisingly, despite the diversity of populations, sources, analyses, and approaches described, the number of subclassifications were relatively consistent throughout the literature, but the interpretation of subtypes and their traits varied. Phenotypes described more than once included: 1) moderately healthy, with mild or transient symptoms, but otherwise broadly similar to controls across most measures; 2) predominantly healthy, but presumed normal, with some persistent conditions, or normal with measurable decline; 3) somatic/functional issues with moderate distress, withdrawal, pain, oculomotor, migraine, cognitive, sleep, or vestibular persistent symptoms; 4) mental health and behavioral concerns indicated by long-term depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), migraine, substance use, and/or affective issues, often associated with higher severity; and 5) a mixed set of traits, drawn from combinations of the above, exhibiting mixed mental health, behavioral, and long-term functional concerns. Notably, within this literature base, no mechanism-driven phenotypes were reported.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^114Yy4vZ]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

In the Toronto Concussion Study, there were significant differences between those with acute headache post-concussion and those without acute headache. Specifically, when compared with those concussion patients who did not experience a new headache in the first week post-concussion, those with acute PTH had significantly higher: (i) number of symptoms and symptom severity scores on the SCAT-3, (ii) psychological disturbances on the Brief Symptom Inventory and (iii) sleep disturbances on the Sleep and Concussion Questionnaire, consistent with previous research on PTH. 21–23

In our study, no significant differences in acute PTH endorsement within the first-week post-injury were found based on injury parameters (self-reported loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia), sex and pre-accident factors including headache frequency, migraine, anxiety or depression.

Upcoming analyses from the Toronto Concussion study will explore the trajectory of recovery from acute PTH, risk factors for development of persistent PTH and characteristics of persistent PTH.

Our study is one of the few to prospectively evaluate acute headache following concussion/mild traumatic brain injury. Lucas and colleagues prospectively enrolled 212 patients with head injuries and assessed PTH prevalence and provided characterization of the headaches. Their study population differed from the Toronto Concussion Study in that patients were recruited from a Level 1 trauma center in Seattle, Washington, the patients were overwhelming male (76%), 58% were injured in vehicle-related crashes (i.e. potentially compensable injuries) and data was collected "usually while hospitalized for observation or other body system injuries". While headache prevalence was documented at week 1, headache characteristics were not documented until the three-month post-injury follow-up. In contrast, our study population sought to exclude individuals with potentially compensable injuries to try to avoid any litigation-bias or other factors that may be unique to the compensable head injury population.

Acute headache attributed to moderate or severe traumatic injury to the head — diagnostic criteria specify that the headache fulfills criteria for 5.1 Acute headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head, and the head injury is associated with at least one of: loss of consciousness for > 30 minutes; Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 13; post-traumatic amnesia lasting > 24 hours; alteration in level of awareness for > 24 hours; or imaging evidence of a traumatic head injury such as skull fracture, intracranial hemorrhage and/or brain contusion. The duration of post-traumatic amnesia is defined as the time between head injury and resumption of normal continuous recall of events.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^115gnaXa]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Limitations of this study include the fact that the inclusion criteria did not specify formal diagnostic criteria for concussion and relied on individual physician diagnosis of concussion. However, it is noteworthy that the ICHD-3 also does not include formal diagnostic criteria for concussion and, indeed, the ICHD-3 criteria only delineate between mild and moderate to severe traumatic injuries to the head. Another limitation of this data is that evaluation of headaches was performed on a weekly basis rather than via daily electronic record; given difficulty tolerating screen use post-concussion, daily symptom recording was not felt to be prudent and it was felt that the initial assessment within 7 days post-injury and the regular weekly follow-up assessments thereafter were sufficient to accurately capture headache characteristics. Baseline pre-injury information was provided by self-report rather than formal chart review potentially negatively impacting evaluation of predictors for the development of acute PTH. Evaluation of acute PTH characteristics was completed by use of questionnaire rather than physician evaluation; it is possible that more precise physician evaluation would have further refined evaluation of headache characteristics and allowed for more precise phenotyping of individuals with tension-type, migraine or cervicogenic; however, as noted above, given the significant potential overlap between symptoms due to concussion and, potentially, whiplash injury, it was not felt that attempted precise characterization of acute PTH phenotypes was appropriate. A small number of patients in the study were lost to follow-up or were discharged from clinic (due to symptom resolution) between 3–12 weeks post injury and it is possible that some of those patients may have gone on to develop the onset of a new headache in a delayed manner; however, the number of such patients was a small percentage of the overall study population and the relationship between concussion and any delayed onset of headache remote from a concussion in an otherwise fully recovered individual would be tenuous. Finally, the current study excluded individuals who sustained injuries that were potentially compensable and, as such, results may not be fully generalizable to those sustaining work-related or motor vehicle related accidents.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^115GfZaf]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Headache questionnaire

The Baseline Headache Questionnaire specifically inquired about (i) the frequency of pre-existing headaches of any type in the year prior to the accident (categorized as none, once every few months, once per month, twice per month, once per week, ≥ 3 times per week); (ii) pre-injury history of chronic headaches (headaches on more than 15 days per month) at any point pre-injury; (iii) pre-injury history of migraine at any time prior to the index accident; (iv) migraine frequency in the year before the index accident (classified as none, once every few months, once per month, twice per month, once per week, ≥ 2–3 times per week); and a family history of migraine.

Participants were asked whether they had developed a headache post-concussion. If yes, then participants were asked (i) when the headache began (i.e. immediately, later the day of the injury, the day after, 2–3 days after, 4–7 days after or more than 1 week after the injury. As this question was repeated at subsequent follow-up visits, more than 1 week after the injury was also an option to select); (ii) the frequency of the headaches; (iii) headache location and relationship to site of injury; (iv) headache characteristics; (v) headache frequency; (vi) headache quality; (vii) number of headache types and their characteristics; (viii) headache intensity: minimum, average and maximum intensity; (ix) associated symptoms; (x) aura symptoms; (xi) precipitating factors; (xii) aggravating factors; and (xiii) alleviating factors.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed on SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, North Carolina, USA) for Windows. Alpha was set at 0.05. Continuous variables were analyzed using descriptive methods and group differences were determined using student's t-test and ANOVA. Categorical variables were analyzed with Chi square contingency tables. All data are reported in accordance with STROBE requirements.

Research ethics

This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at University Health Network, study ID#15–9214. All participants provided written informed consent.

### Post-traumatic headache due to mild traumatic brain injury: current knowledge and future directions [^115XXnwC]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

Post-traumatic headache is one of the most common and persistent symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an update on the diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of post-traumatic headache, and to identify future research priorities.

Methods

This is a narrative review of the literature regarding post-traumatic headache attributed to mild traumatic brain injury.

Results

Onset of post-traumatic headache within 7 days of injury is the only evidence for a causal relationship between the injury and the headache included in the diagnostic criteria. Post-traumatic headache often resolves within the first few days of onset, whereas it persists for at least 3 months in 30–50%. The majority of insights into post-traumatic headache pathophysiology come from pre-clinical animal studies and human imaging studies, which implicate structural, functional, metabolic, and neuroinflammatory mechanisms for post-traumatic headache. There is a paucity of quality evidence for how to best treat post-traumatic headache.

Conclusions

Although meaningful progress has been made in the post-traumatic headache field, priorities for future research are numerous, including the optimization of diagnostic criteria, a greater understanding of post-traumatic headache pathophysiology, identifying mechanisms and predictors for post-traumatic headache persistence, and identifying safe, well-tolerated, effective therapies.

### Posttraumatic headache [^111Ag9pv]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is a commonly occurring and potentially disabling consequence of concussion and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This brief review highlights recent advances in the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of concussion, mTBI, and PTH.

Recent Findings

Current epidemiological studies suggest that previous estimates of concussion and mTBI incidence are grossly underestimated and have also helped to identify specific activities and demographic groups that might be more susceptible. Concussion results in profound metabolic derangements during which the brain is potentially vulnerable to repeat injury and permanent damage. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging have proven to be effective at identifying these abnormalities both acutely and also weeks after symptoms resolution. To date, there have been no randomized, placebo-controlled studies supporting the efficacy of any treatment for PTH and current therapeutic decisions are guided only by expert opinion and current evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of specific primary headache phenotypes, the most commonly occurring of which is migraine.

Summary

Despite numerous advances in the awareness, pathophysiology, and diagnostic workup of concussion, mTBI, and PTH, there is a paucity of evidence-based guidance regarding treatment.

VA/DoD post-acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) cognitive symptom assessment — We suggest that patients with a history of mTBI who report cognitive symptoms that do not resolve within 30–90 days and have been refractory to treatment for associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, headache) be referred as appropriate for a structured cognitive assessment or neuropsychological assessment to determine functional limitations and guide treatment.

### Post-concussion symptoms rule: derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule for early prediction of persistent symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury [^116ZrQUZ]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Prior studies have identified some specific organic and psychogenic factors that seem to be associated with PPCS. The most frequently reported characteristics are sex (female), prior TBI, history of psychiatric disorders, level of education, comorbidities, dizziness in ED, headaches in ED, concomitant injuries, alcohol intoxication, hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT) scan, cervical sprain or strain, and litigation. Some symptoms have also been associated with PPCS during early follow-up: light sensitivity, fatigue, sleep disturbance, severe symptoms on the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ), pain, depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, difficulty concentrating, and abnormal eye movements. It seems that patients who sustained sport-related mTBI may experience less post-concussion symptoms. However, the association with some factors remains controversial with contradictory results in the literature, such as age, loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia, and Glasgow Coma Scale < 15 on arrival in ED. Some biomarkers, combined with clinical factors, may be useful to predict the diagnosis and prognosis of mTBI. It has also been reported that S100ß, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and cleaved-Tau (C-Tau) could be associated with brain damage. However, their ability to predict PPCS is still unclear. Finally, even if other biomarkers like diffusion tensor imagingcould be potentially predictive, they are expensive and difficult to measure among all mTBI patients in the ED.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^11614QxK]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the persistence of continuous headaches in many patients and the clear overlap between symptoms of concussion (i.e. nausea, photo/phonophobia) and symptoms of headache in the acute phase post-injury, it is challenging to accurately characterize individual patients' headache phenotypes as tension-type or migraine and, as such, we chose to describe the acute PTH characteristics noted rather than try to assign primary headache phenotype labels to individual patients.

Our study identified that almost all individuals (94%) with acute PTH experience headache onset the day of the concussion or the following day and only a small minority develop headaches later within the first seven days post-injury. Further, no patients in our study endorsed a new onset acute PTH occurring beyond one-week post-injury. Accordingly, this suggests that the current ICHD-3 interval for headache onset should not be extended beyond seven days. Furthermore, the results raise the spectre of reducing the interval between injury and headache onset to less than seven days to improve diagnostic precision.

Certainly, we have all seen patients who endorse headaches that begin beyond seven days post-injury; however, it is our belief that such headaches should not be considered to be a direct sequelae of the head injury (i.e. meet criteria for acute or persistent headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head). It is important to recognize that there are innumerable precipitants for headache and many of these provocative factors are experienced by individuals following concussion/traumatic brain injury (e.g. adverse psychological reactions to the injury-related circumstances, depressed or anxious mood, acute psychosocial or financial stressors, workplace-related stressors, narcotic medication use for concomitant polytrauma, sleep deprivation, interrupted sleep, altered sleep-wake cycles, etc.). It is highly problematic for the ICHD-3 criteria for headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head to impugn a head injury to be directly causally related to headache onset when the headache begins more than one-week post-injury as inclusion of such individuals in ICHD diagnostic criteria is not substantiated by prospective studies. Further, inclusion of individuals with delayed onset headache is likely to effectively "muddy the waters" leading to heterogeneous patient populations making epidemiologic, clinical and pharmacologic research uninterpretable.

### Post-concussion symptoms rule: derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule for early prediction of persistent symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury [^1159PyeS]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common problem. Depending on diagnostic criteria, 13 to 62% of those patients develop persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS). The main objective of this prospective multi-center study is to derive and validate a clinical decision rule (CDR) for the early prediction of PPCS. Patients aged ≥ 14 years were included if they presented to one of our seven participating emergency departments (EDs) within 24h of an mTBI. Clinical data were collected in the ED, and symptom evolution was assessed at 7, 30 and 90 days post-injury using the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ). The primary outcome was PPCS at 90 days after mTBI. A predictive model called the Post-Concussion Symptoms Rule (PoCS Rule) was developed using the methodological standards for CDR. Of the 1083 analyzed patients (471 and 612 for the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively), 15.6% had PPCS. The final model included the following factors assessed in the ED: age, sex, history of prior TBI or mental health disorder, headache in ED, cervical sprain and hemorrhage on computed tomography. The 7-day follow-up identified additional risk factors: headaches, sleep disturbance, fatigue, sensitivity to light, and RPQ ≥ 21. The PoCS Rule had a sensitivity of 91.4% and 89.6%, a specificity of 53.8% and 44.7% and a negative predictive value of 97.2% and 95.8% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The PoCS Rule will help emergency physicians quickly stratify the risk of PPCS in mTBI patients and better plan post-discharge resources.

### The efficacy of botulinum toxin use in service members and veterans with migraine and post-traumatic headache disorders: a scoping review [^111PSANS]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI), however minor, may result in a host of post-concussion symptoms including headache, fatigue, irritability, and cognitive decline. The headache incidence in this group of polytraumatized populations with TBI is estimated to be as high as 90%, and up to 33% of all service members suffering from mild TBI could require specialist neurology input for headache symptom management. Despite the preventive treatment, 15–53% of this group could experience PTH. Therefore, it is unsurprising to find a high degree of associations between headache and TBI. The constellation of symptoms propagated by TBI forms a component of a syndrome termed the "polytrauma clinical triad", with post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain comprising the other 2 elements of the triad. It is widely reported that the more severe the initial TBI insult, the higher the probability of observing more severe headache symptoms and neurological manifestations in keeping with migraine-like features. The odds of reporting migraine-like symptoms are also significantly higher in subjects who had previously suffered from moderate TBI as opposed to mild TBI.

### A controlled prospective inception cohort study on the post-concussion syndrome outside the medicolegal context [^112hFzps]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

In an earlier historical cohort study on the post-concussion syndrome (PCS) in Lithuania, a country in which there are few confounding factors, the validity of this condition as a disease entity could not be confirmed. In order to register the post-traumatic symptoms, the influence of sociodemographic factors, and the effect of expectation on these symptoms more reliably, we performed a controlled prospective study. Three hundred subjects with concussion were followed up with repeated questionnaires for 1 year. For each study subject, a sex- and age-matched control person with minor non-head injury was identified. These controls received similar questionnaires. Headache both after 3 months and after 1 year did not differ significantly between the head-injured participants and the non-head-injured controls. Several other symptoms attributed to PCS did not differ significantly between the groups after 3 months. After 1 year the vast majority of symptoms did not differ significantly. Exceptions were slightly significant differences concerning memory problems, concentration problems, dizziness and tiredness. These differences were insignificant when analysing symptoms in unmarried and/or people with lower education, separately. No relationship between cognitive dysfunction and the severity of concussion was found. Although the possibility of a mild organic brain injury cannot be completely ruled out, our results cast doubt on the validity of PCS as a useful clinical entity, at least for head injuries with loss of consciousness for < 15 min. Sociodemographic factors and expectation seem to influence reporting of symptoms after concussion.

### Heterogeneity of persisting symptoms after sport-related concussion (SRC): exploring symptom subtypes and patient subgroups [^111Phqtq]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, 50–60 million people suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year, among which the majority (60–95%) have mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Sports injuries are among the most common causes (24–29%) of concussion. Although the majority of patients with a concussion recover within 10–14 days, 10–15% of patients suffer from persisting symptoms (i.e. for more than 1 month). Sport-related concussions (SRCs) show great heterogeneity in terms of the emergence, evolution and recovery of symptoms and functional impairments over time. To date, the sources of this variability are largely unknown and a general effective treatment for SRC is missing, which might be due to the heterogenetic nature of SRC. Moreover, prominent differences between patients challenge the development and application of clinical SRC management. Better understanding of the heterogeneity in SRC symptoms could importantly contribute to the development of more targeted and personalized care.

In recent research, the variability in SRC symptomatology has spurred a search into possible symptom subtypes of concussion. Early descriptions of SRC subtypes based on clinical observation have recently been revised into consensus-driven descriptions of symptom subtypes in the acute timeframe after concussion (0–3 days post-injury), for which support was subsequently found in meta-analytic evidence. In a meta-cluster analysis, we recently provided further support for delineation of SRC symptoms into subtypes within the typical course of SRC recovery (within 1 month post-injury). More specifically, the existing literature provides evidence for the existence of at least five symptom subtypes that are characterized by (i) migraine symptoms; (ii) cognitive and emotional symptoms (iii); cognitive and sleep symptoms; (iv) neurological symptoms; and (v) undefined feelings (i.e. "don't feel right" and confusion). The literature also provides evidence for relations between symptom subtypes and clinical outcomes. More specifically, symptoms relating to the migraine subtype were most strongly related to aspects of clinical outcome (e.g. prolonged recovery and cognitive deficits). Symptom subtyping may be informative with regard to the underlying cause(s) and prognosis of SRC, and may be useful to define optimal combinations of interventions in SRC management. Unfortunately, there is no research on the classification of symptom subtypes beyond the typical course of recovery, while targeted SRC management may be considered particularly crucial for the group of patients with persistent symptoms after SRC, where considerable negative impact on daily life and participation is at stake.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^111vFLjU]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participants

All participants were recruited from the Hull-Ellis Concussion and Research Clinic ("the Clinic") at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute of the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada between January 2016 and December 2018. All participants were referred from surrounding university-affiliated emergency departments (ED) with a diagnosis of concussion. Given the wide array of diagnostic criteria proposed for concussion (e.g. Berlin Consensus on Concussion in Sports, Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation Concussion Guidelines), the diagnosis of concussion was left to the expert clinical judgment of the assessing ED physician. Participants were seen for an initial consultation at the Clinic, and after agreeing to participate in the study provided written informed consent within 7 days of their injury.

Inclusion criteria included: aged between 17–85 years; physician diagnosis of concussion; Glasgow Coma Scale of 13–15; CT scan imaging negative or deemed unnecessary using a validated clinical decision rule; not admitted to hospital post-injury; deemed medically stable by clinic physicians; ability to be seen in clinic within 7 days of the injury and attend regular clinic visits; and able to comprehend English and complete questionnaires/measures in English. Participants were excluded if they had a third-party insurance claim-eligible mechanism of injury (i.e. workplace accident or motor vehicle collision); were symptomatic from a previous concussion that occurred < 3 months ago; were unwilling or unable to comply with the trial follow-up requirements; or unable to provide informed consent.

Research clinic assessments

Participants attending their first visit in the Hull-Ellis Clinic were invited to enroll in the Toronto Concussion Study. At baseline, participants underwent multiple assessments: a patient questionnaire that included demographic information, injury information, and prior health status; a Baseline Headache Questionnaire (assessing pre-injury headache history and initial post-injury headaches); a computerized version of the SCAT-3 symptom checklist; The Sleep and Concussion Questionnaire (SCQ) (which is a Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) that describes and quantifies changes in sleep and wakefulness in response to brain injury), and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) psychological symptom questionnaire (administered at the week 2 visit). Participants also underwent neurocognitive testing and a physical examination by the treating physician. Patients were subsequently evaluated weekly for the first eight weeks after their injury followed by visits at week 12 and week 16. Data from follow-up visits were analyzed to assess for headache recovery trajectory and risk factors for persistence and will be presented in separate publications from the Toronto Concussion Study.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of vestibular migraine and the vestibular disorders it mimics [^113JFaAy]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Post-Concussive Syndrome

Concussion is an acceleration-deceleration injury, and is a term often used to describe a mild form of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The symptoms of concussion may include headache, cognitive or emotional symptoms, sleep disturbance, and an initial loss of consciousness (LOC) or amnesia. Symptoms typically resolved within 2 weeks, but symptoms that persist past 2 weeks are classified as the post-concussive syndrome (PCS), while the persistent post-concussive syndrome (persistent PCS) describes symptoms lasting longer than 3 months. For the remainder of this manuscript, we will refer to both post-concussive syndrome and persistent post-concussive syndrome as PCS. While headache is the most common complaint of PCS, dizziness is the second most common complaint. Patient with PCS commonly also experience photophobia, phonophobia, visual focusing issues, and fatigue.

Dizziness due to PCS is typically described as either a continuous or episodic swaying or rocking sensation and it may be worse with movement or complex visual or overstimulating sensory cues. The most common ocular motor abnormality in patients with concussion is convergence insufficiency in around 40% of patients, abnormal smooth pursuit in 40%, and accommodative dysfunction in around 20% of patients, although the ocular motor examination is often normal.

Treatment of PCS is variable, however a randomized controlled trial confirmed that early vestibular rehabilitation for post-concussive dizziness accelerates recovery. Although there is a lack of randomized controlled trials for pharmacologic therapy targeting dizziness after concussion, trials have demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in headaches and the post-concussion symptom scale (PCSS) score with either gabapentin or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). While the PCSS does include dizziness, this scoring system groups together nausea, vomiting, balance problems, photophobia, phonophobia, fatigue, tingling, and a variety of cognitive, sleep related, and emotional symptoms with it. Therefore, the specificity of these medications' effects on dizziness in PCS remains uncertain. While there is evidence from animal studies that CGRP inhibitors may be effective for post-traumatic headaches, it is unclear whether this is also true in humans, and its generalizability to post-concussive dizziness remains uncertain.

### Survey of child neurologists on management of pediatric post-traumatic headache [^117KTch8]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury causes significant morbidity in youth, and headache is the most common postconcussive symptom. No established guidelines exist for pediatric post-traumatic headache management. We aimed to characterize common clinical practices of child neurologists. Of 95 practitioners who completed our survey, most evaluate < 50 pediatric concussion patients per year, and 38.9% of practitioners consistently use International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria to diagnose post-traumatic headache. Most recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as abortive therapy, though timing after injury and frequency of use varies, as does the time when providers begin prophylactic medications. Amitriptyline, topiramate, and vitamins/supplements are most commonly used for prophylaxis. Approach to rest and return to activities varies; one-third recommend rest for 1 to 3 days and then progressive return, consistent with current best practice. With no established guidelines for pediatric post-traumatic headache management, it is not surprising that practices vary considerably. Further studies are needed to define the best, evidence-based management for pediatric post-traumatic headache.

### Evaluation of posttraumatic headache phenotype and recovery time after youth concussion [^116vPkV2]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are outcomes for posttraumatic headache (PTH) after youth concussion associated with migraine phenotype?

Findings

In this cohort study from the Four Corners Youth Consortium including 281 patients with 286 concussions, PTH with migraine phenotype was associated with prolonged recovery and higher risk of persistent PTH following concussion compared with nonmigraine PTH phenotype or no PTH.

Meaning

These findings suggest that PTH with migraine phenotype may be a marker for more significant injury or deleterious pathophysiology after head injury and could be a target for early intervention to prevent persistent and disabling symptoms following concussion.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^113b9fK2]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Headache — post-traumatic headache (PTH) background indicates that PTH are very common, occurring in 25–78% of individuals following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). They are more frequent in individuals with mild versus moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), including having a negative correlation between the duration of unconsciousness and incidence of headache in moderate to severe TBI. Posttraumatic headache most frequently resembles tension-type or migraine headaches and can be exacerbated by even very mild physical or mental exertion, and for detailed analysis and management guidance see the VA/DoD CPG for the Primary Care Management of Headache (2019).

### Headache complexity (number of symptom features) differentiates post-traumatic from non-traumatic headaches [^116AvBE7]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-traumatic headaches are a common sequela of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion). It is unclear whether or how these headaches differ phenotypically from primary headaches.

Objective

Determine whether there is an overarching unobserved latent trait that drives the expression of observed features of post-traumatic headache and other headaches.

Methods

Data from this post-hoc analysis come from the Warrior Strong Cohort Study conducted from 2010 through 2015. Approximately 25,000 soldiers were screened for concussion history at routine post-deployment health assessments. A random sample was invited to participate, enrolling 1567. Twelve observed headache phenotypic features were used to measure "headache complexity", the latent trait of clinical interest, using single factor confirmatory factor analysis. We compared headache complexity between groups and determined whether headache complexity predicted accessing medical care for headache.

Results

Of 1094 soldiers with headaches, 198 were classified as having post-traumatic headache. These headaches were compared to those in the other soldiers (647 without concussion history and 249 with concussion history). Soldiers with post-traumatic headache had greater endorsement of all 12 headache features compared to the soldiers with non-concussive headaches. The confirmatory factor analysis showed good model fit (χ²(51) = 95.59, p = 0.0002, RMSEA = 0.03, comparative fit index = 0.99, and Tucker-Lewis index = 0.99), providing empirical support for the headache complexity construct. Soldier groups differed in their mean headache complexity level (p < 0.001) such that post-traumatic headache soldiers had greater headache complexity compared to non-concussed soldiers (standardized mean difference = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.72–1.09, p < 0.001 and to concussed soldiers with coincidental headaches standardized mean difference = 0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.53–0.96, p < 0.001). Increasing headache complexity predicted medical encounters for headache (odds ratio = 1.87, 95% confidence interval: 1.49–2.35, p < 0.001) and migraine (odds ratio = 3.74, 95% confidence interval: 2.33–5.98, p < 0.001) during the year following deployment. Conclusions and relevance: The current study provided support for a single latent trait, characterized by observed headache symptoms, that differentiates between concussive and non-concussive headaches and predicts use of medical care for headache. The single trait confirmatory factor analysis suggests that post-traumatic headaches differ from non-concussive headaches by severity more than kind, based on the symptoms assessed.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of pharmacological preventive treatment for persistent post-traumatic headache attributed to mild traumatic brain injury [^113mwgDU]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Persistent headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head is divided into two subtypes, one attributed to moderate or severe traumatic injury and another attributed to mild traumatic injury (i.e., concussion). The latter is much more prevalent, in part because more than 90% of cases with traumatic brain injury are classified as mild. The pathophysiology of persistent post-traumatic headache is poorly understood and the underlying mechanisms are likely multifactorial. There is currently no approved treatment specifically for persistent post-traumatic headache, and management strategies rely on medications used for migraine or tension-type headache. Therefore, high-quality trials are urgently needed to support clinical decision-making and optimize management strategies. International guidelines can facilitate appropriate trial design and ensure the acquisition of high-quality data evaluating the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of available and novel pharmacological therapies for the preventive treatment of persistent post-traumatic headache.

Methods

The development of this guideline was based on a literature review of available studies in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, along with a review of previously published guidelines for controlled trials of preventive treatment for episodic and chronic migraine. The identified literature was critically appraised, and due to the scarcity of scientific evidence, recommendations were primarily based on the consensus of experts in the field.

Objective

To provide guidelines for designing state-of-the-art controlled clinical trials aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of preventive treatments for persistent post-traumatic headache attributed to mild traumatic brain injury.

### A comprehensive approach to the assessment and management of posttraumatic headache [^115nwrDs]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is the most common symptom seen in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). PTH most commonly resembles migraine or tension-type headache, but it is a unique entity that is challenging to treat. Co-occurring symptoms of mTBI or persistent postconcussive symptoms and comorbidities can increase the risk for persistent PTH. At this time, the pharmacologic management of PTH is largely based on PTH phenotype, but there is no high-quality research to support this practice. This review explores the current evidence for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of PTH and proposes a multidisciplinary approach rooted in the principles of mTBI treatment.

### Post-traumatic headache attributed to traumatic brain injury: classification, clinical characteristics, and treatment [^117G7P2i]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Post-traumatic headache is a common sequela of traumatic brain injury and is classified as a secondary headache disorder. In the past 10 years, considerable progress has been made to better understand the clinical features of this disorder, generating momentum to identify effective therapies. Post-traumatic headache is increasingly being recognised as a heterogeneous headache disorder, with patients often classified into subphenotypes that might be more responsive to specific therapies. Such considerations are not accounted for in three iterations of diagnostic criteria published by the International Headache Society. The scarcity of evidence-based approaches has left clinicians to choose therapies on the basis of the primary headache phenotype (eg, migraine and tension-type headache) and that are most compatible with the clinical picture. A concerted effort is needed to address these shortcomings and should include large prospective cohort studies as well as randomised controlled trials. This approach, in turn, will result in better disease characterisation and availability of evidence-based treatment options.

### Factors related to adverse long-term outcomes after mild traumatic brain injury in children: a scoping review [^113RVG42]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Almost half a million children attend hospital annually after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the UK. More than 90% are mild, although the definition of 'mild' varies, and there is no consensus on severity thresholds based on symptoms and signs. Symptoms of mild TBI (mTBI) can persist for several months (postconcussion syndrome (PCS))in up to one-third of patients. PCS lacks a widely accepted definition, with different criteria used for diagnosis (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition and International Classification of Diseases 10). It presents with subjective physical complaints (eg, headache, dizziness), and cognitive, emotional and behavioural changes. These symptoms can appear early or late after the injury, may become chronic or permanent and negatively impact development and quality of life for affected children.

Research on mTBI pathophysiology has explored links between symptoms and potential individual or environmental factors.mTBI can result in disturbed neurotransmission which, when combined with personal or environmental characteristics, can lead to different types and durations of symptoms post injury (figure 1).

Figure 1
Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and how potential factors may affect symptoms after mTBI. PCS, postconcussion syndrome.

There is no widely accepted, validated prediction tool to identify children at risk of developing long-term sequelae of mTBI. Limited evidence on syndrome characterisation precludes developing interventions for PCS. Knowing who to target would help develop and refine interventions to prevent or treat symptoms and lower morbidity.

In this review, we aimed to identify factors associated with long-term adverse outcomes of mTBI from published research and identify key areas for future research.

Objective

To identify from the literature the demographic, premorbid and injury-related factors, or biomarkers associated with long-term (≥ 3 months) adverse outcomes in children after mTBI.

### CARE4Kids study: endophenotypes of persistent post-concussive symptoms in adolescents: study rationale and protocol [^114hKSr7]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As noted above, the clinical implications of identifying key predictive factors that can lead to PPCS become important to identify early post-injury to reduce or even eliminate undue suffering or disability. Ultimately a definition of the endophenotypes predicting prolonged recovery will provide information for the clinician to activate early surveillance of the patient's recovery profile and the initiation of active treatments to ameliorate the issues. This early definition of the patient's clinical needs will facilitate a more confident and systematic approach to recovery management. The next step, however, is to define the targeted evidence-based treatments through clinical trials. For example, the definition of autonomic factors that contribute to the presence of persisting headaches or neuropsychological factors that underlie post-concussive anxiety provide key areas toward which treatments can be directed early in recovery.

The approach to concussion management has been evolving from nonspecific treatments (rest, exercise, psychoeducation, sleep) to a more tailored strategy based upon the patient's predominant symptoms. This older approach may have contributed to the chronicity of "post-concussion syndrome" and offered little in the way of specific interventions. It also created limitations on the ability to design controlled treatment trials. Subtypes of concussion have begun to be delineated, with the goal of more treatment individualization; however, current subtyping still relies predominantly on subjective self-reported symptoms. Adding objective measures to concussion subtypes, and particularly PPCS subtypes, is hypothesized to lead to more selective treatments and improved prognosis. Other neurological diagnoses have begun examining the concept of combining clinical signs and symptoms with more objective markers of underlying biology to develop endophenotypes or endotypes of post-traumatic epilepsy or neurodegeneration. By obtaining objective neurobiologically-based endophenotypes of those with PPCS, the CARE4Kids study will help elucidate different biological processes that may contribute to persisting symptoms after concussion, and also lay groundwork for more mechanism-based therapeutics for those experiencing long-term suffering and impairments.

### Post traumatic headache (PTH) in a cohort of UK compensation claimants [^114nN2eR]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To explore post traumatic headache characteristics and risk factors in compensation claimants by observational retrospective cohort analysis.

Case Results

Medicolegal reports on 116 consecutive compensation claimants aged 41.9 ± 15.0 years were reviewed 21 ± 14 months after injury. Eighty eight had suffered head and neck injuries, 21 reported only neck injury and seven had "other injuries". Ninety four percent of the head injuries were "mild". The incidence of post traumatic headache following neck injury did not differ from that following head and neck injury, and none of the "other injuries" cases developed post traumatic headache. We anticipated that all head and neck injury claimants would seek compensation for post traumatic headache, but 25% denied developing headache. Post traumatic headache was very strongly correlated with a past history of primary headache (p < 0.0001) but no other risk factors were identified. Post traumatic headache semiology was consistent with "migraine" or "probable migraine" in 90% of cases. Headache resolved in 30% of claimants between 3 and 24 months after injury but 70% continued to suffer headaches at the time of assessment. Forty one percent of claimants had received no treatment for post traumatic headache in primary care.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that post traumatic headache is essentially "migraine" provoked by head or neck concussion. It is not clear why so many post traumatic headache sufferers receive poor or inadequate treatment for this condition.

### Post-traumatic headache: epidemiology and pathophysiological insights [^111RDhiS]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is a highly disabling secondary headache disorder and one of the most common sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion. Considerable overlap exists between PTH and common primary headache disorders. The most common PTH phenotypes are migraine-like headache and tension-type-like headache. A better understanding of the pathophysiological similarities and differences between primary headache disorders and PTH could uncover unique treatment targets for PTH. Although possible underlying mechanisms of PTH have been elucidated, a substantial void remains in our understanding, and further research is needed. In this Review, we describe the evidence from animal and human studies that indicates involvement of several potential mechanisms in the development and persistence of PTH. These mechanisms include impaired descending modulation, neurometabolic changes, neuroinflammation and activation of the trigeminal sensory system. Furthermore, we outline future research directions to establish biomarkers involved in progression from acute to persistent PTH, and we identify potential drug targets to prevent and treat persistent PTH.

### Concussion is confusing us all [^111iaWDo]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Headache

Head injuries often produce headache. The duration is very variable and often does not relate clearly to injury severity. The pathogenesis of post-traumatic headache is poorly understood. Local trauma or muscular injuries presumably account for some headaches but many cases of mild head injury do not produce obvious focal injury. Experimental mild TBI does, however, show similar biochemical changes as that seen in migraine, suggesting a possible pathogenic mechanism to explain the high incidence of post-traumatic headache. Analgesic treatment is effective acutely, using combinations of opiates, paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The need for these medications usually rapidly reduces over the first few weeks. Once the initial period of acute pain has settled (usually within the first 2 months), we advise patients to avoid opiate medication completely and to taper other analgesics to avoid analgesic overuse headache.

It is surprisingly common for headaches to persist for many months after mild TBI. A recent prospective study of more than 200 patients found a 1-year cumulative incidence of 91%, with migraine present in 50%. A reactivation or worsening of migraine frequency is common, and migrainous type headaches sometimes occur de novo. Previous history of migraine, age < 60 years, female sex, and mood disturbance have been associated with more persistent headaches. Tension-type headache and cervicogenic headache are also common.

Given the incidence of headache and the risk of chronic pain, a diagnosis of 'post-concussion' headache is unhelpful, as it is often accompanied by a failure to manage the problem actively. It is unclear whether treatment guidelines can be extrapolated from primary headache disorders. However, in our experience symptomatic migraine treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans can be helpful, and prophylactic medication is often required for frequent headaches with propranolol and amitriptyline both sometimes effective. There is limited clinical trial evidence available, although triptans and topiramate are effective. It is useful to consider the presence of other symptoms when choosing prophylactic treatment. For example, if patients are anxious or require a mood stabiliser, propranolol or sodium valproate may treat the headache and mood problems. In contrast, if there is an element of insomnia then amitriptyline is a sensible choice. Physiotherapy or nerve blocks can help for headaches of cervicogenic origin. From our experience and in a small number of reported cases, greater occipital nerve injections can help to treat post-traumatic headaches, especially if there is localised tenderness.

Posttraumatic headache (PTH) in Veterans and active duty Service members — the incidence of mTBI and concurrent headache in this population is four to five times higher than that in the general U.S. population. The financial impact of the diagnosis and treatment of mTBI in active duty Service members is estimated to range from $95 million to nearly $150 million. Specifically, blast-related headaches have been shown to account for 60% of post-deployment headaches, and 81% of all deployed active duty Service members reporting a concussion also report a headache, and in active duty Service members and Veterans, the diagnosis and treatment of PTH can be complicated by the high prevalence of comorbidities such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cognitive, sleep, and other behavioral health disorders.

Abstract

Background

There is limited prospective data on the prevalence, timing of onset, and characteristics of acute headache following concussion/mild traumatic brain injury.

Methods

Adults diagnosed with concussion (arising from injuries not related to work or motor vehicle accidents) were recruited from emergency departments and seen within one week post injury wherein they completed questionnaires assessing demographic variables, pre-injury headache history, post-injury headache history, and the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT-3) symptom checklist, the Sleep and Concussion Questionnaire (SCQ) and mood/anxiety on the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI).

Results

A total of 302 participants (59% female) were enrolled (mean age 33.6 years) and almost all (92%) endorsed post-traumatic headache (PTH) with 94% endorsing headache onset within 24 hours of injury. Headache location was not correlated with site of injury. Most participants (84%) experienced daily headache. Headache quality was pressure/squeezing in 69% and throbbing/pulsing type in 22%. Associated symptoms included: photophobia (74%), phonophobia (72%) and nausea (55%). SCAT-3 symptom scores, Brief Symptom Inventory and Sleep and Concussion Questionnaire scores were significantly higher in those endorsing acute PTH. No significant differences were found in week 1 acute PTH by sex, history of migraine, pre-injury headache frequency, anxiety, or depression, nor presence/absence of post-traumatic amnesia and self-reported loss of consciousness.

Conclusions

This study highlights the very high incidence of acute PTH following concussion, the timing of onset and characteristics of acute PTH, the associated psychological and sleep disturbances and notes that the current ICHD-3 criteria for headaches attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head are reasonable, the interval between injury and headache onset should not be extended beyond seven days and could, potentially, be shorted to allow for greater diagnostic precision.

### Concussions and their consequences: current diagnosis, management and prevention [^1161pb2o]. CMAJ (2013). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on concussion:

- **Definition**: Concussion is a mTBI induced by direct or indirect biomechanical force transmitted to the head that is characterized by reversible symptoms of dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, and loss of consciousness.
- **Pathophysiology**: Concussion is caused by biomechanical force transmitted to the head in the setting of work environment, motor vehicle crashes, sports and recreation, and falls at home among elderly.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, loss of consciousness, and on occasions malignant brain swelling. Repeated concussions may cause post-traumatic epilepsy, postconcussion syndrome, and delayed post-traumatic brain degeneration leading to dementia and movement disorders.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Concussion is associated with increased mortality risk in the elderly with adjusted HR 1.25 (95% CI 1.16–1.34).

### A systematic review of structural and functional imaging correlates of headache or pain after mild traumatic brain injury [^112K9zb5]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Headaches and pain-related symptoms are the most disabling somatic complaints following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In this study, we reviewed the existing literature examining structural differences in brain morphology and axonal connections, as well as functional differences in brain activity and connectivity associated with pain or post-traumatic headache (PTH) following mTBI. We searched MEDLINE ®, Embase, PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases for: (1) TBI OR concussion OR post-concussion syndrome; (2) pain OR headache; and (3) magnetic resonance imaging OR functional MRI OR diffusion tensor imaging. Inclusion criteria were that articles be original studies written in English about participants with mTBI or concussion diagnosis with results reported about pain and/or headache. Excluded were review articles, case studies, documentaries, and studies related to moderate to severe TBI. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) quality assessment tool. Nineteen out of 3439 studies satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants with pain-related symptoms had lower cortical thickness in frontal and parietal cortical areas and spinothalamic tract volume. Differences in axonal connectivity were displayed in the corpus callosum, spinothalamic tract, fornix-septohippocampal circuit, and periaqueductal gray. Less activation in pain-related regions during a heat-pain task-based fMRI was reported in participants with PTH. In conclusion, individuals with pain following mTBI display differences in brain structure and brain function, suggesting irregularities in the descending pain modulatory system. These findings primarily provide information on neuroimaging differences in adults; there is limited research in pediatric populations.

Current terminology and its weaknesses

Numerous definitions for mTBI have been published (Table 1). The definitions extrapolate the presumed presence and severity of an underlying TBI from clinical markers. Alteration of mental state is considered a fundamental marker of TBI, with classifications agreeing, for example, that loss of consciousness is sufficient (but not necessary) to diagnose a mTBI. However, debate remains regarding the degree of alteration in mental state required, whether evidence of structural injury constitutes a more severe injury and whether the presence of subjective post-injury symptoms (e.g. headache, dizziness, cognitive impairment) is sufficient to diagnose a TBI.

Table 1
Key definitions of mTBI and concussion

A recent survey of mTBI experts found agreement amongst the panel that individuals with an mTBI can present with isolated subjective symptoms such as headache, dizziness and cognitive impairments. However, such symptoms are not specific to head injury, occurring at the same rate in those with extracranial injury and in up to three quarters of otherwise healthy adults. This perhaps explains the finding that 59% of the general population who report having been 'concussed' deny ever having had a brain/head injury.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^11213P2Q]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Consistent with the prior study of Lieba-Samal, the overwhelming majority of concussed individuals followed prospectively develop acute PTH on the day of the injury or by the following day. Delayed-onset PTH was not observed. PTH characteristics are highly variable with no prototypical location, quality, duration, associated symptoms or aggravating/provoking factors. Those who experienced acute PTH had a higher number and overall burden of symptoms and a greater likelihood of concomitant sleep and psychological disturbances. Given the high prevalence of acute PTH in our study, we were unable to identify any predictive factors for the development of acute PTH.

The findings of the Toronto Concussion Study together with the findings of Lieba-Samal and colleagues suggest that current ICHD-3 criteria for acute headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head are reasonable and appropriate and the interval between injury and headache onset should not be extended beyond seven days. Indeed, given that 94% of the patients in this study had acute PTH onset the day of their concussion or by the next day, consideration could be given by the ICHD to reducing the accepted interval for headache onset post-injury from seven days to a shorter interval to improve diagnostic precision.

Diagnoses that may underpin persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury

The foundation of our approach to persistent symptoms after mTBI is the recognition that the symptoms are non-specific. This means that, in different people, there might be a range of possible diagnoses within which such symptoms could cluster. Alternatively, numerous different underlying diagnoses might be present in another individual with the same persistent symptoms and those symptoms may have a high degree of overlap between diagnoses. The assessment therefore needs to tease apart (or indeed cluster together) symptoms to establish a reasonable diagnostic formulation shared with the patient, with the express purpose of developing a rational bio-psycho-socio-ecological treatment plan informed by that formulation. To illustrate this approach, we have used two of the most commonly described symptoms after mTBI; headache and dizziness (Fig. 1).

Figure 1
Two distinct approaches to the same symptom complex post mTBI. (A) Panel demonstrates the consequence of the PCS label being applied, resulting in a single non-specific treatment. (B) Adopting an individualized diagnostic formulation to consider and identify the multiple potential causative factors potentially underlying identical symptom complexes. The consequence is the instigation of targeted evidence-based individualized treatment plans. Dotted arrows represent contributory processes to symptom persistence/amplification.

When compared to primary headache disorders, post-traumatic headache most commonly represents a migraine-type headache with associated migraine symptoms, including nausea, light and noise sensitivity, irritability and cognitive symptoms — symptoms that are also listed as typical symptoms of PCS itself. Furthermore, a pre-existing or family history of migraine are risk factors for prolonged post-traumatic headache. However, although migraine and post-traumatic headache pathophysiology may overlap in some patients, there is likely to be a range of pathophysiological processes underpinning post-traumatic headache and treating all the same is unlikely to be successful. For example, persistent psychological factors and medication overuse are recognized to prolong post-traumatic headache. Therefore, treatment trials that fail to stratify patients and instead treat all post-traumatic headache as the same are at risk of failure. Despite these caveats, early treatment of post-traumatic headache, particularly in those at greatest risk, and a diagnostic explanation for the patient including the clustering of other 'postconcussional' symptoms are warranted.

### Factors associated with persistent symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury [^116wkJsL]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the early clinical characteristics associated with persistent symptoms 30 days after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 803 patients presenting at a median of 1.5 hours after an mTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≥ 13), 9 characteristics were significantly associated with symptoms persisting for 30 days: female sex; elevated body mass index; mechanism of injury; a prior diagnosis of headaches or migraines, depression, or anxiety; and the presence of focal neurological deficits, headache, or multiple computed tomography scans at intake.

Meaning

These findings suggest that patients with any of these characteristics should be identified as candidates for early intervention intended to prevent persistent 30-day postconcussive symptoms and should receive follow-up for mTBI.

### Post-traumatic headache after pediatric traumatic brain injury: prevalence, risk factors, and association with neurocognitive outcomes [^116qs1Er]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic headache is common after pediatric traumatic brain injury and affects thousands of children every year, but little is known about how headache affects recovery after traumatic brain injury in other symptom domains. We aimed to determine the association between headache and other common symptoms after pediatric traumatic brain injury and explore whether subjective complaints of headache are associated with objective deficits on specialized neurocognitive testing. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children ages 3–19 years following traumatic brain injury with a completed Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) questionnaire. Post-traumatic headache was defined by a score more than 2 on the SCAT question for headache and define headache groups for comparison. In our cohort, we analyzed data from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition (WASI-II). Headache was reported in 40 (33%) patients presenting for post-traumatic brain injury care among 121 pediatric traumatic brain injury patients and did not differ by injury severity. Median total SCAT symptom score in the headache group was 5-fold higher compared to patients without headache (median 45.5 vs 9; P < .001). Significantly lower-scaled scores in color naming, matrix reasoning, letter sequencing, and letter switching were also found in the headache group (all P ≤ .03). Our study shows that headache, as reported by patients on the SCAT, is associated with higher symptom scores in all other symptom domains, including sleep, mood, sensory, and cognitive. Headache was also associated with worse objective neurocognitive measures and may identify patients who could benefit from specialized follow-up care and management.

### Clinical features and sex differences in pediatric post-traumatic headache: a retrospective chart review at a Boston area concussion clinic [^115mfNLL]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Often concussion/mTBI triggers a chronic headache syndrome called persistent post-traumatic headache (P-PTH) that can last from months to years post-injury, and produce significant disruption of childhood education, social interaction and development. Although prevalent and highly disabling, P-PTH is underrepresented in headache and pain research and lacks clear definition and pathophysiology. Clinical presentation of P-PTH frequently resembles that of other headache disorders, like migraine, yet the pathophysiological mechanisms are distinct and not fully understood, making the disorder difficult to treat in the clinical setting.

Methods

In a retrospective analysis of 1506 pediatric patients attending Boston Children's Hospital clinics, demographic trends, symptom features, and the influence of sex on clinical presentation of PTH are presented. We compare clinical characteristics of P-PTH with a published cohort of migraine patients to evaluate the clinical features that are unique to P-PTH.

Results

Findings show that despite equivalent representation of sex in the clinic, P-PTH is expressed more in females than males and is weighted towards somatic symptoms. Relative to migraine, PTH is less associated with a family history of headache.

Conclusions

The ability to identify persons with PTH can help manage risk factors and identify persons likely to develop persistent post-concussion symptoms.

### Post-traumatic headache: from classification challenges to biological underpinnings [^111FA7H6]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

The ICHD-II criteria for post-traumatic headache (PTH) are strictly outlined. PTH can be subdivided into an acute and a chronic forms, the former likely nociceptive in nature, the latter likely neuropathic. The time of transition between the acute and the chronic forms is artificial and in the future should be better based on clear clinical or rather biological data. Chronic PTH often presents as one of the primary headache syndromes, e.g. migraine or tension-type headache. Its biology is poorly understood and whether it merely represents the expression of the primary headache or it has a distinct pathogenesis remains unclear. The frontal lobe is often affected in traumatic head injury. Its dysfunction can cause an array of clinical consequences that have an impact on the patient's symptomatology and therapeutic outcome. Its recognition is likely to improve patient management quality.

### CARE4Kids study: endophenotypes of persistent post-concussive symptoms in adolescents: study rationale and protocol [^112fdZhA]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2024). Medium credibility.

Headache

This portion of the study is targeted towards better defining endophenotypes leading to post-traumatic headache (PTH). Classification based on current International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 criteria (which only broadly classifies post-traumatic headache)may not reflect complexities of PTH pathophysiology in the setting of concussion. A better understanding of PTH and associated neurological dysfunction may require a finer granularity of phenotypic characterization — distinct from what has been developed for primary headache disorders. Determination of PTH phenotype may have practical importance not only in terms of predicting persisting symptoms, but also as an indicator of potential benefit of phenotype-specific therapies.

We postulate that migraine-like post-traumatic headache may be a unique post-concussion endophenotype with a distinct recovery timeline and markers that could be inferred from physical, imaging, autonomic or blood biomarkers. There are numerous components that will test this hypothesis. Extensive headache questionnaires are obtained at the T1 and T3 visits (Table 2). Headache questions were designed to integrate with the Headache and Concussion NINDS Common Data Elements (CDEs). We also chose to use the MyCap platformto longitudinally monitor headache and associated features, medication use, and a basic indicator of sleep quantity to more fully characterize headache burden and characteristics from recruitment and the first study visit (T1) until the recovery visit (T3). We are also utilizing validated migraine disability assessment tools at the T1 and T3 research visits, the Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedsMIDAS), and Headache Impact Test 6 (HIT 6).

Table 2.
Symptoms and Examination Checklist for Headache Assessment

Associated with these headache features, we are characterizing blood-flow pathophysiology through advanced neuroimaging (arterial spin labeling; ASL) and white matter microstructure with diffusion tensor imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The prospective measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) using ASL in this project has the potential to provide highly meaningful information regarding changes in blood flow as a mechanism of PTH and as an indicator of PPCS outcomes. Fluid biomarker data will also supplement this analysis, we are investigating pathophysiologic associations with pain neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and Substance P.

To assess for physical examination markers that correlate with outcomes, research coordinators have been trained in a standardized head and neck examination, tailored for headache disorders, to assess for cervical and neurologic components of persistent posttraumatic headache (Table 2).

### Predictors of clinical recovery from concussion: a systematic review [^116w7NCZ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

At present, it is reasonable to conclude that the large majority of injured athletes recover, from a clinical perspective, within the first month following injury. Neurobiological recovery might extend beyond clinical recovery in some athletes. Clinicians know that some student athletes report persistent symptoms for many months following injury, there can be multiple causes for those symptoms and those individuals are more likely to be included in studies conducted at specialty clinics.

A range of preinjury individual differences, initial injury severity indicators, acute clinical effects or subacute clinical effects or comorbidities might influence outcome from concussion. Genetics, sex differences, younger age, neurodevelopmental factors such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)or learning disability, personalor family history of migraine, or a personalor family history of mental health problemsmight also be predictors or effect modifiers of clinical recovery from concussion. Having a past concussion is a risk factor for having a future concussion, and having multiple past concussions is associated with having more physical, cognitive and emotional symptoms prior to participation in a sporting season. There have been inconsistent findings regarding whether specific injury severity characteristics, such as loss of consciousness, retrograde amnesia or post-traumatic amnesia, are associated with greater acute effects or prolonged recovery. Numerous postinjury clinical factors, such as the initial severity of cognitive deficits, the development of post-traumatic headaches or migraines, experiencing dizziness, difficulties with oculomotor functioningand experiencing symptoms of depression, have also been associated with worse outcomes after concussion.

There is a need to synthesise evidence regarding the relationship between demographic and clinical preinjury, injury-related and postinjury factors and clinical recovery after concussion. Therefore, this systematic review will assess numerous factors that might be considered intermediary, effect modifying, predictor or confounding variables in relation to clinical recovery from concussion. Clinical recovery is defined functionally as a return to normal activities, including school and sports, following injury. Operationally, it encompasses a resolution of postconcussive symptoms and a return to clinically normal balance and cognitive functioning.

### Functional neurological disorders in personal injury [^114S7eTh]. BMJ Neurology Open (2021). High credibility.

Postconcussion syndrome

This term describes a constellation of symptoms that can occur after 'concussion' (usually taken to mean mTBI), such as poor memory, pain, headache, dizziness, fatigue and psychiatric symptoms. The terminology can be confusing and misleading, and some have suggested a change in terminology, for example, to 'post-traumatic syndrome'. The term postconcussion syndrome (PCS) is unhelpful, and it is clearer to describe each symptom in turn and consider the pathophysiological basis for each.

While it is certainly possible an isolated mTBI can produce temporary damage to the brain, cognitive (and other) symptoms that persist beyond the expected weeks to months are likely to have a functional basis. The symptoms of PCS are nonspecific and also occur in non-head injury trauma controls, healthy volunteersand personal injury litigants without head injury. Many more examples (mental health problems, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, whiplash, sleep deprivation, intercurrent illness, substance abuse, medication side effects, personality disorder and even the way symptoms are elicited by the interviewer) are discussed by Kaufman and colleagues in their thoughtful review. Premorbid factors predict outcome after traumatic brain injuries, and several meta-analyses have shown that mTBI itself does not lead to persistent deficits — see Larrabee and Rohling, Kaufman et al and references therein.

Key Points

Question

Is posttraumatic headache phenotype associated with symptom burden and quality of life 3 months after concussion among children aged 8 to 16 years?

Findings

In this cohort study among 928 children with concussion or orthopedic injury, children with posttraumatic migraine symptoms had higher symptom burden and lower quality of life 3 months after concussion than children with nonmigraine headache. Children with no headache after concussion had the lowest symptom burden and highest quality of life following concussion, comparable with children with orthopedic injury.

Meaning

These findings suggest that postacute headache phenotype was associated with symptom burden and quality of life 3 months after concussion.

### Questionnaire and structural imaging data accurately predict headache improvement in patients with acute post-traumatic headache attributed to mild traumatic brain injury [^11223b4c]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Our prior work demonstrated that questionnaires assessing psychosocial symptoms have utility for predicting improvement in patients with acute post-traumatic headache following mild traumatic brain injury. In this cohort study, we aimed to determine whether prediction accuracy can be refined by adding structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain measures to the model.

Methods

Adults with acute post-traumatic headache (enrolled 0–59 days post-mild traumatic brain injury) underwent T1-weighted brain MRI and completed three questionnaires (Sports Concussion Assessment Tool, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and the Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale). Individuals with post-traumatic headache completed an electronic headache diary allowing for determination of headache improvement at three- and at six-month follow-up. Questionnaire and MRI measures were used to train prediction models of headache improvement and headache trajectory.

Results

Forty-three patients with post-traumatic headache (mean age = 43.0, SD = 12.4; 27 females/16 males) and 61 healthy controls were enrolled (mean age = 39.1, SD = 12.8; 39 females/22 males). The best model achieved cross-validation Area Under the Curve of 0.801 and 0.805 for predicting headache improvement at three and at six months. The top contributing MRI features for the prediction included curvature and thickness of superior, middle, and inferior temporal, fusiform, inferior parietal, and lateral occipital regions. Patients with post-traumatic headache who did not improve by three months had less thickness and higher curvature measures and notably greater baseline differences in brain structure vs. healthy controls (thickness: p < 0.001, curvature: p = 0.012) than those who had headache improvement.

Conclusions

A model including clinical questionnaire data and measures of brain structure accurately predicted headache improvement in patients with post-traumatic headache and achieved improvement compared to a model developed using questionnaire data alone.

Across trials, there was no difference in post-concussion symptoms between true and sham rTMS at four months or six months, no difference in headache symptoms at six months, and no differences in performance on a battery of neuropsychological tests at one month or in Quality of Life after Brain Injury Questionnaire scores at six months; one study found rTMS was associated with improvement in debilitating headache at one month, but this is not a validated means of measuring change in headache symptom severity, and another reported patients receiving rTMS were more likely to return to work than sham. The FDA identified a risk for seizure with the use of rTMS; none of the reviewed studies noted seizure as an adverse event, but all three studies excluded individuals with a history of seizures. Evidence also indicated some potential harm associated with rTMS, particularly headache, with other side effects including worsening mood, dizziness, stimulation site discomfort, insomnia, face tightness, and toothache, and the body of evidence had some limitations, including small sample sizes.

Participants endorsing ongoing headache(s) at their initial concussion clinic visit had significantly higher SCAT-3 symptom severity scores (mean, 46.9; SD, 28.8; 95%CI 43.5–50.3) than participants not endorsing headaches (mean, 26.6; SD, 21.3; 95%CI 17.8–35.4; p = 0.0007) (Table 3). Furthermore, participants endorsing a headache at the initial visit endorsed a greater number of symptoms on the SCAT-3 (number of symptoms, 15.6; SD, 5.4; 95% CI 14.9–16.2) than those not endorsing a headache (number of symptoms, 11.1; SD, 6.2; 95% CI 8.6–13.7; p = 0.0001).

Headache associated factors

a) Age and sex

There was no significant difference in Week 1 headache endorsement by sex (p = 0.25). The age of the participants endorsing acute PTH (mean age, 33.0 years; SD, 12.8; 95%CI 31.5–34.5) was significantly lower compared to participants who did not endorse PTH (mean age, 39.2 years; SD, 13.8; 95%CI 33.5–44.9; p = 0.02).

b) Pre-injury headache history

Pre-injury frequency of headache did not predict endorsing a new headache at Week 1 (p = 0.91). Those with a prior history of chronic daily headaches at any point in their life prior to the index concussion were not more likely to endorse headaches in the first week post-concussion (n = 38, 13%; chi square value = 2.90, p = 0.09)

### A controlled historical cohort study on the post-concussion syndrome [^11329hpC]. European Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

In Lithuania, expectation of chronic symptoms after minor head injury is less than in western countries and possibilities for monetary compensation are minimal. Therefore, an opportunity exists to study the post-concussion syndrome (PCS) without several confounding factors present in western societies. We sent questionnaires about symptoms attributed to PCS to 200 subjects who had a concussion with loss of consciousness between 35 and 22 months before the study. For each study subject, a sex- and age-matched control person with minor non-head injury was identified. These controls received similar questionnaires. All the responding post-concussion patients stated that they had had acute headache after the trauma but this headache had disappeared in 96% of cases within 1 month. Headache and dizziness at the time of the questioning were not significantly more prevalent in the patients with concussion than in the controls, and there was no significant difference concerning subjective cognitive dysfunction. Scores of visual analogue scales of symptoms attributed to PCS showed no significant differences except for depression, alcohol intolerance and worry about brain injury, which were more frequent in the concussion group. No specific effect of the head injury was detected when various definitions and different constellations of core symptoms of PCS were used. These findings question the validity of the PCS as a useful clinical entity.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^115tdwt3]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Headache is an extremely common symptom after concussion and onset is typically within the first 24 hours post-injury
The characteristics of acute headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head are highly variable with no prototypical frequency, duration, location, quality, associated symptoms, triggering or aggravating factors.
There were no identified predictive factors for development of acute PTH (as almost all participants experienced headaches within the first week).
Those who experienced acute PTH had higher overall burden of symptoms and symptom severity, and greater likelihood of sleep and psychological disturbances.
ICHD-3 5.1 criteria for acute headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head are reasonable and appropriate; the accepted interval between the time of the injury and headache onset should not be extended beyond 7 days and consideration could be given to reducing the interval to 48 hours to improve diagnostic precision.

### Concussion is confusing us all [^115d3YK6]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

It is time to stop using the term concussion as it has no clear definition and no pathological meaning. This confusion is increasingly problematic as the management of 'concussed' individuals is a pressing concern. Historically, it has been used to describe patients briefly disabled following a head injury, with the assumption that this was due to a transient disorder of brain function without long-term sequelae. However, the symptoms of concussion are highly variable in duration, and can persist for many years with no reliable early predictors of outcome. Using vague terminology for post-traumatic problems leads to misconceptions and biases in the diagnostic process, producing uninterpretable science, poor clinical guidelines and confused policy. We propose that the term concussion should be avoided. Instead neurologists and other healthcare professionals should classify the severity of traumatic brain injury and then attempt to precisely diagnose the underlying cause of post-traumatic symptoms.

### Part I – evaluation of pediatric post-traumatic headaches [^111DenLK]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Brain injury is one of the most common injuries in the pediatric age group, and post-traumatic headache is one of the most common symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury in children.

Methods

This is an expert opinion-based two-part review on pediatric post-traumatic headaches. Part I will focus on an overview and approach to the evaluation of post-traumatic headache. Part II will focus on the medical management of post-traumatic headache. Relevant articles were reviewed, and an algorithm is proposed.

Results

We review the epidemiology, classification, pathophysiology, and clinical approach to evaluating patients with post-traumatic headache. A comprehensive history and physical examination are fundamental to identifying the headache type(s). Identifying the precise headache phenotype is important to help guide treatment. Most of the post-traumatic headaches are migraine or tension type, but occipital neuralgia, cervicogenic headache, and medication overuse headache also occur. Postconcussive signs often resolve within 1 month, and individuals whose signs persist longer may benefit from an interprofessional approach.

Conclusions

Rigorous evaluation and diagnosis are vital to treating post-traumatic headaches effectively. A multifaceted approach is needed to address all the possible contributing factors to the headaches and any comorbid conditions that may delay recovery or alter treatment choices.

### Does analgesic overuse contribute to chronic post-traumatic headaches in adolescent concussion patients? [^115Y9kn5]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The causes of persistent headache following concussion are poorly understood. The objective of this study is to explore analgesic overuse as a potential cause of chronic post-traumatic headache among adolescents referred to a headache clinic following concussion.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted of all adolescent concussion patients referred to our pediatric headache clinic over the 16-month period between August 1, 2011, and November 30, 2012. Those patients with chronic post-traumatic headaches of 3–12 months' duration who also met International Headache Society criteria for probable medication-overuse headache were identified. Demographic data, concussion symptoms, and headache features were characterized from the initial evaluation and from follow-up visits.

Results

Of 104 adolescent concussion patients referred during the study period, 77 had chronic post-traumatic headache of 3–12 months' duration. Fifty-four of 77 (70.1%) met criteria for probable medication-overuse headache. Only simple analgesics were overused. Thirty-seven patients (68.5%) had resolution of headaches or improvements to preconcussion headache patterns after discontinuing analgesics; seven (13%) had no change in headaches or worsening of headaches after discontinuing analgesics and 10 (18.5%) did not discontinue analgesics or were lost to follow-up.

Conclusion

Excessive use of analgesics postconcussion may contribute to chronic post-traumatic headaches in some adolescents. Management of patients with chronic post-traumatic headache should include analgesic detoxification when medication overuse is suspected.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^113oNUu5]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, there is an extremely limited number of relevant clinical trials upon which to make therapeutic decisions for PTH management. The hope is that with greater clarity in PTH diagnostic criteria, with renewed interest in PTH and with promising new emerging therapies, appropriate patients can be enrolled in clinical trials and novel therapeutic agents and treatment strategies can be appropriately evaluated.

To date, there has been limited research on the clinical characteristics of acute headache following head trauma. Most prior research on PTH has been retrospective, looked at homogenous athlete, military or pediatric populations that do not optimally generalize to the general concussion population, or has focused on persistent PTH. Accordingly, this phase of the Toronto Concussion Study was designed to prospectively and comprehensively evaluate acute PTH within the first week post-concussion in a heterogeneous outpatient population. Specifically, the aim of this phase of the Study was to determine the prevalence of acute PTH in a general (non-motor vehicle accident and non-work-related injury) population, to ascertain the typical timing of onset and clinical characteristics of acute PTH and, in turn, determine the appropriateness of the ICHD-3 criteria for acute PTH. Another objective was to examine risk factors for the development of acute PTH. Subsequent analyses from the Toronto Concussion Study evaluate the risk factors for the persistence of PTH through the first three months post-concussion.

Results

Between January 2016 and December 2018, 1270 individuals were referred to the concussion clinic by various emergency departments. From this group, 555 individuals were deemed eligible to participate and 344 people provided consent to participate in this study. A total of 302 participants completed the Week 1 Headache Questionnaire and were included in this analysis (Figure 2).

Participants were seen at a mean of 5.3 (SD 1.8) days after their injury. The mean age was 33.6 (SD 13.0) years and 59% were female. At the first visit, the mean number of symptoms endorsed on SCAT-3 was 15.2 (SD 5.6) of 22 possible symptoms and mean symptom severity score was 45.2 (SD 28.8) of a possible 132 (reflecting a significant symptom severity burden). Participant demographics are presented in Table 1.

Acute post-traumatic headache characteristics

a) Headache prevalence

At the Week 1 clinic visit, 277 individuals (92%) endorsed that they experienced a post-injury headache(s). Headache characteristics are presented in Table 2.

Table 2.
Headache characteristics.

b) Timing of headache onset

From the cohort of 277 patients who experienced headache, 260 (94%) indicated that their headache onset was the day of the concussion or by the following day post-injury. Of those 262 individuals who indicated that their headaches began within one day of the injury, 147 (57%) indicated that their headache began "immediately after injury", 69 (26%) selected "later the same day as the injury", and 46 (17%) endorsed headache onset the day after injury; 16 (6%) individuals noted that they had headache onset more than 48 hours after injury but within 7 days of injury.

### Phenotyping the spectrum of traumatic brain injury: a review and pathway to standardization [^111vJvD3]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Two studies used COBRIT trial data to explore acute injury/treatment data collected in the first 24 h after a TBI (e.g. fluid intake, blood tests, and CT scan measures). Both studies included persons with non-penetrating TBI and positive baseline CT, but each study used a different analysis and found slightly different phenotypes. Masino et al. identified four phenotypes that were associated with 90-day outcomes on cognitive, emotional and other functional outcomes, whereas Folweiler et al. used similar methods and measures but identified three phenotypes. Separately, Folweiler et al. reported three phenotypes using supervised k -means clustering on TRACK-TBI data. Two out of the three phenotypes were similar in both the COBRIT and TRACK-TBI samples.

An analysis of acute care data collected (including imaging characteristics in the first 24 h) was undertaken in adults from the CENTER-TBI European cohort study. By applying PCA and then clustering on the reduced dimensional outputs with bootstrap resampling, they revealed four stable clusters of TBI severity (Table 1). These clusters were distinguished by 1) injury mechanism, 2) presence of extracranial injury, and 3) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The results implied treating intermediate (moderate) severities as two distinct groups (upper and lower), that is, 1) mild, 2) moderate lower, 3) moderate upper, and 4) severe. Traditional severity categories are broad and encompass very different pathologies, and so research into further gradations asserted by Gravesteijn et al. could find value for assisting differential diagnosis, and/or quantifying cases where additional diagnostics are/are not necessary.

Predominantly post-concussion symptom profiles

Several studies examined post-concussion symptom profiles using a variety of measures and analytical techniques to derive phenotypes that inform prevalence, predictors of recovery, and/or target potential treatments. Lumba-Brown and colleagues convened a multi-disciplinary expert workgroup to define common subtypes of concussion in pediatric and adult populations and identify clinical questions related to prevalence and recovery. Using these key clinical questions, the group conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of concussion subtype prevalence. The meta-analysis of multiple measures (clinical signs, symptomology, neurocognitive and vestibulo-oculomotor testing, etc.) informed the varying acute prevalence of the following subclassifications, populated predominantly with post-concussive symptoms: 1) headache/migraine, 2) cognitive, 3) vestibular, 4) anxiety/mood, and 5) oculomotor impairments.

### Novel interdisciplinary intervention, GAIN, vs. enhanced usual care to reduce high levels of post-concussion symptoms in adolescents and young adults 2–6 months post-injury: a randomised trial [^112rF3C4]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Patients with concussion, also termed mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), are common in the hospital setting. One of the highest incidence rates of 150–200 per 100 000 years is found among adolescents and young adults. However, as many patients are not seen in hospital, the population rate may be much higher. Although the majority recovers within the first weeks, it is typically estimated that 10–15% continues to suffer from post-concussion symptoms (PCS) such as headache, dizziness, fatigue, concentration problems, sadness, and irritability. However, recent studies suggest that the prevalence of persistent symptoms may even be as high as 40%. Patients reporting high levels of PCS 2–3 months after concussion are at risk of prolonged disability and reduced health-related quality of life. These are particularly serious and problematic prospects in relation to adolescents and young adults both in terms of personal suffering and socioeconomic implications. Nevertheless, according to recent systematic reviews there is a striking lack of methodologically rigorous clinical trials investigating treatment for these patients. Thus, there is an urgent need for trials developing and investigating interventions for persistent PCS.

Knowledge about modifiable prognostic factors is essential to identify viable targets for intervention. Recent studies suggest that prognostic factors are best understood in terms of a bio-psycho-social model. According to current understanding, the acute and subacute pathophysiological processes following a concussion (with no findings on standard neuroimaging) may induce a temporary disturbance of neurometabolism and thereby brain function, which seems to normalise within a few weeks. Findings regarding permanent microstructural changes that may explain persistent PCS are inconclusive. There is general agreement that other factors than pathophysiological processes seem to be involved in the development of persistent PCS, some of which may be modifiable.

One such factor may be patients' illness perceptions, which seem to be significantly associated with outcome after concussion. Illness perceptions contain a number of dimensions that can be psychometrically measured and followed over time. A new understanding of illness perceptions and persistent somatic symptoms is emerging based on an updated model of the working brain. According to this model, unconscious expectations of symptom experience are crucial in the understanding of the conscious experience of symptoms. The unconscious expectations are mirrored in patients' illness perceptions. Importantly, such expectations can be modified not only in the laboratory, but also in real-world settings.

### Reframing postconcussional syndrome as an interface disorder of neurology, psychiatry and psychology [^112Kh7Hi]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

The injury: to what extent has persistent damage occurred?

A TBI results from an external mechanical force which is hypothesized to cause a primary injury. However, the mTBI group comprises a huge range of injury severity. Within this same category might be a person who sustained a very minor blow to the head resulting in symptoms such as dizziness, headache and nausea and a person who, following a blow to the head, had 29 min of loss of consciousness, 23 h of post-traumatic amnesia and a non-displaced skull fracture. It seems logical that the physical consequences to the brain are likely to differ across this spectrum.

Despite this complexity, there often appears to be an assumption in the literature that symptoms after mTBI are always caused by the same basic process of brain injury at a cellular and structural level and, therefore, that experimental studies at a group level are a reasonable way to investigate the nature of these injuries. This fails to recognize the heterogeneity of likely physical injury within the broad mTBI category and also, crucially, that other disorders can cause persistent symptoms after mTBI (e.g. functional neurological disorder, depression, migraine) which are themselves associated with abnormalities on experimental measures such as functional MRI.

Post-mortem studies of patients with a history of mTBI, but who died of other reasons, have found evidence in some of white matter injury and persistent inflammation months after the injury. Secondary injury could therefore develop in minutes, hours or months, with possible long-term effects on symptoms and function. However, caution must be applied, because these phenomena are likely to affect only a proportion of people with mTBI. There is also a tendency to extrapolate in an unrestrained way the results of animal studies to humans, even though the vast range of injury severities in humans with mTBI do not map well onto the carefully controlled experimentally-induced injuries in animal studies.

### Concussion is confusing us all [^1115dHmB]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Standard investigations also do not particularly help in defining 'concussion'. Many patients with mild TBI do not undergo neuroimaging and are perhaps wrongly reassured about the concussive nature of their problems without any detailed investigation. Even when there is available neuroimaging, it is easy to be falsely reassured by negative neuroimaging findings. Standard neuroimaging will identify large focal contusions or haemorrhage but normal conventional CT and MRI do not exclude diffuse axonal and vascular injury, both major drivers of poor clinical outcome after TBI (see Investigation section). Standard neuroimaging sequences can miss these problems, although more advanced techniques such as susceptibility weighted and diffusion MRI are a more sensitive way of identifying them.

Finally, the term concussion lacks any diagnostic precision and at worst encourages a lazy diagnostic approach. Arriving quickly at the diagnosis of 'postconcussive syndrome' often curtails a detailed assessment of the post-traumatic symptoms. For example, patients with migrainous headaches may be labelled as having concussion, and denied more accurate diagnosis and treatment. This is a type of diagnostic bias where undue emphasis is placed on one aspect of the presentation (the initial injury), which has the effect of obscuring other elements of the diagnostic process. As a result patients with disabling problems often feel that they have not been properly assessed, 'not been listened to' and are 'not getting the services that their injuries deserve'. This type of 'broad-brush' approach to the neurological assessment of patients with TBI is often justified by therapeutic nihilism. We believe such pessimism is inappropriate and that patients with TBI can benefit from the same level of diagnostic precision and careful management that neurologists bring to other areas of their practice.

### The spectrum of mild traumatic brain injury: a review [^115Gc73j]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

This review provides an in-depth overview of diagnostic schema and risk factors influencing recovery during the acute, subacute (operationally defined as up to 3 months postinjury), and chronic injury phases across the full spectrum of individuals (e.g., athletes to neurosurgery patients) with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Particular emphasis is placed on the complex differential diagnoses for patients with prolonged postconcussive symptoms.

Methods

Select literature review and synthesis.

Results

In spite of an increase in public awareness surrounding the acute and potential long-term effects of mTBI, the medical field remains fragmented both in terms of the diagnostic (different criteria proffered by multiple medical organizations) and prognostic factors that influence patient care.

Conclusions

Given the lack of objective biomarkers and the spectrum of different disorders that likely encompass mTBI, clinicians are encouraged to adopt a probabilistic, rather than definitive, diagnostic and prognostic framework. The relevance of accurately diagnosing and managing the different manifestations of mTBI becomes clear when one considers the overall incidence of the disorder (42 million people each year worldwide), and the different treatment implications for patients with a true neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., chronic traumatic encephalopathy; rare) vs potentially treatable conditions (e.g., depression or posttraumatic headache; frequent).

### Different clinical phenotypes of persistent post-traumatic headache exhibit distinct sensory profiles [^1175hb4h]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Persistent post-traumatic headache remains a poorly understood clinical entity. Although there are currently no accepted therapies for persistent post-traumatic headache, its clinical symptoms, which primarily resemble those of migraine or tension-type headache, often serve to guide treatment. However, evidence-based justification for this treatment approach remains lacking given the paucity of knowledge regarding the characteristics of these two major persistent post-traumatic headache phenotypes and their etiology.

Methods

We compared clinical features and quantitative sensory testing profiles between two distinct cohorts of persistent post-traumatic headache subjects that exhibited symptoms resembling either migraine (n = 15) or tension-type headache (n = 13), as well as to headache-free subjects that had suffered traumatic brain injury (n = 19), and to healthy controls (n = 10). We aimed to determine whether the two persistent post-traumatic headache subgroups could be discriminated based on additional clinical features, distinct quantitative sensory testing profiles, or the interaction of pain severity with the level of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Results

Persistent post-traumatic headache subjects with migraine-like symptoms reported that bright light and focused attention aggravated their pain, while stress and nervousness were reported to aggravate the headache in subjects with tension-type headache-like symptoms. Quietness was better in alleviating migraine-like persistent post-traumatic headache, while anti-inflammatory medications provided better relief in tension-type headache-like persistent post-traumatic headache. The two persistent post-traumatic headache subgroups exhibited distinct quantitative sensory testing profiles with subjects exhibiting tension-type headache-like persistent post-traumatic headache displaying a more pronounced cephalic and extracephalic thermal hypoalgesia that was accompanied by cephalic mechanical hyperalgesia. While both persistent post-traumatic headache subgroups had high levels of post-traumatic stress disorder, there was a positive correlation with pain severity in subjects with tension-type headache-like symptoms, but a negative correlation in subjects with migraine-like symptoms.

Conclusions

Distinct persistent post-traumatic headache symptoms and quantitative sensory testing profiles may be linked to different etiologies, potentially involving various levels of neuropathic and inflammatory pain, and if confirmed in a larger cohort, could be used to further characterize and differentiate between persistent post-traumatic headache subgroups in studies aimed to improve treatment.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^113BGvsE]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Concussions/mild traumatic brain injuries are very common neurological injuries that can cause physical, cognitive, and psychological dysfunction. The most common acute post-concussion symptom is headache (often referred to as post-traumatic headache or PTH). The acute headache following a concussion may persist for days, weeks or months post injury. The International Headache Society Classification of Headache Disorders Third Edition (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria 5.1 for acute headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head and 5.1.2 acute headache attributed to a mild traumatic injury to the head are outlined in Figure 1 (3). When the headaches continues for more than 3 months post-injury, ICHD-3 defines them as persistent headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head. To meet criteria for persistent headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head, individuals would have first had to meet criteria for acute headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head. These ICHD-3 criteria are largely based upon the consensus opinion of an expert panel rather than being evidence-based given the paucity of data in this area. Furthermore, these criteria do not identify any characteristic or defining headache quality, location, frequency, duration, associated symptoms, triggering or aggravating factors.

In terms of onset timing, the ICHD-3 criteria require that the headache develop within 7 days after injury (or after regaining consciousness or discontinuation of medication(s) impairing ability to sense or report headache). There has been debate regarding the validity of this time frame with some suggesting that the interval should be shorter and others suggesting that the interval should be extended out as far as thirty days post-injury or longer (3,6,7); indeed the appendix of the ICHD-3 proposes research criteria that extend the interval between traumatic injury to the head and headache onset out to ninety days (so called "delayed-onset" headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head). These divergent views demonstrate the need to evaluate and field-test the diagnostic criteria.

Despite its high prevalence, relatively little is known about acute and persistent PTH in terms of the epidemiology, headache characteristics, predictive factors for headache recovery or persistence, imaging correlates, and the role of genetics. The pathophysiology of acute PTH is not well understood. PTH results from physical forces that may precipitate headache de novo in a non-headache prone individual, initiate a new headache type in someone with pre-injury episodic or chronic headaches, or may exacerbate an existing primary headache disorder.

### Headache after concussion [^112KTCiU]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Chronic post-traumatic headache attributed to mild head injury is a somewhat disputed headache diagnosis. A main object of this study was to assess the validity of this diagnosis by studying the headache pattern of concussed patients that participated in one historic (n = 131) and one prospective cohort (n = 217) study.

Methods

Head injury patients were recruited from two hospitals in Kaunas, Lithuania. Controls were recruited amongst patients with minor orthopaedic traumas not involving the head and neck.

Results

When data from the two studies were pooled, no difference in any headache category (diagnosis, attack frequency, symptoms) was found one or more years after the trauma, except that photophobia was somewhat more prevalent amongst the concussed patients. In both injury groups, the existence of pre-traumatic headache was a predictor of post-traumatic headache, although pre-traumatic headache seems to have been underreported amongst the concussed patients. There was a significant negative correlation between the duration of unconsciousness and the headache.

Conclusions

This negative correlation, and the lack of specificity indicates that headache occurring 3 months or more after concussion is not caused by the head or brain injury. Rather it may represent an episode of one of the primary headaches, possibly induced by the stress of the situation.

### Headache management in traumatic brain injury [^112VH52m]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is estimated to rank as the third most important disease burden worldwide. About 60% of the survivors develop chronic headaches and visual symptoms, and the long-term management of headaches in these patients is controversial. Importantly, the care pathway of most patients is fragmented, complicating conclusive headache management. Here we review the epidemiology and aetiology of post traumatic headaches (PTH), discuss the diagnostic work up and summarise the acute and long-term management.

### Identifying migraine phenotype post traumatic headache (MPTH) to guide overall recovery from traumatic brain injury [^112QJE1J]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective: The primary aim of this study is to develop an easy way to identify migraine phenotype posttraumatic headache (MPTH) in children with traumatic brain injury, to treat headache in traumatic brain injury effectively, and to promote faster recovery from traumatic brain injury symptoms overall. Methods: We evaluated youth aged 7–20 years in a pediatric neurology traumatic brain injury (TBI) clinic, assigning a migraine phenotype for post-traumatic headache (MPTH) at the initial visit with the 3-item ID Migraine Screener. We stratified the sample by early (≤ 6 weeks) and late (> 6 weeks) presenters, using days to recovery from concussion symptoms as the primary outcome variable. Results: 397 youth were assessed; 54% were female. Median age was 15.1 years (range 7.0–20.4 years), and 34% of the sample had sports-related injuries. Migraine phenotype for posttraumatic headache (MPTH) was assigned to 56.1% of those seen within 6 weeks of traumatic brain injury and 50.7% of those seen after the 6-week mark. Irrespective of whether they were early or late presenters to our clinic, patients with migraine phenotype (MPTH) took longer to recover from traumatic brain injury than those with posttraumatic headache (PTH) alone. Log rank test indicated that the survival (ie, recovery) distributions between those with migraine phenotype posttraumatic headache (MPTH) and those with posttraumatic headache (PTH) were statistically different, χ²(3) = 50.186 (P < .001). Conclusions: Early identification of migraine phenotype posttraumatic headache (MPTH) following concussion can help guide more effective treatment of headache in traumatic brain injury and provide a road map for the trajectory of recovery from traumatic brain injury symptoms. It will also help us understand better the mechanisms that underlie conversion to persistent posttraumatic headache and chronic migraine after traumatic brain injury.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^111SH867]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

In the study by Lucas and colleagues, a lower percentage of patients (54%) endorsed a new or worse headache after the injury at 1-week post-injury versus the Toronto Concussion Study (92%). In the study by Lucas and colleagues, 59% of those who did not endorse a new or worse headache at week 1 endorsed a new or worse headache (compared to pre-injury) at the three-month follow-up (the first follow-up after the initial visit); Lucas and colleagues utilize these results to suggest that the time interval accepted by the ICHD-3 for headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head should be increased beyond seven days to a longer time period. This contrasts with our study and the study of Lieba-Samal and colleagues wherein delayed onset PTH was not identified.

Lieba-Samal and colleagues recruited 100 patients with acute mild head injury presenting to the department of trauma surgery at the Medical University of Vienna. The patients were primarily male (66%), and 38% were admitted to hospital post-injury. Patients underwent a detailed telephone interview between days 7 and 10 post injury and again between 90–100 days post-injury. The prevalence of acute PTH was 66%. For those with acute PTH, 92% developed their headache within 48 hours after the trauma. The presence of acute PTH was related to chronic pain (excluding headache), pre-existing episodic headache, number of posttraumatic symptoms, anxiety and depression. None of the patients continued to have persistent PTH when assessed at 90–100 days and none of the patients who did not endorse headache at 7–10 days post-injury endorsed the emergence of a new headache at 90–100 days post-injury.

Introduction

Concussion is a prevalent injury accounting for up to 98% of all traumatic brain injuries (TBI), and is often referred to as mild TBI. In Europe, the incidence rate of TBI is approximately 300 cases per 100,000 person-years, whereas in New Zealand it may be even higher with 790 cases per 100,000 person-years. These incidence rates result in an estimated 55.9 million concussions occurring globally each year. While the majority of those affected recover, up to 30% develop persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) with post-traumatic headache (PTH) being one of the most frequent symptoms. Treating post-traumatic headache (PTH) is a challenge due to the lack of an evidence-based treatment strategy, and despite its high prevalence, the underlying pathophysiology remains unknown. Current proposed management guidelines are based on the headache phenotype of PTH, which is often migraine-like.

During the last 30 years, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has substantially increased the understanding of migraine pathophysiology. Initial research revealed increased plasma CGRP levels in migraine patients during attacks, and later, its headache-inducing properties were discovered. The importance of CGRP is underlined by CGRP antibodies being used as preventive medication in episodic and chronic migraine. Although the precise pathophysiological mechanism of CGRP remains to be elucidated, it may contribute to migraine due to its ability to cause both peripheral and central sensitization within the trigeminovascular system.

Despite the clinical similarities between PTH and migraine, remarkably few studies have examined CGRP concentrations in individuals with concussion who develop PPCS/PTH. One of the few studies available in this field found lower blood CGRP levels in PTH, contrasting with the findings of migraine studies. Due to the paucity of evidence, we aimed to replicate this finding by assessing serum CGRP levels in patients with PPCS/PTH 2–6 months following a concussion.

Analytical approach

Our overall approach will involve iteratively fitting models to predict PPCS as defined by a PCSI Retrospective Adjusted Post-Injury Difference (RAPID) score (pre-injury PCSI score subtracted from the post-injury PCSI score) greater than 5 at the T3 visit. Benchmark predictability will be determined with clinical factors alone; next we will test predictability of individual biomarkers alone; the third step will combine clinical, biomarker and psychosocial variables; finally, we will examine the effects of confounders and effect moderators such as medication and treatment, gender, mechanism of injury, and comorbidities. For each model we will estimate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). We will employ 10-fold cross validation to avoid overfitting. Point estimates will be the average of the estimates from each of the ten folds and we will calculate bootstrapped confidence intervals.

Benchmark model

Clinical variables previously shown to be related to developing PPCSinclude: age, gender, prior concussion history and symptom duration, history of physician-diagnosed migraine, physician-diagnosed anxiety, physician-diagnosed depression, self-reported headache, self-reported sensitivity to noise, and self-reported fatigue. We will test for differences between participants with and without PPCS using chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. We will fit separate logistic regression models using each variable as well as varying combinations of variables. Models will be ranked in terms of AUC with the model producing the best testing characteristics serving as the benchmark for evaluating improvements at predicting PPCS with the addition of biomarkers.

Individual biomarkers

For each biomarker, the AUC and Youden's index will be calculated in univariable logistic regression models to predict PPCS. One model per imaging modality will be developed. For modalities producing many predictors, we will use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality prior to modeling. The optimal dichotomization of each multi-level or continuous biomarker will be selected using a combination of Youden's index and clinical judgment.

Benchmark + individual biomarkers

Next, we will separately add each biomarker and psychosocial variables to the benchmark model and assess changes in testing characteristics. Biomarkers will be ranked from most to least improvement in AUC. Any biomarker with a marginally significant p value (p < 0.20) for either a main effect or interaction will be eligible for the risk stratification model and continued in the Validation Phase.

### External validation of the post-concussion symptoms rule for predicting mild traumatic brain injury outcome [^115LT9xr]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2024). Medium credibility.

Persistent symptoms are common after a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The Post-Concussion Symptoms (PoCS) Rule is a newly developed clinical decision rule for the prediction of persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) 3 months after an mTBI. The PoCS Rule includes assessment of demographic and clinical characteristics and headache presence in the emergency department (ED), and follow-up assessment of symptoms at 7 days post-injury using two thresholds (lower/higher) for symptom scoring. We examined the PoCS Rule in an independent sample. We analyzed a clinical trial that recruited participants with mTBI from EDs in Greater Vancouver, Canada. The primary analysis used data from 236 participants, who were randomized to a usual care control group, and completed the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire at 3 months. The primary outcome was PPCS, as defined by the PoCS authors. We assessed the overall performance of the PoCS rule (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]), sensitivity, and specificity. More than 40% of participants (median age 38 years, 59% female) reported PPCS at 3 months. Most participants (88%) were categorized as being at medium risk based on the ED assessment, and a majority were considered as being at high risk according to the final PoCS Rule (81% using a lower threshold and 72% using a higher threshold). The PoCS Rule showed a sensitivity of 93% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88–98; lower threshold) and 85% (95% CI, 78–92; higher threshold), and a specificity of 28% (95% CI, 21–36) and 37% (95% CI, 29–46), respectively. The overall performance was modest (AUC 0.61, 95% CI 0.59, 0.65). In conclusion, the PoCS Rule was sensitive for PPCS, but had a low specificity in our sample. Follow-up assessment of symptoms can improve risk stratification after mTBI.

Sub-concussion, concussion, traumatic brain injury, and neurological sequelae

The vast majority of individuals exposed to head impacts typically experience trauma confined to the cranial structure without significant involvement of the brain parenchyma. Instead, a minority of subjects experience the development of loss of consciousness or the onset/worsening of neurological signs or cognitive impairment following a head trauma — traumatic brain injury (TBI). The pathophysiology of such injuries involves functional damage that often eludes detection by conventional neuroimaging, such as CT or MRI, primarily designed to identify structural damage. TBIs are commonly graded at the onset based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) into mild (GCS 13–15), moderate (GCS 9–12), and severe (GCS < 9). While only severe TBIs are usually linked to evident structural damage, it is noteworthy that even mild or moderate TBIs can infrequently manifest with intracranial lesions.

Many authors utilise the term concussion to describe any neurological manifestation following head trauma in the absence of discernible intracranial lesions on neuroimaging, suggesting that the term can be used interchangeably with mild to moderate TBI most of the time. On the other hand, a patient may incur a brain injury even in the absence of overt symptoms, as the nature of the trauma may have been too subtle to generate symptoms or be discerned through clinical assessment. In such instances, the term "sub-concussion" is employed to characterise these covert injuries.

Both isolated TBI and repetitive TBI or sub-concussions can elicit a spectrum of diverse neurological sequelae (Table 1). Common persistent symptoms include headache, dizziness, impaired attention, poor memory, executive dysfunctions, irritability, and depression. Post-concussion, persistent post-concussion, and chronic post-concussion syndrome have an acute onset temporally related to a single concussive event, whereas chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) occurs insidiously following multiple head injuries and a latent period.

Headache post-trauma

Headache post-trauma is recognised by the IHS (although this does not prove a direct causal link). Chronic headache post-trauma is often associated with 'PCS' and medication overuse. Chronic migraine should be treated in the usual way, and simple analgesia is limited to < 10 days a month.

### A prospective controlled treatment trial for post-traumatic headaches… [^113iXUj1]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

A Prospective Controlled Treatment Trial for Post-Traumatic HeadachesClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Post-traumatic headaches are the most common complaint after traumatic brain injury, possibly generated by a number of stressors to the trigeminovascular and cervical plexus networks, including inflammation of the high cervical facet joints, traumatic cranial neuralgias, migraines, and myofascial injuries. To date, no treatment guidelines exist for PTH management except for conservative modalities, such as cognitive rest, physical therapy, and neuropathic pain medications, all of which have minimal evidence to support them. The investigators propose a randomized, controlled, clinical trial and prospective follow-up study to evaluate the effect of invasive procedures such as occipital nerve block and cervical medial branch block in the management of PTH.

Adolescents and adults will be recruited from Boston Children's Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Pain clinics, Concussion clinics and Headache clinics. Headaches and neck pain following a concussion are potentially treatable and resolve over time. Nerve blockade may enhance the recovery of appropriate neural circuits involved in the pathophysiology of a chronic headache. Currently, no evidence-based guidelines exist for treatment of PTH. Adoption of "brain rest" for 1–2 weeks, followed by gradual return to activity and avoiding "second-impact syndrome" are current practice. The use of medications controlling neuropathic pain is of partial benefit for some. Adverse effects like sedation, mood changes, cardiac side effects of pharmacologic agents are often not compatible with the demands of athletics. For those patients where sports performance is paramount, they may therefore not be able to tolerate regular medications.

The incidence of chronic post-concussive headaches at one year is 8. 4%
- 35% and at four years is up to 25%. Therefore, patients can have a significant disability from their post-traumatic headaches for many years after their injury. Without appropriate treatment, these headaches can remain as chronic headaches. Over-the-counter and other symptomatic medication overuse can exacerbate and prolong PTH significantly, secondary to rebound headaches. Successful treatment is essential since PTH limits return to sports as well as more general activities of living, such as work and school.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^116Lm55W]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current ICHD-3 guidelines for acute headache attributed to a mild traumatic injury to the head are based upon expert opinion rather than evidence. The Toronto Concussion Study is one of the few studies to systematically and prospectively evaluate acute headaches attributed to head injury within the first week post-concussion in a general (non-compensable injury) population.

Out of 302 patients with diagnosed concussions by ED physicians, almost all patients (92%) examined within a week post-injury at the Hull-Ellis Concussion and Research Clinic post-concussion endorsed acute PTH. Those presenting with acute PTH at their initial clinic visit all met ICHD-3 criteria for acute headaches attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head and were carefully and thoughtfully evaluated.

The results of our study validate the current ICHD-3 criteria for acute headaches attributed to head injury. The Toronto Concussion Study provides meaningful evidence to support the ICHD-3 assertion there are no defining clinical characteristics of acute PTH (i.e. pain frequency, duration, location, quality, associated symptoms, provoking and aggravating factors are heterogeneous). The most reported headache frequency was daily and intermittent (59%) or daily and continuous (25%). Headache location was highly variable and was not correlated with the site of injury. In terms of primary headache quality, the most common quality was pressure/squeezing/tightening in 69% of patients whereas throbbing/pulsing was endorsed by 22%. Very few patients had neuropathic-type head pain (stabbing). 41% of patient had more than one headache phenotype. Commonly associated symptoms included photophobia (74%), phonophobia (72%) and nausea (55%). Trigeminal autonomic symptoms occurred in some patients but were much less common.
