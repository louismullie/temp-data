## Question

What about testosterone in low libido

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of testosterone therapy for low libido, distinguishing men from women and integrating evidence, guidelines, and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions of low libido and hypogonadism. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for testosterone therapy in men, including thresholds, formulations, and monitoring. Next, I will examine the evidence in women, including dosing, safety, and regulatory status. After that, I need to consider special populations and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight uncertainties that require shared decision-making and follow-up planning.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't jump to conclusions. Low libido, or hypoactive sexual desire disorder, is a distressing lack or absence of sexual desire and must be distinguished from erectile dysfunction, which is a separate domain of sexual function; both can coexist, but their mechanisms and responses to therapy differ, so I need to keep that distinction clear in my mind and in counseling. In men, testosterone deficiency is typically defined by consistent symptoms such as reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, or decreased morning erections plus unequivocally low morning total testosterone, often using a threshold around 300 ng/dL, with confirmation on a second fasting morning sample to avoid transient or assay-related variability [^114G25rR] [^111GBUFL] [^111EbdnM].

> Now, I should review the evidence base for men with low libido and biochemical hypogonadism. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and durability of benefit. High-quality trials and meta-analyses show that testosterone therapy improves libido and overall sexual activity in hypogonadal men, with modest standardized mean differences and sustained effects over 12 to 24 months in some studies, although erectile function gains are smaller and less consistent than desire outcomes [^111VeSAz] [^11219QK6] [^111u6X2r]. I need to ensure I anchor this to thresholds: benefits are clearest when baseline testosterone is unequivocally low, whereas men with normal testosterone generally do not experience meaningful libido improvements from testosterone therapy, reinforcing the need to confirm biochemical deficiency before treating [^116osqrf] [^113NQqzd].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline positions and practical prescribing details so recommendations are actionable. The Endocrine Society supports testosterone therapy to improve libido in men with confirmed hypogonadism, while the American College of Physicians suggests discussing a trial in men with age-related low testosterone and sexual dysfunction, with explicit plans to reassess and discontinue if there is no improvement within about 12 months; both emphasize shared decision-making and cost-conscious formulation choices, with intramuscular preparations offering similar effectiveness and harms at lower cost than transdermal options [^116osqrf] [^1168ToX4] [^117MhTif] [^116KAm6X]. I should double-check monitoring: measure hematocrit at 3 to 6 months, recheck symptoms and testosterone levels to ensure the dose achieves a mid-normal range, and discontinue if goals are not met, documenting the rationale and patient preferences throughout [^115dU9ax] [^117MhTif].

> Next, I will examine the evidence in women, but I need to be cautious because the regulatory landscape and safety profile differ. Randomized trials in carefully selected postmenopausal women with distressing low desire show that physiologic-dose transdermal testosterone, typically around 300 micrograms daily, increases satisfying sexual episodes and desire, with modest effect sizes and a dose-response pattern; however, long-term safety, especially breast outcomes, remains uncertain and no testosterone product is FDA-approved for women in the United States [^113xxYe5] [^114Nb87q] [^116xiabA]. Let me reconsider the dose-response point: exceeding physiologic female ranges does not further improve desire and may worsen side effects, supporting a conservative, mid-normal female testosterone target during therapy [^111EXbkc] [^116BGQd1].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring in women so I don't understate risks. Androgenic adverse effects such as hirsutism and acne are dose-related and generally mild at physiologic doses, but breast cancer signals are mixed across studies; a large RCT reported a small number of breast cancer diagnoses without a clear causal signal, and observational cohorts have not shown a statistically significant increase, yet the absence of definitive long-term data necessitates cautious, individualized use with explicit counseling and close follow-up [^113xxYe5] [^112eq3Nf] [^114Nb87q]. I need to ensure I emphasize that testosterone is reserved for women with distressing low desire after addressing biopsychosocial contributors and optimizing estrogen status when relevant, given the centrality of nonandrogenic factors in female sexual desire [^116BGQd1] [^116xiabA].

> But wait, what about special populations and contraindications where testosterone may be inappropriate or harmful. In men who desire fertility, exogenous testosterone suppresses spermatogenesis and should be avoided; alternative strategies such as hCG or selective estrogen modulators should be considered instead, and this point must be made explicit during counseling [^115R2Zsk] [^1149xne2]. I should also review chronic opioid use, obesity, sleep apnea, and diabetes, which commonly suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis; addressing reversible causes and comorbidities can normalize testosterone in a meaningful fraction of men, so testosterone therapy should generally follow, not precede, optimization of these factors [^1111tSrY] [^1178MmgM] [^114tZLyY].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations for men so they are clinically usable. First, confirm symptoms and signs consistent with androgen deficiency and obtain two separate fasting morning total testosterone measurements; if total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal, add a reliable free testosterone assay to clarify the diagnosis, and avoid diagnosing deficiency on a single low value [^111EbdnM] [^111GBUFL]. Second, screen for and treat reversible causes of secondary hypogonadism, including obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and medication-induced suppression, and consider a monitored therapeutic trial only if symptoms persist and testosterone remains unequivocally low after 6 to 12 months of optimization [^1178MmgM] [^114tZLyY]. Third, if a trial is undertaken, set measurable goals for libido and sexual activity, reassess at 3 to 6 months, and discontinue if there is no meaningful benefit; if effective, continue with periodic monitoring of symptoms, testosterone, and hematocrit, documenting shared decision-making at each step [^117MhTif] [^115dU9ax].

> For women, I should confirm a cautious, stepwise approach. First, exclude modifiable contributors to low desire such as relationship distress, mood disorders, dyspareunia, and medication effects; then, ensure adequate estrogen status if relevant, as testosterone is typically layered onto estrogen-replete states in trials and guidelines [^116BGQd1] [^114Nb87q]. Second, if distressing low desire persists after these steps, consider a time-limited, closely monitored trial of low-dose transdermal testosterone targeting female physiologic levels, with explicit counseling about off-label status, uncertain long-term safety, and the need to stop if benefits are not realized or adverse effects emerge [^113xxYe5] [^116xiabA]. I should double-check that monitoring includes tracking of androgenic side effects and, given the breast signal uncertainty, shared decision-making about continuing therapy beyond the short term [^114Nb87q].

> Finally, I need to ensure the overall message reflects the evidence hierarchy and uncertainties. In men with unequivocal biochemical hypogonadism and low libido, testosterone therapy has moderate-certainty benefit for libido and sexual activity, with small effects on erectile function and little to no benefit for energy or mood, so expectations should be calibrated and therapy individualized with predefined stopping rules [^111u6X2r] [^116n5Jct]. In women, benefits are modest and safety is uncertain beyond the short term, so testosterone should be reserved for carefully selected, estrogen-replete patients after addressing biopsychosocial drivers, with transparent counseling and vigilant monitoring [^113xxYe5] [^116BGQd1]. Hold on, I should verify that I have emphasized the key principle: treat confirmed deficiency in men and treat distressing symptoms after reversible causes are addressed in both sexes, aligning choices with patient values and evolving evidence [^116osqrf] [^114Nb87q].

Testosterone therapy is **most effective for low libido** in men with confirmed biochemical hypogonadism [^116osqrf], producing moderate improvements in sexual desire and activity [^114uHgia] [^111VeSAz]. In eugonadal men, testosterone has **little to no benefit** for libido and is not recommended [^113NQqzd] [^116osqrf]. In postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, low-dose transdermal testosterone can modestly improve desire and satisfying sexual events [^113xxYe5], but long-term safety remains uncertain and therapy should be reserved for carefully selected, estrogen-replete patients after other causes are addressed [^116xiabA] [^116BGQd1]. Testosterone is not indicated for low libido in men without hypogonadism or in premenopausal women, and treatment decisions should be individualized with shared decision-making and close monitoring [^116osqrf] [^111czeX3] [^112gw72Z].

## Physiological role of testosterone in libido

Testosterone plays a **central role in sexual desire** across sexes by modulating dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways in the brain [^notfound]. In men, it supports sexual motivation, arousal, and erectile function; in women, it contributes to sexual desire and responsiveness, though estrogen also modulates desire [^113NQqzd] [^115wW8UD].

## Testosterone therapy in men with low libido

### Evidence supporting testosterone therapy

- **Hypogonadal men**: In men with confirmed low testosterone, testosterone therapy significantly improves libido, sexual activity, and overall sexual satisfaction compared with placebo [^116osqrf] [^111VeSAz].
- **Magnitude of benefit**: Meta-analyses show moderate improvements in libido and sexual activity (standardized mean difference ~0.35) [^notfound].
- **Duration of benefit**: Improvements are typically seen within 3–6 months and are sustained with ongoing therapy [^111VeSAz] [^116fWNNr].

---

### Limitations and considerations

- **Eugonadal men**: Testosterone therapy does not significantly improve libido in men with normal testosterone levels [^116osqrf].
- **Side effects**: Risks include erythrocytosis, acne, gynecomastia, and potential cardiovascular concerns; regular monitoring is required [^11219QK6] [^1149xne2].
- **Contraindications**: Untreated prostate cancer, severe cardiovascular disease, and desire for fertility are contraindications [^115dU9ax] [^115R2Zsk].

## Testosterone therapy in women with low libido

### Evidence supporting testosterone therapy

In postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), **testosterone therapy** — particularly transdermal patches delivering 300 micrograms/day — modestly increases satisfying sexual episodes and improves sexual desire and distress [^113xxYe5] [^114Nb87q]. Benefits are most pronounced in estrogen-replete women, and long-term safety data remain limited [^116xiabA] [^115x8WvR].

---

### Limitations and considerations

- **Safety concerns**: Potential risks include hirsutism, acne, and uncertain long-term effects on breast and cardiovascular health [^113xxYe5] [^114Nb87q].
- **Regulatory status**: No testosterone formulation is currently FDA-approved for women; use is off-label and requires careful monitoring [^116xiabA] [^1174dHYa].
- **Patient selection**: Therapy should be reserved for carefully selected, estrogen-replete women after other causes of low libido are addressed [^116xiabA] [^111dcfL9].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Population** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Men with hypogonadism | Testosterone therapy is recommended to improve libido and sexual function | High [^116osqrf] [^115x7nqZ] |
| Men with normal testosterone | Testosterone therapy is not recommended for low libido | High [^116osqrf] [^113NQqzd] |
| Postmenopausal women with HSDD | Consider low-dose transdermal testosterone after other causes are addressed | Moderate [^113xxYe5] [^114Nb87q] |
| Premenopausal women | Testosterone therapy is not recommended | Low [^notfound] |

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, exercise, and management of comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, sleep apnea) can improve libido and testosterone levels [^114tZLyY] [^1178MmgM].
- **Psychological therapies**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy and sex therapy address psychological contributors to low libido [^notfound].
- **Pharmacological alternatives**: PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil) are effective for erectile dysfunction but do not directly improve libido [^115u8pGD].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Testosterone therapy is **most effective for low libido** in men with confirmed hypogonadism, with moderate, sustained benefits [^111VeSAz]. In women, low-dose transdermal testosterone may modestly improve desire in carefully selected, estrogen-replete postmenopausal patients, but long-term safety remains uncertain [^115x8WvR] [^114Nb87q]. Testosterone is not indicated for low libido in men with normal levels or in premenopausal women; treatment decisions should be individualized with shared decision-making and close monitoring [^116osqrf] [^112gw72Z].

### Does testosterone have a role in erectile function? [^113R7Wiw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Despite the well-established role of testosterone in enhancing libido, its exact contribution to erections in men remains unclear. The main objectives of this review are to clarify the role of testosterone in erectile function and evaluate its therapeutic value in men with erectile dysfunction (ED).

Methods

Review of the relevant literature (English, French, and Spanish) from 1939 to June 2005 was conducted using data sources from MEDLINE, endocrinology text books, and hand searching of cross-references from original articles and reviews. Clinical trials, animal studies, case reports, reviews, and guidelines of major associations were included.

Results

Animal and preliminary human studies suggest that testosterone may facilitate erection by acting as vasodilator of the penile arterioles and cavernous sinusoids. Following castration, most, but not all, men had partial or complete loss of erection. Hypogonadism is not a common finding in ED, occurring in about 5% of cases, and in general, there is lack of association between serum testosterone levels, when present in normal or moderately low levels, and erectile function. Most trials using testosterone for treatment of ED in hypogonadal men suffer from methodological problems and report inconsistent results, but overall, suggest that testosterone may be superior to placebo. Erectile function is more likely to improve with testosterone therapy in patients with severe degrees of hypogonadism. Testosterone treatment may ameliorate the response to the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in hypogonadal men and men with low-normal serum testosterone. Repeated measurement of morning serum total testosterone is a fairly accurate and easy method to evaluate androgenecity, but measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone is recommended in conditions that alter the levels of sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), such as in the elderly and in obesity.

Conclusions

Available data suggest that in most men circulating levels of testosterone, well below the normal range, are essential for normal erection and that higher levels of serum testosterone may not have major impact on erectile function. Screening for hypogonadism in all men with ED is necessary to identify cases of severe hypogonadism and some cases of mild to moderate hypogonadism, who may benefit from testosterone treatment.

### Androgen therapy in women [^116xiabA]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Androgens are believed to have an important biologic role in women, particularly in regulation of libido and sexual arousal, although much about their function on other systems in women is unknown. Testosterone, the primary ovarian androgen, has been used to treat carefully selected postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). However, testosterone use in women has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of uncertainties regarding the effectiveness and long-term safety of this strategy. An intravaginal form of the adrenal androgen, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been approved by the FDA to treat genitourinary syndrome of menopause. In this article, we review the current knowledge regarding the role of androgens and their clinical use in women. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed for publications describing the role and clinical use of androgens in women. We used the search terms "HSDD", "DHEA in women", "testosterone in women", and "androgens in women", and reviewed most references from all relevant articles. Most randomized placebo-controlled trials show an improvement in sexual function with low-dose testosterone therapy in select postmenopausal women with HSDD. Although this strategy appears to be safe in the short term and no major safety concerns have emerged thus far, long-term effects on cardiovascular risk and breast cancer incidence are not known. A trial of low-dose testosterone therapy may be considered for carefully selected postmenopausal women with HSDD, as long as other contributors to sexual dysfunction have been adequately addressed. However, patients need careful counseling regarding the lack of long-term safety data, and close clinical and laboratory monitoring of these women is recommended to avoid supraphysiologic dosing.

### Testosterone therapy improves erectile function and libido in hypogonadal men [^112d7AY1]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Erectile dysfunction and decreased libido are common complaints in the older male population. Recent studies have elucidated the role testosterone therapy (TTh) can play in men with low testosterone levels. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of these findings and the utility of TTh. We specifically examine the role of TTh on erectile function, coadministration with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and libido.

Recent Findings

Recent publications suggest that TTh improves mild erectile dysfunction, though may be less useful in men with more severe erectile dysfunction. In men unresponsive to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and with mild erectile dysfunction, TTh can further improve erectile function. TTh has also shown consistent benefit in improving libido in men with low testosterone levels at baseline, with no additional improvements once testosterone levels are normalized.

Summary

The available literature supports a role for TTh in men with low testosterone levels, erectile dysfunction, and low libido, with symptomatic improvement in these men.

### Testosterone for midlife women: the hormone of desire? [^115hSvRm]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Testosterone declines with aging, so most midlife women have "low" testosterone levels. Because libido also declines with aging, and distressing sexual problems peak at midlife, should midlife women with low libido and associated distress be treated with testosterone? This Practice Pearl reports clinical trial evidence, reviews the risks, and explains how testosterone might be used in a clinical setting. For women who may be considering a trial of testosterone therapy, limitations and adverse effects should be disclosed and appropriate monitoring instituted once treatment has begun.

### Effects of testosterone on sexual function in men: results of a meta-analysis [^113NQqzd]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The role of androgen decline in the sexual activity of adult males is controversial. To clarify whether sexual function would benefit from testosterone (T) treatment in men with partially or severely reduced serum T levels, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies published in the past 30 years. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the effects of T on the different domains of sexual life.

Data Source

A comprehensive search of all published randomized clinical trials was performed in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Current Contents databases.

Review Methods

Guided by prespecified criteria, software-assisted data abstraction and quality assessed by two independent reviewers, a total of 17 randomized placebo-controlled trials were found to be eligible. For each domain of sexual function we calculated the standardized mean difference relative to T and reported the results of pooled estimates of T treatment using the random effect model of meta-analysis. Heterogeneity, reproducibility and consistency of the findings across studies were explored using sensitivity and meta-regression analysis.

Results

Overall, 656 subjects were evaluated: 284 were randomized to T, 284 to placebo (P) and 88 treated in cross-over. The median study length was 3 months (range 1–36 months). Our meta-analysis showed that in men with an average T level at baseline below 12 nmol/l, T treatment moderately improved the number of nocturnal erections, sexual thoughts and motivation, number of successful intercourses, scores of erectile function and overall sexual satisfaction, whereas T had no effect on erectile function in eugonadal men compared to placebo. Heterogeneity was explored by grouping studies according to the characteristics of the study population. A cut-off value of 10 nmol/l for the mean T of the study population failed to predict the effect of treatment, whereas the presence of risk factors for vasculogenic erectile dysfunction (ED), comorbidities and shorter evaluation periods were associated with greater treatment effects in the studies performed in hypogonadal, but not in eugonadal, men. Meta-regression analysis showed that the effects of T on erectile function, but not libido, were inversely related to the mean baseline T concentration. The meta-analysis of available studies indicates that T treatment might be useful for improving vasculogenic ED in selected subjects with low or low-normal T levels. The evidence for a beneficial effect of T treatment on erectile function should be tempered with the caveats that the effect tends to decline over time, is progressively smaller with increasing baseline T levels, and long-term safety data are not available. The present meta-analysis highlights the need, and pitfalls, for large-scale, long-term, randomized controlled trials to formally investigate the efficacy of T replacement in symptomatic middle-aged and elderly men with reduced T levels and ED.

### Testosterone therapy for reduced libido in women [^114JGuQH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Modest benefit has been shown from transdermal testosterone therapy given to postmenopausal women with reduced sexual desire. An increased frequency of satisfying sexual encounters and intensity of sexual desire and response has been shown in medically and psychiatrically healthy women able to have 2–3 satisfying sexual experiences each month before therapy commences. Women more clearly sexually dysfunctional in keeping with currently proposed definitions of sexual disorder have not been studied. Numerous factors are known to influence women's sexual desire with mood and feelings towards the partner showing the most robust associations. How to identify women whose low desire might stem from low testosterone activity remains unknown: neither serum levels of testosterone nor its metabolites correlate with desire or function. Production of androgens in the brain, sensitivity of the androgen receptors, and activity of cofactors are all potentially relevant confounds. The long-term safety of systemic testosterone with or without estrogen is unknown but necessary as women's sexual lives tend to endure as long as there is an active partner.

### Testosterone therapy in women: a review [^111dcfL9]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2005). Low credibility.

Female sexual dysfunction is a complex problem with multiple overlapping etiologies. Androgens play an important role in healthy female sexual function, especially in stimulating sexual interest and in maintaining desire. There are a multitude of reasons why women can have low androgen levels with the most common reasons being age, oophorectomy and the use of oral estrogens. Symptoms of androgen insufficiency include absent or greatly diminished sexual motivation and/or desire, that is, libido, persistent unexplainable fatigue or lack of energy, and a lack of sense of well being. Although there is no androgen preparation that has been specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of Women's Sexual Interest/Desire Disorder or for the treatment of androgen insufficiency in women, androgen therapy has been used off-label to treat low libido and sexual dysfunction in women for over 40 y. Most clinical trials in postmenopausal women with loss of libido have demonstrated that the addition of testosterone to estrogen significantly improved multiple facets of sexual functioning including libido and sexual desire, arousal, frequency and satisfaction. In controlled clinical trials of up to 2 y duration of testosterone therapy, women receiving androgen therapy tolerated androgen administration well and demonstrated no serious side effects. The results of these trials suggest that testosterone therapy in the low-dose regimens is efficacious for the treatment of Women's Sexual Interest and Desire Disorder in postmenopausal women who are adequately estrogenized. Based on the evidence of current studies, it is reasonable to consider testosterone therapy for a symptomatic androgen-deficient woman with Women's Sexual Interest and Desire Disorder.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116osqrf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — sexual function with testosterone (T) therapy — reports that in hypogonadal men with low libido, T treatment "is associated with significantly greater improvement in libido, erectile function, and sexual activity vs placebo", but "does not significantly improve sexual function and activity in men who do not have low T concentrations in the hypogonadal range". For men using phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, randomized controlled trials "have failed to demonstrate further improvements in erectile function with the addition of T", and "T therapy does not improve ejaculatory function in men with low T concentrations and ejaculatory dysfunction".

### Hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction: the role for testosterone therapy [^115u8pGD]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

The role of low testosterone levels in erectile dysfunction (ED) remains unclear. Both organic and psychogenic factors contribute to ED, with vasculogenic causes being the most common etiology. Approximately 10–20% of patients with ED are diagnosed with hormonal abnormalities. At the physiologic level, two second messenger systems are involved in mediating erections, one involving cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the other involving cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil promote the cGMP pathway, while alprostadil affects the cAMP pathway. Evidence is strong that, in animal systems, testosterone has direct effects on erectile tissue. However, although testosterone clearly has an impact on libido in humans, its effect on penile function is less clear. Evaluation of ED includes medical, sexual, and psychosocial history assessments, as well as laboratory tests to check for diabetes and hormonal abnormalities. Initial interventions should involve correction of potentially reversible causes of ED, such as hypogonadism. First-line therapy for other patients is typically oral PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil. For patients who fail treatment with PDE5 inhibitors, local therapies such as intracavernous alprostadil are highly successful. Recent data also support the success of combination therapy with sildenafil and testosterone. This opens the possibility of other combinations of testosterone and other treatments of ED. The ability to exploit multiple pathways in the physiologic processes leading to erection may help improve therapy for ED.

### Androgen deficiency in aging and metabolically challenged men [^116p9i5G]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Androgen deficiency in aging men is common, and the potential sequelae are numerous. In addition to low libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased bone density, depressed mood, and decline in cognition, studies suggest strong correlations between low testosterone, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome. Because causation and its directionality remain uncertain, the functional and cardiovascular risks associated with androgen deficiency have led to intense investigation of testosterone replacement therapy in older men. Although promising, evidence for definitive benefit or detriment is not conclusive, and treatment of late-onset hypogonadism is complicated.

### A sex-specific dose-response curve for testosterone: could excessive testosterone limit sexual interaction in women? [^111EXbkc]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone treatment increases sexual desire and well-being in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder; however, many studies have shown only modest benefits limited to moderate doses. Unlike men, available data indicate women show a bell-shaped dose-response curve for testosterone, wherein a threshold dosage of testosterone leads to desirable sexual function effects, but exceeding this threshold results in a lack of further positive sexual effects or may have a negative impact. Emotional and physical side-effects of excess testosterone, including aggression and virilization, may counteract the modest benefits on sexual interaction, providing a possible explanation for a threshold dose of testosterone in women. In this commentary, we will review and critically analyze data supporting a curvilinear dose-response relationship between testosterone treatment and sexual activity in women with low libido, and also explore possible explanations for this observed relationship. Understanding optimal dosing of testosterone unique to women may bring us one step closer to overcoming regulatory barriers in treating female sexual dysfunction.

### Testosterone and cardiovascular disease [^111aKJmZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Testosterone (T) is the principal male sex hormone. As men age, T levels typically fall. Symptoms of low T include decreased libido, vasomotor instability, and decreased bone mineral density. Other symptoms may include depression, fatigue, erectile dysfunction, and reduced muscle strength/mass. Epidemiology studies show that low levels of T are associated with more atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and cardiovascular events. However, treating hypogonadism in the aging male has resulted in discrepant results in regard to its effect on cardiovascular events. Emerging studies suggest that T may have a future role in treating heart failure, angina, and myocardial ischemia. A large, prospective, long-term study of T replacement, with a primary endpoint of a composite of adverse cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or cardiovascular death, is needed. The Food and Drug Administration recently put additional restrictions on T replacement therapy labeling and called for additional studies to determine its cardiac safety.

### Are the endocrine society's clinical practice guidelines on androgen therapy in women misguided? A commentary [^113fjzko]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines on Androgen Therapy in Women (henceforth referred to as the Guidelines) do not necessarily represent the opinion held by the many health-care professionals and clinicians who are specialized in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of women's health in androgen insufficiency states. The recommendations provided in the published Guidelines are neither accurate nor complete. We disagree with the therapeutic nihilism promoted by these Guidelines. The members of the Guidelines Panel (henceforth referred to as the Panel), in their own disclaimer, stated that the Guidelines do not establish a standard of care. Based on data available in the contemporary literature, on the role of androgens in women's health, we provide in this commentary a point-by-point discussion of the arguments made by the Panel in arriving at their recommendations. It is our view that the Guidelines are not based on the preponderance of scientific evidence. Health-care professionals, physicians, and scientists often disagree when determining how best to address and manage new and emerging clinical issues. This is where we stand now as we endeavor to understand the role of androgens in a woman's health and welfare. Indeed, some basic facts are not in contention. All agree that dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) production from the adrenal gland begins during the preteen years, peaks in the mid 20s, then declines progressively over time. In contrast, ovarian androgen (i.e., testosterone) secretion commences at puberty, is sustained during a woman's peak reproductive years and declines as a woman ages, with a more rapid and steep decrease after surgical menopause. However, there are ample data to suggest that adrenal androgens play a role in the development of axillary and pubic hair, and that testosterone is critical for women's libido and sexual function. We take this opportunity to invite members of the Panel on Androgen Therapy in Women to discuss, clarify, comment, or rebut any of the points made in this Commentary. It is our goal to elevate this debate in order to provide women who are afflicted with androgen insufficiency and sexual disorders with the highest quality health care and to relieve their distress and suffering, as well as to improve their quality of life.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116NxGuM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Systematic review methods and outcomes framework — Reviewers searched for studies published in English from 1980 through May 2019 and searched MEDLINE and PsycINFO from inception to November 2018; the guideline used GRADE to report evidence and grade recommendations, interpreted standardized mean differences as small (SMD, 0.2), medium (SMD, 0.5), and large (SMD, 0.8), and rated quality of life, erectile function, cognitive function, and specified harms as critical outcomes while rating energy and vitality, physical function, mood (depression), fracture reduction, libido, and lower urinary tract symptoms as important outcomes.

### Testosterone treatment and sexual function in older men with low testosterone levels [^114uHgia]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

The Testosterone Trials are a coordinated set of seven trials to determine the efficacy of T in symptomatic men ≥ 65 years old with unequivocally low T levels. Initial results of the Sexual Function Trial showed that T improved sexual activity, sexual desire, and erectile function.

Objective

To assess the responsiveness of specific sexual activities to T treatment; to relate hormone changes to changes in sexual function; and to determine predictive baseline characteristics and T threshold for sexual outcomes.

Design

A placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Twelve academic medical centers in the United States.

Participants

A total of 470 men ≥ 65 years of age with low libido, average T < 275 ng/dL, and a partner willing to have sexual intercourse at least twice a month.

Methods

Men were assigned to take T gel or placebo for 1 year. Sexual function was assessed by three questionnaires every 3 months: the Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire, the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Function, and the International Index of Erectile Function.

Results

Compared with placebo, T administration significantly improved 10 of 12 measures of sexual activity. Incremental increases in total and free T and estradiol levels were associated with improvements in sexual activity and desire, but not erectile function. No threshold T level was observed for any outcome, and none of the 27 baseline characteristics predicted responsiveness to T.

Conclusions

In older men with low libido and low T levels, improvements in sexual desire and activity in response to T treatment were related to the magnitude of increases in T and estradiol levels, but there was no clear evidence of a threshold effect.

### Testosterone for' late-onset hypogonadism' in men? [^112a5twd]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy is indicated in men with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone due to classical primary or secondary hypogonadism.1–8 Of note, however, some testosterone preparations are also specifically licensed for "male climacteric symptoms like decreased libido".1–3 This indication is based on the concept of 'late-onset hypogonadism', a term used to describe the decline in testosterone concentrations with age plus associated symptoms (by analogy with the female menopause/climacteric).9 Other terms for 'late-onset hypogonadism' include 'partial androgen deficiency in the ageing male'. It has also been known as 'andropause' or, colloquially, 'male menopause', but these latter terms are not usually used by specialists nowadays. Here we discuss whether 'late-onset hypogonadism' is a distinct medical entity, and whether testosterone replacement has a role in older men with low testosterone concentrations but not classical hypogonadism.

### Testosterone and the cardiovascular system: a comprehensive review of the basic science literature [^117TBSfn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

An increasing number of elderly men are receiving exogenous testosterone to treat hypogonadism, low libido, and general weakness. The impact of testosterone on the cardiovascular system is controversial. Elderly men are typically at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events than age‐matched women, and one study suggested that exogenous testosterone was associated with an increase in adverse cardiovascular events in this population. In contrast, other clinical studies suggest that testosterone is beneficial to the cardiovascular system and that low levels of testosterone negatively affect the cardiovascular system. –

Because of this controversy, we sought to determine the current status of basic science studies that have examined the effects of testosterone on the cardiovascular system in experimental models.

### The relationship between libido and testosterone levels in aging men [^113wyffD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Although it is known that serum testosterone (T) concentrations are related to libido, the strength of that relationship in community-dwelling men has not yet been determined.

Objective

Our objective was to assess the strength and significance of the association between aging men's self-reports of libido and serum T concentrations.

Design

Our study was a community-based evaluation of men's health and aging, including three data collection waves: baseline (T1, 1987–1989) and follow-ups (T2, 1995–1997; T3, 2002–2004). Libido was measured on a 14-point scale assessing self-reported frequency of desire and thoughts/fantasies; low libido was defined as a score of less than 7 of 14.

Setting

We conducted an epidemiological study in greater Boston, Massachusetts.

Participants

There were 1632 men aged 40–70 yr at baseline, with follow-up on 922 (56%) at 9 yr (T2) and 623 (38%) at 15 yr (T3).

Main Outcome Measures

We assessed total and calculated bioavailable T.

Results

Three hundred eighteen (19%) subjects reported low libido at baseline. Libido and T displayed a significant association. However, the difference in mean T levels between those subjects with low libido and those without was small; analyses indicated a 3.4 ng/dl (0.12 nmol/liter) increase in total T per unit increase in libido. Subjects reporting low libido exhibited an increased but modest probability of exhibiting low T. Dividing T concentrations by the number of androgen receptor gene cytosine, adenine, guanine repeats did not enhance associations.

Conclusions

Libido and T concentrations are strongly related at the population level. However, the value of individual patient reports of reduced libido as indicators of low T levels is open to question.

### Medical treatment of hypogonadism in men [^111Mtdh5]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urologists may commonly diagnose hypogonadism in adult men experiencing an age-related decline in serum testosterone. Low serum testosterone in conjunction with symptoms such as decreased libido, fatigue, memory deficit, or decreased vitality is described as testosterone deficiency syndrome. There are numerous therapeutic options, although each is unique in its formulation, administration, and side-effect profile. For this reason, treatment can prove to be challenging for each unique patient case. The clinician must carefully monitor key serum markers before and during treatment. With careful dosing and monitoring, therapeutic benefit can be achieved reliably and sustainably.

### Role of testosterone in maintaining lean body mass and bone density in HIV-infected patients [^116hZW7s]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Low testosterone levels are common in both men and women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and may contribute to loss of lean body mass and AIDS wasting. Causes of low testosterone levels are complex and may include chronic illness, HIV infection and its complications, medications used to treat HIV and opportunistic diseases, and normal aging-related declines. In the majority of studies addressing the use of testosterone treatment in HIV-infected patients, testosterone has been found to help prevent loss of lean body and muscle mass. Whether the combination of exercise and testosterone is more effective in preventing loss of lean body mass than either therapy alone is not yet clear and warrants further study. In addition to its effects on body composition, testosterone treatment results in improved mood and libido in HIV-infected women and increased bone mineral density in HIV-infected men. Testosterone may thus make a valuable contribution to the treatment of HIV-infected individuals. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003) 15, Suppl 4, S21-S25. doi:10.1038/sj.ijir.3901032

### Effect of testosterone replacement therapy on sexual function and hypogonadal symptoms in men with hypogonadism [^111VeSAz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Few long-term randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in improving sexual function and hypogonadal symptoms in men with hypogonadism and whether effects are sustained beyond 12 months.

Objective

The Testosterone Replacement therapy for Assessment of long-term Vascular Events and efficacy ResponSE in hypogonadal men (TRAVERSE) study evaluated the effect of TRT on major adverse cardiovascular events in middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism. The Sexual Function Study, nested within the parent trial, determined testosterone's efficacy in improving sexual activity, hypogonadal symptoms, libido, and erectile function among men reporting low libido.

Methods

Among 5204 men, 45–80 years, with 2 testosterone concentrations < 300 ng/dL, hypogonadal symptoms, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or increased CVD risk enrolled in the TRAVERSE trial, 1161 with low libido were enrolled in the Sexual Function Study (587 randomized to receive 1.62% testosterone gel and 574 to placebo gel for the duration of their participation in the study). Primary outcome was change from baseline in sexual activity score. Secondary outcomes included hypogonadal symptoms, erectile function, and sexual desire.

Results

TRT was associated with significantly greater improvement in sexual activity than placebo (estimated mean [95% CI] between-group difference 0.49 [0.19,0.79] and 0.47 [0.11, 0.83] acts per day at 6 and 12 months, respectively; omnibus test P = 0.011); treatment effect was maintained at 24 months. TRT improved hypogonadal symptoms and sexual desire, but not erectile function, compared with placebo.

Conclusion

In middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism and low libido, TRT for 2 years improved sexual activity, hypogonadal symptoms, and sexual desire, but not erectile function.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112rVxjX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m 2 and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

Conditions with a high prevalence of low testosterone (T) for targeted measurement — conditions in which there is a high prevalence of low T concentrations and for which we suggest measurement of serum T concentrations include: pituitary mass, radiation to the pituitary region, or other diseases of the sellar region; treatment with medications that affect T production or metabolism, such as opioids and glucocorticoids; withdrawal from long-term AAS use; HIV-associated weight loss; infertility; osteoporosis or low trauma fracture; and low libido or erectile dysfunction.

### Testosterone for low libido in postmenopausal women not taking estrogen [^113xxYe5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen therapy are unknown.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week trial in which 814 women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder were randomly assigned to receive a patch delivering 150 or 300 microg of testosterone per day or placebo. Efficacy was measured to week 24; safety was evaluated over a period of 52 weeks, with a subgroup of participants followed for an additional year. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 24 in the 4-week frequency of satisfying sexual episodes.

Results

At 24 weeks, the increase in the 4-week frequency of satisfying sexual episodes was significantly greater in the group receiving 300 microg of testosterone per day than in the placebo group (an increase of 2.1 episodes vs. 0.7, P < 0.001) but not in the group receiving 150 microg per day (1.2 episodes, P = 0.11). As compared with placebo, both doses of testosterone were associated with significant increases in desire (300 microg per day, P < 0.001; 150 microg per day, P = 0.04) and decreases in distress (300 microg per day, P < 0.001; 150 microg per day, P = 0.04). The rate of androgenic adverse events - primarily unwanted hair growth - was higher in the group receiving 300 microg of testosterone per day than in the placebo group (30.0% vs. 23.1%). Breast cancer was diagnosed in four women who received testosterone (as compared with none who received placebo); one of the four received the diagnosis in the first 4 months of the study period, and one, in retrospect, had symptoms before undergoing randomization.

Conclusions

In postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen therapy, treatment with a patch delivering 300 microg of testosterone per day resulted in a modest but meaningful improvement in sexual function. The long-term effects of testosterone, including effects on the breast, remain uncertain. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00131495.)

### Welcoming low testosterone as a cardiovascular risk factor [^112vcYYi]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

Testosterone is the predominant sex hormone in man. A young man produces 3–10 mg of testosterone daily that results in serum levels of 300–1000 ng per 100 ml. The traditional consequences of male hypogonadism are well known. These include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased muscle mass and strength, increased fat mass, changes in mood and energy, osteoporosis and decreased sexual hair. 1 However, for the past two decades, many studies have found an association between low serum testosterone levels and various cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. In addition, some epidemiological studies have also linked low testosterone levels with CV and all-cause mortality. In this review, we will briefly touch upon the various CV risk factors that have been linked to low serum testosterone in men.

### Testosterone therapy increases sexual desire in ageing men with low-normal testosterone levels and symptoms of androgen deficiency [^113AvGc8]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2008). Low credibility.

Although decline in sexual function is a common reason for ageing men to seek advice regarding testosterone therapy, placebo-controlled trial data have been unable to show a consistent, beneficial role for testosterone. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of testosterone therapy on sexual function in non-obese ageing men with symptoms of androgen deficiency and low-normal serum testosterone levels. A total of 60 men aged 55 years or older in good general health with total testosterone (TT) levels < 15 nM, and with symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency, were randomized in a double-blinded protocol to transdermal testosterone patches or placebo for 12 months. Sexual function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function at weeks 0, 26 and 52. In men receiving testosterone TT levels increased by 30% (P = 0.01) and luteinizing hormone decreased by 50% (P < 0.001). Relative to placebo, testosterone therapy improved sexual desire (P = 0.04); however other parameters of sexual function including erectile function were unaffected by the treatment. Ageing men in good general health and with symptoms of androgen deficiency and low-normal serum testosterone levels receiving 12 months of transdermal testosterone therapy experienced, relative to placebo, improved sexual desire but no effect on other parameters of sexual function.

### Serum androgen profiles in women with premature ovarian insufficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117WJaYp]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

The consequences of androgen deficiency have been discussed in very few studies. Androgens are thought to be one of the basic prerequisites for a healthy woman. - A lack of androgens may lead to symptoms of sexual dysfunction, such as decreased libido, loss of sexual responsiveness, or decreased sexual arousal. - Other clinical symptoms are a diminished sense of well-being, dysphoric mood, cognitive dysfunction, and persistent, unexplained loss of energy. -

The role of androgens in maintaining a woman's health has been receiving increasing attention, but still, there is considerable controversy relating to the role of androgens in women, and its clinical significance.- Testosterone at supraphysiological, but not at physiological, levels enhance the effectiveness of low-dose estrogen therapies at increasing women's sexual desire; however, the mechanism by which supraphysiological testosterone increases women's sexual desire in combination with an estrogen remains unknown. Clinical evidence suggests that testosterone has anxiolytic and antidepressant benefits, with the potential to promote improved mood and mental health in women. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the protective effects of testosterone in males and females remain poorly understood. Selective androgens appear capable of improving early stages of folliculogenesis. Androgens, like T, appear effective in improving functional ovarian reserve in women with diminished ovarian reserve. A study found that a low-testosterone status is a potentially important step in the development of POI/POF in women with endometriosis. In women with diminished ovarian reserve, the basal T level presented a positive association with pregnancy outcome in in vitro fertilization.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — role of free testosterone: The Panel does not recommend using free testosterone measurements as the primary diagnostic method for testosterone deficiency, and total and free testosterone are not to be considered interchangeable measures; in an analysis of 3,219 men (mean age 58 years) with a single morning testosterone measurement, using a free testosterone level added no value when the total testosterone level was < 231 ng/dL, whereas when total testosterone was between 230–317 ng/dL, free testosterone measurement may be helpful in diagnosis, and free testosterone also has a place in the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency in highly symptomatic patients with total testosterone levels in the low/normal or equivocal range.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^116fWNNr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Sexual function, energy/vitality, cognition, and mood

The T-Trials, the most definitive trial of older men with low serum total testosterone to date, recruited 790 men (who were similar to our patient) without known hypogonadism and a serum total testosterone concentration < 275 ng/dL; (< 9.54 nmol/L). The mean age was 72 years, 62.9% were obese, and mean baseline serum total testosterone was 232 ng/dL (8.0 mmol/L). About 10% of men were taking PDE5-inhibitor treatment at baseline. In the primary analysis among men with self-reported low libido and a partner willing to have sexual intercourse at least twice a month, testosterone treatment increased sexual activity at 3, 6, and 9 months, but this declined at 12 months. In subsequently reported more detailed analyses, testosterone treatment improved 10 of 12 measures in sexual activity (including sexual desire, activity, and overall satisfaction) with standardized mean differences (SMD) up to 0.45 (SMDs of 0.2–05 represent a modest treatment effect). The average increase in erectile function (2.64 in Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function score [IIEF-EFD]) was below the clinically significant threshold of ∼ 4.0. However, this threshold of 4.0 is for men with erectile dysfunction; the T-Trials did not include erectile dysfunction as an entry criterion and likely included men with a broad range of erectile function. Many men who do not meet the criteria for erectile dysfunction for clinical trials might consider an increase of 2.64 as clinically significant. In agreement with findings of the T-Trials, a meta-analysis of RCTs of 2298 men with a mean age of 60 years and a serum testosterone < 346 ng/dL (< 12 nmol/L) reported that testosterone treatment increased the IIEF-EFD score by 2.3, but this effect was attenuated in men with T2D and obesity. PDE5-inhibitors are more effective than testosterone therapy for treatment of erectile dysfunction in older men with low serum testosterone concentrations, and the added value of testosterone treatment in men receiving optimized PDE5-inhibitors treatment requires further study.

### Diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunction in the male partner in the setting of infertility: a committee opinion [^115R2Zsk]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

Decreased libido — Hormonal dysfunction is frequently associated with sexual complaints among infertile men, most commonly diminished libido; evaluation may include straightforward questions or a validated questionnaire such as the androgen deficiency in aging male's test. Indeed, 43% of 94 men presenting to an infertility clinic with normozoospermia provided a positive response to a validated questionnaire of symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency, and men presenting with oligozoospermia have concomitant hypogonadism in 42%-50% of cases. Correction of testosterone deficiency in the setting of ED should be approached with modest expectations, although men with diminished libido related to testosterone deficiency may achieve good symptomatic benefit from hormonal therapy. Exogenous testosterone replacement therapy should be avoided in men attempting conception because of disruption of normal spermatogenesis.

### Randomized controlled trial to evaluate transdermal testosterone in female cancer survivors with decreased libido; north central cancer treatment group protocol N02C3 [^115x8WvR]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Decreased libido is one of several changes in sexual function that are often experienced by female cancer patients. Transdermal testosterone therapy has been associated with increased libido among estrogen-replete women who report low libido.

Methods

In a phase III randomized, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial, we evaluated whether transdermal testosterone would increase sexual desire in female cancer survivors. Postmenopausal women with a history of cancer and no current evidence of disease were eligible if they reported a decrease in sexual desire and had a sexual partner. Eligible women were randomly assigned to receive 2% testosterone in Vanicream for a testosterone dose of 10 mg daily or placebo Vanicream for 4 weeks and were then crossed over to the opposite treatment for an additional 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was sexual desire or libido, as measured using the desire subscales of the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire, as assessed at baseline and at the end of 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Serum levels of bioavailable testosterone were measured at the same times. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

We enrolled 150 women. Women who were on active testosterone cream had higher serum levels of bioavailable testosterone than women on placebo (mean change from baseline, testosterone versus placebo, week 4, 11.57% versus 0%, difference = 11.57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.49% to 14.65%; week 8, 10.21% versus 0.28%, difference = 9.92%, 95% CI = 5.42% to 14.42%; P < .001 for all). However, the average intrapatient libido change from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 was similar on both arms.

Conclusion

Increased testosterone level did not translate into improved libido, possibly because women on this study were estrogen depleted.

### Testosterone therapy for menopausal women [^117XWfs3]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that there is a link between low circulating concentrations of testosterone and reduced sexual functioning in postmenopausal women, 1 and it has been more than 60 years since the effects of testosterone therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms were first reported. 2 Since then, testosterone supplementation has received growing attention for its potential role in maintaining sexual function in menopausal women. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline on the diagnosis and management of menopause recommends considering testosterone supplementation for women with low sexual desire if hormone replacement therapy (HRT) alone has been ineffective. 3 However, in the UK no testosterone products are licensed for such use. A testosterone patch authorised by the European Medicines Agency in 2006 for use in women with surgical menopause was withdrawn from the market in 2012 for commercial reasons. 4 Here, we provide an update on the evidence of the effectiveness and safety of testosterone supplementation in menopausal women.

### Differing levels of testosterone and the prostate: a physiological interplay [^115DFhkd]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

The controversies surrounding testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) have been addressed in the past few years. Although the androgenic effects of TRT on normal and malignant prostate cells have been studied for over 70 years, little clinical prospective research exists on the physiological responses of prostate tissues to a wide range of serum testosterone levels. The prostate is both an androgen-dependent and an androgen-sensitive organ; active processes are triggered at a 'threshold' or 'saturation' level of testosterone. Despite decades of research, no compelling evidence exists that increasing testosterone beyond this threshold level has a causative role in prostate cancer, or indeed changes the biology of the prostate. Testosterone deficiency has marked physiological and clinical effects on men in middle age and beyond. With subnormal testosterone levels, the potential positive benefits of TRT on factors such as muscle mass, libido or erectile function are likely a dose-response phenomenon, and should be considered differently than the threshold influence on the prostate. This Review will re-examine classic androgen research and reflect on whether testosterone actually stimulates prostatic cellular growth and progression in a 'threshold' or a 'dose-response' (or both) manner, as well as discuss the influence of testosterone on prostate cells in the hypogonadal and eugonadal states.

Testosterone treatment in adult men — population, interventions, comparator, outcomes, and setting: Adult men were the population studied; transdermal and intramuscular testosterone treatments approved by the FDA were evaluated, compared with no testosterone treatment, including placebo. Both clinician and nonclinician public members were asked to independently rate the importance of evaluated outcomes; physician members rated serious adverse events the highest, whereas public members rated cardiac adverse events the highest; quality of life, erectile function, cognitive function, and harms, including serious adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events, deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, mortality, and prostate cancer, were rated as critical outcomes, while energy and vitality, physical function, mood (depression), fracture reduction, libido, and lower urinary tract symptoms were rated as important outcomes. Treatment timing was for 6 months or longer in an outpatient setting, the target audience was all clinicians, and the target patient population was adult men.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^117GX1vK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

(13) Recommendations regarding other androgenic preparations Systemic dehydroepiandrosterone is not associated with significant improvement in libido or sexual function in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function and cannot be recommended for women with HSDD (Level IA, Grade A). In the absence of vulvovaginal atrophy, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone has not been tested and thus cannot be recommended for treatment of HSDD (Expert Opinion).

(14) Recommendations regarding the design of future trials of physiologically dosed testosterone (Expert Opinion for all) More adequately powered, double-blind RCTs, without selection bias and with consistent reporting of standardized outcomes, are needed to comprehensively establish the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy for women. For studies of testosterone and FSD:order Relief of the distress associated with sexual dysfunction is a primary aim of FSD treatment. Presently, no questionnaire covers all domains of female sexual function such that a combination of domains from different questionnaires should be used. Satisfying sexual events should no longer be used as a primary efficacy measurement in clinical trials of women with FSD. A set of clearly defined core outcomes needs to be established. There is a need for an instrument to assess sexual function with the following characteristics: general applicability; not disease-specific; high discriminant validity between women diagnosed with FSD and sexually functional women; validated, to measure FSD per se and as an instrument to screen for and diagnose FSD and demonstrating clinically meaningful response to intervention; cover different domains, with each domain comprising several items; translated and back-translated in a variety of languages, satisfies the most stringent assessment to gain approval by regulatory agencies. There is a need for adequately powered RCTs of the effects of testosterone on the musculoskeletal health of women with normal bone mass, low bone mass, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and sarcopenia, with outcomes including vertebral and total hip and femoral neck bone mineral density, trabecular bone score, serum biomarkers, fracture risk, body composition, and muscle strength. There is a need for adequately powered RCTs of the effects of testosterone on cognitive performance.

### Testosterone for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^1174dHYa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although there is no androgen deficiency diagnosis for women, research demonstrates that testosterone treatment can be modestly beneficial in treating appropriately selected postmenopausal women with distressing low desire, also known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Current data do not support the role of testosterone treatment in supporting bone health or brain health or improving energy or cognition in women, and only limited research supports its benefit for HSDD treatment in women of late reproductive age. No current U.S. Federal Drug Administration-approved formulation of testosterone is available for women in the United States because of a lack of long-term safety data. However, two clinical guidelines now provide expert guidance on testosterone treatment and monitoring in women for HSDD. This narrative review presents the data and summarizes the guidelines in a clinically relevant format to make the information accessible to clinicians treating cisgender women with HSDD seeking testosterone treatment.

How Should This Man Be Evaluated?

Does This Man Have Clinically Evident Androgen Deficiency?

The first step is to determine his pretest probability of hypogonadism. There is significant overlap of the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Because of his report of depressed mood and fatigue, the patient was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool that screened negative for major depression.

Careful assessment for symptoms and signs that are more specific for hypogonadism is a key first step in the evaluation (Table 1). In the initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Ageing Study, 3 sexual symptoms (low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections) were the only symptoms (out of a total of 19 candidate symptoms) that were consistently associated with a low serum testosterone in a syndromic fashion; diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. Of note, this epidemiology study cannot determine causality. Because reduced sexual activity has been proposed to lower serum testosterone, the observed association of sexual symptoms with low serum testosterone concentrations in the European Male Ageing Study might reflect reverse causation. In the European Male Aging Study, the prevalence of these sexual symptoms was 25% to 35% even in men with a normal serum testosterone. His symptoms of fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and have low diagnostic value. They may be caused by systemic disease (see below). However, the constellation of symptoms of sexual dysfunction and low serum testosterone justify further evaluation for androgen deficiency.

Table 1.
Clinical features of testosterone deficiency in men

The patient lacks more specific clinical signs of hypogonadism (Table 1), but these findings, such as new-onset or increased gynecomastia that is almost always characterized by breast pain and tenderness, deficient male pattern body hair (that is generally only seen in longstanding hypogonadism), hot flashes that might occur with acute onset of hypogonadism (eg, bilateral orchidectomy), and/or small (< 15 cc) testes are not common in hypogonadal middle-aged or older men. Although small testes are an uncommon finding in older men with newly diagnosed hypogonadism, Klinefelter syndrome, the most common cause of classic organic hypogonadism, is typically characterized by very small testes (≤ 4 cc each), is underdiagnosed (by 50% or more), and might not be diagnosed until middle or older age.

### The practical management of testosterone deficiency in men [^114Hq3p8]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Despite increased global interest in testosterone deficiency in men and its treatment with testosterone therapy, practical aspects of care remain confusing to many practitioners. Testosterone deficiency can result from testicular dysfunction (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism), and be congenital or acquired. Sexual and nonsexual symptoms of testosterone deficiency can negatively affect quality of life and cause considerable general health concerns. Investigation of testosterone deficiency should be undertaken in men with symptoms of reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, fatigue, poor concentration, and poor memory. Total and free testosterone are the most frequently used tests and evaluating serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone aids determination of primary versus secondary testosterone deficiency. Multiple formulations of testosterone therapy are available, but symptomatic benefits might not manifest for several weeks to many months; long-acting formulations are convenient and improve compliance. Concerns regarding cardiovascular and prostate cancer risks are not supported by current evidence, monitoring during therapy is mandatory. On balance, testosterone therapy can be considered a safe and effective treatment for testosterone deficiency.

Back to the Case

The evidence was discussed with the patient. He agreed to implement lifestyle measures and was referred to a dietician and exercise physiologist with a target weight loss of 5% to 10% that might increase his serum testosterone into the normal range. However, despite his initial enthusiasm and hiring a personal coach, he was only able to maintain modest dietary and exercise changes. PDE5-inhibitor treatment was progressively titrated to maximum dose, with modest improvements in his erectile function. CPAP therapy was commenced and optimized with improvements in fatigue; repeat polysomnography demonstrated resolution of significant apneic episodes. He was prescribed a weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist, but he was unable to tolerate a low dosage of GLP-1 receptor agonist due to significant gastrointestinal side effects. SGLT2 inhibitor treatment was initiated.

Twelve months later, he had lost 2 kg (now 97.3 kg, 214 lb), and his HbA1c had decreased to 7.3%. A fasting early morning blood sample demonstrated a total serum testosterone (216 ng/dL; 7.5 nmol/L;) and a low calculated free testosterone (51.6 pg/mL; 179 pmol/L). A second blood sample yielded similar results. Both total testosterone measurements were done by a validated, harmonized assay. Although his energy has improved, he still reports low motivation and intermittent low mood. He reports improved erectile function, but libido, tumescence, and overall sexual function remains less than satisfactory. The patient wishes to discuss the potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy.

What Are the Benefits of Testosterone Treatment?

In men with classic organic hypogonadism, testosterone replacement ameliorates the clinical features of hypogonadism (except fertility) although the evidence is limited to uncontrolled studies. In the following section we will focus on double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs of testosterone treatment in older men with low serum testosterone and no classic cause of HPT axis pathology. Benefits and risks are summarized in Table 3.

### Use of testosterone in postmenopausal women [^111czeX3]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The role of testosterone in women and its potential as a therapeutic agent continue to attract controversy. The clinical trials of testosterone therapy for women primarily have focused on treatment of female sexual dysfunction, with the largest placebo-controlled studies being of transdermal testosterone in postmenopausal women. Based on the cumulative data from these studies, loss of sexual desire with associated personal distress currently is the only agreed-on indication for judicious testosterone supplementation for postmenopausal women. This article reviews the physiology of testosterone in women, summarizes the findings from observational studies and clinical trials, and considers indications for testosterone use.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114tZLyY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In the population-based European Male Ageing Study, the prevalence of the syndromic association of symptoms of hypogonadism plus low serum testosterone without an identifiable classic HPT axis pathology was determined in men aged 40 to 79 years. Symptoms of hypogonadism were defined as a constellation of low libido, decreased sexual function, and a low serum testosterone. The overall prevalence of this syndrome of androgen-deficiency-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone was 2.1%, and it increased from 0.6% in men 50 to 59 years of age to 5.1% in men 70 to 79 years. Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m 2) was associated with a 13-fold increased prevalence compared with normal weight. Likewise, the presence of ≥ 2 comorbidities was associated with a 9-fold increase in the prevalent syndrome of hypogonadism-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone. In the longitudinal follow-up, weight loss was associated with resolution of this syndrome in a significant percentage of the men.

The management of older men with low serum testosterone concentrations is hampered by the fact that many clinical features of androgen deficiency are nonspecific and similar to those associated with obesity or comorbid disease, conditions that are associated with low serum testosterone concentrations. In such men, the conundrum lies in determining the degree to which the (often nonspecific) clinical symptoms are predominantly due to hypogonadism or instead due to obesity and other chronic systemic disorders that suppress the HPT axis (ie, reverse causality). Of note, this assessment is probabilistic rather than deterministic. In many men, this assessment can only be validated during management, by monitoring the response to lifestyle measures, optimization of comorbidities, and in selected cases, a trial of testosterone treatment. However, a trial of testosterone therapy should only be considered when an older man has persistent symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism and reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations after a minimum of 6–12 months of addressing reversible causes of a suppressed HPT, including vigorous lifestyle changes for overweight men. It is particularly important to use a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay (if at all possible) when considering a trial of testosterone therapy.

### Endocrine aspects of male sexual dysfunctions [^115e1GT1]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endocrine disorders may adversely affect men's sexual function.

Aim

To provide recommendations based on best evidence for diagnosis and treatment of endocrine-related male sexual dysfunctions.

Methods

The Endocrine Aspects of Male Sexual Dysfunctions Committee, including 11 members from eight countries and four continents, collaborated with the Endocrine subcommittee of the Standards Committee of the International Society for Sexual Medicine. Medical literature was reviewed in detail, followed by extensive internal committee discussion over 2 years, then public presentation and discussion with the other experts before finalizing the report.

Main Outcome Measure

Recommendations based on grading of evidence-base medical literature and interactive discussion.

Results

From animal studies, it is derived that testosterone modulates mechanisms involved in erectile machinery, including expression of enzymes that both initiate and terminate erection. In addition, testosterone is essential for sexual motivation. Whether these findings could be extrapolated to human erections is unclear. Testosterone plays a broad role in men's overall health. Recent studies have established strong associations between low testosterone and metabolic and cardiovascular imbalances. In some studies, low testosterone decreased longevity; however, longitudinal studies do not support the predictive value of low testosterone for further cardiovascular events. The article proposes a standardized process for diagnosis and treatment of endocrine-related male sexual dysfunctions, updating the knowledge on testosterone and prostate safety. There is no compelling evidence that testosterone treatment causes prostate cancer or its progression in men without severe testosterone deficiency (TD). The possible roles of prolactin and thyroid hormones are also examined.

Conclusions

Men with erectile dysfunction, hypoactive sexual desire and retarded ejaculation, as well as those with visceral obesity and metabolic diseases, should be screened for TD and treated. Prospective interventional studies are required before screening for TD in more conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, and considering correction as preventive medicine as much data suggests.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^116BGQd1]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

The lack of clear correlation between sexual function and declining androgen levels has been explained by the complexity of androgen metabolism and measurementand the observation that circulating testosterone levels do not adequately reflect tissue concentrations. Although circulating hormone levels have been used as indicators of tissue exposure, a significant proportion of androgen synthesis may be intracrine, such that circulating precursors and testosterone act as prohormones and are converted to active hormones within target cells. The complex regulation of AR expression plays a key role in androgen effects. Furthermore, androgenic effects vary according to individual variations in the amount and activity of the enzymes 5α-reductase and aromatase and individual differences in the AR response. However, it is still not clear whether the AR activity is a modulator of the androgenic effect on sexual desireor if levels of intracrine activity of androgens are better parameters for androgen effect on sexual desire.

What is the rationale for testosterone therapy in women?

Although no testosterone serum concentration correlates with the presence or absence of HSDD or its severity, there is a loose correlation between testosterone concentration while undergoing treatment and its benefits for improving sexual dysfunction. Although the complexity of central and peripheral mechanisms of action of testosterone on sexual desire is not completely understood, research and clinical evidence support a positive effect of testosterone therapy on sexual desire when premenopausal physiologic levels are maintained. When testosterone supplementation exceeds the normal premenopausal range, which is the recommended optimal treatment threshold, sexual desire may actually decrease, suggesting a bimodal effect.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^111EbdnM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Approach to diagnosis and management of possible hypogonadism in men ≥ 50 years. 1 Recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia; osteoporosis (see Table 1). 2 Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) that was measured in the absence of high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. It is generally useful to repeat the measurement in this clinical setting. 3 Measure TT when patient is at baseline health. Confirm low TT with a second fasting sample. At a minimum, the confirmatory measurement should be done on a fasting sample drawn between 7 and 10 Am. 4 Assess serum free testosterone (FT) on confirmatory sample using an accurate method if the serum TT is 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected (see Table 2). Although some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone given the limitations discussed in the manuscript and focus instead on interpretation of SHBG along with total testosterone, this approach is congruent with assessing serum free testosterone with an accurate method. 5 Investigation for cause of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disorder includes clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, review of medications that affect the HPT axis and measurement of serum prolactin. Measurement of serum T4 might be useful if panhypopituitarism is suspected. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated. Evaluation of hyperprolactinemia also includes review of medications and measurement of TSH. Sellar imaging also indicated if there are symptoms of a sellar mass, serum LH is undetectable, or serum total testosterone is < 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L). 6 This includes optimization of management of chronic disease, stopping medications that can suppress the HPT axis if possible (eg, opioids, glucocorticoids), evaluation and treatment of depression and sleep apnea. 7 Consider karyotype for assessment for Klinefelter syndrome; offer testosterone treatment if there is no contraindication (including desire to conceive in the next 1–2 years). 8 The decision to offer testosterone therapy should take into consideration the likelihood of benefit and the potential risk. The benefits are highest in men with lower testosterone concentrations and men with concordantly low total and free testosterone concentrations. A trial of testosterone therapy may be offered if the following conditions are met: 1) there are no contraindications; 2) there has been a discussion regarding potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy and the uncertainties regarding long-term health outcomes; 3) patient-specific goals have been set; and 4) there is agreement that testosterone treatment will be stopped if these goals are not achieved. See text in manuscript. 9 Reassessment of men with high BMI consists of assessment for symptoms and signs of hypogonadism and re-measurement of testosterone. If there are symptoms of hypogonadism and low serum testosterone after 6–12 months of lifestyle changes, then testosterone therapy may be considered. Medical therapy to achieve weight loss and/or bariatric surgery should be considered for men whose BMI remains > 30 kg/m 2 after 6 months of lifestyle changes. Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; FT, free testosterone; HPT, hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TT, total testosterone; SHBG, sex hormone binding globulin.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112gw72Z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — testosterone therapy for men with age-related low testosterone and sexual dysfunction — ACP suggests that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment and include potential benefits, harms, costs, and patient preferences; ACP suggests that clinicians should reevaluate symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter and clinicians should discontinue treatment if there is no improvement in sexual function; ACP suggests that clinicians consider intramuscular rather than transdermal formulation because costs are considerably lower and clinical effectiveness and harms are similar. Evidence shows that men with a testosterone threshold ≤ 10.4 nmol/L [300 ng/dL] may show small improvements in sexual functioning on AMS, International Index of Erectile Function (erectile dysfunction domain), or IIEF-5, but evidence shows little to no improvement in physical function, depressive symptoms, energy and vitality, or cognition; the FDA requires labeling of testosterone products to include a warning about a possible increased risk for heart attacks and strokes; most studies followed patients for 12 months or less, so longer-term benefits and harms are unknown, and without symptom improvement treatment would incur additional cost with no clear benefit; evidence shows variability in patient values and preferences and does not support use in all patients without informed decision making.

### The incidence of invasive breast cancer among women prescribed testosterone for low libido [^112eq3Nf]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although the efficacy of testosterone for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder is well established, the effect of testosterone therapy on breast cancer risk remains uncertain.

Aim

The incidence of invasive breast cancer among past and current testosterone users.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 631 women ever treated with testosterone between January 1989 and December 2007 in a clinical endocrinology practice.

Main Outcome Measure

The incidence of invasive breast cancer since first exposure, and the standardized incidence rate ratio (IRR) calculated using Australian age-specific incidence rates for 2005.

Results

The mean age of the women at first exposure to testosterone therapy was 49.1 ± 8.2 years, median treatment duration, 1.3 years, and mean follow-up of 6.7 ± 4.6 years, providing 4,015 woman-years of follow-up. Twelve cases of invasive breast cancer occurred among 599 women breast cancer-free before treatment, giving an age adjusted IRR of 1.35 (95% confidence interval 0.76–2.38). There was no evidence of an independent effect of duration of exposure on breast cancer risk.

Conclusion

In this study, testosterone use was not associated with a significant increase in breast cancer risk.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115dU9ax]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Back to the Case

The patient has continued to have symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency and reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations. He enquired about testosterone therapy to restore his serum testosterone concentration into the normal range. Before testosterone therapy was considered and the potential benefits and risks were discussed, prostate cancer screening was discussed; untreated prostate cancer is a contraindication to testosterone therapy (Table 4). After discussion of the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening, he elected to undergo prostate cancer screening; digital rectal exam revealed no prostate abnormality and PSA was 1.5 ng/dL. The potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy were discussed because he had persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and reproducibly, unequivocally low serum testosterone concentrations after a year of addressing reversible causes of a suppressed HPT axis (including lifestyle changes to lose weight and optimization of treatment of sleep apnea).

Table 4.
Contraindications to testosterone therapy in men

He was counseled about the potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy (including the lack of definitive data about the effects on cardiovascular outcomes and prostate cancer) and the absence of high-quality, long-term studies. The patient's main concerns were identified as low libido, reduced energy, and low mood. He was advised that, based on the T-Trials, effects of testosterone treatment on these symptoms should be evident within 3 to 6 months while other benefits (eg, muscle mass and function, bone health) typically take longer. Testosterone formulations (including topical and intramuscular treatment) were discussed. He preferred topical testosterone for a therapeutic trial of 6 months to determine if testosterone therapy would meaningfully improve his symptoms. He agreed that testosterone treatment would be stopped if there was no significant benefit despite normal serum testosterone concentrations during therapy. The discussion about the benefits and risks of testosterone, the goals of therapeutic trial and the plan to discontinue testosterone therapy if these goals were not met were documented in the medical record. Treatment was initiated with a standardized monitoring plan that included follow-up clinic visits to assess for effectiveness and safety at 3 and 6 months with reassessment of the dosage of testosterone based on symptoms and measurement of serum testosterone concentrations and assessment of hematocrit 3 and 6 months after initiation (and increases of dosage) of testosterone.

Central mechanisms in women

The brain is one of the most important targets for sex hormones throughout the life span. Some research supports the role of estradiol in the central modulation of sexual desire. Other research demonstrates that testosterone has enduring influences on many neural and behavioral functions via both genomic and nongenomic actions. The neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying the influence of testosterone on sexual behavior in women are still not completely understood. It remains unclear whether testosterone positively modulates sexual desire in women through a direct stimulation of the AR or through its conversion to estrogen and subsequent binding to estrogen receptors. Consistent with preclinical data, 2 lines of evidence point toward a direct, AR-mediated effect of testosterone on sexual behavior in women. One is based on the fact that estrogen-alone therapy in postmenopausal women was associated with a small to moderate improvement in sexual function, particularly in pain, with no effect on libido, sexual desire, and interest. Second, in a study of postmenopausal women using transdermal estradiol and testosterone gel randomized to an aromatase inhibitor or placebo, total and free testosterone in the physiologic range was associated with improvement in sexual satisfaction, well-being, and mood. Aromatase inhibition did not appear to influence the outcome. Existing evidence therefore suggests that testosterone conversion into estradiol is not necessary to exert its beneficial effects on sexuality.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone: a springboard hormone for female sexuality [^112GL3Rd]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the role of adrenal androgenic hormone precursors in female sexual function.

Design

A review of current literature on sexual function and the androgen precursor hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS).

Result(S)

The C(19) steroid DHEA is both an ovarian and adrenal androgen precursor hormone, whereas DHEAS is only synthesized in the adrenal cortex. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate secretion begins at age 10, peaks at age 20, and then wanes. Low DHEAS levels occur in men and women with adrenal insufficiency and in the elderly. Dehydroepiandrosterone, 50 mg/d, increases DHEAS levels. In women but not men, the increased DHEAS levels facilitate additional production of downstream androgens, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, and androstenediol glucuronide. With the improved female androgenic profile women with adrenal insufficiency have increased sexual thoughts and fantasies as well as an enhancement in mood and well-being. In the elderly > age 65 - DHEAS levels increase in both men and women with DHEA 50 mg/d but only in women were the higher DHEAS levels accompanied by a surge in testosterone levels and in women > age 70 increased libido and enhanced sexual satisfaction as well as a 26% diminution in bone resorption, and a 10% decrease in skin pigmentation.

Conclusion(S)

The female adrenal androgen deficiency syndrome, characterized low serum DHEAS levels may be corrected by DHEA supplements that increase levels of DHEAS and downstream androgens of importance to female sexuality.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^116WEn5R]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency — role of testosterone therapy: Testosterone treatment should be considered in women with iatrogenic POI to manage hypoactive sexual desire disorder when other biopsychosocial aetiologies are excluded. Testosterone treatment could be considered in women with non-iatrogenic POI to manage hypoactive sexual desire disorder when other biopsychosocial aetiologies are excluded. HCPs should be aware that although short term treatment with transdermal testosterone at doses approximating physiological premenopausal levels is safe, longer term safety data are lacking. The guideline group recommends that women with POI are informed that there are limited data for androgen treatment for indications other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and that long-term health effects are unknown.

### Declining testicular function in aging men [^114Sw16y]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Age-related decline in male sex hormones, particularly testosterone, is referred to as andropause. Like menopause, andropause is associated with physical and emotional changes that may be alleviated by hormone replacement therapy. Hypogonadism in aging men, as defined by a low free testosterone index, is due to declining testosterone production and increased sex hormone-binding globulin levels. About 30% of men in their 60s and more than 80% of men over 80 y may have a low free testosterone index. Diagnosis of hypogonadism is based on clinical symptoms (eg, decreased muscle mass, fractures, loss of libido) and laboratory determinations of serum testosterone-usually total testosterone levels. Measuring bioavailable testosterone, or free testosterone, is expensive and time-consuming, but may more accurately detect hypogonadism. Testosterone replacement therapy is generally safe in aging men and may improve libido, cognition, bone mineral density, body mass composition, and serum lipoproteins. Although contraindicated in men with prostate or breast cancer, testosterone replacement therapy in aging men warrants examination. Any of the available testosterone formulations can be used, but injectable forms have certain advantages, including excellent dose adjustability, lack of skin irritation, and low cost.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11219QK6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Commissioned systematic reviews of testosterone replacement therapy in men with hypogonadism included symptomatic men with a screening total testosterone level < 300 ng/dL and evaluated transdermal therapy. The first review identified 11 reports of four trials with 1779 participants, and all included trials tested transdermal therapy with durations from 12 to 52 weeks and mean baseline total testosterone 201 to 239 ng/dL; meta-analysis found small but statistically significant improvements in libido [standardized mean difference (SMD), 0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.01, 0.34], erectile function (SMD, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.06, 0.27), sexual activity (SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.13, 0.33), and sexual satisfaction (SMD, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.01, 0.31), with no statistically significant difference in energy or mood and cognition data limited to one trial. The second review identified nine studies of three trials with 1581 patients, with mean baseline total testosterone 201 to 236 ng/dL and durations 12 to 52 weeks, and testosterone treatment was associated with significantly higher frequency of erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 54%) (relative risk, 8.14; 95% CI, 1.87, 35.40) but no significant difference in change in lower urinary tract symptoms (mean difference, 0.38, 95% CI, −0.67, 1.43), with the evidence warranting moderate and high certainty, respectively, in the provided estimates.

### Androgen therapy for loss of desire in women: is the benefit worth the breast cancer risk? [^1131uH24]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To contrast the limited evidence that androgen therapy is an effective treatment for low sexual desire in women with the extensive literature suggesting that androgens promote breast cancer.

Design

Evidence from population studies of women is reviewed on the association between endogenous androgen levels and sexual function or satisfaction. Recent randomized trials of testosterone therapy for low desire are critiqued in terms of methodology and generalizability. Research on endogenous testosterone levels and breast cancer risk in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women is summarized, as are recent studies of androgenic hormonal therapy and breast cancer risk.

Setting

Literature review.

Patient(S)

Not applicable.

Intervention(S)

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Not applicable.

Result(S)

Endogenous androgen levels are not correlated with sexual desire in population-based studies of aging women. Factors that are strongly associated with low desire include pain with sexual activity, emotional distress, life stress, and relationship conflict. The efficacy of testosterone therapy for women's desire problems is modest. Expectancy effects were not adequately controlled in randomized trials. Epidemiological findings agree that higher endogenous serum androgen levels confer increased breast cancer risk both before and after menopause. Androgenic hormonal replacement regimens also increase the risk of breast cancer.

Conclusion(S)

Testosterone supplementation should not be prescribed to women with low sexual desire unless long-term studies can demonstrate its efficacy and safety. Treatments for low sexual desire in women should address its common correlates: relationship distress, emotional distress, and dyspareunia.

### Testosterone therapy in women: its role in the management of hypoactive sexual desire disorder [^1119fXWz]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2007). Low credibility.

Disorders of sexual dysfunction occur in nearly half of women during their life, and hypoactive sexual desire disorder accounts for most of those complaints. Although the relationship between low endogenous testosterone levels and sexual desire disorders in women has not been empirically established, clinical trials have shown that exogenous testosterone therapy improves arousability, sexual desire and fantasy, frequency of sexual activity and orgasm, and satisfaction and pleasure from the sexual act. Its therapeutic role in bone mineral density, fatigue, well-being and hot flashes requires more study before specific recommendations can be made. Potential adverse effects of testosterone therapy include hirsutism, acne and deepening of the voice along with changes in lipid profiles. While less well understood, concern after increased risks for breast cancer and cardiovascular events has been raised about this therapy. Testosterone therapy is available in various formulations; the most commonly used are oral and transdermal, including patches, gels, creams and ointments.

### Transdermal testosterone therapy improves well-being, mood, and sexual function in premenopausal women [^117SGgXp]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Circulating testosterone in women declines during the late reproductive years such that otherwise healthy women in their 40s have approximately half the testosterone level as women in their 20s. Despite this, research showing the benefits of androgen replacement has been limited to the postmenopausal years. In view of the known premenopausal physiological decline in testosterone, we have evaluated the efficacy of transdermal testosterone therapy on mood, well-being, and sexual function in eugonadal, premenopausal women presenting with low libido.

Design

Premenopausal women with low libido participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, efficacy study of testosterone cream (10 mg/day) with two double-blind, 12-week, treatment periods separated by a single-blind, 4-week, washout period.

Results

Thirty-four women completed the study per protocol, with 31 women (mean age 39.7 ± 4.2 years; serum testosterone 1.07 + 0.50 nmol/L) providing complete data. Testosterone therapy resulted in statistically significant improvements in the composite scores of the Psychological General Well-Being Index [+12.9 (95% CI, +4.6 to +21.2), P = 0.003] and the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self-Rating Scale [+15.7 (95% CI, +6.5 to +25.0), P = 0.001] compared with placebo. A mean decrease in the Beck Depression Inventory score approached significance [-2.8 (95% CI, -5.7 to +0.1), P = 0.06]. Mean total testosterone levels during treatment were at the high end of the normal range, and estradiol was unchanged. No adverse effects were reported.

Conclusions

Testosterone therapy improves well-being, mood, and sexual function in premenopausal women with low libido and low testosterone. As a substantial number of women experience diminished sexual interest and well-being during their late reproductive years, further research is warranted to evaluate the benefits and safety of longer-term intervention.

### Testosterone and the cardiovascular system: a comprehensive review of the basic science literature [^11338M6D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Because of the increase in the number of prescriptions and use of testosterone in adult males for the treatment of hypogonadism, low libido, and weakness, an investigation of the effects of testosterone on the cardiovascular system in basic science studies was carried out. The benefits of testosterone relating to the cardiovascular system are as follows. Testosterone has been shown to exhibit potential antiarrhythmic properties in the form of decreasing action potential duration, early after depolarizations, and shortened QTc interval. –, Testosterone has also been shown to reduce myocardial infarct size compared with that in subjects not treated with testosterone by modulating the myocardial K ATP channel. enhancing vasodilation, – improving lipid metabolism, – and improving DM. – These conclusions do not come without controversy. Much of the literature suggests that testosterone attenuates atherosclerosis, – but some studies suggest otherwise. – Further deleterious effects of testosterone on the cardiovascular system have been shown in studies on vasoconstriction, – inflammation. and death signaling.– These findings suggest that testosterone may simultaneously benefit and harm the cardiovascular system by different pathways. The complexity of this relationship is obvious, and thus additional basic science studies are required for a better understanding of the relationship between testosterone and the cardiovascular system.

### The effect of statins on testosterone in men and women, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1111tPkD]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of this reduction in testosterone with statins is difficult to gauge. The normal range of testosterone is wide and sexual function similar across the range. Erectile dysfunction is a rare side effect of statins, perhaps because statins' have beneficial effects on cardiovascular function that would counteract changes of this magnitude in testosterone. However, large changes in testosterone (and libido) can occasionally occur with statin use, which are reversible by statin withdrawal. The impact on population health may be more germane, where statins causing diabetes could be another side effect. We are not aware of any study examining whether lowering testosterone mediates the effect of statins on diabetes, as this possibility has not, to the best of our knowledge, been considered before, and remains speculative. Moreover, observational studies suggest serum testosterone has sex-specific physiological effects on diabetes, negative among men, but positive among women, when statins increase diabetes in both sexes. We could not identify any RCT confirming testosterone therapy increases diabetes incidence among women. In postmenopausal women, RCTs of testosterone therapy indicate little effect on glucose metabolism. In younger women, some RCTs indicate that low doses of testosterone may improve glucose metabolism; female to male transsexuals given high doses of testosterone have improved glucose metabolism. Nevertheless, distinct effects of testosterone on diabetes may occur by dose, sex and age with the reduction in testosterone with statin treatment insufficient to modulate diabetes risk consistently. This meta-analysis also raises the question as to whether lowering testosterone is a side effect of statin therapy or contributes to statins' mode of action, which could inform new treatments and prevention policies. Observationally testosterone is inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality; whether testosterone is causal or a marker of health is unknown. No RCT has shown testosterone therapy reduces cardiovascular events; two RCTs of testosterone therapy were halted because of adverse, mainly cardiovascular events, among men allocated to testosterone. Natural experiments suggest lower testosterone protects against specifically ischemic heart disease mortality, with a relatively lower risk in men legally castrated or with Klinefelter's syndrome. Physiologically lowering testosterone may reduce thromboxane and platelet activation, specifically relevant to reducing ischemic cardiovascular disease but not to diabetes. However, whether lowering testosterone with statin treatment modulates cardiovascular disease, via these or other pathways, has not been examined.

### The effects of a low carbohydrate diet on erectile function and serum testosterone levels in hypogonadal men with metabolic syndrome: a randomized clinical trial [^1128x4x3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic syndrome has been widely studied in recent years, mainly due to its role as a risk factor for several diseases. Overweight or obesity, which is one component of metabolic syndrome, has a high prevalence and is considered a public health problem. Brazilian data show that the obesity rate in individuals aged ≥ 20 years more than doubled (from 12.2 to 26.8%) between 2003 and 2019 and, during this period, male obesity rose from 9.6% to 22.8%. The 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey estimated the prevalence of obesity in the US population at 35%.

Testosterone deficiency, also called hypogonadism, is also a prevalent condition, affecting around 5 million Americans. Hypogonadism is defined both biochemically and clinically: total serum testosterone < 300 ng/dL and clinical manifestations such as cognitive deficit, decreased lean mass, lower bone mineral density, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, etc. Metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus and hypogonadism can negatively influence male health and some authors have even proposed that hypogonadism should be included as a criteria for metabolic syndrome. Some studies have shown that low serum testosterone levels are associated with increased insulin resistance, including an estimated 50% prevalence of hypogonadism in diabetic men. Insulin resistance, in turn, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases.

Metabolic syndrome and all of its risk factors (eg, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and obesity) are associated with erectile dysfunction, raising the hypothesis that correcting these factors could improve the sexuality of men who suffer from this condition. In addition, some studies not only corroborated these findings, but also demonstrated that a low-carbohydrate diet was superior regarding weight loss and reducing systolic blood pressure, increasing HDL and reducing triglyceride levels, proving to be more effective in reducing established cardiovascular risk factors.

We found no studies reporting specific effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on male hypogonadism. Therefore, we performed a study to verify the effects of this type of diet in men with metabolic syndrome, mainly focusing on serum testosterone level and erectile function, due to the possible correlation between them after an extensive literature review.

### Testosterone deficiency in men: systematic review and standard operating procedures for diagnosis and treatment [^112tWR7g]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Testosterone (T) deficiency (TD) may significantly affect sexual function and multiple organ systems.

Aim

To provide recommendations and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) based on best evidence for diagnosis and treatment of TD in men.

Methods

Medical literature was reviewed by the Endocrine subcommittee of the ISSM Standards Committee, followed by extensive internal discussion over two years, then public presentation and discussion with other experts.

Main Outcome Measure

Recommendations and SOPs based on grading of evidence-based medical literature and interactive discussion.

Results

TD is the association of a low serum T with consistent symptoms or signs. T level tends to decline with age. T modulates sexual motivation and erection. It also plays a broader role in men's health. Recent studies have established associations between low T, male sexual dysfunctions and metabolic risk factors. Though association does not mean causation, low T is associated with reduced longevity, risk of fatal cardiovascular events, obesity, sarcopenia, mobility limitations, osteoporosis, frailty, cognitive impairment, depression, Sleep Apnea Syndrome, and other chronic diseases. The paper proposes a standardized process for diagnosis and treatment of TD, and updates the knowledge on T therapy (Tth) and prostate and cardiovascular safety. There is no compelling evidence that Tth causes prostate cancer or its progression in men without severe TD. Polycythemia is presently the only cardiovascular-related adverse-event significantly associated with Tth. But follow-up of controlled T trials is limited to 3 years.

Conclusions

Men with sexual dysfunctions, and/or with visceral obesity and metabolic diseases should be screened for TD and treated. Young men with TD should also be treated. Benefits and risks of Tth should be carefully assessed in older men. Prospective, long-term, placebo-controlled, interventional studies are required before screening for TD in more conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, and considering correction of TD as preventive medicine.

### Dihydrotestosterone and the prostate: the scientific rationale for 5 α-reductase inhibitors in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115CAoEY]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed the physiological and pathogenic role of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), evidence for the beneficial effects of decreasing DHT through 5alpha-reductase inhibition and the effects of altering the androgen balance with these agents.

Materials and Methods

A review of the relevant literature was done using published studies identified from the MEDLINE database.

Results

The androgens DHT and testosterone have complementary roles in male physiology. Each is mediated through the intracellular androgen receptor. It has been hypothesized that DHT may provide an amplification mechanism for testosterone, which could be a beneficial adaptation in men with low circulating testosterone. The recognition of the central role of DHT in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has changed the way the disease is viewed and has led to the introduction of 5alpha-reductase inhibitors, which can prevent and retard the progression of BPH by suppressing DHT synthesis. The 5alpha-reductase inhibitors decrease prostate volume. In doing so they improve symptoms and urinary flow, and decrease the risks of acute urinary retention and the need for BPH related surgery. The predominant drug related adverse events with 5alpha-reductase inhibitors are reproductive events, that is typically decreased libido, impotence and ejaculatory dysfunction. These events occur in a minority of men and tend to decrease with a longer treatment duration.

Conclusions

DHT appears to have an obligatory role in the development of BPH. The role of 5alpha-reductase inhibitors in the treatment of BPH has been firmly established with an adverse events profile that is suitable for long-term use.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1178MmgM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

What Treatment Would You Recommend?

This patient has nonspecific symptoms and signs of androgen deficiency, and his serum total testosterone is modestly reduced. The diagnostic evaluation has excluded classic pathology of the HPT axis. His symptoms, signs, and low serum testosterone (with normal serum gonadotropin) concentrations suggest HPT suppression due to obesity, untreated sleep apnea, and T2D with suboptimal glycemic control. A high percentage of older, obese men with low serum testosterone with normal serum gonadotropin concentrations will remit to normal serum testosterone concentrations, particularly with weight loss. Initial treatment of our patient should include 1) implementation of lifestyle measures and pharmacotherapy to optimize weight and comorbidities (including cardiovascular risk) and 2) initiation of phosphodiesterase type 5-inhibitor (PDE5-inhibitor) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy to address his principal concerns of erectile dysfunction and fatigue. This holistic approach will provide general health benefits and has the potential to reverse his hypogonadism.

Androgen Deficiency

Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation.

### Correlates of low testosterone and symptomatic androgen deficiency in a population-based sample [^1122uzFQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Risk factors for low testosterone and symptomatic androgen deficiency (AD) may be modifiable.

Objective

Our objective was to examine demographic, anthropometric, and medical correlates of low testosterone and symptomatic AD.

Design

Data were used from the Boston Area Community Health Survey, an epidemiological study conducted from 2002–2005.

Setting

Data were obtained from a community-based random sample of racially and ethnically diverse men.

Patients Or Other Participants

Data were available for 1822 men.

Main Outcome Measures

Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of covariates with 1) low testosterone and 2) symptomatic AD. The operational definition of low testosterone was serum total testosterone less than 300 ng/dl and free testosterone less than 5 ng/dl; symptomatic AD was defined as the additional presence of symptoms: any of low libido, erectile dysfunction, or osteoporosis or two or more of sleep disturbance, depressed mood, lethargy, or diminished physical performance.

Results

Factors associated with low testosterone included age (OR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.11–1.66, per decade), low per-capita income ($6000 or less per household member vs. more than $30,000; OR = 2.86; 95% CI = 1.39–5.87), and waist circumference (per 10-cm increase; OR = 1.75; 95% CI = 1.45–2.12). Only age (OR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.04–1.77), waist circumference (OR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.44–2.47), and health status (OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.05–0.92, excellent vs. fair/poor) were associated with our construct of symptomatic AD. Of all variables, waist circumference was the most important contributor in both models.

Conclusions

Waist circumference is a potentially modifiable risk factor for low testosterone and symptomatic AD. Manifestation of symptoms may be a consequence of generally poor health status.

### Estrogens in men: clinical implications for sexual function and the treatment of testosterone deficiency [^1148jN45]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The role of estrogens in male sexual function and the pathogenesis of testosterone deficiency remain controversial and poorly understood.

Aims

To review the distribution of estrogens in normal and testosterone deficient men, their potential role in sexual function, and the clinical implications of elevated estrogens during testosterone therapy.

Methods

A comprehensive, broad-based literature review was conducted on the role of estrogens in male sexual function and testosterone deficiency.

Results

Estrogens elicit a variety of physiological responses in men and may contribute to modulation of sexual function. In the absence of testosterone deficiency, elevations in estrogens do not appear to be harmful and estrogens may help maintain some, but not all, sexual function in castrated men. While the therapeutic use of estrogens at pharmacologic doses has been used to suppress serum testosterone, naturally occurring elevations of estrogens do not appear to be a cause of low testosterone. During testosterone replacement, estrogens may rise and occasionally reach elevated levels. There is a lack of evidence that treatment of elevated estrogen levels during testosterone replacement has benefit in terms of male sexuality.

Conclusion

Further research on the importance of estrogens in male sexual function is needed. Current evidence does not support a role of naturally occurring estrogen elevations in testosterone deficiency or the treatment of elevated estrogens during testosterone therapy.

### Dihydrotestosterone: biochemistry, physiology, and clinical implications of elevated blood levels [^112qVZSZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Sexual function

Perhaps the most controversial area with regards to the nonprostate-related effects of DHT in male health is in the area of sexual function, particularly with respect to the reversibility, or lack thereof, of sexual side effects that are attributed to the 5AR-Is. Multiple large studies have reported sexual dysfunction in men with BPH taking finasteride or dutasteride, including three large, placebo-controlled studies. Overall, use of 5AR-Is is associated with a 5% to 9% prevalence of new-onset erectile dysfunction and decreased libido. These data strongly point to a role for endogenous DHT in the maintenance of normal sexual and ejaculatory function and sexual desire. And, in fact, this has been shown to be true in healthy young men where serum DHT concentration was revealed to be the sole independent predictor of orgasm frequency, a surrogate for overall male sexual function.

The impact of reductions in serum DHT in younger men, who may be using 5AR-Is for MAA, is more controversial. In particular, some retrospective analyses and case series have suggested that sexual side effects in younger men taking 5AR-Is are irreversible; however, it should be noted that such analyses may suffer from recall bias, and all lack a placebo control, so the findings should be treated with caution until appropriately designed trials are conducted. Of note is one placebo-controlled trial in healthy young men that revealed small changes in sexual function and semen parameters (but not fertility) with both finasteride and dutasteride over 1 year. But all of these changes reverted to baseline 6 months after drug cessation. The role of estrogens in sexual desire and erectile function in men was recently highlighted in an elegant study from Finkelstein et al. Studies of exogenous DHT are largely consistent with these findings and show that DHT maintains or improves sexual function, including a minor role (secondary to T) in maintenance of normal erectile function. However, possibly through decreases in serum estradiol concentrations, elevated DHT may not help to maintain sexual desire. Notably, inclusion of dutasteride with T replacement did not alter sexual function in older men with low T. In summary, endogenous DHT appears to play a role in the maintenance of normal sexual function, including libido, in younger and older men. We have not identified any literature to suggest modest or even substantial increases in circulating DHT have a negative impact on male sexual function.

### Negative correlation between metabolic score for insulin resistance index and testosterone in male adults [^1149EWZx]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testosterone, the primary male sex hormone produced by Leydig cells, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in males, such as sexual function, metabolism, cardiovascular health, bone density, and cerebral function. However, insufficient levels of serum testosterone in males can trigger dysfunctions in multiple organs, which are manifested as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and potentially exacerbating metabolic disorders such as depression and osteoporosis. which is commonly referred to as the testosterone deficiency syndrome, or male hypogonadism. Testosterone deficiency is a prevalent disorder influencing approximately 7% of males aged 50 and above, and its occurrence tends to increase as the growth of age. As suggested by projections, this condition will escalate alongside the average lifespan in the forthcoming decades. Furthermore, hypogonadism is common in males with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and about one-third of males with T2DM have low serum testosterone levels. Testosterone deficiency was increasingly alarming worldwide.

As a significant contributory factor, IR plays a crucial role in the development and advancement of cardiometabolic diseases. Furthermore, it has been observed that hypogonadism is prevalent among individuals with metabolic comorbidities, including DM and obesity. In spite of this, lots of studies have underscored the close correlation between IR and testosterone deficiency. According to the study of Souteiro et al. IR can serve as the primary risk factor for low testosterone levels in obese males, and some males suffering from testosterone deficiency exhibit a higher IR index than those with mild DM. In addition, a deficiency or decrease in testosterone can be linked to the development of metabolic disorders, including increased IR and visceral lipids. Moreover, the bidirectional relationship between metabolic disorders and hypogonadism has been established in cases of functional hypogonadism and late-onset hypogonadism. Therefore, it is a prominent research field to investigate the correlation between IR and male testosterone.

### Sex-differential testosterone response to long-term weight loss [^1155GvVp]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

In approximately 40% of men, obesity is associated with low testosterone together with low SHGB and increased oestradiol, and with low or inappropriately normal gonadotropins. In our study, despite an average age of male subjects of 55 years, only a single male was affected by hypogonadism. However, the median testosterone level of male subjects was below the reference range.

The weight loss interventions led to an increase in total testosterone over 12, 24 and 36 months with an increase in SHBG from baseline up to 24 months. The sustained increase in SHBG levels and in total and CFT in males was previously attributed to reduction in visceral adipose tissue and to alterations in testosterone metabolism with relative decreases in aromatization and lower 5α-reductase activity. The restoration of testosterone levels may help to relieve fatigue and improve reduced libido. As testosterone inhibits stem cell differentiation into adipocytes and promotes myogenesis, testosterone supplementation in males results in favourable change in body composition with reduction in total and abdominal fat mass and preservation of lean body mass. Notably recent recommendations by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) endorsed screening men with obesity for hypogonadism and evaluation of body weight in men with hypogonadism.

### Androgens and female sexual function and dysfunction – findings from the fourth international consultation of sexual medicine [^1129qTcj]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Androgens have been implicated as important for female sexual function and dysfunction.

Aim

To review the role of androgens in the physiology and pathophysiology of female sexual functioning and the evidence for efficacy of androgen therapy for female sexual dysfunction (FSD).

Methods

We searched the literature using online databases for studies pertaining to androgens and female sexual function. Major reviews were included and their findings were summarized to avoid replicating their content.

Main Outcome Measures

Quality of data published in the literature and recommendations were based on the GRADES system.

Results

The literature supports an important role for androgens in female sexual function. There is no blood androgen level below which women can be classified as having androgen deficiency. Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated that transdermal testosterone (T) therapy improves sexual function and sexual satisfaction in women who have been assessed as having hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The use of T therapy is limited by the lack of approved formulations for women and long-term safety data. Most studies do not support the use of systemic dehydroepiandrosterone therapy for the treatment of FSD in women with normally functioning adrenals or adrenal insufficiency. Studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of vaginal testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy are ongoing.

Conclusion

Available data support an important role of androgens in female sexual function and dysfunction and efficacy of transdermal T therapy for the treatment of some women with FSD. Approved T formulations for women are generally unavailable. In consequence, the prescribing of T mostly involves off-label use of T products formulated for men and individually compounded T formulations. Long-term studies to determine the safety of T therapy for women and possible benefits beyond that of sexual function are greatly needed.

Patients with chronic illness and low testosterone concentrations — treatment individualization: Many chronic disorders are associated with an increased risk of low testosterone concentrations and related symptoms, but the paucity of randomized controlled trial data on efficacy or safety precludes a general recommendation for testosterone therapy in these conditions. Clinicians must individualize the decision to treat or not to treat based on the severity of symptoms, the degree of testosterone deficiency, confounding effects of the comorbid illness, patient preferences, and the uncertainty of the risks and benefits of therapy.

Testosterone is important for muscle mass, bone strength, hair growth, and sexual function. Low testosterone can cause symptoms such as low energy, poor concentration, depression, low libido, and erectile dysfunction. Testosterone deficiency is the condition of having low testosterone and 1 or more of these symptoms. Testosterone deficiency is common, affecting approximately 7% of men in their 50s, and increases with age. In some cases, the testes are not able to make enough testosterone. In other cases, the brain is not making enough luteinizing hormone, which signals the testes to make testosterone. Both can result from infection, trauma, exposure to toxins such as chemotherapy, or genetic conditions. Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, obesity, anemia, and HIV infection are also linked to low testosterone. Certain medications such as opioids, corticosteroids, and anabolic steroids can lead to low testosterone.

When testosterone deficiency is suspected, a man should undergo a medical history and physical examination by either his primary care physician or a specialist. Blood tests to check the morning total testosterone level are typically performed twice to confirm the diagnosis. Other blood or imaging tests may also be necessary. The standard treatment for testosterone deficiency is testosterone therapy, which comes in formulations such as topical gels, self-injection, and pellets under the skin. These medications should be avoided in men interested in having children, as they can decrease sperm production and fertility. Men taking TT should be seen regularly by their physician. Side effects of TT can include changes in mood, headache, hair growth, male pattern baldness, breast tenderness, acne, and decreased testicular size. Regular blood tests are necessary to check testosterone levels and blood counts, which can become abnormally high.

There is no strong evidence that TT increases risk of blood clots. Testosterone can affect the prostate, and some men with prostate conditions should not use TT. While TT does not cause prostate cancer, men with untreated prostate cancer or men recently treated for high-risk prostate cancer should avoid TT. Men taking TT should ask their physician about prostate cancer screening. The evidence is not conclusive whether TT can worsen urinary symptoms from an enlarged prostate. Men with low testosterone are at increased risk of CVD. It is not known whether this risk is due to low testosterone or because men with low testosterone are more likely to have other medical conditions linked to CVD, such as high blood pressure, obesity, and high cholesterol. Further research is needed on the risks and benefits of TT for cardiovascular health.
