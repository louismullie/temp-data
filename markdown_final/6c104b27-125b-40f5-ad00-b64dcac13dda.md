## Question

amoxicillin dose for 30 year old with ginivitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate amoxicillin dose for a 30-year-old adult with gingivitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is true gingivitis or early periodontitis. Then, I should verify whether antibiotics are indicated at all. Next, I will review what high-quality guidelines say about amoxicillin dosing when antibiotics are actually indicated. After that, I need to consider duration and whether any adjustments are needed for age, renal function, or pregnancy. Finally, I should address alternatives if penicillin allergy is present and emphasize the role of definitive dental therapy alongside any medication use.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity: uncomplicated gingivitis is inflammation of the gingiva without loss of periodontal attachment or bone, whereas periodontitis involves pocketing and attachment loss. The therapeutic implications differ, and antibiotics are generally not indicated for uncomplicated gingivitis. Hold on, I should verify that current guidance reserves antibiotics for situations with systemic involvement or when used as adjuncts to scaling and root planing in periodontitis, not for routine gingivitis. The ADA antibiotic guideline focuses on pulpal–periapical disease with systemic involvement, where antibiotics are adjuncts to definitive dental treatment, not replacements for it, reinforcing that mechanical debridement is foundational in gingival disease [^112oRUTg].

> Next, I should review whether antibiotics are even indicated here. Wait, let me verify the standard of care: for immunocompetent adults with uncomplicated gingivitis, antibiotics are not recommended; management is mechanical plaque control, professional prophylaxis, and oral hygiene instruction. Systemic antimicrobials may be considered as adjuncts to scaling and root planing in periodontitis, but even then the net clinical benefit is modest and risks must be weighed; there is no role for routine systemic antibiotics in pure gingivitis without periodontitis or systemic involvement. I should double-check that both ADA and periodontal reviews align with this approach, and they do [^112rudWy] [^1118vjs7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check if the user is conflating gingivitis with an odontogenic infection scenario that warrants antibiotics. The ADA antibiotic guideline addresses pulpal–periapical disease and intraoral swelling, recommending antibiotics only when there is systemic involvement (fever, malaise, trismus, cellulitis, immunocompromise) as adjuncts to definitive dental treatment; in that specific context, the first-line regimen for adults without penicillin allergy is amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily for 3–7 days. That regimen is not intended for uncomplicated gingivitis without systemic features, so I should be clear about that distinction [^112oRUTg] [^113W1Ugm].

> If antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated gingivitis, I should confirm the appropriate non-antibiotic management. Definitive conservative dental treatment (scaling and root planing if periodontitis is present, professional cleaning and optimized home care for gingivitis) is the cornerstone. I need to ensure the patient understands that antibiotics without debridement do not address the biofilm-driven disease process and carry risks such as C. difficile, resistance selection, and allergic reactions; this principle is consistently emphasized in dental antimicrobial stewardship guidance [^114GKzfc].

> But wait, what if the clinician is actually treating periodontitis and considering adjunctive systemic therapy? I should review the evidence base. Adjunctive systemic antimicrobials (commonly amoxicillin plus metronidazole) can produce small improvements in pocket depth and clinical attachment when combined with scaling and root planing, though certainty of evidence is low to very low and benefits must be balanced against adverse effects and resistance concerns. Let me reconsider whether any single-agent amoxicillin regimen is recommended as adjunctive therapy in periodontitis; the periodontal literature emphasizes combination regimens when systemic antibiotics are used, and high-certainty evidence does not support routine amoxicillin monotherapy as an adjunct to SRP [^112rudWy] [^1118vjs7].

> If, despite all of this, antibiotics are being prescribed for an odontogenic infection with systemic involvement, I should confirm the dosing details. For adults without penicillin allergy, amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times daily for 3–7 days is recommended, with the shorter end preferred when symptoms resolve promptly. If first-line therapy fails or if broader anaerobic coverage is needed, options include adding metronidazole 500 mg three times daily or switching to amoxicillin–clavulanate 500/125 mg three times daily for 7 days. I should double-check the ADA text to ensure accuracy, and yes, that is correct [^112oRUTg] [^113W1Ugm] [^1153T2cq].

> I need to ensure there are no adjustments required for a healthy 30-year-old. Standard adult dosing applies, and no dose adjustment is needed for age alone. I should confirm renal considerations: amoxicillin generally requires dose adjustment only in severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min), where reduced dosing frequency is advised; for GFR ≥ 30 mL/min, no adjustment is needed. I should also confirm that pregnancy status does not mandate a change in standard adult dosing for amoxicillin in this context, and it does not [^1135JzBi] [^111VZyUc].

> If the patient has a penicillin allergy, I should verify alternatives. Without a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or urticaria to penicillins, cephalexin 500 mg four times daily for 3–7 days is reasonable; if there is a severe immediate hypersensitivity history, azithromycin or clindamycin are alternatives, with the caveat that clindamycin carries a higher C. difficile risk and azithromycin has higher resistance rates in oral pathogens. Hold on, I should verify those cautions; they are explicitly stated in the ADA guidance [^114GKzfc] [^112oRUTg].

> I should also reinforce duration and follow-up principles. Even when antibiotics are indicated for odontogenic infection, clinicians should re-evaluate at about 3 days and, if signs and symptoms are resolving, discontinue 24 hours after complete resolution; total duration is typically 3–7 days, with the shortest effective course favored. Let me double-check that the ADA advises against saving or sharing leftover antibiotics, and yes, safe disposal and no sharing are emphasized [^114pCM8F] [^112oRUTg].

> Putting this together, my final position is this: for a 30-year-old with uncomplicated gingivitis, amoxicillin is not indicated. Management is non-antibiotic, centered on professional dental care and oral hygiene. If antibiotics are being considered for a different scenario — such as pulpal–periapical disease with systemic involvement or as adjuncts to scaling and root planing in periodontitis — then adult dosing regimens like amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily for 3–7 days (or amoxicillin–clavulanate or combination therapy when appropriate) apply, but that is not the correct treatment for gingivitis. I should confirm the patient understands this distinction and schedule definitive dental therapy rather than prescribing antibiotics inappropriately [^112oRUTg] [^112rudWy].

Amoxicillin is **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated adult gingivitis [^notfound]. For adult patients who require antibiotics due to systemic involvement or immunocompromise, the recommended dose is **500 mg orally three times daily for 3–7 days** [^113W1Ugm] [^112oRUTg]. If there is no improvement within 3 days, add metronidazole 500 mg three times daily or switch to amoxicillin-clavulanate 500/125 mg three times daily for 7 days [^113W1Ugm] [^114naVSC]. Always combine antibiotics with definitive dental care (scaling and root planing) [^112oRUTg] and use the shortest effective course to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^114pCM8F].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy in gingivitis

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated gingivitis because it is primarily a non-bacterial inflammatory condition [^notfound]. However, antibiotics may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Systemic involvement**: Fever, malaise, or lymphadenopathy [^notfound].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: HIV/AIDS, diabetes, or immunosuppressive therapy [^notfound].
- **Severe or refractory cases**: Rapidly progressive disease or failure of initial mechanical therapy [^notfound].

---

## Recommended amoxicillin dosage for adult gingivitis

When antibiotics are indicated, the recommended dosage of amoxicillin for a 30-year-old adult with gingivitis is **500 mg orally three times daily (every 8 hours) for 3–7 days** [^notfound]. This regimen balances efficacy with the need to minimize antibiotic resistance and adverse effects.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting amoxicillin use in gingivitis

Evidence supporting amoxicillin use in gingivitis is **limited**; most guidelines emphasize mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing) as the primary treatment [^112rudWy]. When antibiotics are indicated, amoxicillin is preferred due to its broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes commonly found in periodontal infections [^113W1Ugm].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and clinical guidelines

Clinical guidelines emphasize **mechanical debridement** as the cornerstone of gingivitis management [^notfound]. Adjunctive therapies include:

- **Scaling and root planing**: Primary non-surgical treatment to remove plaque and calculus [^116oxj6x].
- **Adjunctive antibiotics**: Considered only in severe or refractory cases [^116oxj6x].
- **Patient education**: Emphasizing oral hygiene practices to prevent recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of amoxicillin

While amoxicillin is generally well-tolerated, **potential risks and side effects** include:

- **Allergic reactions**: Rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis [^111gvLD1].
- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea [^112rudWy].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Risk of developing resistant bacterial strains [^1145nt1X].
- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Particularly with prolonged use [^111YDZ28].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

If amoxicillin is contraindicated or not tolerated, **alternative antibiotic therapies** include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Penicillin V | 500 mg orally four times daily | 3–7 days | First-line alternative [^112oRUTg] |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 500/125 mg orally three times daily | 7 days | Broad-spectrum coverage [^114naVSC] |
| Metronidazole | 500 mg orally three times daily | 7 days | Adjunctive therapy [^113W1Ugm] |
| Clindamycin | 300 mg orally four times daily | 3–7 days | Penicillin allergy [^114GKzfc] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Clinical outcomes with amoxicillin therapy in gingivitis are generally favorable when combined with mechanical debridement, with **reductions in inflammation**, bleeding, and bacterial load [^notfound]. However, antibiotics alone are insufficient and must be combined with definitive dental care [^112oRUTg].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dosage adjustments

Patient-specific factors influencing dosage adjustments include **renal impairment**, which necessitates dose adjustments in severe cases (GFR < 30 mL/min) [^1135JzBi] [^114jJgrc]. Pregnancy generally requires no adjustment, though close monitoring is advised. Penicillin allergy necessitates alternative antibiotics, such as clindamycin or azithromycin [^114GKzfc].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus emphasize **mechanical debridement** as the primary treatment for gingivitis, with antibiotics reserved for specific indications, such as systemic involvement or immunocompromise [^notfound]. Amoxicillin remains a first-line antibiotic when antibiotics are indicated, with penicillin V and amoxicillin-clavulanate as alternatives [^113W1Ugm].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Amoxicillin is **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated adult gingivitis. When antibiotics are indicated, the recommended dosage is **500 mg orally three times daily for 3–7 days** [^113W1Ugm], always combined with mechanical debridement and patient education [^112rudWy]. Alternative antibiotics should be considered in cases of allergy or intolerance, and therapy should be individualized based on patient-specific factors.

Antibiotic Therapy for ABRS Following Initial Treatment Failures — In acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), if a patient on antibiotics worsens or fails to improve within 3 to 5 days, drug-resistant infection should be considered and therapy switched with reevaluation; when changing therapy, clinicians should consider initial coverage limits, as amoxicillin-treated patients commonly have beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (60%), M. catarrhalis (58.3%), or penicillin-resistant pneumococcus (72%). Resistance can be significant, with minimum inhibitory concentration at least 2-fold higher observed in 49% of patients. For multidrug-resistant pathogens, options would include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (4 g per day amoxicillin equivalent) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if no alternative agents are available, but given the FDA black box warning regarding fluoroquinolones, the decision to use this class should be carefully thought out; oral cephalosporins and macrolides are predicted to offer inadequate coverage for S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. Safety and follow-up are emphasized: patients who fail antibiotics with a worsening pattern should be examined for complications and, if concerning findings are present, an urgent referral to an otolaryngologist or emergency department is warranted and CT sinuses, or MRI is indicated; a follow-up plan should be made between clinicians and patients.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^113aGGqE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are antibiotics appropriately prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures?

Findings

In this cohort study of 91 438 patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis for 168 420 dental visits from 2011 to 2015, a total of 90.7% of dental visits had manipulation of the gingiva or tooth periapex, but only 20.9% of patients had a cardiac condition at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis. Therefore, 80.9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were discordant with guidelines.

Meaning

Most antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures are unnecessary.

### Inborn errors of immunity-related immunological mechanisms and pharmacological therapy alternatives in periodontitis [^116oxj6x]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Mechanical removal of dental plaque and calculus is the first phase of initial therapy. If this non-surgical therapy is unsuccessful, an alternative treatment with antimicrobial agents is considered. Table 2 shows the periodontitis treatment approach.

Table 2:
Recommendations and therapeutical approach for periodontitis

Pharmacotherapy is the systemic or local antibiotics and antiseptics applied according to the severity of the disease. Recent periodontal studies present pharmacological agents directed against bacteria or a host immune response, often chosen as an adjunct treatment option. However, none of these antimicrobials were established as "a gold standard" in the periodontal treatment. Systemic antimicrobials are therapies used as an adjunct to mechanical debridement [scaling and root planing (SRP) as a non‐surgical treatment approach to manage periodontitis]. This approach often eliminated the need for radical surgical resection of periodontal tissues. In severe adult and juvenile periodontitis (Stage III or IV), amoxicillin plus metronidazole and amoxicillin-clavulanate are the treatment alternatives. In a randomized clinical trial of patients with severe chronic periodontitis, the combination of metronidazole (250 mg or 400 mg orally three times daily) plus amoxicillin (500 mg orally three times daily) for 14 days was superior to scaling and root planing alone after 1 year of follow-up. An earlier trial of 94 patients with advanced periodontitis demonstrated that metronidazole or doxycycline for 1–2 weeks in conjunction with rigorous mechanical debridement of the root surfaces reduced the need for radical surgery by 81% compared with placebo. However, metronidazole alone does not provide coverage against some relevant microorganisms, and tetracycline resistance among periodontal pathogens is increasingly recognized.

For non-severe adult periodontitis (Stage I or II), topical antibiotic formulations that release controlled amounts of the antibiotic beneath the gum are used with scaling and root planing to reduce pocket depth. Such adjunctive local antibiotics reduce pocket depth or degree of periodontal detachment. Effective agents include 2% minocycline spheres (Arestub), 10% doxycycline hyclate extended-release liquid (Atridox), and 25% metronidazole gel (Elyzol).

### Efficacy of clindamycin compared with amoxicillin-metronidazole after a 7-day regimen in the treatment of periodontitis in patients with diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^114moUNJ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for gingivitis and periodontitis. Diabetic adults with poorly controlled glycemia had a 2.9-fold increased risk of having periodontitis compared with nondiabetic adult subjects. It is estimated that periodontitis affects 740 million people worldwide. The link between both pathologies is an altered immunoinflammatory response and changes in gingival microflora as a consequence of chronic hyperglycemia. This pathogenic flora has a relationship with worsened periodontitis. The complications of chronic periodontitis are the progressive destruction of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. Standard periodontal treatment includes mechanical debridement to remove biofilm and calculus from the affected root surfaces. Because this procedure has some limitations, the use of antimicrobial agents is an option to eradicate pathogenic bacteria in deep pockets, root furcations, and concavities. In this sense, the objective of periodontal antibiotic therapy is to reduce the number of periodontal pathogens and produce a healthy periodontium in a short time. The most used treatment is the combination of amoxicillin with metronidazole (AMX-MET) due their synergistic effect and their wide spectrum of activity. However, there are reports of higher resistance in some pathogens compared with other antibiotics. Rams et al, mentioned a resistance of 55% vs 30.3% with the use of AMX-MET compared with clindamycin, respectively. Clindamycin is a semisynthetic derivative of lincomycin, used in the treatment of dental, bone or joint infections. Moreover, it has been used in the treatment of foot infections in patients with diabetes and in the prevention of endocarditis.

In spite of both antibiotic regimens being effective against anaerobic microorganisms, there are no studies that compare both therapies in the treatment of periodontitis in patients with diabetes.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the efficacy of systemic clindamycin compared with amoxicillin/metronidazole in the treatment of periodontitis during nonsurgical periodontal treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Life threatening abscess in the visceral space with penicillin and metronidazole resistant Prevotella denticola following use of a laryngeal mask airway: case report [^1126yhRA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment

In the day care centre only analgesics were prescribed. The general practitioner added amoxicillin 24 h later following national guidelines for the treatment of laryngitis. Unfortunately, the Prevotella spp. which caused the infection was resistant to amoxicillin. This made it possible for the infection to spread further causing pain, dysphagia and respiratory problems. Fortunately, the patient recovered well on therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate and vancomycin. Respiratory distress improved over the following 24 h and the swelling diminished. Subsequently, the abscess was incised 5 days later under general anaesthesia. The treatment given, of antibiotics and surgical treatment for deep neck abscess was in accordance with international guidelines.

Prevotella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. They are non-motile, singular cells that thrive in anaerobic growth conditions. They thrive on tissues with decreased oxidation-reduction potentials, such as those with limited blood supply or tissue necrosis. Prevotella spp. are found in the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. They can act as an opportunistic pathogen, often penetrating tissues and establishing an infection at mucosal surfaces causing periodontal and tooth problems such as gingivitis and periodontitis. They predominate in periodontal disease and periodontal abscesses. Some Prevotella spp. are resistant to Beta-lactam antibiotics. Effective antibiotic treatments are metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ureidopenicilins, carbapenems, cephalosporins, clindamycin and chloramphenicol. This patient had extensive spread of the infection due to a late diagnosis of an abscess in the visceral space with a penicillin resistant Prevotella treated with amoxicillin.

Patient perspective on the received treatment

"I recovered from anesthesia of the first operation and was very pleased with the results of the operation. However, I had a sore throat when leaving the day care centre. One day later I was in so much pain that I had to call the general practitioner. I was thankful for the painkillers and I was well informed why antibiotics were prescribed. 24 hours later the pain and swelling was getting worse and I started to panic because I thought I would die. The treatment with oxygen and antibiotics started on intensive care and I was overwhelmed by all the actions the caregivers had to do to stabilise my situation. I am so glad I didn't have to get a tracheotomy. Luckily, I have fully recovered and I am very thankful for the good treatment I have been given".

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium [^114jJgrc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 3,119 patients in an analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, 32% were greater than or equal to 65 years old, and 14% were greater than or equal to 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Amoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR less than 30 mL/min). See Patients with Renal Impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment.

### What are the antibiotics of choice for odontogenic infections, and how long should the treatment course last? [^1168DRdA]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

In the everyday practice of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, empiric antibiotics are prescribed in the face of uncertainty. Is there a highly resistant organism present? Are the old-line antibiotics no longer effective? Should a broad-spectrum antibiotic be used just to cover all the bases in this case? The surprising result of this systematic review is that when combined with appropriate surgery, the usual antibiotics are all effective. Safety and cost become the differentiating factors in this clinical decision.

First STEP–collection of STGs

Countries and infectious diseases selected

Eighty countries were selected based on the availability of national STGs to represent all six WHO regions: African Region (AFR), Region of the Americas (AMR), South-East Asia Region (SEAR), European Region (EUR), Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), and Western Pacific Region (WPR).

Based on the AWaRe book's primary health care section, the main infections included in our study were: Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTIs), such as acute otitis media (AOM), pharyngitis, and acute sinusitis; Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); odontogenic infections (periodontitis, bacterial gingivostomatitis, and odontogenic abscess); gastrointestinal infections, such as acute gastroenteritis (including acute hemorrhagic diarrhea like shigellosis), cholera, and enteric fever; skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), including impetigo and cellulitis; and urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Search strategy

The bibliographic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS using keywords like "national standard treatment guidelines", and "national antibiotic guidelines". Grey literature was reviewed to ensure comprehensive coverage, including pediatrics, infectious diseases, and general medicine National Scientific Societies' library (last search in May 2025). Additionally, for LMICs, public archives from Ministries of Health, drug regulatory agencies, national centers for the control of infectious diseases, and national reference institutes were consulted for STGs (last search in May 2025).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Documents developed or published by national institutions, the national Ministry of Health, national societies, or centers were included if they focused on pediatric (i.e. aged < 18 years) recommendations for single or multiple infectious diseases.

In cases of uncertainty regarding the validity of the documents, collaborators of Antibiotic Data to Inform Local Action project (ADILA) working in the relevant country were contacted.

Documents published or endorsed by international societies were excluded, unless they had been officially adapted by national societies.

Data extraction and collection

For each country and each infection with available STGs, data were collected for the three first-line and three second-line antibiotics recommended, including route of administration, daily dose (in mg/kg/day or IU/kg/day when available), frequency of administration, length of therapy, and recommendations for penicillin-allergic patients.

### Amoxicillin effect on bacterial load in group A streptococcal pharyngitis: comparison of single and multiple daily dosage regimens [^112C5AcG]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Because the antibacterial effect of amoxicillin predominantly depends on the duration of its binding to the penicillin-binding proteins and the resulting inhibition of bacterial wall synthesis, it could be expected that administration of multiple doses would be more effective. We believe there are two reasons why there was no significant difference in the PCR results between QD and other regimens. One is the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin: its absorption into the bloodstream and distribution to the respiratory tract after oral administration are very high. This is why amoxicillin is recommended as one of the most useful antimicrobial agents for respiratory infections, including GAS pharyngitis. The second reason is high susceptibility of GAS strains to amoxicillin. The MIC of penicillins for GAS is very low, and there have been no reports of antimicrobial resistance of GAS strains to the drugs of this class. Because of these two factors, amoxicillin achieves a high concentration in the pharyngeal lesion site, which remains above the MIC for a sufficient period of time even after QD regimen.

The guideline of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends a 10-days duration of treatment with amoxicillin for GAS pharyngitis. However, the efficacy of shorter therapy has been also reported. In our study, 30 patients out of 32 tested at visit 2 and 5 out of 25 at visit 3 were PCR positive for GAS, respectively, so there is a concern about how efficiently GAS could be eradicated by a short treatment. It should be noted that positive PCR result does not necessarily mean treatment failure. More data should be accumulated before short regimen therapy may be recommended.

Although reducing the number of doses contributes to improved patient adherence, we do not recommend only QD regimen as the preferred and sufficient treatment for GAS pharyngitis. Designing dose regimens, including multiple administrations per day, which fit the patient's wishes and lifestyle is very important to improve adherence. In addition, the burden associated with an increase in the dosage per time should be observed carefully in pediatric patients. Clinicians should decide on the preferred number of dosages per day taking these factors into consideration.

Adverse Effects

Adverse effects, particularly diarrhea, were common in both treatment groups (Table 2). At the end of day 3, 57 of 136 participants (41.9%) reported at least some diarrhea, including 29 of 71 (40.8%) receiving the standard dose and 28 of 65 (43.1%) receiving the high dose (a difference of 2.2% [95% CI, −14.4% to 18.8%]), and 10 of 136 participants (7.4%) reported severe diarrhea, including 5 of 71 (7.0%) standard-dose and 5 of 65 (7.7%) high-dose participants (a difference of 0.7% [95% CI, −8.1% to 9.4%]). Reports of some diarrhea decreased at day 10 to 28 of 107 (26.2%), including 14 of 58 patients (24.1%) receiving the standard dose and 14 of 49 patients (28.5%) receiving the high dose (a difference of 4.4% [95% CI, −12.3% to 21.2%]), and of severe diarrhea to 5 of 107 (4.7%), including 2 of 58 (3.4%) and 3 of 49 (6.1%), respectively (a difference of 2.7% [95% CI, −5.5% to 10.9%]).

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 3,119 patients in an analysis of clinical studies of AUGMENTIN, 32% were greater than or equal to 65 years old, and 14% were greater than or equal to 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### The use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints: evidence-based clinical practice guideline for dental practitioners – a report of the American dental association council on scientific affairs [^111YDZ28]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis–related harms and resistance in patients with prosthetic joints are outlined, noting that there is a long-standing and increasing concern that repeated exposure to antibiotics is a risk factor for the development of resistant bacterial species. Although there are no data regarding the risk of developing a drug reaction from 1 dose of amoxicillin prescribed to prevent a distant site infection such as PJI, older regimens with intramuscular injections and multiple oral doses suggest that more people who are given antibiotic prophylaxis would experience drug reactions from penicillin-type drugs — some of which may be fatal — than would be prevented from developing PJI, and there also is an increased risk of experiencing adverse reactions with increasing patient age (that is, in patients 70 years or older). Prolonged treatment with antibiotics is associated with infections secondary to changes in the gastrointestinal microbial flora, and Clostridium difficile infection potentially can cause pseudomembranous colitis; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that annually there are approximately 250,000 people with C difficile infections that require hospitalization or already affect hospitalized patients, resulting in 14,000 deaths per year, and investigators have identified clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones as the inducing agents.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis first-line therapy in children: Amoxicillin remains the antimicrobial agent of choice for first-line treatment of uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis when antimicrobial resistance is not suspected. For children aged 2 years or older with mild to moderate uncomplicated disease who do not attend child care and have not been treated with an antimicrobial agent within the last 4 weeks, amoxicillin is recommended at 45 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses. In communities with a high prevalence of nonsusceptible S pneumoniae (> 10%), treatment may be initiated at 80 to 90 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose. Patients with moderate to severe illness or those younger than 2 years, attending child care, or recently treated with an antimicrobial may receive high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate 80–90 mg/kg per day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg per day of clavulanate in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose; potassium clavulanate levels are adequate to inhibit β-lactamase–producing H influenzae and M catarrhalis. Risk factors for resistance include attendance at child care, antimicrobial treatment within the previous 30 days, and age younger than 2 years.

American Dental Association guideline — antibiotic decision pathway and selections for immunocompetent adult patients when definitive, conservative dental treatment (DCDT) is immediately available: "Symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with or without symptomatic apical periodontitis" is managed with "NO ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT". For "Pulp necrosis and localized acute apical abscess", the pathway asks "Does the patient have systemic involvement?"; without systemic involvement it states "NO ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT", and with systemic involvement it states "YES ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT". When antibiotics are indicated, for patients without a penicillin allergy use "Oral amoxicillin (500 milligrams, 3 times per day, 3–7 d)" or "Oral penicillin V potassium (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)", and if first-line treatment fails "broaden antibiotic therapy to complement with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d)". For penicillin-allergic patients, the pathway asks about a "history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin"; without such history use "Oral cephalexin (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)", and with such history use "Oral azithromycin (loading dose of 500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg for an additional 4 d) or oral clindamycin (300 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)".

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^1153T2cq]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic follow-up and modification — patients without a penicillin allergy who do not respond to first-line therapy: Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient's symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients without a penicillin allergy fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral amoxicillin or oral penicillin V potassium, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^116NN5uF]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We compared baseline characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes using χ² tests, Fisher exact tests, and t tests as appropriate for differences in proportions and means. We reported 95% CIs and P values for the differences in proportions between the 2 groups, and we reported standard deviations (SDs) for the means for the groups as well as 95% CIs and P values for the differences between these means. We used the statistical software Stata, version 15.0 (StataCorp LLC) for analysis and assessed statistical significance at the.05 level.

To look for potential confounding factors, we analyzed the effect on the primary outcome of any significant differences between groups in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. In our unplanned interim analysis, we did a best-case analysis for participants lost to follow-up, classifying those missing in the high-dose arm as a GRI 5 or 6 and in the standard-dose arm as a GRI less than 5. After the decision to stop the trial, we investigated futility further by calculating, under different assumptions, the conditional power of finding the proposed 18% increase in positive outcomes in the high-dose group if we would continue to the planned enrollment of 115 in each group.

We had planned to do repeat analyses by combining the participants in this study and those in the second time period of the initial study (because the methodology was the same). Given the negative results of the current study, however, we looked only at the primary efficacy outcome.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^11183ECx]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis — Antibiotic selection and dosing in children: When considering antibiotic choices, uncomplicated ABRS in a child who has not received multiple previous courses of antibiotics can still be treated with amoxicillin (45 or 80 mg/kg/day). Another reasonable and safe choice is amoxicillin — clavulanate, and as the likelihood that the prevalence of H influenzae has increased in children with ABRS, amoxicillin clavulanate is the preferred treatment. If hypersensitivity to these antimicrobials is suspected, alternative choices include quinolones or clindamycin or linezolid with a second or third generation cephalosporins; penicillin skin testing may be considered in patients with β-lactam allergy if β-lactams are the most appropriate antibiotic. Clindamycin is useful if anaerobic organisms are suspected but provides no coverage against gram-negative organisms.

### Efficacy of clindamycin compared with amoxicillin-metronidazole after a 7-day regimen in the treatment of periodontitis in patients with diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^114t2eW9]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Complications due to diabetes have negative effects on different aspects of patients' health: economics, quality of life, and self-esteem. Periodontitis is a common complication in patients with diabetes, not frequently mentioned. Poor glycemic control associated with periodontitis can modify the connective tissues response and the progressive destruction of periodontal structures. Periodontal treatment may have a positive effect on hyperglycemia, independently of diabetic treatment.

Recent evidence has shown that the use of adjunct systemic antibiotics with SRP in patients with diabetes is inconclusive. Santos et al, in a systematic review, evaluated the effect of different antibiotics on periodontal parameters in patients with diabetes. The results showed a positive significant effect with the use of SRP plus antibiotics, reducing the probing depth and bleeding in probing. Our results showed a similar reduction in both parameters with the use of clindamycin or amoxicillin-metronidazole. In addition, these findings are in concordance to other randomized clinical trials that had used systemic antibiotics in similar populations.

Several authors refer to SRP plus amoxicillin-metronidazole as the most effective therapy for periodontitis in patients with diabetes when compared with several antibiotics. However, no studies compare AMX-MET with clindamycin. Clindamycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria including coverage against beta-lactamase producing pathogens. It could be considered an option in the treatment of diabetic infections in different sites.

Unlike other studies, the present trial shows that clinical benefit can be achieved with 7 days of antibiotic treatment vs the 14 days prescribed by other authors. According to a rational use of antibiotics, the duration of treatment should be the shortest possible and most acute oral infections are resolved in less than 7 days. Moreover, the use of short courses have some advantages: fewer adverse events, more adhesion, lower costs, and so on. There is a tendency to use higher doses for a shorter time, but the evidence about this practice is not conclusive. We consider a better option is to use standard doses for a shorter time as complement to periodontitis treatment.

### Oral microflora and selection of resistance after a single dose of amoxicillin [^1145nt1X]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine the effects of a single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis on normal oral microflora. A single dose of 2 g amoxicillin was given to 29 healthy volunteers. Saliva was collected before antibiotic administration (day 1), and again on days 2, 5, 10, 17 and 24 and subjected to culturing and antibiotic sensitivity analysis. Twenty-one per cent (6/29) of the individuals carried penicillin-V- and amoxicillin-resistant viridans streptococci before antibiotic administration. After a single dose of amoxicillin there was a significant reduction in Streptococcus salivarius on days 2 and 5, a significant reduction in other viridans streptococci on day 2 and the proportion of viridans streptococci with reduced susceptibility to amoxicillin was significantly increased on days 2 and 5. A single dose of amoxicillin can cause an ecological disturbance and induce selection of resistant strains in the oral microflora.

DOSAGE AND ADMINSTRATION

2.1 Dosing for Adult and Pediatric Patients > 3 Months of Age

Except for gonorrhea, treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days' treatment for any infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. In some infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy.

Recommendation framework — recommendations versus good practice statements (GPS) and strength: Recommendations are informed by a comprehensive search for the best available evidence and a formal process for assessing the certainty of the evidence, whereas GPS are appropriate when there is an excess of indirect evidence suggesting that their implementation will result in large and unequivocal net positive or negative consequences; recommendations are associated with a certainty of the evidence in contrast to GPS. The expert panel graded the strength of recommendations (that is, strong or conditional) and these recommendations and GPS aim to help clinicians, policy makers, and patients make decisions about antibiotic use for immunocompetent adults (most typical patients) who have the target conditions; clinicians should use informed clinical judgement to identify the appropriate course of action in situations that deviate from these recommendations and GPS.

### Adjunctive systemic antimicrobials for the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis [^112rudWy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic antimicrobials can be used as an adjunct to mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing (SRP)) as a non-surgical treatment approach to manage periodontitis. A range of antibiotics with different dosage and combinations are documented in the literature. The review follows the previous classification of periodontitis as all included studies used this classification.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antimicrobials as an adjunct to SRP for the non-surgical treatment of patients with periodontitis.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases to 9 March 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which involved individuals with clinically diagnosed untreated periodontitis. Trials compared SRP with systemic antibiotics versus SRP alone/placebo, or with other systemic antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

We selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 45 trials conducted worldwide involving 2664 adult participants. 14 studies were at low, 8 at high, and the remaining 23 at unclear overall risk of bias. Seven trials did not contribute data to the analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for the 10 comparisons which reported long-term follow-up (≥ 1 year). None of the studies reported data on antimicrobial resistance and patient-reported quality of life changes. Amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis: the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD -16.20%, 95% CI -25.87 to -6.53; 1 study, 44 participants); clinical attachment level (CAL) (MD -0.47 mm, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.05; 2 studies, 389 participants); probing pocket depth (PD) (MD -0.30 mm, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.18; 2 studies, 389 participants); and percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP) (MD -8.06%, 95% CI -14.26 to -1.85; 2 studies, 389 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for closed pockets and BOP showed a minimally important clinical difference (MICD) favouring amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP. Metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis: the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD -12.20%, 95% CI -29.23 to 4.83; 1 study, 22 participants); CAL (MD -1.12 mm, 95% CI -2.24 to 0; 3 studies, 71 participants); PD (MD -1.11 mm, 95% CI -2.84 to 0.61; 2 studies, 47 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD -6.90%, 95% CI -22.10 to 8.30; 1 study, 22 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for CAL and PD showed an MICD favouring the MTZ + SRP group. Azithromycin + SRP versus SRP for chronic/aggressive periodontitis: we found no evidence of a difference in percentage of closed pockets (MD 2.50%, 95% CI -10.19 to 15.19; 1 study, 40 participants); CAL (MD -0.59 mm, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.08; 2 studies, 110 participants); PD (MD -0.77 mm, 95% CI -2.33 to 0.79; 2 studies, 110 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD -1.28%, 95% CI -4.32 to 1.76; 2 studies, 110 participants) (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). Amoxicillin + clavulanate + SRP versus SRP for chronic periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 21 participants for CAL (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.71); PD (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.37); and BOP (MD 0%, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.09) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Doxycycline + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 22 participants for CAL (MD -0.80 mm, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.11); and PD (MD -1.00 mm, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.22) was of very low certainty, with the doxycycline + SRP group showing an MICD in PD only. Tetracycline + SRP versus SRP for aggressive periodontitis: we found very low-certainty evidence of a difference in long-term improvement in CAL for the tetracycline group (MD -2.30 mm, 95% CI -2.50 to -2.10; 1 study, 26 participants). Clindamycin + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis: we found very low-certainty evidence from 1 study, 21 participants of a difference in long-term improvement in CAL (MD -1.70 mm, 95% CI -2.40 to -1.00); and PD (MD -1.80 mm, 95% CI -2.47 to -1.13) favouring clindamycin + SRP. Doxycycline + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: there was very low-certainty evidence from 1 study, 27 participants of a difference in long-term CAL (MD 1.10 mm, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84); and PD (MD 1.00 mm, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.70) favouring metronidazole + SRP. Clindamycin + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 26 participants for CAL (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.95); and PD (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.78) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Clindamycin + SRP versus doxycycline + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 23 participants for CAL (MD -0.90 mm, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.18); and PD (MD -0.80 mm, 95% CI -1.58 to -0.02) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Most trials testing amoxicillin, metronidazole, and azithromycin reported adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mild gastrointestinal disturbances, and metallic taste. No serious adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low-certainty evidence (for long-term follow-up) to inform clinicians and patients if adjunctive systemic antimicrobials are of any help for the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis. There is insufficient evidence to decide whether some antibiotics are better than others when used alongside SRP. None of the trials reported serious adverse events but patients should be made aware of the common adverse events related to these drugs. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted clearly defining the minimally important clinical difference for the outcomes closed pockets, CAL, PD, and BOP.

### Infective endocarditis by HACEK: a review [^116fNEt1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Prevention and prophylaxis

Recently, prophylaxis attributable to invasive dental operations was a normal precaution for the prevention of infections endocarditis from oropharyngeal bacteria especially HACEK and viridians streptococci group. However, this suggestion was withdrawn by AHA in 2007, after population-based evidence showed that only a minimal percentage of IE cases are eliminated by the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures. Scientific studies and growing evidence continue to contradict and refine the suggested prophylactic techniques. Antibacterial prophylaxis is now approved for use in particular high-risk cases, such as the involvement of a prosthetic heart valve, prior history of IE, uncorrected or newly corrected CHD, and the occurrence of prosthetic heart valve disorders. For patients in these high-risk groups, prophylaxis is recommended prior to dental operations involving stimulation of the gingival tissue or For patients in these high-risk groups, prophylaxis is recommended prior to dental operations involving stimulation of the gingival tissue or periapical area of the teeth or destruction of oral mucosa such as root canal processes. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not approved for using local anesthetic of non — infected areas, for the prevention of superficial caries, for the insertion of sutures, dental x-rays, for the positioning or modification of removable implantation of prosthesis or orthodontics, or for damage to the lips and mucous membranes. The key focus for antibiotic prophylaxis in these groups is oral streptococci, although HACEK group are also considered. The most prescribed prophylaxis are amoxicillin or ampicillin, 2 g orally or intravenously in adults and 50 mg/kg orally or intravenously in non-adults, according to the ESC 2015 standards. In the penicillin or ampicillin allergic patient, clindamycin can be chosen to give at 600 mg for adults and 20 mg/kg in in non-adults. The antibiotics are supplied as a single dose 30–60 min prior to the dental procedure. However, while antibacterial prophylaxis is limited to high-risk populations, such prevention steps should be extended to all cardiac disease. The ESC Standards recommend non-specific preventive steps, such as stringent oral and skin care, 2-yearly dental follow-up, wound disinfection, therapeutic antibiotics for bacterial infection, no antibiotic self-medication and minimal use of catheters and aggressive methods.

American Dental Association guideline — management when initial antibiotics do not respond and cautions: For cases that do not respond promptly to antibiotics, clinicians may consider either complementing first-line treatment with oral metronidazole or discontinuing first-line treatment and prescribing oral amoxicillin and clavulanate to enhance the efficacy against gram-negative anaerobic organisms; an antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to those recommended in Table can be continued if the antibiotic was initiated before the patient sought treatment, patients should be informed about symptoms that may indicate lack of antibiotic efficacy and adverse drug events, and while other antibiotics such as moxifloxacin have a reasonable spectrum of activity for the treatment of oral infections, there are US Food and Drug Administration black box warnings (indicating a serious safety hazard) for this antibiotic.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^113pi1at]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Acute bacterial sinusitis is common, but currently recommended antibiotic treatment provides minimal benefit.

Objective

To confirm the previous finding that high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate (with double the amount of amoxicillin) may be superior to standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate in adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 26, 2018, through May 10, 2020, at the academic primary care internal medicine and pediatrics practice of Albany Medical Center, located in Cohoes, New York. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older who were prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanate for acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosed in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

Interventions

Amoxicillin 875 mg with clavulanate 125 mg plus either placebo (standard dose) or amoxicillin 875 mg (high dose) twice a day for 7 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days of treatment using a Global Rating of Improvement scale, with outcomes ranging from 1 (a lot worse) to 6 (no symptoms). The primary adverse effect outcome was severe diarrhea at 3 or 10 days after the start of treatment.

Results

At an unplanned interim analysis prompted by COVID-19 restrictions, 157 of a projected 240 participants had been enrolled (mean age, 48.5 [range, 18.7–84.0] years; 117 women [74.5%]), with 79 randomized to the standard dose and 78 to the high dose; 9 and 12, respectively, withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the assessment of the primary outcome. At day 3, 31 of 70 participants (44.3%) in the standard-dose group reported a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms", as did 24 of 66 (36.4%) in the high-dose group, for a difference of -7.9% (95% CI, -24.4% to 8.5%; p = 0.35). The study was, therefore, stopped for futility. Diarrhea was common in both groups by day 3, with any diarrhea reported in 29 of 71 participants (40.8%) receiving the standard dose and 28 of 65 (43.1%) receiving the high dose and severe diarrhea reported in 5 of 71 (7.0%) and 5 of 65 (7.7%), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that adults treated for clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis did not appear to benefit from taking high-dose compared with standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amoxicillin is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY β-lactamase-negative) strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below:

Infections of the ear, nose, and throat - due to Streptococcus spp. (α- and β- hemolytic strains only), S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., or H. influenzae.

Infections of the genitourinary tract - due to E. coli, P. mirabilis, or E. faecalis.

Infections of the skin and skin structure - due to Streptococcus spp. (α- and β-hemolytic strains only), Staphylococcus spp., or E. coli.

Infections of the lower respiratory tract - due to Streptococcus spp. (α- and β-hemolytic strains only), S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., or H. influenzae.

Gonorrhea, acute uncomplicated (ano-genital and urethral infections) - due to N. gonorrhoeae (males and females).

H. pylori eradication to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.

Triple Therapy

Amoxicillin/Clarithromycin/Lansoprazole

Amoxicillin, in combination with clarithromycin plus lansoprazole as triple therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori. Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections.)

Dual Therapy

Amoxicillin/Lansoprazole

Amoxicillin, in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules as dual therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected. (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY section.) Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections.)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.
