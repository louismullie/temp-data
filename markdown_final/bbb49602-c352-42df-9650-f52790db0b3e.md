## Question

tmp smx is prophylaxis for what in transplant patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what TMP-SMX prophylaxis covers in transplant patients, how strong the evidence is, and how to dose and adapt it across organ types and special situations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary indication and its evidence base. Then, I should verify secondary indications like toxoplasmosis and nocardiosis. Next, I will review dosing regimens and renal adjustments. After that, I need to check duration by organ type and risk modifiers. Finally, I should consider alternatives when TMP-SMX is not tolerated, special populations, and a practical synthesis of what TMP-SMX "covers" in transplant recipients.

> Let me first confirm the primary indication. TMP-SMX is first-line for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP/PCP) prophylaxis in solid organ transplant recipients, with high-quality guideline support recommending universal prophylaxis early post-transplant, typically for 3–6 months and longer in higher-risk scenarios, because without prophylaxis the incidence approximates 5–15% and mortality is substantial [^115eQFbf] [^1169qLXg] [^116BSwUv] [^113RZCEZ].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence rather than assume. The Cochrane review in non-HIV immunocompromised patients shows an approximately 85% reduction in PCP with TMP-SMX versus no prophylaxis or fluoroquinolones, with a number needed to treat around 19, which aligns with transplant cohorts where routine prophylaxis has dropped PJP incidence from roughly 10% to about 1% in the first post-transplant year [^113iBSwr] [^115C1Exg].

> Next, I should review toxoplasmosis. In heart transplantation, donor-positive/recipient-negative (D+/R−) pairs have a uniquely high risk of primary toxoplasmosis; ISHLT recommends TMP-SMX regimens for primary prophylaxis, and many centers extend or even consider lifelong prophylaxis in high-risk D+/R− recipients, given the severity of disease if untreated [^1132ohzL] [^116rPrWd].

> Hold on, I should verify nocardiosis data because this is often underappreciated. Observational and meta-analytic data suggest TMP-SMX prophylaxis reduces nocardiosis risk in SOT recipients, with an adjusted odds ratio around 0.3 and most breakthrough isolates remaining susceptible; however, some guidance frames this as a potential benefit rather than a universally mandated indication, so I need to be careful not to overstate it as a primary target in all organs [^115ihANN] [^114arfLD] [^117Gjw9d].

> I will now examine dosing regimens and renal adjustments. Standard adult prophylaxis uses either one single-strength tablet daily or one double-strength tablet three times weekly, with dose reductions by 50% when creatinine clearance is 15–30 mL/min and consideration of alternatives if CrCl is less than 15 mL/min; pediatric dosing is weight-based at approximately 5–10 mg/kg/day of the TMP component, with attention to maximum daily totals and renal function [^112E5Q19] [^115BtcTw] [^115XQQ2A].

> Let me think about duration by organ type and risk. Kidney transplant recipients generally receive 3–6 months of TMP-SMX, extended to at least 6 weeks during/after rejection therapy; liver recipients are commonly prophylaxed for 6–12 months; heart recipients get at least 6–12 months and many centers extend or use lifelong prophylaxis in D+/R− pairs; lung recipients often receive 6–12 months and may extend based on immunosuppression intensity and prior infections [^115eQFbf] [^116BSwUv] [^1132ohzL] [^116ADzhY].

> But wait, what if immunosuppression remains high beyond the usual window. I should confirm modifiers that prompt extension or re-initiation: recent or ongoing high-dose glucocorticoids, lymphopenia, rituximab exposure, CMV disease, or treatment for acute rejection increase PJP risk and support prolonged or reinstituted prophylaxis; rituximab-treated cohorts show markedly lower PJP incidence with TMP-SMX, and observational data in AAV suggest broader reductions in serious infections during the first 6 months of intensive immunosuppression [^113zQ9Ao] [^111REBZX] [^114iMnCz].

> Next, I should review alternatives when TMP-SMX is not tolerated. Atovaquone, dapsone, and aerosolized or intravenous pentamidine are acceptable substitutes for PJP prophylaxis, but they lack the broad coverage against toxoplasma and nocardia; importantly, many patients initially labeled "intolerant" can be rechallenged or desensitized, with success rates around 70–75% in HIV cohorts and transplant protocols, which helps preserve the broader-spectrum protection of TMP-SMX [^117EDyS1] [^111zSbvF] [^117FBFKv].

> I need to ensure I cover special populations. In hematopoietic cell transplantation, TMP-SMX is preferred from engraftment for at least 100–180 days and longer with chronic GVHD; in CAR T-cell therapy, prophylaxis is recommended for at least 6 months after infusion; in pediatrics, weight-based TMP-SMX regimens are standard, and some centers successfully use twice-weekly schedules, though daily or three-times-weekly regimens are more common in guidelines [^115BoQPs] [^1115NZr9] [^116F52jX] [^115XQQ2A] [^111GvntB].

> Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interactions that could alter prophylaxis decisions. TMP-SMX can increase creatinine via tubular secretion inhibition, interact with warfarin and phenytoin via CYP2C9, and has variable interactions with methotrexate; recent data suggest minimal impact on high-dose methotrexate clearance, but institutional protocols often hold TMP-SMX around HD-MTX, so I should align with local practice and monitor closely [^117RMLiu] [^113MstYM] [^116pP6Ue] [^115thPie].

> Let me reconsider what TMP-SMX "covers" in transplant patients to avoid overgeneralization. Definitively, it provides highly effective primary prophylaxis against PJP across SOT populations. Probabilistically, it reduces toxoplasmosis risk, especially in heart transplant D+/R− pairs. Likely, it lowers nocardiosis incidence, though this remains an evolving indication and should be framed as an added benefit rather than a universal mandate. It also offers partial protection against common urinary and respiratory bacterial pathogens, though resistance patterns can blunt this effect and should not replace organ-specific UTI strategies [^115eQFbf] [^1132ohzL] [^115ihANN] [^111LBHEG].

> In summary, TMP-SMX is the cornerstone post-transplant prophylaxis primarily to prevent PJP, with strong guideline endorsement and robust efficacy data; it additionally provides meaningful protection against toxoplasmosis in high-risk cardiac recipients and likely reduces nocardiosis across SOT, while its broad antibacterial activity is a bonus that must be balanced against resistance and tolerability; dosing is standardized with renal adjustments, duration is organ- and risk-adapted, and rechallenge strategies can rescue many "intolerant" patients to preserve its unique multi-pathogen coverage [^115eQFbf] [^115Se7Fh] [^1132ohzL] [^113iBSwr].

TMP-SMX is used in transplant recipients primarily to prevent **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)** [^115eQFbf] and **Toxoplasma gondii infection** [^1132ohzL], with additional coverage against **Nocardia** [^115ihANN] and select bacterial infections [^114iMnCz]. It is first-line prophylaxis for PJP in solid organ and hematopoietic transplant recipients [^115eQFbf] [^115BoQPs] and is essential for toxoplasmosis prevention in heart transplant recipients with donor-positive/recipient-negative serology [^1132ohzL]. TMP-SMX is typically given for 3–12 months post-transplant, with duration individualized to ongoing immunosuppression and rejection therapy [^115eQFbf] [^115Se7Fh]; alternatives (atovaquone, dapsone, pentamidine) are used when TMP-SMX is not tolerated [^115BoQPs].

## Primary indications for TMP-SMX prophylaxis in transplant recipients

Key characteristics by primary indication:

| **Aspect** | **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)** | **Toxoplasma gondii infection** |
|-|-|-|
| Incidence and risk | PJP is a major opportunistic infection in transplant recipients, with risk highest in the first 6–12 months post-transplant and during intensified immunosuppression [^113RZCEZ] [^114iMnCz] | Toxoplasmosis is a significant risk in heart transplant recipients with donor-positive/recipient-negative (D+/R−) serology, with high morbidity and mortality if untreated [^116rPrWd] |
| Efficacy | TMP-SMX is highly effective, reducing PJP incidence by ~85% in non-HIV immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients [^113iBSwr] | TMP-SMX is first-line for toxoplasmosis prophylaxis in D+/R− heart transplant recipients, typically for ≥ 6 months and often up to 1 year or longer depending on immunosuppression [^1132ohzL] [^116rPrWd] |
| Guidelines | Universal PJP prophylaxis is recommended for all solid organ transplant recipients [^116ZMAqU] [^115eQFbf] [^1132ohzL], typically for 3–6 months post-transplant, extended to ≥ 6 months with ongoing immunosuppression or rejection therapy [^115Se7Fh] [^1169qLXg] | ISHLT recommends TMP-SMX prophylaxis for D+/R− heart transplant recipients, with consideration of lifelong prophylaxis in high-risk cases [^1132ohzL] |

## Additional benefits of TMP-SMX prophylaxis

### Nocardia species infections

Incidence: Nocardia infections are rare but serious in transplant recipients, with higher risk in heart and lung recipients [^117Gjw9d]. Efficacy: TMP-SMX prophylaxis significantly reduces nocardiosis risk, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.3 in solid organ transplant recipients [^115ihANN]. Guidelines: Although not universally mandated, many centers extend TMP-SMX use for nocardiosis prevention, especially in high-risk recipients [^114arfLD].

---

### Bacterial infections

Spectrum: TMP-SMX provides coverage against common bacterial pathogens, including urinary tract infections and respiratory pathogens, reducing overall infection burden in transplant recipients [^114iMnCz]. Guidelines: While not a primary indication, this broad-spectrum activity is a valuable secondary benefit, particularly in renal transplant recipients [^111LBHEG].

## Duration of TMP-SMX prophylaxis

| **Transplant type** | **Standard duration** | **Extended duration indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Kidney | 3–6 months | - Ongoing immunosuppression <br/> - Rejection therapy <br/> - Rituximab exposure [^115C1Exg] |
| Liver | 6–12 months | - Ongoing immun suppression <br/> - Rejection therapy [^notfound] |
| Heart | 6–12 months | - Ongoing immunosuppression <br/> - Toxoplasma D+/R− serology [^1132ohzL] |
| Lung | 6–12 months | - Ongoing immunosuppression <br/> - Rejection therapy |
| Hematopoietic stem cell | ≥ 6 months | - Chronic GVHD <br/> - Ongoing immunosuppression [^1145Fzna] |

## Alternative prophylactic agents

When TMP-SMX is not tolerated due to allergy, hematologic toxicity, or renal impairment, **alternatives** include:

- **Atovaquone**: Effective for PJP prophylaxis, particularly in patients with TMP-SMX intolerance [^115KvHxu].

- **Dapsone**: Alternative for PJP prophylaxis, though less effective against Nocardia and Toxoplasma [^117EDyS1].

- **Pentamidine**: Aerosolized or intravenous, reserved for patients unable to tolerate oral agents [^116pP6Ue].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of TMP-SMX prophylaxis

TMP-SMX is generally well tolerated, but **adverse effects** include:

- **Hematologic toxicity**: Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia [^115Hk9rw].

- **Renal toxicity**: Hyperkalemia, elevated creatinine, particularly in patients with renal impairment [^112wqDfV].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Rash, fever, rarely Stevens-Johnson syndrome [^116rHUca].

- **Drug interactions**: Potential interactions with immunosuppressive agents, requiring careful monitoring and dose adjustments [^117RMLiu].

---

TMP-SMX is the cornerstone of infection prophylaxis in transplant recipients, primarily preventing **PJP** and **toxoplasmosis**, with additional benefits against Nocardia and bacterial infections. Its use is tailored to transplant type, immunosuppression intensity, and patient tolerance, with alternatives available when needed [^115eQFbf] [^1132ohzL].

Background

Whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis prevents nocardiosis in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effect of TMP-SMX in the prevention of nocardiosis after SOT, its dose-response relationship, its effect on preventing disseminated nocardiosis, and the risk of TMP-SMX resistance in case of breakthrough infection.

Methods

A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus up to 19 September 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

(a) Risk of nocardiosis between SOT recipients with and without TMP-SMX prophylaxis, or (b) sufficient details to determine the rate of TMP-SMX resistance in breakthrough nocardiosis.

Participants

SOT recipients.

Intervention

TMP-SMX prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Exposure (ROBINS-E) for comparative studies; dedicated tool for non-comparative studies.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

For our primary outcome (i.e. to determine the effect of TMP-SMX on the risk of nocardiosis), a one-step mixed-effects regression model was used to estimate the association between the outcome and the exposure. Univariate and multivariable unconditional regression models were used to adjust for the potential confounding effects. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

Individual data from three case-control studies were obtained (260 SOT recipients with nocardiosis and 519 uninfected controls). TMP-SMX prophylaxis was independently associated with a significantly decreased risk of nocardiosis (adjusted OR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.18–0.52, moderate certainty of evidence). Variables independently associated with an increased risk of nocardiosis were older age, current use of corticosteroids, high calcineurin inhibitor concentration, recent acute rejection, lower lymphocyte count, and heart transplant. Breakthrough infections (66/260, 25%) were generally susceptible to TMP-SMX (pooled proportion 98%, 95% CI 92–100).

Conclusions

In SOT recipients, TMP-SMX prophylaxis likely reduces the risk of nocardiosis. Resistance appears uncommon in case of breakthrough infection.

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^115WMtwo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. In settings with a low prevalence of untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, patients with hematologic malignancies constitute the largest risk group for developing PJP. Widespread use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has significantly lowered the incidence of PJP in high-risk hematological patients, but PJP still occurs in high-risk patients not tolerating TMP-SMX or after discontinuing prophylaxis, and in low-risk patients not receiving prophylactic treatment, in particular patients who have received treatment with high-dose corticosteroids.

The recommended first-line treatment for PJP in patients with hematologic malignancies is TMP-SMX given at a high dose, 15–20 mg/kg of the TMP component, but the evidence supporting this high dose is anecdotal. TMP-SMX therapy may cause dose-dependent adverse events, and previous studies have shown that the standard high-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP may be correlated to an increased frequency of such adverse events.

In a recent meta-analysis analyzing reduced-dose vs standard-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality but an 18% absolute risk reduction of adverse events with reduced doses of TMP-SMX. However, few patients with hematological malignancies were included in this study, and it is thus unclear if these findings can be generalized to a hematological population. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by comparing clinical outcomes and adverse events in hematologic patients receiving a reduced vs standard dose of TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP.

Exposure to prophylactic‐

In this study, physicians at each institution determined the selection process of patients for prophylactic TMP‐SMX. In addition, because there were no established guidelines for discontinuing TMP‐SMX, the decision about when or whether to discontinue was also made at the physician's discretion. The TMP/SMX dosage was either one single‐strength tablet (TMP 80 mg and SMX 400 mg) daily or one double‐strength tablet (TMP 160 mg and SMX 800 mg) every other day, adjusted according to the patient's renal function. No patients received alternative prophylactic agents, such as dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine.

In this study, the index date (day 0) was defined as 14 days after the initiation of RTX or CYC as induction therapy. This 14‐day lead‐in period was established to ensure a stable study population and sufficient time for evaluating the prophylactic efficacy of TMP‐SMX. Patients who developed serious infection or censored during the lead‐in period were excluded. Exposure to TMP‐SMX was determined using two approaches (Supplementary Figure 2). First, an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) design was used in which each patient was classified into the prophylaxis group if he/she received the prophylactic TMP‐SMX at the index date. In the ITT analysis, classified patients remained in their original group regardless of later treatment changes. Second, a time‐varying analysis (ie, as‐treated) was performed in which each person‐day observation was classified according to whether the patient received prophylactic TMP‐SMX. In this approach, patients were able to dynamically transit between exposed and unexposed categories without restriction, defining consecutive periods of exposure or nonexposure as episodes. In both analyses, observation for all patients started on the index date and continued until either death, loss to follow‐up (defined as no visit for more than 6 months since the last visit), or 52 weeks from the index date, whichever occurred first.

### Time-dependent effect of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on the incidence of serious infections in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a target trial emulation study [^111dDLXh]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although we have demonstrated the beneficial effects of prophylactic TMP‐SMX on the risk of serious infection, the optimal duration remains uncertain. Because the risk of serious infection is influenced by disease activity and degree of immunosuppression, the risk likely varies according to the interval from the start of induction treatment. Interestingly, this study showed that approximately 86% of serious infections occurred during the first 180 days of the observation period, and the preventive effect of TMP‐SMX was evident only during this period. Because the effect of prophylaxis is dependent on the incidence of the target disease, stable disease activity and tapering of GC 180 days after baseline could have contributed to the observed result. Previous studies on the effect of prophylactic TMP‐SMX on PJP risk showed that tapering prednisone dose to < 15 mg/day might be a relevant threshold for considering its withdrawal. However, in this study, patients received a lower dose of GC (mean ± SD: 6.9 ± 5.7 mg/day of prednisone) on day 180, and approximately 40% of the serious infections occurred when patients were receiving less than 15 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. These findings suggest that prolonged use of TMP‐SMX, for at least six months from the initiation of induction therapy, may be necessary to ensure a better outcome in patients with AAV.

### European best practice guidelines for renal transplantation. section IV: long-term management of the transplant recipient. IV.7.1 late infections. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia [^114JuNzu]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines

A. Approximately 5% of patients develop Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) after renal transplantation if they do not receive prophylaxis. PCP is a severe disease, with a very high fatality rate. Therefore, all renal transplant recipients should receive PCP prophylaxis. The treatment of choice is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), at a dose of 80/400 mg/day or 160/800 mg every other day, for at least 4 months. Patients who are treated for rejection should receive TMP-SMX prophylaxis for 3–4 months. B. In the case of TMP-SMX intolerance, aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg once or twice per month) is an alternative for prophylaxis. C. The first-line treatment of PCP is high-dose TMP-SMX. Patients with a PaO2 of < 70 mmHg initially should be treated parenterally, and the administration of additional steroids should be considered.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we demonstrated that the prophylactic use of TMP‐SMX significantly lowered the risk of serious infection in patients with AAV with the greatest impact observed during the initial 180 days of the observation period. The benefits were more evident in patients with additional risk factors for serious infections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large‐scale cohort study to focus on factors affecting the prophylactic effect of TMP‐SMX.

Patients with AAV are more susceptible to serious infections than the general population because of disease‐specific organ damage, potential long‐term effects of widespread inflammation, and medications used to treat AAV. The increased susceptibility to infection is most significant in the early phase because of intensive immunosuppressive treatment; thus, infection is one of the common causes of early mortality in patients with AAV. This study confirmed these reports, as indicated by the 1‐year incidence of serious infection after induction therapy using RTX or CYC of 30.5 per 100 person‐years, with a significant fatality rate, which suggests that decreasing the risk of serious infections is crucial for improving treatment outcomes in patients with AAV.

Despite its significant impact on the prognosis of patients with AAV, there have been few studies on optimal management to minimize the risk of infection. Notably, some recent studies have suggested that prophylactic TMP‐SMX could prevent serious infections in patients with AAV as well as PJP, which is consistent with the results of this study, in which the prophylaxis group was associated with an approximately 50% reduction in serious infections compared with the control group. The mechanisms underlying the reduced incidence of serious infections in patients receiving prophylactic TMP‐SMX remain unclear. However, TMP‐SMX has broad‐spectrum antimicrobial effects against bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, which may allow the removal of pathogens in patients with AAV. A recent meta‐analysis demonstrated that prophylactic TMP‐SMX was associated with a lower incidence of bacterial infections in patients with HIV infection. Although the antimicrobial effect of TMP‐SMX has not been thoroughly investigated in patients without HIV, our results strongly suggest that prophylactic TMP‐SMX provides additional benefits in patients with AAV beyond reducing the risk of PJP. Furthermore, we demonstrated a favorable safety profile of prophylactic TMP‐SMX, with the NNH for serious ADR being significantly higher than the NNT to prevent one case of serious infection. This risk‐benefit assessment indicates that prophylactic TMP‐SMX should be administered to patients with AAV receiving induction immunosuppressive treatment.

### Evaluation of the incidence of Nocardia infection in solid organ transplant recipients on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for opportunistic infection prophylaxis [^114arfLD]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the preferred prophylactic agent for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) and toxoplasmosis after solid organ transplant (SOT). Compared with other agents, it has additional activity against Nocardia species.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of Nocardia infection in SOT patients receiving TMP-SMX or an alternative agent for opportunistic infection (OI) prophylaxis.

Methods

This retrospective analysis included transplant recipients at a large urban medical center over a period of 4 years. All patients received either TMP-SMX or an alternative agent for PJP prophylaxis. The primary outcome was the incidence of Nocardia infection within 24 months posttransplant. Secondary outcomes included resistance rates of Nocardia isolates, usage rates of alternative prophylactic agents, reasons for using alternative agents, and rate of conversion from an alternative agent back to TMP-SMX.

Results

A total of 791 adult SOT recipients who received PJP or toxoplasmosis prophylaxis were included. Mean age at transplantation was 60.9 years with the majority of patients being male (67.3%) lung transplant recipients (63.6%). TMP-SMX was the most commonly used initial prophylactic agent (84.6%), followed by atovaquone (15.4%). Of the 791 SOT recipients, 16 (2.0%) were diagnosed with nocardiosis within 24 months posttransplant. Patients receiving alternative agents had a higher incidence of infection compared with those receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis (P < 0.001).

Conclusion and Relevance

Our findings suggest that OI prophylaxis with TMP-SMX may be protective against nocardiosis in SOT recipients. If possible, patients who are switched to an alternative agent due to TMP-SMX intolerance should be re-challenged when the adverse effect resolves. Most patients in our study were able to tolerate re-initiation, suggesting that the adverse effects associated with TMP-SMX may be temporary and may not warrant discontinuation.

### Time-dependent effect of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on the incidence of serious infections in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a target trial emulation study [^111GRNMg]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Patients

This study was designed to emulate a hypothetical target trial in which patients with AAV received or did not receive prophylactic TMP‐SMX (Supplementary Table 1). Detailed description of our study design is provided in Supplementary Text 1. We included patients with AAV from four tertiary referral hospitals in South Korea. From the electronic medical database of each institution, we identified patients with new onset or relapsing AAV who received RTX or intravenous CYC as induction therapy between 2005 and 2023. All patients were diagnosed with either granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) according to the 2022 American College of Rheumatology/EULAR classification criteria for AAV. Patients were excluded from the study if they were < 18 years of age at the time of induction with RTX or CYC, had concomitant malignancy or history of solid organ transplantation, or started the induction therapy at another hospital. The flow chart of patient inclusion is shown in Supplementary Figure 1.

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review board of each center. The requirement for patient consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study.

### Intermittent oral trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole on two non-consecutive days per week is effective as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis in pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^111GvntB]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) is a serious complication in patients receiving chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Current recommendations for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) dosing as PCP prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients are based on either daily dosing or dosing three consecutive days per week. We report our experience of prophylaxis with TMP-SMZ twice daily on two non-consecutive days per week in 145 immunocompromised children with hematologic disorders, cancer, or metabolic disorders following chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. There were no breakthrough cases of PCP. We therefore conclude our prophylaxis regimen is effective against PCP in immunocompromised children.

### Toxoplasma prophylaxis in haematopoietic cell transplant recipients: a review of the literature and recommendations [^114ktDnH]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Toxoplasmosis in haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Prophylaxis following HCT is recommended for high-risk pre-HCT toxoplasma-seropositive (pre-HCTSP) recipients. However, there is no agreement or consistency among programmes on whether to adopt prophylaxis or not, or if used, on the chosen antitoxoplasma prophylactic regimen. This review discusses the role of prophylaxis, and preemptive treatment, for toxoplasmosis in the setting of HCT.

Recent Findings

Approximately two-thirds of toxoplasmosis cases following HCT are reported in allogeneic pre-HCTSP (allo pre-HCTSP) patients. This finding confirms a major role of reactivation of latent infection in the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis in this patient population. Toxoplasma disease-related mortality in allo pre-HCTSP patients was reported at 62%, but it can be significantly decreased with early detection and treatment of toxoplasma infection. There are no randomized trials comparing the efficacy of different prophylactic agents to prevent toxoplasmosis after HCT. Several observational studies have demonstrated the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) in decreasing the incidence of toxoplasmosis following HCT. There is limited information regarding efficacy of other prophylactic agents. Preemptive treatment using routine blood PCR monitoring seems to be beneficial in detecting infection early and preventing disease in several observational studies and has been adopted for allo pre-HCTSP HCT patients when universal prophylaxis is not possible.

Summary

Universal prophylaxis with TMP/SMX in allo pre-HCTSP patients should be implemented by all transplant programmes. Preemptive treatment with routine blood PCR monitoring is an option if prophylaxis cannot be used.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111LBHEG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria after kidney transplant — In renal transplant recipients who have had the renal transplant surgery > 1 month prior, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Remarks: There is insufficient evidence to inform a recommendation for or against screening or treatment of ASB within the first month following renal transplantation. The impact of UTI may be more severe in the immediate posttransplant period (ie, within the first month), and prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, usually TMP-SMX, is routinely used during the initial 6 months following renal transplant and is probably effective in decreasing both symptomatic UTI and ASB, although antimicrobial resistance to TMP-SMX in Enterobacteriaceae may limit efficacy. Renal transplant patients with ASB have an increased frequency of symptomatic UTI, including pyelonephritis, and risk factors for acquisition of ASB include female sex, comorbidities, urologic variables, and some immunosuppressive therapies; retrospective studies have reported associations of early, but not late, graft pyelonephritis.

### Variance in Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis practice for pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation [^116Un9GY]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients can be prevented by efficient prophylaxis. We surveyed HCT centers in North America to assess their PJP prophylaxis practices. Most institutions used intravenous (IV) pentamidine (29.6%) or inhaled pentamidine (14.8%); 37% institutions changed from trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) to another medication after conditioning; and 44% administered no PJP prophylaxis during the pre-engraftment period. Most institutions avoided using TMP-SMX during the pre-engraftment period, mainly because of concerns about myelotoxicity, despite this being the preferred PJP prophylaxis agent. There is a need to evaluate the effects of TMP-SMX on engraftment.

### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients: can we always follow the guidelines? [^1115NZr9]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening disease in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the preferred prophylaxis but has significant toxicity. We assessed 139 consecutive HCT patients for PCP prophylaxis in our center. According to our procedures, TMP-SMX should be given as first-line prophylaxis from engraftment. In case of intolerance, atovaquone (ATO) or aerosolized pentamidine may be given. Thirteen (9.3%) patients did not receive prophylaxis because they early died. Of the 126 prophylaxed patients, 113 (90%) received TMP-SMX and 13 (10%) received ATO as first-line regimen. However, only 51/113 (45%) patients received TMP-SMX as the sole prophylaxis: 60 patients were switched to ATO because of side effect. There were 18 PCP cases: 3 occurred before engraftment, 7 occurred under ATO, 3 occurred while prophylaxis was pending the resolution of side effects, and 5 occurred after stopping prophylaxis. No cases occurred under TMP-SMX while 7 (9.6%) cases occurred under first-(n = 13) or second (n = 60)-line ATO. There are many concerns about PCP prophylaxis after HCT: patients may develop PCP before engraftment or several months after stopping immunosuppressors, and half of them do not receive TMP-SMX all along the at-risk periods. New prophylactic drugs and strategies should be evaluated.

### Time-dependent effect of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on the incidence of serious infections in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a target trial emulation study [^111REBZX]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) on the incidence of serious infections in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV).

Methods

This multicenter cohort study was designed to emulate a target trial that studied 296 patients with AAV who were treated with rituximab (RTX) or cyclophosphamide (CYC) as induction therapy. Patients were grouped based on the administration of TMP-SMX within 14 days following induction therapy (n = 240 and 56 patients in prophylaxis and control groups, respectively) (intention-to-treat) and also as a time-dependent exposure (time-varying). Inverse probability weighting was applied to minimize the baseline imbalance between the two groups. The primary outcome was one-year incidence of serious infection.

Results

During the 252.1 person-years of observation, 77 cases of serious infections were recorded in 65 patients with a fatality rate of 18.5%. Most serious infections (n = 66, 85.7%) occurred within the first 180 days of observation. The prophylaxis group showed a significantly lower incidence of serious infections than the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32–0.72]). However, this beneficial effect of TMP-SMX was only significant during the first 180 days (HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.22–0.76]) and not thereafter (HR 3.67 [95% CI 0.46–29.43]) (interaction P = 0.044). This result was also consistent with the time-varying analysis result. Based on one case of severe adverse drug reaction related to TMP-SMX, the number needed to harm was 127.4, whereas the number needed to treat to prevent one serious infection was 8.0.

Conclusion

Prophylactic TMP-SMX significantly reduced the risk of serious infections in patients with AAV, particularly during the first six months of induction therapy with RTX or CYC.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^116fRdDt]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a potentially life‐threatening opportunistic infection that occurs mainly in immunocompromised patients. Although first identified during the onset of the HIV epidemic in the early 1980s, PJP infection has become more common in non–HIV‐immunocompromised patients suffering from various conditions, such as malignancies, solid organ transplants, and autoimmune or inflammatory disease (AIID). Furthermore, PJP in patients without HIV typically exhibits rapid progression with a higher mortality rate than in HIV patients.

Trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMP‐SMX) is the gold standard for PJP prophylaxis, and its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in both HIV‐infected and non–HIV‐infected immunocompromised patients. Although no RCTs have specifically addressed this issue in patients with AIID, many observational studies have shown that prophylactic TMP‐SMX treatment significantly decreases the incidence of PJP in these patients, particularly when they receive prolonged, high‐dose glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. Based on these results, despite the weak level of evidence and the variation in risk depending on specific diseases and clinical settings, a recent recommendation from EULAR states that PJP prophylaxis should be taken into consideration when patients with AIID receive daily doses of prednisone exceeding 15 to 30 mg for longer than two to four weeks.

### Prevention of infection caused by Pneumocystis carinii in transplant recipients [^114iMnCz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis carinii remains an important pathogen in patients who undergo solid-organ and hematopoietic transplantation. Infection results from reactivation of latent infection and via de novo acquisition of infection from environmental sources. The risk of infection depends on the intensity and duration of immunosuppression and underlying immune deficits. The risk is greatest after lung transplants, in individuals with invasive cytomegalovirus disease, during intensive immunosuppression for allograft rejection, and during periods of neutropenia. Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) prevents many opportunistic infections, including infection with P. carinii, Toxoplasma gondii, and community-acquired respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract pathogens. Intolerance of TMP-SMZ is common; desensitization is useful less often in transplant patients than in patients with AIDS. Alternative agents provide a narrower spectrum of protection than does TMP-SMZ and less adequate protection against Pneumocystis species. Clinically, the diagnosis of breakthrough Pneumocystis pneumonia often requires invasive procedures. Strategies for the prevention of Pneumocystis infection must be individualized on the basis of a stratification of risk for each patient.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis after CAR T-cell therapy includes TMP/SMX 1 SS tablet PO QD or 1 DS PO TIW, with alternatives such as dapsone 100 mg PO QD, atovaquone 1500 mg PO QD, or pentamidine inhaled or IV monthly, with duration to start with ANC recovery (at least by d 30 post-CAR T) and continue until ≥ 6 m post-CAR T. Separately, narrative guidance states that prophylaxis with TMP/SMX is recommended to start post-CAR T cell infusion until at least 6 mo, citing a study where 2 of 40 patients developed PJP pneumonia < 6 mo when prophylaxis was discontinued at 3 mo, and noting some centers use a threshold of < 200 cells/ mm³ to guide duration.

Pneumocystis infection manifests predominantly as an interstitial pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Diagnostic testing in the appropriate clinical context can be highly sensitive and specific and involves radiographic imaging, fungal biomarkers, nucleic acid amplification, histopathology, and lung fluid or tissue sampling. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remains the first-choice agent for treatment and prophylaxis. Investigation continues to promote a deeper understanding of the pathogen's ecology, epidemiology, host susceptibility, and optimal treatment and prevention strategies in solid organ transplant recipients.

### Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis with atovaquone in trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-intolerant orthotopic liver transplant patients: a preliminary study [^111wmyFv]. Liver Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic infection associated with increased morbidity and mortality in solid-organ and bone-marrow transplant recipients. Side effects of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) are frequent; therefore, we performed a preliminary study using atovaquone suspension, 750 mg once daily, for 1 year for the prevention of PCP in liver transplant recipients intolerant to TMP/SMX therapy. Twenty-eight patients were treated, and data were analyzed for efficacy and toxicity. Adverse events occurred in 14 subjects, mainly related to the gastrointestinal tract. Side effects from TMP/SMX, i.e., rash, completely resolved and bone-marrow suppression improved in 62% of patients. No patients developed Pneumocystis carinii infection. Although a lower dose of atovaquone once daily may be effective in transplant recipients, further studies are necessary to confirm this preliminary observation. Liver Transpl 2001;7:750–751.)

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111VvEHB]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) treatment — first-line TMP-SMX and adjuncts: TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is the treatment of choice for PCP (AI), and outpatient oral TMP-SMX is highly effective for mild-to-moderate disease (AI); lower doses may also be effective though randomized controlled data are unavailable, and the dose must be adjusted for abnormal renal function. Multiple randomized clinical trials indicate TMP-SMX is as effective as parenteral pentamidine and more effective than other regimens, and leucovorin to prevent myelosuppression during acute treatment is not recommended. Mutations associated with resistance to sulfa drugs have been documented, but their effect on outcome is uncertain. Patients who have PCP despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis usually can be treated effectively with standard doses of TMP-SMX (BIII). In moderate-to-severe disease — defined by room air PaO2 < 70 mmHg or A-a (alveolar-arterial) gradient ≥ 35 mmHg — patients should receive adjunctive corticosteroids as soon as possible and certainly within 72 hours after starting specific PCP therapy (AI).

### Immunodeficiencies in adults: key considerations for diagnosis and management [^117LJRfr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

General Preventive Measures

Prevention of infection primarily includes general hygiene measures, such as hand disinfection, wearing protective face masks during winter months in case of contact with crowds in closed spaces, and avoiding close contact with sick individuals.

Patients with SID require regular follow-ups with their primary care physician. Depending on their estimated infectious risk, they might also require follow-up with specialists to monitor immune function, infection risk, and treatment response. Follow-up visits should include clinical assessments, laboratory monitoring, and individualized adjustments to prophylactic or therapeutic strategies based on disease progression and emerging complications.

Early infection detection and intervention are crucial, as infections may present atypically, progress rapidly, and lead to severe complications. Patients should be educated on recognizing early signs of infection, including fever, persistent cough, shortness of breath, unexplained weight loss, recurrent diarrhea, or localized pain and swelling. Patients should be instructed to seek prompt medical attention if they develop any of these symptoms to facilitate early diagnosis and timely treatment.

Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Based on Infectious Risk

Patients at high risk for infection (e.g. transplant recipients, cellular therapies recipients, HIV with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm 3) (Fig. 1) may require specific antimicrobial prophylaxis. Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis is recommended in patients with cellular immunodeficiencies. First-line prophylaxis is trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), which also provides protection against Toxoplasma gondii. If TMP-SMX cannot be used, alternatives for Pneumocystis jirovecii include atovaquone or aerosolized pentamidine. Toxoplasmosis prophylaxis is also recommended in patients at high risk, including toxoplasma-seropositive HIV-infected persons with CD4 counts below 200 cell/mm 3 and toxoplasma-seronegative heart transplant recipients receiving an allograft from a seropositive donor. When TMP-SMX cannot be used, patients at risk for toxoplasmosis may require dapsone combined with pyrimethamine and folinic acid. Given their complexity and potential toxicities, they should preferably be prescribed with input from an infectious diseases or immunology specialist.

### Impact of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on clearance of high-dose methotrexate in adult patients [^113MstYM]. JCO Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is an antineoplastic dosing strategy used to treat various cancers including primary central nervous system lymphoma. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is commonly used for antibiotic prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia infections in this patient population. Significant drug-drug interactions between TMP/SMX and methotrexate (MTX) leading to adverse outcomes have been documented, primarily in adult patients taking MTX for rheumatologic conditions.

Methods

This study is a single-center, retrospective, cohort study comparing outcomes in patients where TMP/SMX was held during HDMTX and patients who received concurrent prophylactic TMP/SMX during treatment. The primary end point was mean MTX level at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Secondary end points included rate of nonhematologic toxicity, rate of hematologic toxicity, median days to MTX clearance, and frequency of glucarpidase utilization.

Results

In total, 248 cycles of HDMTX were analyzed from 221 individual patients. One hundred ninety-one cycles were administered without prophylactic TMP/SMX, and 57 were administered with TMP/SMX. The median MTX level at 24, 48, and 72 hours in those without versus with prophylactic TMP/SMX was 4.30 versus 4.30, 0.29 versus 0.30, and 0.14 versus 0.15, respectively. Similarly, rates of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities did not differ significantly between groups with the exception of neutropenia; however, there was no corresponding increased rate of neutropenic fever. Only one patient received glucarpidase and had not received TMP/SMX.

Conclusion

Prophylactic TMP/SMX had minimal interaction with HDMTX and does not lead to increased time to clearance or clinically relevant toxicities. Prophylactic TMP/SMX can be safely administered with HDMTX in adult patients.

### Time-dependent effect of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on the incidence of serious infections in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a target trial emulation study [^112QdDQH]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis (AAV) is a group of autoimmune diseases characterized by the severe inflammation of small blood vessels and the development of autoantibodies to the proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase. AAV poses significant clinical challenges because of potential major organ involvement, especially the respiratory tract and kidney. To achieve remission of life‐threatening AAV, glucocorticoids (GCs) combined with either rituximab (RTX) or cyclophosphamide (CYC) have been recommended. However, these intensive immunosuppressive therapies increase the risk of infection, which is the most frequent cause of death, especially in the early phase of the disease. Hence, preventing serious infection‐related complications is crucial to improve the treatment outcome of AAV.

Trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMP‐SMX) is widely used as primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in patients who are immunocompromised, including those with rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Notably, a few observational studies recently suggested that prophylactic TMP‐SMX could reduce the risk of serious infections, as well as PJP. Based on these findings, the EULAR recommended the prophylactic use of TMP‐SMX against PJP and other infections in patients with AAV. However, the effect of TMP‐SMX on the incidence of non‐PJP–related infection has not been confirmed in other studies. Furthermore, the risk of serious infections could be influenced by various patient‐specific factors, including disease activity, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive treatment. Moreover, the interaction between these factors and the efficacy of prophylactic TMP‐SMX against serious infections has not been thoroughly investigated. Using a target trial emulation framework, this observational study aimed to investigate the effect of prophylactic TMP‐SMX on serious infections and the clinical factors influencing its effectiveness in a large‐scale cohort of patients with AAV.

### Invasive Nocardia infections across distinct geographic regions, United States [^117Gjw9d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

TMP/SMX dosage for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis after organ transplantation is not necessarily protective against invasive Nocardia infection. Guidelines addressing Nocardia infections in solid organ transplantation suggest that TMP/SMX prophylaxis might be helpful in preventing primary Nocardia infection or relapse after treatment, although infections can occur despite prophylaxis. For secondary prophylaxis, a TMP/SMX dosage of 1 double-strength tablet daily (dosage-adjusted for renal function) has been offered as a consideration, although that recommendation was weak and supported by low-quality evidence.

A recent study reported a death rate after 1 year of 16.8% in solid organ transplant recipients with Nocardia infection. Independent risk factors for death included liver transplantation and time from symptom onset to seeking treatment; disseminated infection was not associated with increased death. Our study found death rates after 1 year of 19.5% among transplant recipients and 9.4% among non–transplant patients, an observation concordant with findings in a larger study from Europe of nocardiosis in solid organ transplant recipients. However, another recent publication noted similar death rates for transplant and non–transplant recipients. Retrospective designs, different underlying risk factors for infection, and variable definitions used in published studies make drawing firm conclusions difficult.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113xQthG]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV pediatric PCP prophylaxis — TMP-SMX dosing and resistance considerations: For trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the total daily dose should not exceed 320 mg TMP and 1600 mg SMX, and in patients with impaired renal function, a reduced dose may be necessary. TMP-SMX, preferably given daily, also is effective in preventing toxoplasmosis and some bacterial infections. Dihydropteroate synthase gene mutations in Pneumocystis from humans have been observed with TMP-SMX and dapsone prophylaxis, suggestive of possible drug resistance, but studies for clinical correlates have not provided conclusive results, and prolonged TMP-SMX prophylaxis for PCP is associated with the emergence of TMP-SMX resistant bacterial species due to selective pressure, a point to be considered in managing bacterial infections in patients receiving prophylaxis.

Objective

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of prophylactic trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMP‐SMX) on the incidence of serious infections in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis (AAV).

Methods

This multicenter cohort study was designed to emulate a target trial that studied 296 patients with AAV who were treated with rituximab (RTX) or cyclophosphamide (CYC) as induction therapy. Patients were grouped based on the administration of TMP‐SMX within 14 days following induction therapy (n = 240 and 56 patients in prophylaxis and control groups, respectively) (intention‐to‐treat) and also as a time‐dependent exposure (time‐varying). Inverse probability weighting was applied to minimize the baseline imbalance between the two groups. The primary outcome was one‐year incidence of serious infection.

Results

During the 252.1 person‐years of observation, 77 cases of serious infections were recorded in 65 patients with a fatality rate of 18.5%. Most serious infections (n = 66, 85.7%) occurred within the first 180 days of observation. The prophylaxis group showed a significantly lower incidence of serious infections than the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32–0.72]). However, this beneficial effect of TMP‐SMX was only significant during the first 180 days (HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.22–0.76]) and not thereafter (HR 3.67 [95% CI 0.46–29.43]) (interaction P = 0.044). This result was also consistent with the time‐varying analysis result. Based on one case of severe adverse drug reaction related to TMP‐SMX, the number needed to harm was 127.4, whereas the number needed to treat to prevent one serious infection was 8.0.

Conclusion

Prophylactic TMP‐SMX significantly reduced the risk of serious infections in patients with AAV, particularly during the first six months of induction therapy with RTX or CYC.

### Urinary tract infections in renal transplant recipients at a quaternary care centre in Australia [^113uXHNw]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common of infections after renal transplantation. The consequences of UTIs in this population are serious, with increased morbidity and hospitalisation rates as well as acute allograft dysfunction. UTIs may impair overall graft and patient survival. We aimed to identify the prevalence and risk factors for post-transplant UTIs and assess UTIs' effect on renal function during a UTI episode and if they result in declining allograft function at 2years post-transplant. Additionally, the causative organism, the class of antibacterial drug employed for each UTI episode and utilisation rates of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis were also quantified.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of 72 renal transplant patients over a 5-year period who were managed at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital. Patient charts, pathology records and dispensing histories were reviewed as part of this study and all UTIs from 2years post transplantation were captured.

Results

Of these patients, 20 (27.8%) had at least one UTI. Older age (p = 0.015), female gender (p < 0.001), hyperglycaemia (p = 0.037) and acute rejection episodes (p = 0.046) were risk factors for developing a UTI on unadjusted analysis. Female gender (OR 4.93) and age (OR 1.03) were statistically significant risk factors for a UTI on adjusted analysis. On average, there was a 14.4% (SEM 5.20) increase in serum creatinine during a UTI episode, which was statistically significant (p = 0.027), and a 9.1% (SEM 6.23) reduction in serum creatinine after the UTI episode trending toward statistical significance. (p = 0.076). Common organisms (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) accounted for 82% of UTI episodes with 70% of UTI cases requiring only a single course of antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, the antibiotic class used was either a penicillin (49%) or cephalosporin (36%) in the majority of UTIs. The use of TMP/SMX prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis did not influence the rate of UTI, with > 90% of the cohort using this treatment.

Conclusions

There was no significant change in serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtrate rate from baseline to 2years post-transplant between those with and without a UTI.

### Dihydropteroate synthase gene mutations in Pneumocystis and sulfa resistance [^115z7KHp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Although decreasing in incidence as a result of combination antiretroviral therapy and effective prophylaxis, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly P. carinii f. sp. hominis), remains the most common AIDS-defining opportunistic infection, as well as the most frequent serious opportunistic infection in HIV-infected persons, in the United States and Europe. Despite the fact that this infection can be prevented, certain patients continue to be at increased risk for PCP. Specifically, PCP frequently signals HIV infection in patients not previously known to be HIV-infected. Patients who are not receiving regular medical care, as well as those who are not receiving or responding to antiretroviral therapy or prophylaxis, are also at increased risk for PCP. PCP may also develop in other immunosuppressed populations, such as cancer patients and transplant recipients. Furthermore, PCP remains a leading cause of death among critically ill patients, despite advances in treatment and management.

The first-line treatment and prophylaxis regimen for PCP is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). While prophylaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence of PCP, the widespread and long-term use of TMP-SMX in HIV patients has raised concerns regarding the development of resistant organisms. Even short-term exposure to TMP-SMX can be associated with the emergence of TMP-SMX resistance, as has been demonstrated in patients with acute cystitis caused by Escherichia coli. Indeed, an increased number of sulfa-resistant bacteria have been isolated in HIV patients, which coincides with the rise in TMP-SMX prophylaxis for PCP. In one study, the prevalence of TMP-SMX–resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae species isolated in all hospitalized patients increased significantly from < 5.5% of isolates before 1986 to 20% in 1995, during which time TMP-SMX prophylaxis was increasing in HIV-infected patients. In addition, the rise in resistant organisms was significantly more prominent in samples obtained from HIV-infected patients, in whom resistant isolates increased from 6.3% in 1988 to 53% in 1995. Another study found that significantly more TMP-SMX–resistant organisms were isolated from HIV-infected patients who had received TMP-SMX than from patients who had not received TMP-SMX.

### Disseminated nocardiosis with infective endocarditis of a transplanted heart [^112dARcg]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Due to lack of randomised trials, the most effective treatment for nocardiosis is not clear. Currently, standard therapy depends on the severity of disease; TMP/SMX is often the initial treatment of choice. When infection is severe (all cases of disseminated disease or CNS involvement as well as infections that involve more than one site in immunocompromised hosts), the combination of intravenous TMP/SMX and amikacin or imipenem is recommended. Life-threatening infections may benefit from treatment with three intravenous antibiotics. Therapy may be adjusted later depending on microbial susceptibilities. While linezolid may be effective against Nocardia, it should generally be avoided when possible given serious side effects such as peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression.

The duration of therapy for nocardiosis depends on the severity of infection, but a typical regimen consists of 6–8 weeks of intravenous therapy followed by prolonged oral therapy. In cases of disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients, or in any patient with CNS involvement, a duration of therapy of at least 1 year is recommended. Efficacy of therapy is influenced by the extent of disseminated disease and underlying health of the host. Overall prognosis is improved with early diagnosis and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy. When the underlying cause of immunocompromise cannot be reversed, a higher dose of TMP/SMX for secondary prophylaxis should be considered in patients who recover from nocardiosis; however, more research is needed to determine whether higher doses of TMP/SMX would provide adequate coverage.

Learning points

Nocardiosis is most often a disease of the immunocompromised; Nocardia has the ability to disseminate, most commonly involving the lungs, subcutaneous tissues and central nervous system.
Heart transplant recipients represent a large proportion of immunocompromised patients who become infected with Nocardia.
Infective endocarditis should be considered in patients with disseminated nocardiosis. Physical examination is essential for the identification of regurgitant murmurs and other suggestive findings.
Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) at doses used for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients may not provide coverage for Nocardia. Higher doses of TMP/SMX should be considered for secondary prophylaxis.
The treatment strategy for nocardiosis depends on severity, but generally requires a long duration of intravenous and oral antibiotics.

### Primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients receiving rituximab [^113zQ9Ao]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although previous studies suggested that rituximab increases the risk of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), it is uncertain whether its primary prophylaxis for PJP is justified.

Research Question

Does the benefit of primary prophylaxis for PJP in patients receiving rituximab treatment outweigh the potential risk of the prophylaxis?

Study Design and Methods

This retrospective study included 3,524 patients (hematologic diseases, 2,500; rheumatic diseases, 559; pre/post-solid organ transplantation, 465) first exposed to rituximab between 2002 and 2018 in a tertiary referral center in South Korea. Patients were classified into a control group (n = 2,523) and a prophylaxis group (n = 1,001) according to the administration of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) during the first 28 days after the start of rituximab (intention-to-treat analysis). In addition, exposure to TMP-SMX was examined as a time-varying variable (time-varying analysis). The primary outcome was the prophylactic effect of TMP-SMX on the 1-year incidence of PJP. Inverse probability of treatment weights was applied to minimize the baseline imbalance. The secondary outcome included the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to TMP-SMX.

Results

Over 2,759.9 person-years, 92 PJP infections occurred, with a mortality rate of 27.2%. The prophylaxis group showed a significantly lower incidence of PJP (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.10–0.42]) than the control group. This result was consistent with the results of time-varying analysis, in which only one PJP infection occurred during TMP-SMX administration (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.01 [0.003–0.16]). The incidence of ADRs related to TMP-SMX was 18.1 (14.6–22.2)/100 person-years, and most were of mild to moderate severity. On the basis of 10 severe ADRs, the number needed to harm was 101 (61.9–261.1), whereas the number needed to prevent one PJP infection was 32 (24.8–39.4).

Interpretation

TMP-SMX prophylaxis significantly reduces PJP incidence with a tolerable safety profile in patients receiving rituximab treatment.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) dose escalation versus direct rechallenge for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with previous adverse reaction to TMP-SMZ [^112rbpWH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is the most effective Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylactic agent, but adverse reactions are common among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and limit its use. This randomized, double-blind controlled trial compared 2 methods of TMP-SMZ reintroduction, 6-day dose escalation and direct rechallenge, for PCP prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients who had experienced previous treatment-limiting reactions. The primary end point was the ability to take single-strength TMP-SMZ daily for 6 months. Seventy-five percent of the dose-escalation group and 57% of the direct-rechallenge group continued to receive daily single-strength TMP-SMZ for 6 months (P = 0.014). Among premature discontinuations, 58% of the dose-escalation group and 70% of the direct-rechallenge group were due to adverse reactions. None of these reactions was serious. This study provides evidence that it is possible to successfully reintroduce TMP-SMZ to a significant proportion of HIV-infected patients who have experienced mild-to-moderate treatment-limiting adverse reactions.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^115XQQ2A]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

PCP prophylaxis regimen — TMP–SMX dosing: TMP–SMX (cotrimoxazole) is the drug of choice for prophylaxis (AI), with a prophylactic dosage of 150 mg/m2 body surface area per day TMP and 750 mg/m2 body surface area per day SMX (approximately 5.0–10 mg/kg body weight per day TMP and 25–50 mg/kg body weight per day SMX; dosing based on TMP component) administered every day (AI) as 5.0–10 mg/kg body weight/dose once daily TMP and 25–50 mg/kg body weight/dose once daily SMX.

### Nocardiosis in immunocompromised patients on alternative Pneumocystis prophylaxis [^117EDyS1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is the drug of choice for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients. Second-line prophylactic agents include atovaquone, dapsone, pentamidine, and clindamycin with pyrimethamine. Alternative agents can be less effective than TMP/SMX at preventing PJP and opportunistic infections caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii, and Nocardia spp. Prophylactic TMP/SMX is sometimes avoided because of a prior adverse drug reaction or when patients are receiving drugs that have potentially overlapping toxicities. Nonetheless, second-line PJP prophylaxis regimens can increase the risk for opportunistic infections, such as nocardiosis. Most nocardiosis occurs in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity; TMP/SMX is the cornerstone of standard therapy. We describe a series of nocardiosis cases in immunocompromised patients who were receiving alternative or no PJP prophylaxis because of TMP/SMX avoidance. We provide the reasons for TMP/SMX avoidance and proportion of patients who subsequently tolerated TMP/SMX.

### An analysis of the utilisation of chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with malignancy receiving corticosteroid therapy at a cancer hospital [^116ojmDy]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Precautions and contraindications

Contraindications to the TMP–SMX prophylaxis must be considered: documented hypersensitivity, megaloblastic anaemia due to folate deficiency, severe renal impairment and porphyria. Caution must also be exercised in patients with impaired renal function, impaired hepatic function, severe drug allergies, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or blood dyscrasias. The potential for myelosuppression or drug interactions may necessitate consideration of an alternative prophylactic agent.

Myelosuppression has been associated with TMP–SMX use in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Conversely, in a study of adult patients with acute leukaemia, no significant difference in myelosuppression was found when TMP–SMX (1 double strength tablet twice daily) was compared with placebo. The original reports of efficacy of TMP–SMX for prophylaxis did not demonstrate significant myelosuppression. However, when used for prophylaxis against bacteraemia following autologous bone marrow transplantation, the time to neutrophil recovery is significantly longer in patients receiving TMP–SMX, compared to patients receiving ciprofloxacin. We recommend that an alternative prophylactic agent be used in at-risk patients with expected myelosuppression > 7 days (Table 3).

In patients receiving chemotherapy with methotrexate, pancytopenia may occur if prophylactic TMP–SMX is used concurrently. The sulphamethoxazole component may increase toxicity of methotrexate by displacement from binding sites or reduced renal excretion. Small studies of children with acute leukaemia have demonstrated both increased free methotrexate and no change in plasma concentration of methotrexate when co-administered with TMP–SMX. In a study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with up to 25 mg methotrexate per week who received TMP–SMX prophylaxis, no patient developed myelosuppression. Conversely, there are a number of case reports of significant adverse events with the combination. We therefore recommend an alternative prophylactic agent in the setting of concurrent methotrexate therapy (Table 3).

Prophylaxis with TMP–SMX may not be tolerated in patients with advanced malignancy and reduced oral intake due to nausea or dysphagia. This may not have been a significant contributor to duration of prophylaxis in our series as only one out of 13 cases of PCP were utilising palliative care services at the time of diagnosis. Further study is required to address the question of appropriateness of commencing prophylaxis in the setting of palliation.

### Toxoplasmosis in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients [^114enKY8]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Infection due to the protozoa Toxoplasma gondii can be life-threatening in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. Most cases of toxoplasmosis in HSCT recipients result from reactivation of latent infection in individuals who were Toxoplasma-seropositive before transplantation and did not receive appropriate prophylaxis. Pretransplantation screening with Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies is suggested for all allogeneic HSCT recipients and their donors and all autologous HSCT recipients. Prevention of toxoplasmosis in T. gondii-seropositive HSCT recipients requires primary prophylaxis, preemptive screening, or both. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the preferred agent for Toxoplasma prophylaxis and should be continued for 6 months or until the patient is no longer receiving immunosuppression, whichever is longer, assuming that immune reconstitution has occurred. Preemptive weekly screening with whole blood Toxoplasma PCR should be considered for seropositive HSCT recipients if prophylaxis cannot be given or if prophylaxis other than TMP-SMX is used. The signs, symptoms, and radiographic findings of toxoplasmosis in HSCT recipients can be nonspecific, and the diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion. Common presentations include fever, encephalopathy with mental status changes or seizures, and pneumonia. A Toxoplasma PCR analysis from whole blood (and other body fluids/tissues according to clinical symptoms) should be obtained in patients in whom there is a concern for toxoplasmosis. Treatment with oral pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin for at least 6 weeks is the first-line therapy and should be followed by secondary prophylaxis. In this article, we review the published literature regarding the epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment, and prevention of toxoplasmosis in HSCT recipients.

### Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in non-HIV immunocompromised patients [^113iBSwr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a disease affecting immunocompromised patients. PCP among these patients is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of PCP prophylaxis among non-HIV immunocompromised patients; and to define the type of immunocompromised patient for whom evidence suggests a benefit for PCP prophylaxis.

Search Methods

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE and EMBASE (to March 2014), LILACS (to March 2014), relevant conference proceedings; and references of identified trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing prophylaxis with an antibiotic effective against PCP versus placebo, no intervention, or antibiotic(s) with no activity against PCP; and trials comparing different antibiotics effective against PCP among immunocompromised non-HIV patients. We only included trials in which Pneumocystis infections were available as an outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in each trial and extracted data from the included trials. We contacted authors of the included trials to obtain missing data. The primary outcome was documented PCP infections. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and pooled using the random-effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials performed between the years 1974 and 2008 were included, involving 1412 patients. Four trials included 520 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the remaining trials included adults with acute leukemia, solid organ transplantation or autologous bone marrow transplantation. Compared to no treatment or treatment with fluoroquinolones (inactive against Pneumocystis), there was an 85% reduction in the occurrence of PCP in patients receiving prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, RR of 0.15 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.62; 10 trials, 1000 patients). The evidence was graded as moderate due to possible risk of bias. PCP-related mortality was also significantly reduced, RR of 0.17 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.94; nine trials, 886 patients) (low quality of evidence due to possible risk of bias and imprecision), but in trials comparing PCP prophylaxis against placebo or no treatment there was no significant effect on all-cause mortality (low quality of evidence due to imprecision). Occurrence of leukopenia or neutropenia and their duration were not reported consistently. No significant differences in overall adverse events or events requiring discontinuation were seen comparing trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to no treatment or placebo (four trials, 470 patients, moderate quality evidence). No differences between once daily versus thrice weekly trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were seen (two trials, 207 patients).

Authors' Conclusions

Given an event rate of 6.2% in the control groups of the included trials, prophylaxis for PCP using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is highly effective among non-HIV immunocompromised patients, with a number needed to treat to prevent PCP of 19 patients (95% CI 17 to 42). Prophylaxis should be considered for patients with a similar baseline risk of PCP.

### Taking the challenge: a protocolized approach to optimize Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis in renal transplant recipients [^117FBFKv]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

While trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is considered first-line therapy for Pneumocystis pneumonia prevention in renal transplant recipients, reported adverse drug reactions may limit use and increase reliance on costly and less effective alternatives, often aerosolized pentamidine. We report our experience implementing a protocolized approach to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole adverse drug reaction assessment and rechallenge to optimize prophylaxis in this patient cohort. We retrospectively reviewed 119 patients receiving Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis prior to and after protocol implementation. Forty-two patients (35%) had 48 trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole adverse drug reactions documented either at baseline or during the prophylaxis period, of which 83% were non-immune-mediated and 17% were immune-mediated. Significantly more patients underwent trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole rechallenge after protocol implementation (4/22 vs 23/27; p = 0.0001), with no recurrence of adverse drug reactions in 74%. In those who experienced a new or recurrent reaction (26%), all were mild and self-limiting with only 1 recurrence of an immune-mediated reaction. After protocol implementation, aerosolized pentamidine-associated costs were reduced. The introduction of a standard approach to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole rechallenge in the context of both prior immune and non-immune-mediated reactions was safe and successful in improving the uptake of first-line Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis in renal transplant recipients.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^117K1edK]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although previous studies show that primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is effective in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive treatment, there is limited evidence regarding the optimal timing for prophylaxis withdrawal. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for PJP despite prophylaxis and provide evidence for an optimal prophylaxis schedule.

Methods

This case-control study included 1,294 prophylactic episodes in 1,148 patients with rheumatic disease who received immunosuppressants and prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). The primary outcome was a one-year incidence of PJP. A Cox proportional hazards model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to evaluate clinical factors associated with outcomes.

Results

During 1,174 person-years of observation, 10 cases of PJP were identified, with an incidence rate of 0.85 per 100 person-years. The mean ± SD duration of TMP-SMX prophylaxis was 181.9 ± 128.7 days. Except in one case, PJP occurred after discontinuation of TMP-SMX, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) interval of 117.0 (86.0–161.0) days. The dose of glucocorticoids at the time of TMP-SMX discontinuation was significantly higher in the PJP group relative to the control group (median [IQR]: 22 [20–40] vs 10 [5–15] mg). Discontinuing TMP-SMX while on a glucocorticoid dose > 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent significantly increased the risk of PJP (adjusted hazard ratio: 13.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.71–111.80). There were 63 cases of adverse events during the observation period, and 10 (15.9%) were attributed to TMP-SMX with probable causality.

Conclusion

Tapering glucocorticoids with 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent could be a reasonable timepoint to initiate the withdrawal of PJP prophylaxis in patients with rheumatic diseases.

### Time-dependent effect of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on the incidence of serious infections in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a target trial emulation study [^112aGK1y]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study had some limitations. First, the baseline characteristics of the patients in the prophylaxis and control groups were significantly different because of the retrospective nature of our study. Although we attempted to minimize selection bias by applying IPW, unmeasured confounders such as compliance to prophylactic TMP‐SMX could have affected our results. Second, although we thoroughly reviewed the EHR data to capture all relevant information on hospitalization at other institutions, some external hospitalizations may not have been recorded in our database. However, we would not expect differential reporting according to whether patients received concomitant TMP‐SMX or not, thus biasing toward the null. Third, the duration of TMP‐SMX use in the prophylaxis group was heterogeneous, and approximately 50% of the patients discontinued it within 180 days, which could have led to a biased estimate of the effect of TMP‐SMX. We showed consistent results in the time‐varying analysis performed to determine exposure to TMP‐SMX. However, its effect on serious infection other than PJP and viral infection was less significant in time‐varying analysis. Because time‐varying analysis accounts for changes in TMP‐SMX use over time, it inherently divides each patient's observation period into smaller time segments, which substantially increases the variance of treatment effect. Therefore, we believe that our finding should be further validated in future larger scale studies with a more homogeneous pattern of prophylactic TMP‐SMX prescription. Finally, because patients with an index date before 2018 could not have contracted COVID‐19, the impact of prophylactic TMP‐SMX on the incidence of COVID‐19 and related infectious complications could not be fully estimated in this study.

In conclusion, we showed that prophylactic TMP‐SMX significantly reduced the overall incidence of serious infections beyond just PJP in patients with AAV undergoing induction therapy with CYC or RTX. The prophylactic effect is most pronounced in the initial period following induction therapy when the risk of serious infection peaks. Although the additional benefits of TMP‐SMX should be confirmed in future randomized studies, it may impact clinical practice for better treatment outcomes in patients with AAV.

### Is toxoplasmosis prophylaxis necessary in cardiac transplantation? Long-term follow-up at two transplant centers [^117AGeKE]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiac transplant recipients are often given prophylactic treatments to prevent opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis carinii. Toxoplasmosis prophylaxis is commonly prescribed for transplant recipients who have not been exposed to this disease but receive a heart from an exposed donor. We reviewed the collective 28-year experience at two urban transplant programs with 596 patients, and found no cases of toxoplasmosis, but all patients received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia. We conclude that specific anti-toxoplasmosis prophylaxis is unnecessary in heart transplant recipients.

### Nocardiosis in immunocompromised patients on alternative Pneumocystis prophylaxis [^116yC5Fk]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure
Reasons for TMP/SMX avoidance and TMP/SMX rechallenge outcomes among immunocompromised patients in whom TMP/SMX prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis was avoided, Stanford, California, USA. *Failed TMP/SMX introduction because of rash or GI symptoms that were not severe. †Developed intractable nausea and vomiting after TMP/SMX was introduced and did not tolerate rechallenge. GI, gastrointestinal; TMP/SMX, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

In this retrospective case series, 16/25 (64%) patients who had nocardiosis while deliberately avoiding TMP/SMX prophylaxis ultimately were treated with TMP/SMX. Immunocompromised patients often are prescribed alternative drugs to TMP/SMX prophylaxis because of concerns over side effects or allergic reactions. However, desensitization or rechallenge could enable a substantial proportion of patients to safely take TMP/SMX for prophylaxis. In our study, 70% of patients with a history of TMP/SMX allergy tolerated a TMP/SMX graded challenge or desensitization when attempted, and 90% of patients avoiding TMP/SMX prophylaxis for nonallergy reasons tolerated TMP/SMX when rechallenged. Our results concur with findings from a study that showed 74% of kidney transplant recipients who underwent TMP/SMX rechallenge had no recurrence of adverse drug reactions.

TMP/SMX prophylaxis might decrease the incidence of nocardiosis in immunocompromised patients. In a retrospective review of HCT recipients with nocardiosis, most (12/15) cases occurred in patients receiving alternate PJP prophylaxis. Other studies have questioned the efficacy of TMP/SMX prophylaxis in preventing nocardiosis in HCT or solid organ transplant recipients.

Taken together, these findings suggest that rates of this highly pathological infection might be reduced by systematically reevaluating TMP/SMX avoidance and reconsidering prophylactic TMP/SMX. Consulting with an allergist can detect contraindications, such as severe cutaneous adverse reactions, and opportunities for challenge or desensitization. Patients with a history of maculopapular rash, cytopenia, or increased creatinine with TMP/SMX might tolerate reintroduction. Electronic medical records can be designed to prompt revisiting whether TMP/SMX avoidance is appropriate.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) primary prophylaxis — first-choice dosing with TMP-SMX (cotrimoxazole) is TMP 2.5–5 mg/kg body weight/dose with SMX 12.5–25 mg/kg body weight/dose twice per day. Dosing based on TMP component. The total daily dose should not exceed 320 mg TMP and 1600 mg SMX. Several dosing schemes have been used successfully: given 3 days per week on consecutive days or on alternate days, given 2 days per week on consecutive days or on alternate days, or given every day (total daily dose of TMP 5–10 mg/kg body weight given as a single dose each day).

### Pneumocystis pneumonia occurrence and prophylaxis duration in kidney transplant recipients according to perioperative treatment with rituximab [^115C1Exg]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), which is caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (P. jiroveci), is a life-threatening fungal infection that can occur in renal transplant recipients. Following the implementation of PCP prophylaxis using trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP–SMX), the incidence of PCP in kidney transplantation (KT) recipients decreased from approximately 10 to 1%. Most cases of PCP occur several months after prophylaxis discontinuation; yet, current recommendations for duration of prophylaxis vary widely from 3 to 12 months. Studies have shown that factors such as age, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, lymphopenia, immunosuppressive regimen, and acute graft rejection may serve as indications for extended prophylaxis; however, the exact duration of prophylaxis needed in each patient is not established, especially in KT recipients who had been treated with rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20, for pre-transplant desensitization or rejection treatment after transplant.

Rituximab, which has a long-lasting effect in depleting B-cells for 6–12 months, is a good option for pre-transplant and adjuvant treatment. However, recent studies have reported that rituximab increases the risk of opportunistic infections including PCP with fulminant clinical course and mortality. Since 2009, approximately 20% of KT performed at our center undergo pre-transplant desensitization with rituximab in order to overcome the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or blood group A/B barriers. After encountering rituximab-treated KT recipients who later developed PCP at few months after prophylaxis discontinuation, we sought to obtain empirical evidence for the benefit of prolonged prophylaxis duration. We assessed the optimal duration of prophylaxis for PCP following KT in recipients who were treated with rituximab for pre-transplant desensitization or rejection treatment within 6 months after transplant.

### Adverse effects of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the prophylaxis of Pneumocystis pneumonia in dermatology [^115Hk9rw]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) combination is used for the prophylaxis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Although TMP/SMX is frequently used in dermatology for cases treated with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants, it is often difficult to continue the administration of TMP/SMX due to adverse events. There are only a few reported studies on the prophylaxis of PCP in dermatology. This is the first review focused on adverse events of TMP/SMX among patients with dermatological diseases compared with previous reports. In this study, we retrospectively investigated 132 cases treated with TMP/SMX and examined the adverse events. Adverse events occurred in 32 cases (24.2%) and the incidence in this study was higher than in previous reports. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 17 cases (12.5%), which was the most frequent adverse event. The possible causes of adverse events were that the standard dose of TMP/SMX may be excessive for most Japanese, in addition to the long administration period, and the concomitant use of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants in almost all cases. We must consider the risks of PCP and adverse events of TMP/SMX in each case. It is desirable to examine possible administration methods that can be continued by adjusting the dose and interval of TMP/SMX.

### An analysis of the utilisation of chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with malignancy receiving corticosteroid therapy at a cancer hospital [^1145Fzna]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study focused on PCP prophylaxis in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy for solid tumours or haematologic malignancy. Although the mechanisms of immune compromise in this population are multifactorial, corticosteroid therapy is a significant and readily identifiable risk factor, providing opportunity for modification of prescribing practices relevant to prophylaxis.

We have identified differences in proportion of patients with solid tumours receiving chemoprophylaxis compared to patients with haematologic malignancy. This may be attributed to the use of prescriber guidelines within some groups of haematology patients at PMCC. However, even in this group, a large proportion (36.4%) were not prescribed chemoprophylaxis, and the observed number of cases of PCP (seven out of 13) in haematology patients would suggest significant under-prescribing. Our estimation of incidence of PCP is based upon a number of assumptions, including consistency of hospital bed-days, indications for corticosteroid therapy, and proportion of solid and haematological malignancy treated at PMCC during the study period. Community-based prescription of corticosteroid therapy was not captured, leading to possible overestimation of incidence.

In our series, predisposing corticosteroid therapy was not administered in 11 patients with PCP. Only two cases had solid tumours, suggesting that the vast majority of at-risk patients with solid tumours can be identified on the basis of corticosteroid therapy. Nine cases had haematological malignancy. Given the heterogeneity of potential risk factors in this subgroup, distinct recommendations for prophylaxis must be based upon the underlying disease or predisposing chemotherapy. For example, chemoprophylaxis should be administered for 6 months following engraftment in allogeneic transplant recipients. This may be extended where immunosuppressive therapy or chronic GVHD persists beyond 6 months. Chemoprophylaxis should be considered in autologous stem cell transplant recipients with underlying lymphoma or leukaemia, intense conditioning regimens, or recently administered fludarabine or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. Patients receiving alemtuzumab therapy should receive PCP chemoprophylaxis for at least 2 months after therapy.

Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis is effective in patients not infected with HIV.showed that TMP–SMX (administered on weekends only) eliminated all cases of PCP in a population of heart transplant recipients, compared to 4% incidence prior to prophylaxis. TMP–SMX has been shown to be an effective prophylaxis in patients with cancer. Daily and thrice weekly dosing regimens have demonstrated equivalence in patients with leukaemia, and twice weekly dosing has been shown to be effective in allogeneic transplant recipients.

Discussion

Our study highlights the incidence of UTIs in a renal transplant population with 27.8% of this cohort experiencing a UTI. Similar rates have been demonstrated in other studies and support the notion that UTI remains the most common infection after renal transplantation. This study is informative about UTIs in a carefully followed low immunosuppression transplant population and our observations are valid only for a similar population.

The study identified risk factors for developing a UTI, many of which have been demonstrated in other studies. Female gender and age were the only risk factors that reached statistical significance on the adjusted analysis and surprisingly, a pre-existing history of UTI or urogenital abnormality were not found to be a risk factors on the unadjusted analysis. Many studies have revealed an association between stent usage and higher rates of UTI. Interestingly, a 2016 study demonstrated that early ureteric stent removal at 1 week was associated with a statistically significant lower rate of UTIs compared with routine stent removal at 4 weeks.

We had very low rates of UTI or bacteremia caused by ESBL -producing organisms and none of our patients died as a result of UTI. Nevertheless, there is a known association between mortality and bacteremia secondary to MDR gram negative infections in transplant recipients and MDR infections are expected to become more problematic in the future.

Furthermore, trimethoprim usage for Pneumocystis prophylaxis did not confer protection against UTIs in our patients, despite 93% of patients using this treatment at doses considered prophylactic for UTIs. This raises interesting questions regarding the therapeutic effectiveness of trimethoprim for UTI prophylaxis in the kidney transplant population. Trimethoprim is also known to cause a reversible increase in serum creatinine by inhibiting the tubular secretion of creatinine. As expected there was no significant difference in baseline serum creatinine levels between the two subgroups as the vast majority of patients were on TMP-SMX prophylaxis.

### Invasive pneumococcal infections in adult lung transplant recipients [^1154tZwp]. American Journal of Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

An increased risk of invasive pneumococcal infection (IPI) has been described among kidney or heart transplant recipients, but the epidemiology of IPI among lung transplant recipients has not been previously reported. We undertook a single center, retrospective cohort study to define the incidence, timing, clinical, and microbiologic features of IPI in lung transplant patients. Fourteen out of 220 recipients (6.4%) developed IPI at a median of 1.3 years after transplantation (incidence rate: 22.7 cases per 1000 person-years). All patients were receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis at the time of diagnosis, and 10 (71%) had TMP-SMX-resistant isolates. All isolates were from the 23 valent polysaccharide vaccine-associated serogroups. The high incidence of IPI in lung transplant recipients is similar to that reported in kidney and heart recipients. Alternative prevention strategies, including use of the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, should be explored in future studies.

### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in the non-HIV-infected population [^1129BKNc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Summarize data on the pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention options for non-AIDS immunocompromised patients who have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP); review the epidemiology of patients presenting with PJP; and discuss the first and second-line pharmacological options for treatment and prophylaxis of PJP in this population.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1989-February 2016) searched. Terms searched included combinations of Pneumocystis jirovecii, Pneumocystis carinii, non-HIV, infected, patients, prevention, prophylaxis, Bactrim, treatment, AIDS, opportunistic, immunocompromised, cancer, and pathophysiology

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles included had the most relevant information on PJP pathophysiology, and first-/second-line treatment and prophylactic options. Inclusion criteria were met and evaluated with 43 sources.

Data Synthesis

P jirovecii has a complicated life-cycle; it seeks to find compromised immune systems in order to replicate, causing life-threatening complications. With immunosuppressive medications coming to market for immunomodulating diseases, PJP has become a prevalent opportunistic infection in the non-HIV population. CD4+ lymphocyte count < 200 cells/µL is the primary risk factor for PJP presentation in these patients. With data from clinical trials, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) has become the primary treatment and prophylaxis of PJP in the non-HIV population, although second-line options are available.

Conclusion

PJP is a health problem that may result in an increased concern as more immunomodulating medications to treat various disease states are developed. Patients on these drugs or those with immunosuppressive diseases should have their CD4+ count monitored. Health care providers should continue to use TMP/SMX as the primary option in non-HIV, immunocompromised patients for treatment and prophylaxis of PJP.

### Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in kidney and simultaneous pancreas kidney transplant recipients in the present era of routine post-transplant prophylaxis: risk factors and outcomes [^113RZCEZ]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), previously known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, is an opportunistic fungal infection observed in immunocompromised individuals. Prior to institution of routine prophylaxis in kidney transplant recipients, the incidence was reported at 5 to 15% and was the highest in the first 6 months after transplantation. Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is highly effective and is now routinely administered for the initial 6 to 12 months post-transplantation at most transplant centers in the United States. This has drastically reduced the incidence of PJP during the initial highest risk period immediately following transplantation. However, the epidemiology of PJP in the modern era of universal prophylaxis and risk factors for late onset infection in the renal transplant population have not been fully elucidated. There is no consensus on which high-risk individuals may benefit from prolongation or re-initiation of prophylaxis.

At our center, administration of PJP prophylaxis is protocolized for the initial 6 to 12 months immediately following transplant. The primary objectives of this study were: 1) to identify risk factors for PJP that, in turn, could provide guidance regarding when prolongation or re-initiation of prophylaxis may be warranted, and 2) to describe outcomes in kidney transplant and simultaneous pancreas kidney recipients whose post-transplant course has been complicated by PJP.

### Time-dependent effect of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on the incidence of serious infections in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a target trial emulation study [^1163QT2c]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for serious infection

In the unweighted univariable Cox regression, old age (age ≥ 60), hypertension, lymphopenia, azotemia, MPA, new onset AAV, high BVAS (BVAS ≥ 16), lung involvement, GCs pulse, and high‐dose GCs were associated with increased frequency of serious infections (Supplementary Table 5). There was no significant difference in the risk of serious infections between the patients receiving RTX and those receiving CYC (P = 0.837). In the multivariable analysis, old age, lymphopenia, azotemia, and lung involvement significantly increased the risk of serious infection.

The effect of TMP‐SMX was evaluated in various subgroups to identify the clinical factors affecting its prophylactic efficacy (Figure 3). The effect of prophylactic TMP‐SMX was more prominent in patients with baseline lymphopenia (P value for interaction < 0.001), azotemia (P = 0.005), MPA (P = 0.013), or relapsed AAV (P = 0.067). Other clinical factors, such as old age, hypertension, high BVAS score, lung involvement, GCs pulse, and high‐dose GCs, did not significantly affect the effect of prophylactic TMP‐SMX.

Safety of‐

During the 127.4 person‐years of TMP‐SMX prophylaxis, 35 cases of AE occurred (Supplementary Table 6), 8 of which were ADRs related to prophylactic TMP‐SMX (incidence rate 6.28 [95% CI 2.87–11.68] per 100 person‐years) (Supplementary Table 7). However, among these AE cases, 27 (77.1%) patients discontinued TMP‐SMX. There was only one case of severe ADR, which was a liver function test abnormality. This was resolved shortly after the discontinuation of TMP‐SMX. Based on the safety assessment, the NNH for severe ADR was 127.4, whereas the NNT for preventing one case of serious infection was 8.0.

Definition of Treatment Groups

The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the initial treatment dose of TMP-SMX: (1) reduced-dose group receiving 7.5–15 mg/kg/day of TMP component; and (2) standard-dose group receiving > 15–20 mg/kg/day of TMP component. The initial treatment dose was defined as the mean daily dose/kg of TMP, corrected for renal function, on the first and second day of PJP treatment (the dose referred to from hereafter). The first treatment day corresponds to the first calendar day of full treatment, generally meaning the day after the start of treatment. This approach was chosen to better reflect the true TMP-SMX exposition as the initial TMP-SMX dose often was adjusted (either increased or decreased) during the first days of treatment. The corrected dose was calculated as the actual given dose multiplied by a correction factor according to creatinine clearance (CrCl): ≥ 50 mL/minute, factor 1; 30 to < 50 mL/minute: factor 1.5; 15 to < 30 mL/minute: factor 2.0; < 15 mL/minute or hemodialysis: factor 3.0.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

PCP prophylaxis in HIV-infected children — TMP-SMX (cotrimoxazole) is the drug of choice (AI); the prophylactic dosage is 150 mg/m2 body surface area per day TMP and 750 mg/m2 body surface area per day SMX (approximately 5.0–10 mg/kg body weight per day TMP and 25–50 mg/kg body weight per day SMX; dosing based on TMP component), administered orally either every day with 5.0–10 mg/kg body weight/dose TMP and 25–50 mg/kg body weight/dose SMX, on 3 consecutive days per week with 2.5–5.0 mg/kg body weight/dose TMP and 12.5–25 mg/kg body weight/dose SMX twice per day, or every other day; the total daily dose should not exceed 320 mg TMP and 1600 mg SMX, and in patients with impaired renal function a reduced dose may be necessary; TMP-SMX, preferably given daily, also is effective in preventing toxoplasmosis and some bacterial infections, and TMP alone has little, if any, anti-Pneumocystis activity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Patients

This study included 1,148 patients who received immunosuppressants and concomitant prophylactic TMP‐SMX for the treatment of underlying AIID at a nationwide tertiary referral center in South Korea between January 2010 and December 2022. The patients received TMP‐SMX at either a dose of one single‐strength tablet daily or a double‐strength tablet three times per week. In cases with decreased renal function, TMP‐SMX dosing was adjusted according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Patients were excluded if they had HIV infection, underwent solid organ transplantation, were younger than 18 years of age, or had a follow‐up duration of less than 28 days. In this study, none of the patients received prophylactic agents other than TMP‐SMX, such as dapsone or pentamidine (Supplementary Figure 1).

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Seoul National University Hospital Institutional Review Board (no. 2009‐065‐1156). The ethics committee waived the requirement for written informed consent due to the retrospective nature of the study.

Study design and prophylaxis episodes

To identify potential risk factors associated with PJP occurrence despite primary prophylaxis, a case‐control study design was selected given the low expected incidence of PJP in the study population. As some patients may have undergone multiple courses of prophylactic TMP‐SMX along with immunosuppressive therapy, we examined each episode of prophylaxis (referred to as a prophylaxis episode) within the study population. Episodes in which prophylactic TMP‐SMX was administered for less than 14 days were excluded from the analysis of PJP incidence. However, AEs that occurred during these episodes were collected for safety assessment.

The observation scheme for the prophylactic episodes is presented in Supplementary Figure 2. The baseline date was defined as the date of prophylactic TMP‐SMX initiation. The index period was designated as four weeks before and after the baseline. The demographics and immunosuppressive agents prescribed during this period were defined as the baseline features of the study population. The observation began from the baseline date and continued until the date of loss to follow‐up, occurrence of PJP, or 52 weeks after the baseline date, whichever occurred first. Each prophylaxis was considered a distinct episode if the patient discontinued TMP‐SMX and restarted it at least 52 weeks after the baseline date. If a patient had more than one episode, time‐varying features such as eGFR, lymphocyte count, and immunosuppressive treatment use at the baseline of each episode were collected.

MANAGEMENT OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS IN ELDERLY KIDNEY TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS

Older recipients of kidney allografts encounter an increased risk of infections within the first year post-KT, often leading to readmission or other adverse outcomes. The primary infections prevalent in older kidney transplant recipients encompass UTIs, bloodstream infections, reactivation or primary infection of cytomegalovirus, and the BK virus. Despite this heightened susceptibility to infections, it is noteworthy that older KT recipients demonstrate a lower risk of both all-cause mortality and mortality attributed to infections in comparison to patients on dialysis. The utilization of antibiotics for preventing and treating UTIs in kidney transplant recipients varies across different studies. A recent retrospective study conducted in Germany involved 207 KTX patients with a diverse age range (16–82 years), with the UTI group comprising significantly older individuals (median age of 60 years) among KTX patients. The study revealed that ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam were the most frequently prescribed antibiotics for UTIs in this patient population. However, the incidence of bacterial resistance was higher in the study cohort when compared to the control group. This underscores the potential risks associated with the excessive use of antibiotics in kidney transplant recipients experiencing UTIs. To address this concern, the study recommends the implementation of antibiotic stewardship teams in the prevention and treatment of UTIs in these patients, ensuring a judicious and rational use of antibiotics.

The current guidelines for managing UTIs from 2019 in elderly kidney transplant recipients lack explicit details, considering this patient population's unique characteristics. Prophylactic use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for 6 months is recommended for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis, which also demonstrates efficacy as prophylaxis against UTIs and bacteremia in kidney transplant recipients, as described in the study from Germany in 2022. For secondary UTI prophylaxis in recipients with recurrent UTIs, nonantimicrobial preventive measures are preferred, with antimicrobial prophylaxis potentially considered for specific cases, such as severe episodes of recurrent UTIs like pyelonephritis. These recommendations are applicable to the entire KTX population, including the elderly subset, which is particularly susceptible to UTIs due to advanced age. The integration of these guidelines ensures a comprehensive and tailored approach to UTI management in kidney transplant recipients. Research into novel antimicrobial agents and immunomodulatory therapies, as well as the significance of innovative nonantibiotic-based approaches, may offer more targeted and effective options, mitigating the risk of infections while minimizing adverse effects.

PCP prophylaxis — resistance considerations with sulfonamide regimens include that dihydropteroate synthase gene mutations in Pneumocystis from humans have been observed with TMP-SMX and dapsone prophylaxis, suggesting possible drug resistance but with no conclusive clinical correlates, and that prolonged TMP-SMX prophylaxis is associated with emergence of TMP-SMX resistant bacterial species due to selective pressure, which should be considered when managing bacterial infections in patients receiving prophylaxis.

### Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (sulfamethox-TMP DS) [^117RMLiu]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate). This interaction should be kept in mind when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin (a CYP2C9 substrate). Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect.

Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites and can compete with the renal transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations.

There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with co-administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients.

Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored.

Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin.

Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is prescribed.

### Early onset Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation [^111VVWH3]. American Journal of Hematology (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii) is one of the major opportunistic pathogens responsible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)-related pneumonias. Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis has been shown to prevent almost all P. carinii infections, 1%-2% of patients may still experience this complication. P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) is usually a late complication in patients receiving TMP/SMX prophylaxis, with most cases occurring later than 2 months post-transplant. We report a patient who developed early onset PCP after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from an HLA-identical sibling donor. On day 12, the patient complained of dyspnea and cough. A chest X ray showed infiltrates in right upper lobe with bilateral pleural effusion. By the findings of Grocott stain on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained on day 14, he was diagnosed as having PCP. Intravenous TMP/SMX failed to improve the lesion. This is the earliest onset PCP in the literature after HSCT despite the prophylactic administration of TMP/SMX before transplant.

### Risk factors associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in non-HIV immunocompromised patients and co-pathogens analysis by metagenomic next-generation sequencing [^117P2KsB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a potentially life-threatening opportunistic infection that predominantly affects immunocompromised hosts including those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other non-HIV immunocompromised hosts including solid organ transplantation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, hematologic malignancies, connective tissue diseases, solid tumors and other autoimmune inflammatory disease that need systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant therapy. In recent years, with the advent of antiretrovirals and prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the incidence of PJP in the HIV patients has decreased significantly. However, as the widespread use of immunosuppressive drugs and antitumor therapy, the broader application of solid organ and bone marrow transplantation, the prevalence of PJP in non-HIV immunocompromised patients has gradually increased. Studies have shown that PJP in non-HIV patients have a more progressive course and higher mortality rate (ranging from 30% to 60%) than HIV patients. Given the serious consequence of PJP in non-HIV immunocompromised patients, it is important to find the risk factors which could be used to predict the occurrence of PJP. Guidelines for preventing PJP in HIV patients are based on CD4 + T cells less than 200 cells/µl. There are no consensus guidelines for prophylaxis of PJP in non-HIV immunocompromised patients. Previous study has reported that lymphopenia, corticosteroids and a low count of CD4 + T cells are risk factors for the development of PJP in adults with autoimmune inflammatory disorders. However, whether such cut-off value of CD4 + T cells < 200 cells/µl can be used as a PJP prophylaxis in non-HIV immunocompromised patients is inconsistent between different academics.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis — trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) dosing and adverse reaction management is summarized as follows: One double-strength TMP-SMX tablet three times weekly also is effective (BI), and a dose of one double-strength tablet daily confers cross protection against toxoplasmosis and many respiratory bacterial infections. TMP-SMX chemoprophylaxis should be continued, when clinically feasible, in patients who have no life threatening adverse reactions; if discontinued for a mild adverse reaction, re-institution should be considered after the reaction has resolved (AII). Therapy should be permanently discontinued (with no rechallenge) in patients with life-threatening adverse reactions including possible or definite Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (AIII). Patients with prior adverse events may better tolerate re-introduction if the dose is gradually increased according to published regimens (BI) or if the drug is given at a reduced dose or frequency (CIII), and as many as 70% of patients can tolerate such re-institution. Lower doses of TMP-SMX may also confer such protection, potentially with less toxicity, though randomized controlled data addressing this possibility are unavailable.

### An analysis of the utilisation of chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with malignancy receiving corticosteroid therapy at a cancer hospital [^116opJbE]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a potentially life-threatening opportunistic infection seen predominantly in immunosuppressed individuals, and with increasing frequency in human immunodeficiency (HIV)-negative patients. The case fatality rate among HIV-negative patients with PCP has remained approximately 50% over the last three decades, despite identification of risk factors, including malignancy, haematologic disorders, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, organ transplantation and CD4 + lymphopenia. In patients with solid tumours or haematologic malignancy, corticosteroid therapy is the most common predisposing risk factor for developing PCP.

Identifying patients who are at risk of PCP is important, as highly effective prophylactic strategies are available. Risk assessment based on intensity of corticosteroid therapy is possible as dose, duration and tapering of corticosteroid therapy appear to impact upon the risk for development of PCP. In a study of 116 HIV-negative patients with PCP, the median daily dose of corticosteroid was equivalent to 30 mg prednisolone, and the median duration of therapy before the onset of infection was 12 weeks. Sepkowitz et al have recommended that any patient with an underlying immunologic disorder (including malignancy) who receives the equivalent of at least 20 mg of prednisolone daily for more than 1 month be given prophylaxis.

The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (PMCC) is a tertiary care cancer centre which sees the full spectrum of malignant disorders. Since 1999, guidelines for trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole (TMP–SMX) prophylaxis have been utilised in patients receiving selected high-intensity chemotherapy protocols: hyper-CVAD, VAD, CEVAD and FLAG. Adherence to the guidelines and frequency of chemoprophylaxis in other patients with haematological malignancy or solid tumours is unknown.

The aims of this study were to (1) identify the potentially preventable cases of PCP, and (2) estimate the proportional use of suitable chemoprophylaxis in patients at risk for PCP on the basis of corticosteroid therapy. Finally, we propose a strategy for PCP prophylaxis in patients with haematological malignancy or solid tumours, who receive high-dose corticosteroid therapy.

Infection control in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) — Patients with ALL undergoing intensive chemotherapy or allogeneic HCT are highly susceptible to infections. During induction, all patients with fever should be evaluated by a medical provider and treated promptly with broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including Pseudomonas), regardless of neutrophil count; following completion of induction, antibiotics may not be indicated for fever based on clinical status. Patients with ALL should take appropriate antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis throughout therapy and be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of infection. All patients with ALL are at high risk for Pneumocystis jirovecii and should take prophylaxis throughout anti-leukemic therapy; Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is the preferred therapy for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. TMP/SMX may be held for a short period of time if blood counts are low, but holding TMP/SMX for prolonged periods or permanently discontinuing TMP/SMX should be avoided; TMP/SMX may be held when HD-MTX is administered and re-started when MTX clearance is achieved per protocol or institutional guidelines. If TMP/SMX is not tolerated, atovaquone, dapsone, or pentamidine (aerosolized or IV) can be considered. Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis should be considered in patients receiving anthracyclines during induction therapy for newly diagnosed ALL or therapy for relapsed ALL who are anticipated to have neutropenia.

### Advocating for the recognition of underlying immunosuppression in critical illness [^116Vq7W3]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Consideration of drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy

Highly effective drugs that are sometimes crucial in the critically ill have relevant interactions with maintenance immunosuppression, affecting their trough levels in both directions. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 (CYP)3 A4 often lead to significant changes in calcineurin inhibitors (CNI).CNI trough levels increase with many anti-fungal azoles, some macrolide antibiotics, doxycycline, and propafenone; they decrease if co-treated with carbamazepine, phenytoin, metamizole, rifampicin, nafcillin, and bosentan. In the reverse setting, it is crucial to know that discontinuation of some maintenance drugs, e.g. azole often leads to a relevant drop in CNI levels that regularly needs a significant dose adjustment. In any case, using online drug-drug interaction tools in these patients is strongly encouraged.

Antibiotic-antifungal prophylaxis in immunosuppression

For patients with cancer-related immunosuppression, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) currently recommend prevention for patients with protracted neutropenia or at high risk of febrile neutropenia. These patients should receive empirical treatment with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (e.g. ciprofloxacin) and an antifungal agent (e.g. voriconazole). Patients who are receiving chemotherapy regimens associated with a risk for Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia (PjP should also receive prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Prophylaxis following solid organ transplantation varies by centre and transplanted organ, with many advocating risk-adapted antifungal prophylaxis, depending on the individual patient. Per the American Society of Transplantation recommendations, most patients are commenced on prophylaxis against PJP with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the six months following transplantation.

### Trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and serious infections in granulomatosis with polyangiitis treated with rituximab [^113GKamH]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis affecting small to medium-sized blood vessels. Effective immunosuppression has greatly improved survival, but infection remains an important cause of mortality in the first year of AAV diagnosis. Rituximab is a mainstay drug for induction and maintenance of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), but the burden of infections during treatment remains substantial.

Low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis during AAV induction, although PJP remains uncommon in AAV. Tertiary care studies found TMP-SMX to be associated with reduced serious infections in AAV. However, TMP-SMX is associated with numerous adverse drug events, though some may be less common or severe at prophylactic doses.

Our objective was to evaluate the association of TMP-SMX prophylaxis with serious infections in a population-based GPA cohort treated with rituximab. Secondary objectives were to assess the association of prophylaxis with outpatient infection visits, PJP and potential adverse drug events.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis regimens for people living with HIV: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112HLYnc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a common opportunistic infection among people living with HIV (PWH), particularly among new and untreated cases. Several regimens are available for the prophylaxis of PCP, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), dapsone-based regimens (DBRs), aerosolized pentamidine (AP), and atovaquone.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of PCP prophylaxis regimens in PWH by network meta-analysis.

Methods

DATA SOURCES: Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL from inception to June 21, 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Comparative randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Participants

PWH.

Interventions

Regimens for PCP prophylaxis either compared head-to-head or versus no treatment/placebo.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs 2.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Title or abstract and full-text screening and data extraction were performed in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Data on PCP incidence, all-cause mortality, and discontinuation due to toxicity were pooled and ranked by network meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses of primary versus secondary prophylaxis, by year, and by dosage were performed.

Results

A total of 26 RCTs, comprising 55 treatment arms involving 7516 PWH were included. For the prevention of PCP, TMP-SMX was ranked the most favourable agent and was superior to DBRs (risk ratio [RR] = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36–0.83) and AP (RR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36–0.77). TMP-SMX was also the only agent with a mortality benefit compared with no treatment/placebo (RR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.98). However, TMP-SMX was also ranked as the most toxic agent with a greater risk of discontinuation than DBRs (RR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.54) and AP (7.20; 95% CI, 5.37–9.66). No significant differences in PCP prevention or mortality were detected among the other regimens. The findings remained consistent within subgroups.

Conclusions

TMP-SMX is the most effective agent for PCP prophylaxis in PWH and the only agent to confer a mortality benefit; consequently, it should continue to be recommended as the first-line agent. Further studies are necessary to determine the optimal dosing of TMP-SMX to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.

### The brief case: caught red-handed [^11174Mxu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

L. micdadei exhibits susceptibility to quinolones and newer macrolides, which require low dosing frequency and have excellent bioavailability and hence make them the antimicrobials of choice. While both trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and cefepime can be used in the treatment of Legionella infections, these are typically not first-line therapy choices. TMP-SMX is a commonly used antibiotic combination for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and other opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV, or receiving immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. after solid organ transplant or for hematological malignancies), or on high-dose steroids. Interestingly, our patient, before admission, was taking TMP-SMX thrice a week as part of a prophylactic regimen and continued without modification until the day of discharge.

L. micdadei is a known nosocomial agent, but in the present case, the patient did not have any prior hospital admissions or medical procedures that would raise suspicion for nosocomial infection. She developed a respiratory illness prior to her current hospital admission. Since the temporal association argued against a possible nosocomial infection, an infection control protocol for source identification and decontamination was not activated at this time. Methods like thermal control and chemical disinfection are some of the commonly used and effective strategies to eliminate the bacterial burden in the water system. Other infection control measures, such as isolation and airborne precautions, are not applicable for Legionella infections, as the disease is not known to spread between humans and can be controlled through environmental monitoring of water sources.

In conclusion, L. micdadei infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infections with positive AFB staining, especially in immunocompromised hosts. A high index of clinical suspicion and consequent employment of appropriate methods of detection can increase microbial recovery, leading to the timely implementation of optimal antimicrobial therapy and effective infection control measures.

AASLD/AST practice guideline — Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia treatment is summarized as follows: Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole is the drug of choice, with high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administered orally or intravenously at 15–20 mg/kg/day in divided doses and adjusted for renal dysfunction; intravenous pentamidine is the preferred alternative for patients intolerant of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole with more severe infections (grade 1, level A). Corticosteroids (40–60 mg of prednisone or its equivalent) should be used in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy for patients with significant hypoxia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen < 70 mm Hg on room air). The minimal duration of antimicrobial therapy is 14 days, but more severe infections may merit longer courses of treatment.

### Optimizing the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for prevention of PCP and opportunistic infections in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients… [^112wqDfV]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract 138 Background: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is preferred for prevention of. Pneumocystispneumonia, toxoplasmosis and other opportunistic infections after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, but it is often withheld due to potential adverse events. From July 2016-June 2017 we observed that 31% of allogeneic HCT recipients at our hospital were prescribed TMP-SMX throughout the high risk period. Therefore, we developed an intervention to explore reasons for such a low prescription rate and to optimize TMP-SMX use. Methods: Our institution's HCT practice guidelines were revised to include indications for TMP-SMX and alternative agents for PCP and Toxoplasmaprophylaxis and specific clinical and laboratory criteria for withholding TMP-SMX. Education on the guidelines was provided to transplant clinicians. Outpatient encounters were prospectively audited from January to April 2018.

Providers received real-time feedback with recommendations in accordance with our guidelines prior to patients' visits. Results: We reviewed 321 outpatient encounters among 112 patients. Seventy-six patients were on TMP-SMX prophylaxis at the first reviewed encounter. Cytopenias were the most common reason for withholding TMP-SMX, occurring in 50 encounters, followed by elevated liver function tests, hyperkalemia, elevated creatinine, rash or hypersensitivity, and unknown/other. In 73 encounters in which patients received alternative or no PCP prophylaxis, we recommended changing to TMP-SMX. This intervention was accepted in 15 patients, 11 of whom tolerated TMP-SMX well. In the remaining four patients, TMP-SMX was subsequently discontinued due to unrelated AE and possible TMP-SMX-associated elevated LFTs.

Conclusions: Provider education and real-time feedback led to increased utilization of TMP-SMX for prevention of PCP and other opportunistic infections in HCT recipients without an increase in TMP-SMX-related adverse effects. Further study is needed to understand the low clinician acceptance rate of the intervention.

### Ciprofloxacin versus trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis of bacterial infections in bone marrow transplant recipients: a randomized, controlled trial… [^112XjQJF]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for the prevention of bacterial infections in patients who received bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of solid and hematopoietic neoplasms. Patients and Methods Adult inpatients about to undergo BMT for lymphoma, leukemia, or solid tumors were enrolled onto a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial that compared CIP with TMS. Subjects were stratified before randomization according to tumor and BMT type. Prophylaxis was begun within 96 hours of initiation of the BMT preparative regimen and continued until the onset of fever, signs or symptoms of infection, serious adverse effects, or recovery of the absolute granulocyte count to ≥ to 400/microL.

Results Seventy-five CIP recipients and 71 TMS recipients were assessable for efficacy. No difference was noted between the two groups in occurrence of fever during neutropenia, time to onset of first fever, or overall infection rates. Ten bacteremias occurred in CIP recipients versus six in TMS recipients. Ten episodes of Clostridium difficile enterocolitis occurred in TMS recipients versus no episodes in CIP recipients. Four infections caused by gram-negative bacilli, including one bacteremia, occurred in TMS recipients versus none in CIP recipients. No differences were noted in the incidence of rash or organ toxicity. TMS recipients had longer durations of granulocytopenia at AGC levels ≤ to 500/microL and ≤ to 100/microL than did CIP recipients. Mean peak and trough serum levels of CIP decreased significantly between weeks 1 and 2 of prophylaxis.

Conclusion CIP and TMS were equally safe and effective in the prevention of bacterial infections in BMT patients when the overall infection rate was used as the principal end point. TMS prophylaxis was associated with a higher incidence of C difficile enterocolitis and infections caused by gram-negative bacilli, as well as a trend toward prolongation of granulocytopenia.

### Perioperative fosfomycin in the prophylaxis of urinary… [^116USn9X]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Study Overview A clinical controlled, randomized and double blind trial that included adult patients receiving kidney transplantation at the INCMNSZ. The intervention group will receive disodium fosfomycin 4 g intravenously in three moments: preoperative of transplant surgery, prior to removal of the urinary catheter and finally prior to removal of ureteral catheter. The control group will receive placebo in the same moments. Both groups will receive prophylaxis standard for urinary tract infection, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg per day. This prophylaxis will be administered once the estimated glomerular filtration rate is greater than 30 mL/min/1. 73m2. In the context of development UTI in receptors of KT, some microbiological factors have raised great importance, mainly the antimicrobial drug resistance, which has been reported for TMP/SMX as high as 60 to 100%.

Furthermore, it is also of increasing importance the recent isolation of multidrug-resistant bacteria, in particular ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus. This phenomenon increases the rate of hospitalizations as well as the costs of hospital stay and antibiotic therapy. In our institution, in receptors of KT the rate of TMP/SMX resistance is 89% and ESBL-production about 32% among E. coli recovered from urine. Because of the increase in the rate of TMP-SMX resistance, there is a lot of interest to use other antibiotics for the prevention of UTI among different populations. In this sense, fosfomycin is an agent with a unique mechanism of action that does not share with other families of known antibiotics, this characteristic provides advantages to use this antibiotic alone or, even, synergistically in combination with other antibiotics.

Our hypothesis is that in the seven weeks after kidney transplantation, perioperative prophylaxis with FOS will show greater efficacy in comparison with standard prophylaxis. Considering that the mean number of UTI and BA episodes per patient in the first seven weeks is 0. 8 episodes / patient, if we want to decrease it to
0. 4 episodes per patient, using the means comparison formula will require 40 patients per arm per treatment, this considering a power of 80% and confidence intervals of 95%. Subjects will be followed up for 7 weeks from renal transplant surgery. The outcome variables are defined as follows:

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was grade II to IV aGVHD. The secondary outcome was grade III to IV aGVHD. Data were analyzed using 3 orthogonal methods: conventional Cox proportional hazard regression, marginal structural models, and machine learning. Both inpatient and outpatient administrations were included. Patients received prophylactic antibiotics, usually fluoroquinolones, while neutropenic. Empirical treatment of neutropenic fever was generally third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins. The grade III to IV aGVHD models did not converge when all antibiotic exposures were included. Therefore, the results for grade III to IV aGVHD should be treated with caution. during week 4 after allo-HCT, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during weeks 3 to 4 after allo-HCT. Avoiding this class of antibiotics early after transplant seems prudent.

The challenge in current practice is the lack of antibiotics that are effective enough in prophylaxis or treatment but spare the commensal microbiota. 18 Various microbiota-targeted approaches are being tested to protect the microbiota during antibiotic use or restore it after injury. 36 Examples of potentially protective treatments are nonselective luminal.
