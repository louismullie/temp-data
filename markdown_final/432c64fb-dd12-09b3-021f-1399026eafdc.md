## Question

Treatment of superior mesenteric vein thrombosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should verify first-line therapy and anticoagulation choices. Next, I will examine indications, techniques, and outcomes for endovascular therapy. After that, I need to check surgical indications and the role of second-look operations. I will then consider special populations such as cirrhosis and transplant candidates. Finally, I should review duration of anticoagulation, thrombophilia testing, and follow-up imaging, and close with a concise algorithm that integrates these elements with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and urgency. SMV thrombosis is a vascular emergency with nonspecific abdominal pain and a risk of bowel ischemia and high mortality if diagnosis and treatment are delayed, so I need to ensure rapid contrast-enhanced CT angiography/venography to confirm the diagnosis and assess extent, bowel wall changes, and peritoneal signs, while initiating resuscitation and correcting electrolytes and coagulopathy as needed [^13dfe7a1] [^99ebc96c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about interventions before establishing first-line therapy. I should confirm that anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is the foundation for all patients without active bleeding, because it halts thrombus propagation and improves recanalization rates, with observational data showing SMV patency rising from 42% to 73% after anticoagulation in noncirrhotic acute PVT/MVT cohorts [^059e26ca] [^25d74b1c] [^076b667f].

> Wait, let me verify the maintenance strategy after initial heparinization. Warfarin has the most evidence, but DOACs are increasingly used and acceptable alternatives in many patients; I should note that ACG suggests LMWH or warfarin for maintenance and acknowledges limited but growing DOAC experience, while ESVS 2025 explicitly allows DOACs as alternatives to VKA or LMWH for acute MVT, which supports a shared decision-making approach in stable patients without high bleeding risk [^67f5fbc1] [^60cceaad] [^8b5235a4].

> I will now examine when to escalate beyond anticoagulation. Endovascular therapy should be considered when there is clinical deterioration despite adequate anticoagulation, extensive thrombus with high risk of ischemia, or persistent severe symptoms, ideally within a multidisciplinary framework; techniques include catheter-directed thrombolysis, pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy, and balloon angioplasty, with access via transjugular intrahepatic, transhepatic, or occasionally transarterial routes, recognizing that evidence is largely retrospective and heterogeneous [^10486749] [^c4578828] [^c9160a84].

> Let me think about the balance of benefits and risks for endovascular therapy. Small series report high technical success and symptom relief, with avoidance of bowel resection in some cohorts, but major complications including bleeding, hepatic arterial injury, and the need for transfusion occur in a meaningful minority; therefore, I should confirm careful selection, close monitoring of fibrinogen and clinical status, and readiness to pivot to surgery if ischemia progresses despite lysis [^47084b43] [^989fe576] [^a770fc25].

> Next, I should review surgical indications and strategy. Exploratory laparotomy with bowel resection is mandatory for peritonitis, transmural infarction, or perforation, and a second-look operation at 24–48 hours is often prudent to reassess bowel viability and limit unnecessary resection; damage control principles apply in unstable patients, and in select postoperative cases, catheter-directed thrombolysis via SMA or direct venous access can be considered to reduce ischemic burden and the need for repeat resections [^debb492f] [^6355a0a3] [^d9b614d0].

> But wait, what if the patient has cirrhosis or is a transplant candidate. I need to ensure a tailored approach: in cirrhosis, anticoagulation is recommended for acute PVT/MVT or when thrombus extends into mesenteric veins, balancing bleeding risk, with UFH preferred if renal dysfunction and LMWH if thrombocytopenia; indefinite anticoagulation is reasonable for transplant candidates to preserve portal inflow and candidacy, and TIPS may facilitate recanalization and improve transplant eligibility in selected cases [^3e3bea4d] [^d052e5e8] [^713004a8] [^1f61a671].

> I should double-check duration of anticoagulation and the role of thrombophilia testing. For reversible etiologies without thrombophilia, 3–6 months is typical; for idiopathic MVT or persistent risk factors, indefinite anticoagulation is advised; in noncirrhotic patients with thrombophilia, indefinite therapy is recommended; ASH suggests thrombophilia testing when results would change duration, but not if anticoagulation will be continued indefinitely, which I should integrate into individualized planning [^0577741b] [^c227f4cc] [^c0cacf06] [^00ea6541] [^2ab65501].

> Let me reconsider follow-up and imaging cadence. Serial clinical assessments for pain, peritoneal signs, and gastrointestinal bleeding are essential; repeat contrast-enhanced CT or MR venography at about 1 week and again at 1–3 months helps document recanalization and guide duration decisions, while Doppler ultrasound can be used for interval surveillance once the patient stabilizes; I should confirm that symptom resolution correlates with imaging improvement before stepping down intensity [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought endovascular therapy might be broadly indicated early for extensive thrombus, but I should correct that impulse. Given the lack of randomized data and meaningful complication rates, endovascular therapy should remain a selective rescue strategy rather than routine first-line care, reserved for patients with progression or high-risk features despite anticoagulation, and pursued in experienced centers with surgical backup [^10486749] [^c4578828] [^57f9aeba].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure a stepwise algorithm: stabilize and confirm with contrast-enhanced CT; start UFH or LMWH immediately if no bleeding; transition to warfarin or a DOAC for maintenance; continue for at least 3–6 months if reversible, and indefinitely if idiopathic, persistent risk factors, or thrombophilia; escalate to endovascular therapy if deterioration or extensive clot with ongoing ischemia; operate for peritonitis or infarction with a low threshold for second look; tailor management in cirrhosis and transplant candidates; and arrange structured follow-up with imaging to confirm recanalization and guide duration, aligning choices with patient-specific bleeding and thrombotic risks [^059e26ca] [^076b667f] [^0577741b] [^10486749] [^debb492f].

---

Superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis is best managed with **immediate anticoagulation** (UFH or LMWH) to halt thrombus progression and reduce recurrence [^059e26ca] [^076b667f]. If symptoms persist or worsen despite anticoagulation, **catheter-directed thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy** is indicated to restore venous flow and prevent bowel infarction [^10486749] [^57f9aeba]. Surgery is reserved for **bowel infarction or peritonitis**, with second-look laparotomy when needed [^debb492f] [^6355a0a3]. Anticoagulation is continued for at least 3–6 months [^0577741b], and indefinitely if thrombophilia or persistent risk factors are present [^c227f4cc] [^c0cacf06]. Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary care are critical to reduce mortality and bowel loss [^13dfe7a1] [^99ebc96c].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnosis

- **Clinical presentation**: SMV thrombosis typically presents with nonspecific abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and distension [^13dfe7a1]. Early symptoms may be subtle, delaying diagnosis and increasing the risk of bowel infarction [^12eb401c].

- **Imaging**: Contrast-enhanced CT is the gold standard, providing detailed visualization of the thrombus, extent of venous obstruction, and bowel wall changes [^99ebc96c].

- **Laboratory tests**: D-dimer may be elevated but is nonspecific; leukocytosis and elevated lactate may indicate bowel ischemia [^notfound].

---

## Medical management

### Anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of SMV thrombosis management, aiming to prevent thrombus propagation, reduce recurrence, and promote recanalization [^059e26ca].

- **Initial anticoagulation**: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is initiated immediately upon diagnosis, provided there is no active bleeding [^059e26ca] [^076b667f].

- **Maintenance anticoagulation**: After initial stabilization, patients are transitioned to oral anticoagulants (warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [DOACs]) for long-term therapy [^67f5fbc1] [^60cceaad].

- **Duration of anticoagulation**: Minimum of 3–6 months for reversible risk factors; indefinite anticoagulation for idiopathic cases, thrombophilia, or persistent risk factors [^0577741b] [^c227f4cc].

---

### Supportive care

Supportive measures include **bowel rest, nasogastric decompression, fluid resuscitation, and close monitoring** for signs of bowel ischemia or infarction [^notfound].

---

## Endovascular interventions

Endovascular therapy is indicated for patients who deteriorate clinically despite adequate anticoagulation or who have extensive thrombus burden with high risk of bowel infarction [^10486749] [^c4578828].

- **Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT)**: Infusion of thrombolytic agents (e.g. rt-PA) directly into the thrombus via transjugular or transhepatic routes, often combined with mechanical thrombectomy [^7a96edbf] [^57f9aeba].

- **Mechanical thrombectomy**: Aspiration or rheolytic devices (e.g. AngioJet) are used to physically remove thrombus, rapidly restoring venous flow [^7a96edbf] [^57f9aeba].

- **Balloon angioplasty and stenting**: Reserved for cases with venous stenosis or residual obstruction after thrombolysis [^7a96edbf] [^c4578828].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **bowel infarction, perforation, or peritonitis**. The goals are to resect nonviable bowel and restore perfusion to viable segments [^debb492f] [^6355a0a3].

- **Bowel resection**: Removal of necrotic bowel segments, with primary anastomosis or temporary stoma creation [^debb492f].

- **Second-look laparotomy**: Routinely performed within 24–48 hours to reassess bowel viability and perform additional resection if necessary [^6355a0a3].

- **Thrombectomy**: Rarely performed, reserved for cases with extensive thrombus and no bowel infarction [^65c16e65].

---

## Special considerations

### Cirrhosis and liver transplantation candidates

In cirrhosis, **anticoagulation is recommended** for acute SMV thrombosis, balancing bleeding risk and potential benefits, including improved portal flow and transplant candidacy [^3e3bea4d] [^db070d79]. Indefinite anticoagulation is advised for transplant candidates to maintain portal venous patency [^7b137cb2].

---

### Thrombophilia and recurrent thrombosis

Thrombophilia testing is recommended in selected patients, particularly those with idiopathic thrombosis or recurrent events, to guide duration of anticoagulation [^00ea6541] [^2ab65501].

---

## Outcomes and complications

With modern management, **mortality has decreased** to approximately 13–20%, though it remains higher in patients with bowel infarction or extensive thrombosis [^f5fe4329] [^13b6272f]. Recurrence is common without adequate anticoagulation, emphasizing the importance of appropriate duration and adherence [^e400545a]. Complications include bowel infarction, short bowel syndrome, portal hypertension, and bleeding related to anticoagulation or interventions [^debb492f] [^8615f97e].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up with **clinical assessment and imaging (Doppler ultrasound or CT)** is essential to monitor recanalization, detect recurrence, and assess for complications such as portal hypertension [^4e6f5ac5].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Anticoagulation (UFH/LMWH) | All patients without active bleeding |
| 2 | Endovascular therapy (CDT/mechanical thrombectomy) | - Deterioration despite anticoagulation <br/> - Extensive thrombus <br/> - High risk of infarction |
| 3 | Surgical intervention | - Bowel infarction <br/> - Perforation <br/> - Peritonitis |
| 4 | Long-term anticoagulation | - Minimum 3–6 months <br/> - Indefinite if idiopathic or thrombophilia |

---

Superior mesenteric vein thrombosis requires **prompt anticoagulation** with escalation to endovascular therapy or surgery based on clinical response and severity. Multidisciplinary care and individualized management are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize complications [^059e26ca] [^99ebc96c].

Objective

To describe a case of superior mesenteric vein thrombosis associated with IVF.

Design

Case report.

Setting

University teaching hospital.

Patient(S)

A 33-year-old female developed progressive abdominal pain several days after ET in her first IVF cycle. A computed tomography scan 12 days after ET showed a superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.

Intervention(S)

Therapeutic anticoagulation.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Resolution of the superior mesenteric vein thrombosis with therapeutic anticoagulation.

Result(S)

Early diagnosis and treatment of a superior mesenteric vein thrombosis associated with IVF led to a favorable outcome.

Conclusion(S)

Endocrine alterations consequent to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF place patients at risk for thromboembolic events. Thromboembolic events may occur during an IVF cycle in the absence of overt ovarian hyperstimulation, an inherited thrombophilia, or pregnancy.

Background

Mesenteric Vein Thrombosis (MVT) is defined as acute thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and its branches, with or without thrombus extension to the portal vein. It is the least common form of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI), accounting for about one-sixth of AMI cases. Typically, it affects the SMV and rarely impacts the inferior mesenteric vein.

Acute superior mesenteric vein thrombosis (ASMVT) typically presents with clinical symptoms within 24–72 h. Initial signs can include classic "pain out of proportion to examination", primarily centered in the mid-abdomen, and if left untreated, ASMVT can lead to significant adverse clinical outcomes, such as bowel necrosis and death, with a reported mortality rate of up to 50%.

Currently, anticoagulant therapy is the standard treatment for ASMVT, primarily aimed at halting thrombus progression and preventing recurrence. According to the Management of the Diseases of Mesenteric Arteries and Veins: Clinical Practice Guidelines of the European Society of Vascular Surgery (ESVS), ACG Clinical Guideline: Disorders of the Hepatic and Mesenteric Circulation and, and Baveno VII consensus, anticoagulation is recommended as the first-line initial treatment approach. However, for patients with extensive thrombotic burden, progressive symptoms, or those unresponsive to anticoagulation therapy, the efficacy of anticoagulation alone remains suboptimal. The management of ASMVT continues to pose a significant clinical challenge, as the overall mortality rate with traditional anticoagulation and bowel resection remains alarmingly high at 13–50%. Therefore, it is particularly crucial to explore more effective alternative treatment strategies for these patients.

### Acute mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis: etiology, diagnosis, and interventional management [^d7cad429]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis (PVT) can lead to fatal mesenteric ischemia, with mortality rates ranging from 37% to 76%. Early diagnosis and prompt venous revascularization are crucial in symptomatic cases. Spontaneous recanalization in portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is rare, making systemic anticoagulation the first-line treatment. However, even with early anticoagulation, recanalization occurs in only 35%-40% of cases. Involvement of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) increases the risk of bowel ischemia, which is associated with poor outcomes. The primary goals of endovascular treatment for portomesenteric thrombectomy and lysis are to restore blood flow, prevent bowel ischemia, and reduce thrombus burden. This approach aims to alleviate symptoms, preserve liver and intestinal function, and facilitate anticoagulation while minimizing procedural risks. For patients who deteriorate despite anticoagulation, catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) via percutaneous transhepatic or transjugular access provides a safe and effective minimally invasive adjunctive treatment.

### Percutaneous pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy of acute symptomatic superior mesenteric vein thrombosis [^57f9aeba]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

At present, there is no agreement on the optimal treatment strategy for acute mesenteric venous ischemia, because of the rarity of the condition and the lack of RCTs. In fact, all available data come from single-center small series or case reports. However, results from those series would seem to encourage an early endovascular approach, particularly with percutaneous pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy, in order to achieve early mesenteric revascularization and avoid surgical resection. According to the findings in this study, treatment of acute SMV thrombosis with PPMT in patients without symptoms and signs of surgical abdomen seemed safe and effective, with a 87.5% long-term survival rate and a 12.5% major complication rate.

### Endovascular management of acute superior mesenteric vein thrombosis: a retrospective study on thrombolysis outcomes [^932dd9d3]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study on invasive combination therapy strategies demonstrates certain potential benefits in patients with ASMVT, particularly in terms of rapid symptom relief, prevention of thrombosis recurrence, reduced mortality, and decreased need for intestinal resection. However, it is important to note that combination percutaneous treatments were performed only in a subset of ASMVT patients. Due to the lack of high-quality evidence, clear clinical guideline support, and the risk of complications, careful and cautious evaluation is required to identify patients who may benefit most from this approach. Given the low incidence of ASMVT, conducting large-scale randomized controlled trials may be impractical, future research should focus on multi-center studies or pooled data analyses to provide stronger evidence and guide clinical practice.

### Percutaneous pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy of acute symptomatic superior mesenteric vein thrombosis [^e400545a]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although to date there is no consensus on treatment of acute SMV thrombosis, once it has been diagnosed, the primary goal of therapy must be to avoid the process leading to transmural infarction, perforation, and severe peritonitis. Systemic heparinization may improve recanalization rates up to 80% and can be beneficial in terms of patient survival. However, anticoagulation alone is associated with recurrence of thrombotic events in 3–40% of cases.

Surgery is mandatory in the presence of severe peritonitis or perforation, but even when the diagnosis is established promptly, 30-day mortality rates in acute SMV thrombosis range from 13 to 50% with traditional treatment of anticoagulation and bowel resection. However, endovascular treatment by means of transcatheter thrombolysis alone may require high dosages and long infusion times, with an increase of up to 60% in the risk of bleeding and intracranial or gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Thrombectomy by manual aspiration or by devices which mechanically debulk and aspire the thrombus has been used in the last years and has demonstrated encouraging results. In particular, percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy has proven to be effective in reducing the dosage and the infusion time of thrombolytics.

### Transcatheter thrombolysis combined with damage control surgery for treatment of acute mesenteric venous thrombosis associated with bowel necrosis: a retrospective study [^159c396f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis (ASMVT) is an uncommon disease that presents no obvious specific symptoms in the early stage. The diagnosis of ASMVT remains elusive until intestinal gangrene and peritonitis occurs. The optimal time for treatment is lost, and eventually massive bowel resection is required, leading to short bowel syndrome. Therefore, early diagnosis and prompt therapy is very important to improve the survival rate of patients with ASMVT, with the goal of conserving as much bowel as possible.

For patients with ASMVT associated with bowel ischemia, the recommended treatment is emergency surgery. However, in venous thrombosis, unlike arterial thrombosis, the line of demarcation is indistinct; leading to massive bowel resection. This is associated with the development of short bowel syndrome and high mortality rates. In order to improve the viability of the ischemic and congested bowel secondary to mesenteric venous thrombosis, a strategy of initial transcatheter thrombolysis followed by surgery has been adopted with success.

In this study, we evaluated the outcome of this novel approach in critically ill patients combined with damage control surgery.

### Endovascular management of acute superior mesenteric vein thrombosis: a retrospective study on thrombolysis outcomes [^fddc0cd1]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute superior mesenteric vein thrombosis (ASMVT) is a rare but life-threatening condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. While anticoagulation remains the standard treatment, endovascular therapies such as thrombolysis, thrombectomy, and angioplasty are increasingly utilized in selected cases. However, evidence on their outcomes remains limited. This study retrospectively reports the clinical outcomes of ASMVT patients treated with endovascular combination therapies.

Methods

Between August 2019 and May 2024, 12 patients (males = 9; mean age, 52.33 ± 12.51 years) were diagnosed with ASMVT. The study collected comprehensive data on demographic details, presenting symptoms, etiology, treatment modalities, response to treatment, and follow-up outcomes. Computed Tomography (CT) was available from diagnosis, and an average of 6.3 CT scans with a median follow-up of 3 months (IQR: 2–20 months).

Results

The average time from symptom onset to angiographic treatment initiation was 8.0 ± 4.71 days, preceded by anticoagulation with heparin from the time of diagnosis. Patients were treated with combination therapy involving endovascular thrombolysis, rheolytic thrombectomy, and balloon angioplasty via transjugular (n = 9, 75%) or percutaneous (n = 3, 25%) approaches. Thrombolysis was performed with an average recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) infusion duration of 2.75 ± 1.14 days and a total dose of 61.25 ± 18.48 mg rt-PA. Superior mesenteric vein (SMV) flow was initially restored almost completely in 58.3% and partially in 41.7% of patients. Complications observed were hepatic artery bleeding (n = 2, 16.7%), hepatic arteriovenous fistula (n = 1, 8.3%), hepatic parenchymal bleeding (n = 1, 8.3%), melena (n = 1, 8.3%), and nostril bleeding (n = 1, 8.3%). Two patients experienced worsening symptoms of post-intervention, leading to bowel resection revealing intestinal necrosis. SMV patency was almost complete in 25%, and partially in 25% of patients at follow-up.

Conclusion

Endovascular combination therapy with long-term thrombolysis and thrombectomy in patients with ASMVT demonstrated promising technical outcomes. In view of complications, individual indication for intervention needs to be confirmed in a multidisciplinary team.

### Acute mesenteric ischaemia secondary to portal, splenic and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis [^13dfe7a1]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Mesenteric ischaemia represents an uncommon complication of splanchnic vein thrombosis which requires a high level of suspicion to diagnose in a timely manner. This report discusses a case of portal, splenic and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis leading to mesenteric ischaemia and infarct in a 79-year-old man. The diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischaemia and splanchnic vein thrombosis remains difficult due to the non-specific symptoms of these conditions. As diagnosis does continue to improve, treatment of acute mesenteric ischaemia using medical management has become increasingly possible before ischaemia advances to the point at which surgical resection is required.

### Open thrombectomy for primary acute mesentericoportal venous thrombosis – should It Be done? [^12ef0620]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Mesentericoportal venous thrombosis (MVT) is a rare condition, accounting for 5–15% of acute mesenteric ischemia. Primary MVT is even rarer, with some reports quoting an incidence rate of 10–30% of reported cases. It presents a diagnostic challenge and is associated with a significant mortality rate, ranging from 13% to 50%. As it is an uncommon condition, the evidence in current literature regarding the treatment of MVT is limited. We discuss our surgical experience with a case of acute primary MVT that was managed with good clinical outcome and discuss the current evidence for the treatment of acute MVT. A 50-year-old Chinese lady with no significant past medical history presented with a 2-day history of abdominal pain and epigastric tenderness on examination. Computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis showed evidence of extensive acute thrombi present in portal confluence extending into the superior mesenteric vein, associated with submucosal edema in some central jejunal loops. Despite systemic anticoagulation therapy with intravenous heparin, the patient deteriorated clinically, and decision was made for an exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, and open thrombectomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. She was discharged on postoperative day 13 with lifelong oral anticoagulation. In conclusion, we describe the successful management of a patient with extensive acute primary MVT where open thrombectomy was performed together with small bowel resection.

Portal and mesenteric venous thrombosis is an uncommon condition that is usually treated with systemic anticoagulation. Catheter-directed thrombolysis via the superior mesenteric artery may be a viable adjunct to treatment of this potentially morbid condition. We present a case of portal and mesenteric venous thrombosis treated with systemic anticoagulation and catheter-directed infusion of tissue plasminogen activator via the superior mesenteric artery.

### Endovascular management of acute superior mesenteric vein thrombosis: a retrospective study on thrombolysis outcomes [^c9160a84]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines remain cautious about the widespread application of invasive treatments. This caution primarily arises from the significant risks of complications associated with such treatments. Patients with liver cirrhosis often receive anticoagulation therapy alone due to the risk of hepatic decompensation and the relatively high likelihood of spontaneous recanalization. In a prospective study conducted by Nery et al. approximately 70% of cases with partial PVT in cirrhotic patients experienced spontaneous recanalization during follow-up. Therefore, treatment strategies for non-cirrhotic patients are generally more aggressive, whereas those for cirrhotic patients are more cautious and individualized. The Baveno VII guidelines provide recommendations on the management of PVT and splanchnic thrombosis in both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. In non-cirrhotic patients, immediate therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended for recent PVT or splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), which continued for at least 6 months. Long-term anticoagulation is advised for those with a persistent prothrombotic state and may be considered in others. For past PVT or SVT, including incomplete resolution after 6 months, long-term anticoagulation is similarly recommended. However, invasive treatments should be considered in cases with ASMVT with progressing symptoms against its risks. For example, while catheter-directed thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy are effective in restoring blood flow, they are linked to severe complications such as bleeding, infection, and organ failure. A meta-analysis by Rodrigues et al. indicated that the higher rates of major complications and mortality observed in studies involving thrombolysis may be attributed to factors such as the choice of access routes, a higher proportion of cavernous transformation, and more extensive thrombosis in non-cirrhotic PVT patients. Yang et al. reported that 4 patients (50%) required additional surgical intervention following thrombolytic therapy due to persistent and unremitting abdominal distention, whereas in our study, only 2 patients (16.7%) underwent bowel resection, which is comparatively lower. This discrepancy may be attributed to differences in the timing of intervention, as the average interval from symptom onset to hospitalization in Yang et al.'s cohort was 12.63 ± 3.62 days, whereas in our study, the average time from symptom onset to angiographic treatment initiation was shorter at 8.0 ± 4.71 days, potentially allowing for earlier intervention and improved outcomes. In a study by Rabuffi et al. one patient died from multi-organ failure following pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy, and Kim et al. reported a case of death due to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction after transhepatic catheter-directed thrombectomy. Additionally, Li observed hepatic subcapsular hematoma in 8.7% of 23 patients undergoing invasive treatments. Adding to these concerns, a study of 21 patients with PVT highlighted that 9 patients (42.8%) experienced hemorrhagic complications. Additionally, in another study of 35 patients who underwent interventional procedures for PVT, 10 patients (28.6%) also experienced bleeding complications. Therefore, such invasive interventions are generally not recommended unless patients exhibit worsening conditions under anticoagulation therapy, persistent symptoms, or signs of intestinal ischemia. The decision to proceed with invasive treatment should be comprehensively evaluated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT).

### Endovascular management of acute superior mesenteric vein thrombosis: a retrospective study on thrombolysis outcomes [^c4578828]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

In light of these challenges, according to the ESVS recommendations for the treatment of MVT, endovascular treatment may be considered for patients who experience persistent symptoms, worsening abdominal pain after initiating anticoagulation, or signs of peritonitis, especially if they are poor candidates for surgery. Over the past few years, minimally invasive interventional procedures (such as catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, and balloon angioplasty) have been proposed as treatment options for ASMVT by percutaneous transhepatic (PT) and transjugular intrahepatic (TI) routes. These techniques can directly remove or dissolve thrombus, rapidly restore mesenteric blood flow, and significantly reduce the damage caused by intestinal ischemia.

Nonetheless, large-scale evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of interventional treatment for ASMVT remains limited. Specifically, studies comparing different interventional approaches and combined treatment strategies are sparse, and standardized protocols have yet to be established. Our study aims to report the clinical outcomes of 12 patients with ASMVT who were treated at our institution through transjugular, percutaneous trans-hepatic, or trans-splenic approaches with a combination of local thrombolysis, rheolytic thrombectomy, and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).

### Transhepatic catheter-directed thrombectomy and thrombolysis of acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis [^42c39f43]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate clinical outcomes after percutaneous treatment of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients with SMV thrombosis treated with percutaneous catheter-directed thrombectomy/thrombolysis. The demographics of the study population, potential causative factors contributing to SMV thrombosis, and morbidity and mortality associated with therapy were assessed.

Results

Eleven patients (mean age, 44.3 years ± 12.8) with SMV thrombosis were treated with percutaneous transhepatic catheter-directed thrombectomy/thrombolysis. Potential causative factors included recent major abdominal surgery, thrombophilic conditions, pancreatitis, and repetitive abdominal trauma. The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and percutaneous treatment was 8.6 days ± 6.5. Computed tomography confirmed the clinical diagnosis in nine patients (81.8%). One patient (9.1%) had a bleeding complication, which was treated by chest tube drainage without long-term sequelae. One patient (9.1%) with refractory SMV thrombosis died of sepsis and multiple organ failure. No recurrent episode of SMV thrombosis or mortality was documented during a mean follow-up of 42 months ± 22.5.

Conclusions

Percutaneous transhepatic catheter-directed thrombectomy/thrombolysis for SMV thrombosis is associated with a rapid improvement in symptoms and low incidences of long-term morbidity and mortality. Percutaneous thrombectomy and thrombolysis should be considered in all patients with acute SMV thrombosis without evidence of bowel necrosis.

### Treatment outcomes in patients with acute thromboembolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery [^4ec8b3a6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is associated with poor prognosis. It can be caused by mesenteric arterial occlusion, mesenteric venous occlusion, and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia caused by vasoconstriction secondary to low-flow states. In particular, acute thromboembolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (ATOS) is a life-threatening condition associated with high mortality rates. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent bowel ischemia and subsequent bowel infarction, necrosis, or perforation. ATOS is widely recognized as the primary etiology of AMI, whereby superior mesenteric artery embolism (SMAE) is estimated to contribute to approximately 40–50% of AMI cases. The majority of these emboli are believed to originate from a cardiac source, such as atrial fibrillation. Superior mesenteric artery thrombosis (SMAT) may be causative in 25% of cases, and it typically occurs in patients with preexisting atherosclerotic disease within the mesenteric vasculature or accompanied by hypercoagulable states. Despite treatment advances and newer techniques, breakthroughs have been made in the treatment of ATOS, and vascular surgeons have both endovascular and open options. The use of endovascular therapy has been increasing in the past decade. However, whether endovascular therapy should be the primary treatment for ATOS is still controversial. The goals of this study were to assess the efficacy of different therapies for ATOS.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) greatly improves the diagnosis of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis, which presents as the unspecific symptom of abdominal pain. Prothrombotic states or thrombophilia and local intra-abdominal infections are major causes of SMV thrombosis. A 37-year-old Chinese woman was diagnosed with SMV and portal vein thrombosis. The patient was initially given 40 mg of heparin sodium every 12 hr and 80,0000 U/day of urokinase using superior mesenteric artery angiography. The abdominal pain was not relieved after treatment. The patient then underwent open surgery, where an ileal branch of the SMV was punctured, a 4F sheath was introduced into the vein toward the portal vein, and a 20-cm Unifuse catheter was placed inside the thrombus for further thrombolysis. Both heparin sodium and urokinase were infused through catheter-directed thrombolysis. The patient's symptoms then gradually resolved.

### Modern treatment of acute mesenteric ischaemia [^99ebc96c]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischaemia in the early stages is now possible with modern computed tomography (CT), using intravenous contrast enhancement and imaging in the arterial and/or portal venous phase. The availability of CT around the clock means that more patients with acute mesenteric ischaemia may be treated with urgent intestinal revascularization.

Methods

This was a review of modern treatment strategies for acute mesenteric ischaemia.

Results

Endovascular therapy has become an important alternative, especially in patients with acute thrombotic superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion, where the occlusive lesion can be recanalized either antegradely from the femoral or brachial artery, or retrogradely from an exposed SMA after laparotomy, and stented. Aspiration embolectomy, thrombolysis and open surgical embolectomy, followed by on-table angiography, are the treatment options for embolic SMA occlusion. Endovascular therapy may be an option in the few patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis who do not respond to anticoagulation therapy. Laparotomy is needed to evaluate the extent and severity of visceral organ ischaemia, which is treated according to the principles of damage control surgery.

Conclusion

Modern treatment of acute mesenteric ischaemia involves a specialized approach that considers surgical and, increasingly, endovascular options for best outcomes.

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^fb8b6b44]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) may be defined as a sudden interruption of the blood supply to a segment of the small intestine, leading to ischemia, cellular damage, intestinal necrosis, and eventually patient death if untreated. AMI may be non-occlusive (NOMI) or occlusive, with the primary etiology further defined as mesenteric arterial embolism (50%), mesenteric arterial thrombosis (15–25%), or mesenteric venous thrombosis (5–15%). The overall incidence is low (0.09 to 0.2% of all acute admissions to emergency departments), representing an uncommon cause of abdominal pain. Prompt diagnostic and intervention are essential to reduce the high mortality rates (50 to 80%).

There are currently no level 1 evidence to guide the evaluation and treatment of suspected AMI, and the published literature contains primarily institutional reviews, case series and personal recommendations with no clearly defined treatment guidelines.

Accordingly, this review aims to provide an update with recommendations based on the most currently accepted concepts in the management of AMI.

The current presentation evolved from the contributions of a group of experts in the field who submitted their evidence-based literature review of key points pertaining to diagnosis and management of AMI. Following preliminary preparation of these key points, a coordinated presentation was organized during the WSES World Congress, May 2017 in Campinas, Brazil. The final version has taken into account the presentations at the congress as well as pertinent group discussions and comments on the various presentations.

The grading of recommendations was evaluated (Table 1).

Table 1
Grading of recommendations

Mesenteric vascular anatomy and physiology

The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is the primary blood supply for the small bowel with some collateral flow from the celiac arterial system, via the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries, as well as from the inferior mesenteric artery. Intestinal blood returns via the portal vein. The splanchnic circulation receives 15–35% of the cardiac output, depending on the feeding state, but oxygen extraction is relatively low, accounting for the oxygen delivery capacity of the portal vein to the liver. Thus, blood supply must be reduced by more than 50% before the small intestine becomes ischemic.

Furthermore, the intestines can autoregulate oxygen availability via enhanced oxygen extraction and perfusion due to vasodilation. Experimentally, it had been shown that mesenteric ischemia does not occur until the patient's mean arterial pressure is < 45 mmHg. Consequently, the small intestine is able to compensate for a 75% reduction in mesenteric blood flow for up to 12 h.

### The role of endovascular therapy in acute mesenteric ischemia [^3f7b583a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Endovascular treatment of acute venous mesenteric ischemia

Despite the lack of specific biomarkers or any insidious symptomatology profile, the incidence of acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis (ASMVT) has increased in relation to the spread of contrast-enhanced CT; the portography phase facilitates early diagnosis with over 90% sensitivity.

As the overall mortality is still high (13–50% with traditional anticoagulation and bowel resection), the management of ASMVT remains a great clinical challenge. In the literature, mortality ranged from 29–38% for surgical treatment and from 13–19% for non-operative management.

Systemic anticoagulation is of uncertain value, because it is associated with extrahepatic portal vein hypertension (25%), transmural bowel infarction (18%) and an elevated risk of bleeding. In recent years, catheter-directed thrombolysis, combined with local anticoagulation and endovascular thrombectomy, has been introduced as a minimally invasive treatment option to dissolve thrombus and rapidly restore SMV flow. This procedure may be performed directly (percutaneous transhepatic and transjugular intrahepatic), or indirectly, via an SMA approach. Nevertheless, endovascular therapy in MVT carries a significant risk of complications and, although it can be life-saving in cases of severe ischemia (intense pain, bowel swelling and edema), the management should usually be stepwise, starting with low-molecular-weight heparin or heparin infusion, and followed by endovascular procedure if the patient's condition does not improve or deteriorates.

### Acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis: transcatheter thrombolysis and aspiration thrombectomy therapy by combined route of superior mesenteric vein and artery in eight patients [^b4da4b3c]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of catheter-directed thrombolysis and aspiration thrombectomy therapy by combined route of superior mesenteric vein and artery (SMV+SMA) for acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis (ASMVT).

Methods

This retrospective study reviewed eight ASMVT patients with transcatheter direct thrombolysis and aspiration thrombectomy therapy via SMV and indirect thrombolysis via SMA during a period of 14 months. The demographics, etiology, risk factors, therapeutic effect, complications, mortality, and follow-up of the study population were assessed. Anatomic and imaging classification of location and extent of thrombus at diagnosis and degree of thrombus lysis were described.

Results

Technical success was achieved with substantial improvement in symptoms and thrombus resolution after thrombolytic therapy in all patients. The local urokinase infusion by SMA and SMV was performed for 5–7 (6.13 ± 0.83) and 7–15 (12 ± 2.51) days. Anticoagulation was performed catheter-directed and then orally throughout hospitalization and after discharge. Four patients required delayed localized bowel resection after thrombolytic therapy with no death. Thrombolytic therapy was not interrupted despite minor bleeding at the puncture site in two patients and sepsis in another two postoperatively. Nearly complete removal of thrombus was demonstrated by contrast-enhanced CT scan and portography before discharge. Patients were discharged in 10–27 (19.25 ± 4.89) days after admission. No recurrence developed during the follow-up of 10–13 (12.13 ± 0.99) months.

Conclusions

Catheter-directed thrombolytic and aspiration therapy via SMV+SMA is beneficial for ASMVT in avoiding patient death, efficient resolving thrombus, rapid improving symptoms, reversing extensive intestinal ischemia, averting bowel resection, or localizing infarcted bowel segment and preventing short bowel syndrome.

### Postoperative catheter-directed thrombolysis versus systemic anticoagulation for acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis [^d9b614d0]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Little data evaluate catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) therapy as a sequential treatment of emergent surgery for patients with acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis (ASMVT). We compared the outcomes of ASMVT patients receiving CDT via superior mesenteric artery (SMA) with those who had systemic anticoagulation after emergent laparotomy.

Methods

A single-center retrospective study of ASMVT patients receiving emergent laparotomy from May 2012 to April 2014 was performed. Patients in group I had postoperative systemic anticoagulation and patients in group II underwent postoperative CDT. The demography, etiology, imaging features, clinical outcomes, and complications were compared. Moreover, univariate analysis was performed to identify confounding variables of 30-day mortality.

Results

Thirty-two patients (20 males, mean age of 44.9 ± 10.6 years) were included, 17 in group I and 15 in group II. No significant differences of demographic data, etiology, baseline value, and perioperative comorbidity were found. The rate of complete thrombus removal was significantly higher in group II than group I (29.4% vs. 80.0%, P = 0.001). The second-look laparotomy and repeat bowel resection (58.8% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.002) were required in fewer patients in group II (20.0% vs. 70.6%, P = 0.001). The incidence of short-bowel syndrome (SBS; 41.2% vs. 6.7%, P = 0.001) and 30-day mortality (41.2% vs. 6.7%, P = 0.001) were lower in group II. The 1-year survival was also better in group II (52.9% vs. 93.3%, P = 0.014). The incidence of massive abdominal hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion and surgical intervention was 11.8% in group I and 20.0% in group II (P = 0.645). The age, serum D-dimer level, SBS, and postoperative CDT were significant risk factors of 30-day mortality in this study.

Conclusions

For ASMVT patients receiving emergent surgery and intraoperative thrombectomy, the algorithm with postoperative CDT via SMA is associated with more favorable clinical outcome compared with systemic anticoagulation.

Materials and methods

Patients group

At our institution, the indication for endovascular therapy (a combination of catheter-directed thrombolysis / rheolytic thrombectomy / ballon angioplasty) via a TIPSS access or direct puncture of the portal vein is considered in the presence of risk factors (cirrhosis in transplant candidates, extensive thrombosis, known coagulopathy, portal vein stenosis, contraindication to anticoagulation) or in cases of persistent or worsening symptoms and thrombus progression despite anticoagulation as observed in a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan.

Between August 2019 and May 2024, we treated 12 patients with ASMVT through either the transjugular (n = 9, 75%) or percutaneous (n = 3, 25%) pathway (females = 3, 25%, males = 9, 75%) with a mean age of 52.33 ± 12.51 years (range 33–70 years). For every patient, we collected the following information: demographic data, presenting symptoms, date of symptom onset, hospitalization and diagnosis, potential causes of the thrombosis, treatment and response to treatment, duration of hospitalization, laboratory test results, and outcomes at the last available follow-up.

Radiologic evaluation

All 12 patients underwent contrast-enhanced CT scans within 3 days before interventional treatment and were diagnosed with ASMVT. Figure 1 shows contrast-enhanced CT images from a representative patient. The time from onset of initial symptoms to diagnosis was 2 days (range 1–4 days). Four patients were diagnosed at a local hospital, while the remaining eight were diagnosed at our institute.

### Transcatheter thrombolytic therapy for acute mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis [^a770fc25]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of transcatheter thrombolytic therapy in 20 patients with acute or subacute (symptoms < 40 days) portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis with severe symptoms, deteriorating clinical condition, and/or persistent symptoms despite anticoagulation.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective study examined 12 male patients and eight female patients seen over a period of 11 years. The average age was 37.6 years. Four of the patients had previously undergone liver transplantation. An anatomic classification system was established to describe the extent of thrombus at the time of diagnosis. Patients were treated with thrombolytic therapy via the transhepatic route, common femoral vein route, and/or superior mesenteric artery route. Improvement in symptoms, avoidance of bowel resection, complications, and radiographic evidence of clot resolution were the main clinical outcomes.

Results

Fifteen of the 20 patients exhibited some degree of lysis of the thrombus. Three patients had complete resolution, 12 had partial resolution, and five had no resolution. Eighty-five percent of patients (n = 17) had resolution of symptoms. Sixty percent of patients (n = 12) developed a major complication. No patients required bowel resection after thrombolytic therapy. One patient died with gastrointestinal hemorrhage and septic shock 2 weeks after thrombolytic therapy. Other major complications included bleeding and conditions requiring transfusion. No patients developed new portal or mesenteric thromboses. Two of the patients who received transplants eventually required repeat transplantation.

Conclusions

Transcatheter thrombolysis was beneficial in avoiding patient death, resolving thrombus, improving symptoms, and avoiding bowel resection. However, there was a high complication rate, indicating that this therapy should be reserved for patients with severe disease. Further evaluation of these techniques and outcomes should continue to be pursued.

### Endovascular management of acute superior mesenteric vein thrombosis: a retrospective study on thrombolysis outcomes [^d23ca98c]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-term outcome

After undergoing interventional treatment, 5 (41.7%) of these patients developed chronic portal vein occlusion, 4 (33.3%) had complete resolution of their PVT, and one (8.3%) patient experienced progression of the thrombosis. Clinically, all 12 patients exhibited symptom relief within 24 h of thrombectomy and thrombolysis treatment, primarily marked by a gradual reduction in abdominal pain and bloating. Among them, 12 patients achieved technical success, 6 patients achieved clinical success, and no recurrence of SMV thrombosis. The remaining 6 patients experienced continued thrombus growth, which prevented further symptom improvement and necessitated intestinal resection. Continuous clinical improvement was observed during the thrombolysis treatment via the SMV infusion catheter. The duration of hospital stay ranged from 6 to 60 days (average of 25.00 ± 14.75 days), with some patients undergoing surgical procedures for other reasons or experiencing extended hospital stays due to post-operative complications. During the follow-up period, all 12 patients were alive. All patients commenced long-term anticoagulation therapy with oral rivaroxaban for at least 6 months (ranging from 6–12 months) post-discharge, during which no repeat episodes of SMV thrombosis occurred.

### Percutaneous pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy of acute symptomatic superior mesenteric vein thrombosis [^47084b43]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the safety and the efficacy of percutaneous pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy (PPMT) of acute superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis.

Methods

A database of patients treated between 2011 and 2018 with acute venous mesenteric ischemia (VMI) was reviewed. VMI was diagnosed in the presence of SMV thrombosis and CT evidence of jejunal thickening. All patients presented with mild to moderate peritonism, which allowed surgery to be postponed. Initial treatment consisted of heparinization. PPMT was indicated in case of worsening abdominal pain despite anticoagulation and was performed via a transjugular or transhepatic approach, using a rotational aspiration thrombectomy catheter, followed by transcatheter thrombolysis. Clinical success was defined as symptoms resolution. Technical success was defined as patency of > 50% of SMV at venography and resolution of jejunal thickening. Patients were discharged on lifelong oral anticoagulation (INR 2.5–3.5). Follow-ups were performed using CT and color Doppler ultrasound.

Results

Population consisted of eight males, aged 37–81 (mean 56.5 years). Causes for thrombosis were investigated. Urokinase infusion time ranged from 48 to 72 h (3,840,000–5,760,000 IU). Clinical and technical success was obtained in all cases. One patient experienced bleeding from the superior epigastric artery and was treated with embolization. One patient died of multi-organ failure after 35 days, despite resolution of SMV thrombosis. In no case was surgery required after PPMT; mean hospitalization was 14.1 days (9–24). Mean follow-up of remaining seven patients was 37.7 months (12–84 months).

Conclusion

PPMT of acute SMV thrombosis seems safe and effective, with an 87.5% long-term survival rate and a 12.5% major complication rate.

Portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis in cirrhosis — initial treatment — We recommend anticoagulation for patients with (i) acute complete main PVT, (ii) MVT, or (iii) extension of portal venous thrombosis into mesenteric veins, and risk of bleeding must be weighed against benefits as, e.g., in patients with platelets < 50,000/μL, or hepatic encephalopathy at risk of falls (strong recommendation, low level of evidence).

### Mesenteric venous thrombosis [^8615f97e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This review explores the current literature on the natural history, diagnosis, and management of mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) in the modern era.

Methods

A review of the contemporary literature from 1997 to 2016 on MVT and its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment was performed.

Results

MVT is an insidious and lethal disease associated with acute mesenteric ischemia. The prevalence of MVT has increased sharply during the past two decades commensurate with an increase in radiographic imaging for abdominal complaints. The optimal treatment of and approach to MVT is controversial, given the poorly understood natural history of this rare disease. Both endovascular and open surgical strategies in addition to systemic anticoagulation have been used as adjuncts to treat MVT with limited success. Despite advances in treatment, mortality associated with MVT is still high. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that failure to recanalize the portomesenteric venous system leads to an increased risk for development of sequelae of portal hypertension.

Conclusions

MVT is a challenging disease to treat, given the difficulty in establishing a prompt initial diagnosis and the inability to reliably monitor patients for evidence of impending bowel infarction. Careful selection of patients for endovascular, open, or hybrid approaches is key to achieving improved outcomes. However, the paucity of prospective data and our evolving understanding of the natural history of MVT make consensus treatment strategies difficult to ascertain.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^21bc9d0b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis (PVT/MVT) treatment — Management of PVT and MVT revolves around use of anticoagulation and prevention of variceal bleeding. In the absence of hemodynamically significant bleeding, anticoagulation is initiated with infusions of unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous administration of LMWH, and initiation of anticoagulation is avoided in patients with active bleeding. Anticoagulation is maintained with oral anticoagulants or LMWH, and direct-acting oral anticoagulants offer promise in the treatment of PVT and MVT; however, there is limited experience with these agents.

### Mesenteric vein thrombosis… [^6355a0a3]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Mesenteric vein thrombosis is an abdominal emergency that is rarely diagnosed early. Review of the literature has shown that most cases have been treated by intestinal resection, a few by thrombectomy with or without resection. Three cases of mesenteric vein thrombosis were treated by resection, heparinization, and a second-look operation after 24 hours. When necessary, resection was carried out at the second surgical procedure followed by a third-look operation after 24 hours. After the last inspecting operation without further resection, full heparinization was continued and anticoagulation was ultimately maintained with warafin sodium for at least three months. The authors believe that optimal treatment for mesenteric vein thrombosis should include anticoagulation with heparin sodium and a mandatory second-look operation.

### Superior mesenteric vein thrombosis after colectomy in a patient with Crohn's disease [^37820c9d]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Background

An 18-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease presented in January 2004 with severe epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting of 4 hours' duration. The patient was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, thought to be consistent with ulcerative colitis, in March 2003, but had no medical history up until this point. Initial treatment with mesalamine was unsuccessful and she subsequently presented with medically resistant fulminant colitis and required an urgent colectomy in June 2003. Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on tapering doses of prednisone. In August 2003, an ileoscopy revealed inflamed, mildly ulcerated mucosa, and biopsies were consistent with Crohn's disease. Azathioprine was added to the treatment regimen and the patient tapered off prednisone. At this stage the patient continued to do well clinically up until presentation.

Investigations

Small bowel series, abdominal CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, exploratory laparotomy.

Diagnosis

Acute mesenteric ischemia secondary to superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.

Management

Resection of necrotic bowel, antibiotics and systemic anticoagulation.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^076b667f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis — initial and maintenance anticoagulation is outlined as follows: We recommend anticoagulation for noncirrhotic patients with acute symptomatic portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis in the absence of any contraindication (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). For duration, we suggest at least 6 months of anticoagulation when the etiology is reversible and indefinite anticoagulation in patients with thrombophilia (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). For initial therapy, we suggest either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) once a decision is made to initiate anticoagulation, considering the pros and cons of either approach (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). For maintenance, we suggest either LMWH or warfarin, noting limited experience with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), that some monitoring of therapy is recommended, and that tests can rule out substantial drug effect; pros and cons, including availability of reversal agents, should be considered (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

### Incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with LAPC and mesenteric vein thrombosis and current treatment paradigm… [^a07ab664]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract 714 Background: Mesenteric venous thrombosis, defined as complete occlusion of the Superior Mesenteric Vein or Main Portal Vein is often incidentally identified on CT or MRI in patients with Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer. There is very limited data describing the incidence and treatment of MVT in large studies in this patient population. Herein, we seek to establish the incidence of MVT and the treatment response in patients with LAPC. Methods: We conducted an analysis on 180 subjects with interpretable baseline imaging for MVT enrolled in the randomized Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial. Subjects who completed 4 Cycles of induction treatment prior to randomization were analyzed. Baseline and end of induction CT scans were read by a board-certified radiologist to determine presence of MVT.

Severe MVT was defined as complete occlusion of MPV and/or SMV. For patients who completed induction the end of induction CT was used to assess down staging of MVT. We analyzed the mean age between patients with and without MVT using a Mann-Whitney test and performed a contingency table with Pearson Chi-Square statistics to analyze tumor location. Out of 112 patients who completed induction, 60 presented with MVT at baseline. Seventeen of these patients demonstrated partial or complete resolution of MVT during induction; most resolved MVT after the first 2 cycles of chemotherapy. Only a minority of these patients were on anticoagulation therapy. Conclusions: Severe MVT is much more prevalent in patients with LAPC than previously reported. Anticoagulation is underutilized in this cohort; however, chemotherapy may have a beneficial effect in downstaging MVT beyond anticoagulation. Clinical trial information: NCT03257033.

### AASLD practice guidance on the use of TIPS, variceal embolization, and retrograde transvenous obliteration in the management of variceal hemorrhage [^1f61a671]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — presence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and TIPS — acute or chronic bland (noncancerous) PVT are not a contraindication to TIPS, and transhepatic or trans‑splenic approaches have proven useful in facilitating shunt creation, venous thrombectomy, and vascular recanalization; in PVT, 1‑year patency outcomes are high with 84% 1‑year TIPS stent patency and 78% 1‑year portal vein patency, while major complications occur in 10%, and TIPS failure/shunt dysfunction are affected by the degree of portal/superior mesenteric vein thrombosis and underlying thrombophilia; portal vein recanalization and TIPS may also improve candidacy for liver transplantation by restoring portal vein patency suitable for anastomosis and graft perfusion.

### Percutaneous transhepatic treatment of symptomatic mesenteric venous thrombosis [^0a0fd5c3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Three patients were seen with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis. With a transhepatic access, percutaneous pharmacologic thrombolysis was performed in one patient with extensive thrombosis of the portal and mesenteric veins, resulting in complete thrombolysis of the portal vein and partial thrombolysis of the superior mesenteric vein. In two patients with focal thrombosis, the use of mechanical devices achieved complete thrombolysis. Percutaneous thrombolysis of portal and mesenteric veins with a transhepatic approach, followed by coil embolization, is a promising endovascular technique for treatment of symptomatic acute mesenteric venous thrombosis.

Portal vein thrombosis

Increased levels of factor VIII (procoagulant driver) and decreased levels of protein C (anticoagulant driver), combined with reduced portal vein flow velocity and endothelial injury, increase the risk of portal vein thrombosis (PVT).

Many patients are asymptomatic; the diagnosis is often made on routine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance, or coincidentally during liver decompensation. However, PVT is independently associated with worsening decompensation, including variceal bleeding and with increased mortality in liver transplant candidates.

Initial diagnosis is made on Doppler US or CT imaging. MR/CT imaging should be performed to evaluate the extent of the thrombus and rule out neoplastic PVT/HCC. Consider screening for underlying thrombophilic conditions if there are extensive clots or other thromboses.

The management of PVT in cirrhosis is summarised in figure 2. Initial treatment is with anticoagulation, although treatment is not required in all cases. Chances of responding to anticoagulation are higher if treatment is started within 6 months of diagnosis. The recent Baveno VII guidelines recommend treatment in patients with cirrhosis and recent (< 6 months) PVT involving > 50% of the portal vein trunk lumen, any symptomatic PVT or PVT in potential liver transplant candidates. Treatment can also be considered if there is progression of thrombosis on early follow-up (1–3 months), or compromise of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV).

### Thrombolytic therapy for acute superior mesenteric artery occlusion [^717a9c80]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to evaluate thrombolytic therapy for acute superior mesenteric artery occlusion as an alternative or adjunctive treatment modality to surgical therapy and to provide current knowledge for timely and informed decisions regarding treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia. A systematic analysis of the available literature from 1966 to 2003 regarding thrombolytic therapy for superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism was performed. A total of 20 case reports and seven small series covered 48 patients with acute superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism. In the herein reviewed series, thrombolytic therapy of acute superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism resulted in angiographic resolution of the thromboembolism in 43 patients, in clinical success without requiring additional surgical intervention in 30 patients, and in survival in 43 patients, with similar complication rates as in thrombolytic treatment of peripheral vascular occlusions. Remission of abdominal pain during the first few hours of treatment formed the most important indicator of therapeutic success. Insufficient evidence from reviewed literature is available to determine the relative effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic treatment for acute superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism; however, initial results appear to be promising. Thrombolytic therapy can be effective relatively quickly, may obviate surgery, and has the potential to resolve the clot completely. In some cases it can be used as an alternative or neo-adjunctive treatment modality to surgery. A treatment guideline for thrombolysis of acute superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism should be developed.

### Percutaneous pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy of acute symptomatic superior mesenteric vein thrombosis [^30b81a47]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Reviewing the PubMed database, 30 reported cases of patients with acute SMV thrombosis who had undergone percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy were found (Table 3). In the 93.3% of cases, the procedure was technically successful, flow in the SMV was restored, and abdominal symptoms resolved.

Table 3
Previously published studies

UK urokinase, rt - PA recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, TA transarterial, TH transhepatic, TJ transjugular

Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, either alone or followed by local thrombolysis, was performed in those series using a TJ or a TH approach, in some cases combined with indirect transarterial thrombolytics infusion through the superior mesenteric artery. The transarterial approach is the least efficient because the thrombolytics are dispersed through the patent arterial branches, without direct vehiculation into the thrombosed vessels. The TIPS approach is invasive and technically challenging, especially in portal vein thrombosis, and it may cause dispersion of the drug into the systemic venous circle. The rationale of this approach is to create a low pressure system which provides a valid outflow for the recanalized vessels in the case of complete extensive thrombosis of the portomesenteric system. A transhepatic ultrasound-guided approach is less invasive, quicker to achieve for operators, even in the case of puncture of a thrombosed branch, and allows direct, maximized thrombolytic action within the thrombosed vessels. Nevertheless, it requires tract embolization at the end of the treatment, since a large diameter introducer is used (9–11 Fr). It was the first choice in this series for non-cirrhotic patients with patent portal branches representing a potential outflow for the recanalized SMV. In this study, tract embolization was performed using Onyx 34, which was chosen over coils because it allows hemostasis even during ongoing heparinization or thrombolytic therapy.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, mechanical aspiration thrombectomy, and direct thrombolysis in the treatment of acute portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis [^621e231a]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

A patient was admitted because of severe abdominal pain, anorexia, and intestinal bleeding. Contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography demonstrated acute portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis (PSMVT). The patient was treated percutaneously with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), mechanical aspiration thrombectomy, and direct thrombolysis, and 1 week after the procedure, complete patency of the portal and superior mesenteric veins was demonstrated. TIPS, mechanical aspiration thrombectomy, and direct thrombolysis together are promising endovascular techniques for the treatment of symptomatic acute PSMVT.

### Transcatheter thrombolysis combined with damage control surgery for treatment of acute mesenteric venous thrombosis associated with bowel necrosis: a retrospective study [^9feb0873]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Discussions

ASMVT is a rare but potentially catastrophic clinical complication that may lead to ischemia and/or infarction of the intestine. The mortality rate of acute mesenteric venous thrombosis is usually up to 50%. The exact pathophysiology of acute SMV thrombosis remains unclear. However, it has been associated with some risk factors for thrombophilia such as myeloproliferative disease, coagulation factor deficiency, factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation, portal hypertension, post-splenectomy, malignancy, intra-abdominal infection or inflammation, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, and so on.

Transcatheter thrombolysis is used to treat patients with ASMVT and bowel ischemia to achieve early recognition and mesenteric recanalization, and subsequently salvage the adjacent bowel with reversible ischemia. Operative intervention is reserved for patients with severe and diffuse peritonitis, and transmural bowel infarction. Damage control surgery is performed to remove the gangrenous bowel with minimum surgical stress, in order to accelerate recovery from acute illness before performing definitive surgery.

In the absence of clear indications for surgery, systemic anticoagulation therapy should be started as soon as possible. Interventional catheter thrombolysis may be more effective than systemic anticoagulation. For acute thrombosis, local thrombolytic therapy via a catheter introduced into the superior mesenteric vein or artery has all been shown to have gratifying results. The indirect and continuous infusion of fibrinolytic therapy through the SMA is effective, because it enables the thrombolytic agent to disperse from the capillaries and small venules, tertiary and secondary arcades before reaching the larger veins. Transarterial infusion can reduce the side effects of drugs such as bleeding, and avoid intraperitoneal and hepatic subcapsular bleedings that may result from the association of liver puncture and the use of fibrinolytic agents and heparin. Direct access to the portal system targets SMV thrombosis by a transjugular or transhepatic route, leading to rapid thrombus removal and venous flow re-establishment, and an improvement in symptoms. Compared to the indirect method, direct thrombolysis is more efficient, less time-consuming, and provides the opportunity to perform mechanical aspiration and balloon angioplasty with possible stent placement for elastic recoil or persistent stenosis.

### Pediatric hypereosinophilic syndrome associated with liver damage, portal vein, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein thromboses: a case report [^1368d155]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We described a pediatric case of HES complicated with liver damage and thromboses of the portal vein, the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein. The thrombi were recanalized and liver enzymes returned to normal after treatment with methylprednisolone succinate, low molecular weight heparin and antioxidants. This single case could facilitate early detection and intervention in patients with HES. Early recognition and management with steroids and anticoagulants is important to prevent serious complications like bowel ischemia. We recommend that anticoagulants, in cases of documented thrombosis, and corticosteroids should be used at an early stage.

### Successful treatment of extensive splanchnic arterial and portal vein thrombosis associated with ulcerative colitis [^0242aa77]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Venous and arterial thromboembolism is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Arterial thrombosis of the splanchnic region is a rare event with a very high mortality rate. Furthermore, it represents a challenging complication since it tends to be overlooked and misinterpreted as a clinical exacerbation of UC. We present the case of a 62-year-old female with pancolonic UC complicated by an extensive arterial thrombosis involving the aorta, the celiac trunk, the hepatic, gastric and splenic arteries and the superior mesenteric artery. A thrombosis of the splenic vein extending into the proximal portal vein was also present. The patient was successfully treated by a combined interventional-radiological and surgical treatment. We discuss the rationale behind our management of this case and review the literature on splanchnic arterial thrombosis associated with UC.

### Acute mesenteric ischemia [^12eb401c]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia is uncommon and always occurs in the setting of preexisting comorbidities. Mortality rates remain high. The 4 major types of acute mesenteric ischemia are acute superior mesenteric artery thromboembolic occlusion, mesenteric arterial thrombosis, mesenteric venous thrombosis, and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, including ischemic colitis. Delays in diagnosis are common and associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Prompt diagnosis requires attention to history and physical examination, a high index of suspicion, and early contract CT scanning. Selective use of nonoperative therapy has an important role in nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia of the small bowel and colon.

Thrombolytic technique

Before catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy, the risk of bleeding complications and benefits of catheter-directed thrombectomy and thrombolysis for acute SMV thrombosis were explained to each patient, and informed written consent was obtained. Thrombolytic therapy was used for patients with persistent or worsening abdominal pain despite systemic anticoagulation.

Contraindications to percutaneous thrombolysis included previous stroke, central nervous system malignancies, active bleeding diathesis, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. Direct portal vein (PV)-SMV thrombolysis was not performed in patients with unfavorable anatomy of the PV, marked atrophy of the liver, or portal venous cavernous transformation.

The route, thrombolytic agent, catheter type, length of treatment, other interventional techniques, and complications are shown in Table 1.

### Endovascular management of acute superior mesenteric vein thrombosis: a retrospective study on thrombolysis outcomes [^7a96edbf]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

After vascular access was established, 5000 IU of heparin was flushed into the portal venous system. A 5F, 120 cm multipurpose catheter was advanced through the thrombus into the distal SMV until collaterals were reached. A direct thrombolysis with 10 mg rt-PA was performed during catheter retraction. Rheolytic thrombectomy (AngioJet, Boston Scientific) was then performed using a 6F, 120 cm catheter (Solent Omni, Boston Scientific) over a 0.035-inch superstiff guidewire. The device was advanced and retracted through the SMV, its branches, and the splenic vein, if necessary, until a total thrombectomy volume of 250 mL was achieved. PTA was performed if blood flow restoration in the SMV was deemed inadequate, using MARS balloons (Boston Scientific) of varying diameters (6–10 mm), as measured based on the SMV diameter. A 4F, multi-side-hole infusion catheter (Uni-Fuse, Angiodynamics, Queensbury, NY, USA) with a treatment length of 10–30 cm was placed into the thrombosed SMV for catheter-directed thrombolysis and secured with the sheath sutured in place. The Checkflo sheath was left in place during thrombolysis to allow for potential re-intervention and to maintain vascular access for heparin infusion, while thrombolytic agents were administered via the infusion catheter. If required, two infusion catheters were deployed in different SMV branches or the splenic vein.

Thrombolytic therapy was administered through the catheter at a rate of 1 mg rt-PA per hour, with fibrinogen levels monitored every 4 h. If fibrinogen levels fell below 2 g/L, the dosage was reduced to 0.5 mg rt-PA per hour. SMV angiography was performed every 24 h through the infusion catheter to evaluate treatment progress. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging was conducted 2 days post-procedure, before catheter removal, and at discharge. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was discontinued when patients exhibited significant symptomatic improvement (e.g. resolution of abdominal pain, distension, and anorexia), were able to transition to oral anticoagulation, and/or follow-up angiography and CT confirmed complete or near-complete resolution of SMV thrombosis. During hospitalization, intravenous unfractionated heparin therapy was continued to maintain the APTT ratio between 2.0 and 2.5 times the control value, transitioning to long-term rivaroxaban upon discharge.

### Prospective study of the incidence and risk factors of postsplenectomy thrombosis of the portal, mesenteric, and splenic veins… [^d104750a]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

All patients who underwent therapeutic splenectomy or splenectomy as a part of any other procedure were considered eligible for the study and were initially enrolled. In total, 147 patients were enrolled but 1 was excluded due to early postoperative death. According to the fifth THRIFT consensus, low molecular weight heparin was prescribed preoperatively and postoperatively for a minimum of 7 days when mild or severe risk of deep vein thrombosis was evident. 4 In case of severe postsplenectomy thrombocytosis, aspirin, or dipyridamole was administered after postoperative day 7. When their administration was contradicted, LMWH was continued for 30 days or until discharge. When thrombosis of the portal system was diagnosed, therapy was administered according to the clinical evaluation and the ultrasound findings.

In cases of subclinical presentation or partial thrombosis with patent vessels, the patient was treated with long-term administration of therapeutic doses of LMWH. If the patient was symptomatic or a complete PST was identified, continuous heparin infusion was administered until the desired partial thromboplastine time was reached. Following treatment with heparin, patients began receiving coumadin orally for a minimum of 6 months. Early ligation of the splenic artery was of no significance. Preoperative and postoperative administration of LMWH did not have a clear protective effect on splachnic vein thrombosis. The mean ± SD maximum platelet count on postoperative day 7 was 608 ± 302 × 103/μL. In this study, the actual platelet count was the only risk factor definitely confirmed in multivariate analysis. A rise in the platelet count of more than 650 × 103/μL is directly associated with the development of PST.

It is therefore advisable to administer antiplatelet agents when severe thrombocytosis occurs postoperatively despite the surgeons' reluctance in their early use. Treatment of the postsplenectomy PST is not standardized. In principle, PST is treated as any thrombotic episode with heparin followed by coumarin for a period of 4 to 6 months. The use of LMWH in therapeutic doses is not clearly justified. 39 We used LMWH in the case of partial portal vein thrombosis, considering that the vessel was patent and the patient was asymptomatic.

### Percutaneous transhepatic angioJet-assisted mechanical thrombectomy for the treatment of post-transplant portal vein thrombosis: a case report [^17b87d16]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is an uncommon but serious complication after liver transplantation (LT). Treatments for PVT include thrombolysis, surgical treatment or percutaneous intervention. We here report a case of PVT after LT successfully treated by an AngioJet device using the percutaneous transhepatic approach. A 36-year-old male presented with substantial thrombosis of the portal vein/superior mesenteric vein 2 years after a liver transplant. He was managed with an Angiojet thrombectomy and subsequent stent placement. This approach may be a safe and effective treatment for PVT in post-orthotopic LT patients.

### Minimally invasive treatment for severe acute pancreatitis with superior mesenteric vein and common bile duct stenosis: a case report and review of the literature [^d9f9f0dc]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

There are devastating complications of AP, including pancreatic necrosis, portal hypertension, organ failure, leading to severe prognosis, even death. Extrahepatic portal venous system (PV, splenic vein, and SMV) stenosis, including thrombosis, embolism and occlusion, is more noticeable in chronic pancreatitis and rarely mentioned in AP. Only a retrospective study focusing on CT scans found the prevalence of SMV thrombosis was 14% in 100 AP patients and risk factors included formation of pseudocysts, alcoholic pancreatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis. Also, another study demonstrated that 13% of 832 patients with extrahepatic portal venous system thrombosis had pancreatitis (including acute and chronic pancreatitis). Moreover, there has been no standard program of prevention and treatment for AP with SMV stenosis.

In AP cases, causes of SMV stenosis include local inflammation, stasis, spasm, and mass effect from surrounding necrotic pancreas as well as direct damage of the venous wall by liberated enzymes. It is more prone to happen in SAP, especially SAP with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, because of more severe inflammation, damage to the vascular endothelium, and hypovolemia.

Mortality associated with acute SMV thrombosis is extremely high, at 20% to 50%. Incidence of SMV stenosis is positively correlated with the severity of pancreatitis. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to SMV stenosis in AP, especially regarding prevention and clinical treatment. On one hand, anticoagulation is considered to be the first choice. However, Gonzelez et alobserved that almost one third of patients had recanalization, regardless of whether they received systemic anticoagulation. The patient's acquired or inherited prothrombotic states is not related to the occurrence of extrahepatic portal venous system thrombosis. Whether early anticoagulation can prevent SMV stenosis in AP remains to be studied. On the other hand, debridement and drainage to remove pancreatic necrotic tissue can prevent further inflammation progression and stent implantation can help recanalization of SMV. However, there is no study on the systemic treatment about SMV stenosis in AP. In our case, we used total minimally invasive therapy, including laparoscopic-assisted debridement of pancreatic necrotic tissue and implantation of endovascular stent in SMV stenosis. The prognosis of the patient is currently good. Limited by the number of cases, systemic treatment of AP-associated SMV stenosis remains to be further studied.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^debb492f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Acute mesenteric vein thrombosis — anticoagulation outcomes and adjunctive therapies are summarized: In a systematic review of noncirrhotic acute MVT, 68% received anticoagulation among 80 patients, and mild to moderate self-limited bleeding occurred in 10 cases. Of 50 patients with follow-up imaging, 50% developed long-term sequelae of portal hypertension over a median follow-up of about 2 years. Anticoagulation is given for a finite duration of 3–6 months for reversible etiologies, while indefinite anticoagulation is required for inherited or acquired thrombophilia. In an observational series using streptokinase thrombolysis, treatment was successful in 19 cases and was associated with bleeding in 6 cases without need for major intervention. When intestinal infarction or gangrene is suspected or confirmed, patients are treated with surgical resection, and second-look laparotomy is often required in extensive infarction.

### Acute thrombosis of the splanchnic veins… [^329e01a0]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The consequence of an acute thrombosis in the splanchnic veins on the viability of the intestine has not been well defined in the literature. Spontaneous recovery or total necrosis of the bowel have both been described. We treated seven patients with thrombosis of the splanchnic veins and adopted a surgical approach in three patients with extended and complete thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein, portal vein, and splenic vein, while four patients with partial thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein or portal vein recovered with conservative treatment. A 22-year literature review has identified 64 cases of acute thrombosis in the splanchnic veins, with complete information regarding the location and extent of the thrombosis, the treatment, and the outcome. Different anatomical patterns of thrombosis with mortality rates varying between 0% and 76% seem to be related to the extent and completeness of venous obstruction.

### Septic thrombophlebitis of the superior mesenteric vein and multiple liver abscesses in a patient with Crohn's disease at onset [^4122fc50]. BMC Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Portal-mesenteric vein thrombosis, pylephlebitis and liver abscesses are rare complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The purpose of this case report is to relate an unusual presentation of CD in order to show how conservative treatment could be an appropriate option as a bridge to the surgery, in patients with septic thrombophlebitis and multiple liver abscesses with CD.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 25-year-old man with Crohn's disease (CD) who developed a superior mesenteric venous thrombosis, multiple liver abscesses and pylephlebitis, diagnosed through abdominal ultrasound and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. The patient was successfully treated with conservative treatment consisting of intravenous antibiotics, subcutaneous anticoagulation and percutaneous catheter drainage of liver abscesses.

Conclusion

We reported an unnusual case of pylephlebitis in CD. Until now this association has not been reported in adult patients at onset. We hypothesise that the infection developed as a result of mucosal disease and predisposed by corticoid therapy. Adequated management was discussed.

### Percutaneous pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy of acute symptomatic superior mesenteric vein thrombosis [^10de5a17]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Complications

One patient developed an abdominal wall hematoma after 48 h of local thrombolysis and underwent CT, which revealed the presence of active bleeding fed from the superior left epigastric artery. Thrombolysis was suspended, and the bleeding was successfully treated via a transfemoral catheterization and a superselective embolization with Onyx.

One patient died of multi-organ failure (MOF) 35 days after treatment. This patient had initially undergone surgery because of bowel necrosis present at the onset with severe peritonism, sustained by portomesenteric thrombosis. However, 3 days after resection, there was a recurrence of mesenteric ischemia due to a distal extension of the SMV thrombosis. In order to avoid surgical reintervention, PPMT was performed via a TIPS creation because of the presence of an extensive portomesenteric thrombosis. After 48 h of thrombolysis, complete symptom resolution was obtained. After 6 days of well-being, the patient developed a fever caused by fluid collection. A drainage was put into place, and the patient was put on antibiotic therapy. After 18 days, despite resolution of the collection, MOF occurred and the patient died (Table 2).

### Minimally invasive treatment for severe acute pancreatitis with superior mesenteric vein and common bile duct stenosis: a case report and review of the literature [^178b0210]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas and the annual incidence ranges from 13 to 45 per 100,000 population. Complications of AP include pancreatic necrosis, fluid collection, organ failure, and so on. Portal hypertension, a complication of pancreatitis, gives rise to esophagogastric varices which may lead to fatal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. It is commonly reported in chronic pancreatitis cases where it is mainly caused by splenic vein thrombosis or occlusion. However, in AP cases, portal hypertension resulted from superior mesenteric vein (SMV) stenosis is rarely concerned and there has been no report about the systemic treatment. Here, we address a case of SMV stenosis in a patient of AP with total minimally invasive treatment, including laparoscopic surgery and stent implantation.

### Percutaneous pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy of acute symptomatic superior mesenteric vein thrombosis [^736c64f3]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The study population consisted of eight males, aged 37–81 (mean 56.5 years). All patients complained of severe abdominal pain; two patients were also suffering from nausea and three from abdominal distension. CT was repeated after completion of the treatment in order to assess bowel wall status and confirm venous patency. Etiology and causes of thrombosis were investigated in all patients (see Table 1). There were no contraindications to thrombolysis. Urokinase infusions ranged from a minimum period of 48 h to a maximum of 72 h, with dosages ranging from 3,840,000 to 5,760,000 IU. Acute SMV thrombosis was associated with portal vein thrombosis in seven out of eight cases. Different grades of portal thrombosis involvement were observed: in six cases, both the main portal trunk and the intrahepatic portal branches were affected, while in one case the right portal branch and the main portal trunk were involved. In all the cases of extensive portomesenteric thrombosis, a cavernomatous transformation was already present at the initial CT. The splenic vein was also affected in three out of seven patients, with CT findings of asymptomatic partial splenic infarction in one case.

### Aneurysm of superior mesenteric vein: case report with 5-year follow-up and review of the literature [^36feec6a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Venous aneurysms are less common than arterial aneurysms in clinical practice, and the occurrence of isolated cases is a topic for publication. Aneurysms of the superior mesenteric vein are rare, and their origin is unknown. Many aneurysms are asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is established from radiologic findings. Others are diagnosed after complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or thrombosis with associated abdominal pain. Because of the rarity of this disease and consequent absence of standard treatment, therapy must be adapted to fit each case. We present a case report of an aneurysm of the superior mesenteric vein. The diagnosis of this anomaly was made after investigation of abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated the mass. Clinical treatment was administered, and no aneurysm growth was observed after 5 years of follow-up.

### Endovascular management of acute superior mesenteric vein thrombosis: a retrospective study on thrombolysis outcomes [^989fe576]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Technical success

In this study, 12 patients successfully underwent thrombus aspiration of the SMV using the rheolytic thrombectomy system, combined catheter-directed continuous infusion thrombolysis with rt-PA and expansion PTA balloon dilation, thereby restoring the main flow of the SMV. Following this procedure, a catheter was left in place in the SMV to continue thrombolysis treatment for a duration of 1 to 5 days (average of 2.75 ± 1.14 days), with an average total dose of rt-PA infusion being 61.25 ± 18.48 mg (ranging from 40–80 mg). The duration of the rt-PA infusion is detailed in Table 2. After the completion of the rt-PA, six (50%) patients showed significant improvement, achieving at least a 50% reduction in the filling of the SMV, as confirmed by repeated angiography. However, two (16.7%) patients experienced an increase in thrombus post-intervention, leading to worsening symptoms and eventually, intestinal necrosis, necessitating exploratory laparotomy and bowel resection. Additionally, ascites detected in five (41.7%) patients before treatment had resolved by the time of discharge. Regarding additional treatments, two patients underwent TIPS stent placement.

Complications

Regarding complications, none of the patients experienced complications at the puncture site or percutaneous liver puncture site (such as bleeding, hematoma, or leakage) during the rt-PA infusion through the catheter. During the thrombolysis treatment period, one (8.3%) patient experienced minor nostril bleeding, which was minimal and quickly ceased without interrupting the thrombolysis treatment. Among the nine patients who underwent TI approach to access the SMV, two (16.7%) suffered from hepatic artery injury leading to hemorrhage, and one (9.1%) patient developed a hepatic arteriovenous fistula. All of them were timely managed with transcatheter arterial embolization, with follow-up CT scans confirming the occlusion of vascular lesions without further complications. One (8.3%) patient developed melena during thrombolytic therapy, which resolved after discontinuing the therapy, and one (8.3%) patient suffered hepatic vein bleeding.

### Transradial approach for transcatheter selective superior mesenteric artery urokinase infusion therapy in patients with acute extensive portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis [^eb672d1b]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this investigation was to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of transradial approach for transcatheter superior mesenteric artery (SMA) urokinase infusion therapy in patients with acute extensive portal and superior mesenteric venous thrombosis. During a period of 7 years, 16 patients with acute extensive thrombosis of the portal (PV) and superior mesenteric veins (SMV) were treated by transcatheter selective SMA urokinase infusion therapy by way of the radial artery. The mean age of the patients was 39.5 years. Through the radial sheath, a 5F Cobra catheter was inserted into the SMA, and continuous infusion of urokinase was performed for 5–11 days (7.1 ± 2.5 days). Adequate anticoagulation was given during treatment, throughout hospitalization, and after discharge. Technical success was achieved in all 16 patients. Substantial clinical improvement was seen in these 16 patients after the procedure. Minor complications at the radial puncture site were observed in 5 patients, but trans-SMA infusion therapy was not interrupted. Follow-up computed tomography scan before discharge demonstrated nearly complete disappearance of PV-SMV thrombosis in 9 patients and partial recanalization of PV-SMV thrombosis in 7 patients. The 16 patients were discharged 9–19 days (12 ± 6.0 days) after admission. Mean duration of follow-up after hospital discharge was 44 ± 18.5 months, and no recurrent episodes of PV-SMV thrombosis developed during that time period. Transradial approach for transcatheter selective SMA urokinase infusion therapy in addition to anticoagulation is a safe and effective therapy for the management of patients with acute extensive PV-SMV thrombosis.

### Improved prognosis and low failure rate with anticoagulation as first-line therapy in mesenteric venous thrombosis [^00c22640]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Within the spectrum of patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, it is difficult to delineate those with mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT). MVT is a rare but life-threatening condition which without treatment can develop into bowel ischemia, bowel gangrene, peritonitis, and death. Main causes of MVT are coagulation disorders, abdominal inflammatory conditions, malignancies, and liver diseases. Currently available investigations fail to identify a causal factor in about 20% of patients. Improved diagnostic workup with computed tomography (CT) may possibly lead to increased detection rates and earlier diagnosis of MVT. Immediate anticoagulation therapy after diagnosis has been proposed as the first-line treatment option.

To prospective study, MVT is challenging due to the low incidence of the condition, and large cohort studies would provide a valuable insight into the optimal management. This retrospective study was designed to evaluate prognostic factors and trends in prognosis over time in a large cohort of patients with MVT. Secondary aims were to evaluate the failure rate with anticoagulation as monotherapy, to identify when failures occurred, and when bowel resection was needed.

### Correlation between white blood cell count and intestinal resection in patients with acute mesenteric vein thrombosis [^87817832]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main function of the mesenteric vein is to transport nutrients via small intestine absorption, belonging to the mixed blood. Once there is a mesenteric vein thrombosis, not only is the transportation function damaged, but the patient will also have different degrees of intestinal ischaemia. However, due to the superior mesenteric artery and branch blood vessels that supply the higher intestine, patients with intestinal ischaemia have a longer compensatory time. Therefore, the onset of this disease in patients occurs insidiously, and because this disease has the same initial symptoms as other causes of acute abdomen, this condition is often ignored by the first doctor that the patient sees or is even even misdiagnosed, resulting in treatment and diagnostic delay and even death.

At present, overall mesenteric vein thrombosis disease is rare because less than 10% of cases are caused by mesenteric vein thrombosis. The occurrence of intestinal ischaemia in patients with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis requiring emergency surgery mainly lies in whether patients experience peritoneal irritation, circulating shock, and bloody ascites. These three aspects, to a certain extent, determine whether patients need surgical treatment after admission. However, no specific biomarkers have been widely used in clinical practice to reflect patients' systemic inflammation, liver function, kidney function and other biomarkers. This study included 8 years of well-documented clinical data from grade III, GRADE A hospitals and concluded that white blood cell count was an independent risk factor for emergency enterectomy in patients with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis. This feature may have some practical value in future emergency surgical interventions. Thirty-seven of the 42 patients who underwent bowel resection had white blood cell counts above the optimal threshold.
