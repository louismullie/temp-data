## Question

Can terbinafine be used to treat Kaposi sarcoma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether terbinafine can be used to treat Kaposi sarcoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what terbinafine does pharmacologically and what it is actually approved to treat. Then, I should review Kaposi sarcoma biology and current evidence-based treatments. Next, I will check authoritative guidelines to see if terbinafine appears anywhere for KS care. After that, I need to consider any plausible mechanistic rationale for terbinafine against KS. I should also ensure there isn't a drug-name mix-up with agents actually used in KS. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded answer with appropriate guidance and safety considerations [^117F8mk1] [^113Rgwco].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and labeled uses of terbinafine. Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal that inhibits the fungal squalene epoxidase enzyme, disrupting ergosterol synthesis and leading to fungal cell death; its approved uses are for dermatophyte infections such as onychomycosis with tablets and tinea corporis/cruris/versicolor with topical formulations, and there is no described antitumor or antiviral activity in the FDA labeling or microbiology sections; wait, let me verify… yes, the FDA monographs consistently limit its activity to fungi without any oncologic indications [^113GhdeJ] [^112VL6ed] [^117F8mk1] [^1121YbzD].

> Next, I should review Kaposi sarcoma pathogenesis and standard treatments to anchor what therapies make sense. KS is a malignant angioproliferative tumor driven by HHV‑8 (KSHV) in the setting of immune dysregulation; care focuses on immune restoration in HIV, first‑line cytotoxics such as liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel, sirolimus in transplant-associated KS, local modalities including radiation and topical alitretinoin, and selected immunotherapies such as PD‑1 blockade in appropriate settings; hold on, I should confirm guideline concordance… the NCCN and BHIVA recommendations and contemporary data align with these approaches [^113Rgwco] [^113LQLDJ] [^114BgCRf] [^117AUyWa] [^115uF4nn].

> I will now examine whether any guideline or evidence base mentions terbinafine for KS. I need to check the NCCN panels across first‑line and subsequent systemic therapy, BHIVA guidance, and systematic reviews; wait, let me double-check the therapy tables… there are multiple chemotherapy, targeted, immunomodulatory, and checkpoint options listed, but there are zero entries for terbinafine, and no randomized or observational KS data include it as an antitumor agent or antiviral strategy against HHV‑8 [^113Rgwco] [^114BgCRf] [^113uVh91] [^111s54ET].

> But wait, what if there were a mechanistic rationale I am overlooking? KS pathogenesis involves HHV‑8 latent and lytic gene products such as vGPCR, pro‑angiogenic signaling including VEGF, and mTOR pathway activation; agents that impact these axes or restore immunity show activity, whereas terbinafine's target is a fungal enzyme without relevance to mammalian signaling or HHV‑8 biology; I should confirm there's no cross‑talk with angiogenesis or mTOR… I find none described for terbinafine, which supports the lack of plausibility for KS efficacy [^111f9r9D] [^112uSf7H] [^111VGoJf] [^113GhdeJ].

> Hold on, I should verify there isn't a name confusion driving this question. Sirolimus (rapamycin) is used in transplant‑associated KS for its mTOR inhibition and antiangiogenic effects, whereas terbinafine is an antifungal; these are entirely distinct agents with no therapeutic overlap in KS; I need to ensure the guidance explicitly references sirolimus in the appropriate context, which it does [^113LQLDJ] [^112kMYRn].

> Let me consider safety, because even off‑label use would need a favorable risk‑benefit profile. Systemic terbinafine carries hepatic risk and rare hematologic toxicities, and dosing concerns in renal impairment are noted; in the absence of any KS benefit signal, exposing patients to these risks is not justified; I should double‑check the label warnings and dosing caveats, which confirm these concerns [^117F8mk1] [^112mSCM4] [^1111reCe].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the clinical recommendation is clear and evidence‑based. No, terbinafine cannot be used to treat Kaposi sarcoma — there is no guideline support, no clinical evidence, and no mechanistic rationale; evidence‑based management should follow established pathways: optimize immune function and ART when applicable, use liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel for systemic disease, consider sirolimus in transplant‑associated KS, apply local therapies including radiation or topical alitretinoin for cutaneous disease, and consider checkpoint inhibitors in selected settings under specialist guidance [^113Rgwco] [^113LQLDJ] [^114BgCRf] [^117AUyWa].

---

Terbinafine is **not effective** for Kaposi sarcoma (KS) because it is an antifungal that targets ergosterol synthesis [^113GhdeJ], a pathway absent in KS [^111VGoJf]. There is **no clinical evidence** or guideline support for terbinafine in KS [^113Rgwco], and standard care remains antiretroviral therapy [^112mY8xD] plus liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel for advanced disease [^113LQLDJ]. Terbinafine should not be used for KS, and patients should receive established therapies [^114BgCRf].

---

## Mechanism of action of terbinafine

Terbinafine inhibits squalene epoxidase [^112VL6ed], blocking ergosterol synthesis [^113GhdeJ] and causing fungal cell death via squalene accumulation and membrane disruption. This **fungal-specific mechanism does not apply to KS**, a vascular tumor driven by HHV-8–infected endothelial cells [^111VGoJf].

---

## Pathogenesis of Kaposi sarcoma

KS is an HHV-8–driven angioproliferative tumor [^111VGoJf], with lesions driven by viral oncogenes, angiogenesis, and immune dysregulation [^117F5zWW]. Its pathogenesis is **viral and angiogenic**, not fungal; therefore, terbinafine's mechanism is irrelevant [^113GhdeJ].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding terbinafine in Kaposi sarcoma

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting terbinafine for KS [^113Rgwco]: no trials or case reports demonstrate efficacy, and no guidelines recommend its use [^114BgCRf] [^1121YbzD].

---

## Current standard treatments for Kaposi sarcoma

Standard KS care is guided by disease extent, symptoms, and immune status [^113uCjcQ]:

- **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)**: Essential for HIV-associated KS [^113Rgwco]; immune restoration alone can induce remission [^114Lgrs4].
- **Systemic chemotherapy**: Liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel for advanced or symptomatic disease [^113LQLDJ] [^11222PRL].
- **Local therapies**: Radiation, intralesional vinblastine [^113eBcuh], or topical agents for limited cutaneous disease [^113PzhLy].
- **Immunomodulatory agents**: Sirolimus for transplant-associated KS [^112kMYRn]; thalidomide or lenalidomide in select cases [^113xy9NK].

These therapies are **evidence-based** and recommended by NCCN and BHIVA [^113Rgwco] [^114BgCRf].

---

## Safety profile and potential risks of terbinafine

Terbinafine has a well-characterized safety profile, including [^117F8mk1] [^116jzyqW]:

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevated liver enzymes and rare severe liver injury.
- **Hematologic effects**: Rare neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia [^112mSCM4].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Rare severe reactions, including anaphylaxis [^112mSCM4].

These risks are **unjustified** in KS given the lack of benefit [^1121YbzD].

---

## Expert opinions and clinical guidelines

There is **no support** from experts or guidelines for terbinafine in KS [^114BgCRf]; NCCN and BHIVA recommend ART, chemotherapy, and immunomodulators [^113LQLDJ], with no mention of terbinafine [^113Rgwco].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Terbinafine is **not effective** for KS due to its fungal-specific mechanism [^113GhdeJ] and lack of evidence. Care should follow established guidelines — ART, chemotherapy, and immunomodulators as appropriate — and avoid terbinafine; patients should receive **evidence-based** therapies [^113Rgwco].

In the management of Kaposi sarcoma according to the NCCN 2019 guidelines, medical management specifically addresses advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal Kaposi sarcoma. It is recommended to provide medical optimization and consider offering radiation therapy for patients not immediately eligible for systemic therapy, while continuing or initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. Systemic therapy is preferred over radiation therapy as first-line therapy and relapsed/refractory therapy for disseminated disease whenever systemic therapy is feasible.

Although uncommon, performance status and medical comorbidities may sometimes preclude the use of upfront chemotherapy. It is essential to address reversible medical issues, such as active infections requiring antibiotic or antiviral treatment or high-level HIV viremia requiring initiation or modification of antiretroviral therapy, to facilitate the prompt delivery of systemic therapy. Consider systemic therapy if poor performance status is due to Kaposi sarcoma, as it may result in an improvement in the patient's performance status.

### An unusual series of patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^111YVHXt]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma (KS) secondary to treatment-induced immunosuppression typically presents similarly to classical KS. It is quite rare in the West, with an incidence of less than 1% overall but up to 4% in Eastern European countries. The risk of iatrogenic KS is correlated to the length of time on immunosuppressive therapy, with a mean onset to lesions of 16 months. Iatrogenic KS will generally resolve completely upon cessation of immunosuppressive therapy, but the benefits of discontinuing immunosuppressive therapy must be balanced against risks such as transplant rejection.

AIDS-related epidemic KS affects HIV patients who have CD4+ T-cell counts of less than 500 cells/mm³. The lesions of epidemic KS can be disfiguringly found on the face and often involve the visceral organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, bones, and lungs. Because of increased visceral involvement with epidemic KS, its prognosis is poor. However, the incidence and severity of epidemic KS have dramatically decreased from a standardized incidence ratio of 22,100 to 3,640 compared with the general population after the advent of antiretroviral therapy.

Non-epidemic KS is a rare, recently identified subtype of KS found in HIV-negative men who engage in sex with other men. This subtype has been hypothesized to be related to the high prevalence of HHV-8 in semen and prostate samples.

Our patients do not clearly fit into any of the existing subtypes of KS. None have HIV, are taking immunosuppressive drugs, are from Africa, nor are engaging in high-risk sexual behavior. They share no risk factors outside the general population.

### The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus G protein-coupled receptor as a therapeutic target for the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma [^111f9r9D]. Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) that has been implicated in the initiation of Kaposi's sarcoma, identifying vGPCR as an attractive target for preventing Kaposi's sarcoma. However, as only a fraction of cells in advanced Kaposi's sarcoma lesions express vGPCR, it is unclear whether this unique viral oncogene contributes to Kaposi's sarcoma progression. We therefore set out to determine whether the few cells that express vGPCR in established tumors represent an appropriate therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with preexisting Kaposi's sarcoma.

To this end, we generated endothelial cell lines stably expressing vGPCR or key KSHV latently expressed proteins (vCyclin, vFlip, and LANA1). The endothelial cell line expressing vGPCR was rendered sensitive to treatment with the nucleoside analogue ganciclovir by using a bicistronic construct coexpressing the herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase. Subcutaneous injection into nude mice with mixed-cell populations formed tumors that approximate the ratio of vGPCR-expressing and KSHV latent gene-expressing cells. These mice were then treated with ganciclovir to specifically target only the vGPCR-expressing cells. Surprisingly, despite the expression of KSHV latent genes in the vast majority of tumor cells, specifically targeting only the few vGPCR-expressing cells in established tumors resulted in tumor regression. Moreover, we observed an increase in apoptosis of latent gene-expressing cells after the pharmacologic deletion of the vGPCR-expressing cells. These findings…

### Terbinafine [^113GhdeJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Microbiology**: Terbinafine, an allylamine antifungal, inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, by inhibiting the squalene epoxidase enzyme. This results in fungal cell death primarily due to increased membrane permeability, mediated by the accumulation of high concentrations of squalene, rather than due to ergosterol deficiency. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species tested in vitro, terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown.

Terbinafine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: *Trichophyton mentagrophytes* and *Trichophyton rubrum*.

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. In vitro, terbinafine exhibits satisfactory minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most strains of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and efficacy of terbinafine in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: *Candida albicans*, *Epidermophyton floccosum*, and *Scopulariopsis brevicaulis*.

### Modern approach to manage patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^113LWseq]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a malignancy associated with Kaposi's sarcoma‐associated herpesvirus (KSHV), primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV or those receiving immunosuppressive treatments. Immunocompetent individuals may also be affected, illustrating the disease's heterogeneity. KS manifests in different forms — classic, endemic, epidemic, iatrogenic, and in men having sex with men — each with distinct clinical features depending on immune status and geographic area of origin. Although advances in treatment have improved disease control, effective management remains a challenge.

This review focuses on the comprehensive approach to investigating and treating KS. It highlights the role of histology, immunohistochemistry, and staging in diagnosing KS and assessing disease extension, together with other KSHV diseases (multicentric Castelman disease, primary effusion lymphoma, and KS inflammatory cytokine syndrome).

- **Treatment strategies**: Restoration of immunity in immunocompromised patients is emphasized, alongside conventional local therapies and chemotherapy options like liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel for aggressive and extensive forms. Promising emerging therapies, including immunomodulatory agents, antiangiogenic therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors, are also explored.

The review emphasizes the importance of personalized treatment based on the patient's underlying condition and KS subtype. It provides an in-depth look at the pathogenesis, diagnostic methods, and evolving therapeutic approaches, offering valuable insights.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116yitFd]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, particularly in the context of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, the 2019 NCCN guidelines emphasize recognizing that the clinical manifestations of this syndrome may include the development of new lesions or enlargement of existing lesions, worsening lymphadenopathy, or worsening edema. It is important to understand that the clinical presentation of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome can be challenging to distinguish from the natural history of progressive disease. If immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is suspected, consultation with an HIV specialist is recommended.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for Kaposi sarcoma, specifically concerning radiation therapy, the NCCN 2019 guidelines suggest offering radiation therapy to plantar and palmar surfaces in selected cases. However, it is advised to approach high doses with caution due to theoretical toxicity concerns, such as long-term wound healing issues, particularly in the presence of coexisting lymphedema.

### Clinical outcome features of non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma and the role of wide excision on survival: A retrospective cohort study [^111DuVtf]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Skin lesions in Kaposi's sarcoma typically manifest as painless macules with a purple hue. Non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma is primarily associated with HHV8 infection, particularly in individuals with immunocompromised status. Apart from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, other types include classic (sporadic), endemic (African), and iatrogenic (immunosuppression-related) types, which are relatively uncommon in clinical practice.

Regarding treatment protocols outlined in the literature, therapies for HIV-positive cases adhere to standard rules and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Treatment approaches for Kaposi's sarcoma vary based on lesion classification. For asymptomatic limited cutaneous lesions, observation along with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended initially, whereas symptomatic limited cutaneous lesions may require ART combined with topicals, systemic therapy, intralesional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or local excision. Advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal lesions may necessitate ART along with radiotherapy, systemic therapy, or participation in clinical trials. However, no standardized treatment protocol has been established for non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma.

In general, elective surgery becomes an option when localized skin lesions become problematic and surgical intervention is feasible. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the outcomes in patients with non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma treated surgically to identify meaningful disparities in surgery-related treatment outcomes.

### Treatment of severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-infected adults [^111s54ET]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma remains the most common cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa and the second most common cancer in HIV-infected patients worldwide. Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), there has been a decline in its incidence. However, Kaposi's sarcoma continues to be diagnosed in HIV-infected patients.
- **Objectives**: To assess the added advantage of chemotherapy plus HAART compared to HAART alone, and the advantages of different chemotherapy regimens in HAART and HAART-naive HIV-infected adults with severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma.
- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, GATEWAY, the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the US National Institutes of Health's ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials and the Aegis archive of HIV/AIDS for conference abstracts. An updated search was conducted in July 2014.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials and observational studies evaluating the effects of any chemotherapeutic regimen in combination with HAART compared to HAART alone, chemotherapy versus HAART, and comparisons between different chemotherapy regimens.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed the studies independently and extracted outcome data. We used the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) as the measure of effect. We did not conduct a meta-analysis as none of the included trials assessed identical chemotherapy regimens.
- **Main results**: We included six randomised trials and three observational studies involving 792 HIV-infected patients.

Prior to administering terbinafine, it is critical to evaluate patients for evidence of chronic or active liver disease [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
- **Dosage and administration**:
	- **Fingernail onychomycosis**: One 250 mg tablet, once daily for 6 weeks.
	- **Toenail onychomycosis**: One 250 mg tablet, once daily for 12 weeks.

The optimal clinical effect is observed several months after achieving mycological cure and cessation of treatment. This delay is due to the time required for the outgrowth of a healthy nail.

### Treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-1 infected individuals with emphasis on resource poor settings [^11222PRL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

In many countries, Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common malignancy among individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) and is a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality.
- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic regimens for the treatment of HIV-associated KS, focusing on options that may be available in resource-poor settings.
- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group trials register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, CINAHL, CANCER LIT, AIDSDRUGS, AIDSTRIALS, African Index Medicus, physicians' data query protocols, and the United Kingdom Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research Register of Cancer Trials. Additionally, we reviewed proceedings and abstracts from AIDS and cancer conferences. The search was conducted between 1st October 2001 and completed on 14th December 2002. We also contacted experts in the field of cancer.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials of therapy for KS in HIV infected adults were included in the review.
- **Data collection and analysis**: All reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. We also contacted study authors for additional information.
- **Main results**: Five trials involving 915 people were included. Two trials involving 499 people compared pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) to a standard regimen among patients with advanced KS and were analyzed together. There was no difference in mortality between the two regimens (RR 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.91). The response to PLD was superior to that of the control regimen.

### Pomalyst [^113pu8nf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The clinical trial 12-C-0047 (NCT01495598) was an open-label, single-center, single-arm clinical study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of POMALYST in patients with Kaposi sarcoma (KS). A total of 28 patients (18 HIV-positive, 10 HIV-negative) received POMALYST 5 mg orally once daily on Days 1 through 21 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All HIV-positive patients continued highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The trial excluded patients with symptomatic pulmonary or visceral KS, history of venous or arterial thromboembolism, or procoagulant disorders. Patients received thromboprophylaxis with aspirin 81 mg once daily throughout therapy.

The median age was 52.5 years; all participants were male, 75% were White, and 14% were Black or African American. Seventy-five percent of patients had advanced disease (T1) at the time of enrollment, 11% had ≥ 50 lesions, and 75% had received prior chemotherapy.

The major efficacy outcome measure was the overall response rate (ORR), which included complete response (CR), clinical complete response (cCR), and partial response (PR). Response was assessed by the investigator according to the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) Oncology Committee response criteria for KS. The median time to first response was 1.8 months (0.9 to 7.6).

### Molecularly targeted therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma in a kidney transplant patient: Case report, "what worked and what did not" [^112uSf7H]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Imatinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for which there is limited information regarding its effects on AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and none in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used for kidney transplants, exhibits antiangiogenic activity related to impaired production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); clinical benefit has been reported in Kaposi's sarcoma associated with renal grafts.
- **Case presentation**: Here we report a case of an 80-year-old male who developed Kaposi's sarcoma nine months after receiving a living non-related donor kidney transplant at age 74. Three years after treatment with different chemotherapeutic agents for progressive cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma with no visceral involvement, he was prescribed Imatinib (200 mg/day for two weeks followed by 400 mg/day). After four weeks of treatment, he developed anasarca, further progression of Kaposi's sarcoma, and agranulocytosis. Imatinib was discontinued, and there was significant clinical recovery. One year later, his immunosuppressive therapy was changed to Sirolimus, and regression of the Kaposi's sarcoma occurred.
- **Conclusion**: The lack of benefit and severe toxicity associated with the use of Imatinib in this patient should alert clinicians of potential adverse consequences of its use in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. On the other hand, the positive response seen in this patient to Sirolimus, even following a long evolution of Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple chemotherapy regimens, and extensive cutaneous disease, further suggests its therapeutic potential.

### Exploring the interplay between Kaposi's sarcoma and SARS-CoV-2 infection: A case series and systematic review [^113T7ipu]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an angio-proliferative disease with a viral etiology and a multifactorial pathogenesis that results from immune dysfunction. In patients affected by latent viral infections such as herpesviruses, SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in lytic cycle reactivation in host cells. A robust immune system response is crucial for eliminating pathogens and resolving both latent and non-latent viral infections.

We report a case series of KS characterized by tumor progression after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a systematic literature review of the PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The keyword terms included "SARS-CoV-2", "HHV-8", "Kaposi's sarcoma", "IL-6", and "COVID-19". An English language restriction was applied, and items not covered by our study were excluded.

KS is a complex disease linked to an impaired immune system. Conditions that result in temporary or permanent immunodeficiency can trigger viral reactivation or exacerbate an existing disease. It is feasible that the increase in cytokine levels in COVID-19 patients, coupled with lymphocyte downregulation and treatment that induces herpesvirus lytic reactivation, may contribute to the progression of KS after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

These observations suggest that patients with KS should be clinically monitored both during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, prospective data should be collected to validate this hypothesis and enhance our understanding of the mechanisms implicated in the onset or progression of KS.

### Kaposi's sarcoma in the pediatric population: The critical need for a tissue diagnosis [^114qB3hM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a low-grade vascular neoplasm mediated by the human herpesvirus-8. Only one clinical subtype, the endemic/African subtype, commonly affects the pediatric population. Although adults with KS often present with cutaneous findings and generalized lymphadenopathy, African children are more likely to present without classic skin findings. Definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination from tissue biopsy; however, as pathology resources are scarce in many developing African countries where KS is prominent, appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the condition are challenging. We report the case of a Malawian child who presented with generalized lymphadenopathy and was presumptively treated for lymphoma, with clinical worsening of his lesions. A diagnosis of KS was made after excisional biopsy of a superficial lymph node, with the initiation of appropriate therapy. The literature regarding pediatric KS is reviewed, and recommendations are offered to allow accurate and timely diagnosis of the condition.

### Aids-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112kMYRn]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, NCCN guidelines from 2019 recommend considering a switch to sirolimus for immunosuppression associated with solid organ transplant. This approach may suffice for controlling and treating Kaposi sarcoma. For more aggressive or advanced disease, systemic therapy should be offered concurrently with sirolimus.

### Emergence of terbinafine-resistantin Ontario, Canada, 2014–2023 [^115WPVwJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Dermatophytoses are superficial mycoses of the skin, hair, and nails caused by several species of keratinophilic fungi including Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton interdigitale, and other Trichophyton spp., as well as Microsporum spp. and Epidermophyton spp. While not fatal, these infections are highly prevalent, affecting 20%–25% of the global population. They cause severe morbidity due to uncomfortable inflammation, itchy rashes, scaling at superficial body sites, and superinfections. Nevertheless, dermatophytoses have historically been regarded as a relatively low-priority clinical and public health problem, in part because effective treatment with a variety of antifungals is available without prescription in many countries.

Recently, a newly described species, Trichophyton indotineae (previously Trichophyton mentagrophytes VIII), has been reported to cause cases of extensive, recalcitrant tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Over the past decade, an alarming increase in the incidence of T. indotineae infections has been reported in India. In a recent survey, the vast majority (78%) of dermatophyte infections in this country were found to be caused by T. indotineae. Now considered endemic to India and Iran, many other countries are reporting imported cases of T. indotineae with possible rare cases of local transmission. This signals the potential for this epidemic to spread to additional countries in the near future. Many cases of T. indotineae dermatophytosis are recalcitrant to both topical and oral preparations of the first-line treatment option, terbinafine.

### The management of children with Kaposi sarcoma in resource limited settings [^114vonsy]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is common where HIV infection is endemic. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced the incidence in well-resourced settings, but in some parts of the world, access to ART is delayed. These recommendations are intended for use where only minimal requirements for treatment are available. Consensus was sought for the management of childhood HIV-associated KS in such settings. There are no randomized controlled studies of chemotherapy for KS in children; therefore, these recommendations have been drawn from the consensus of a group of experts as well as published reports from studies in adults.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^112VL6ed]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Terbinafine, an allylamine antifungal, inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of the squalene epoxidase enzyme. This leads to fungal cell death, primarily due to increased membrane permeability mediated by the accumulation of high concentrations of squalene and not due to ergosterol deficiency. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species tested in vitro, terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown.

Terbinafine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum.

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. In vitro, terbinafine exhibits satisfactory minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most strains of the following microorganisms. However, the safety and efficacy of terbinafine in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: Candida albicans, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis.

### The role of dermatologists in the early HIV/AIDS epidemic: A historical review for the 40th anniversary of HIV/AIDS [^111w8Kn9]. JAMA Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

In 1981, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was first recognized in young gay men presenting with opportunistic infections and Kaposi sarcoma. Over the past 40 years, there has been an unparalleled and hugely successful effort on the part of physicians, scientists, public health experts, community activists, and grassroots organizations to study, treat, and prevent HIV/AIDS. Yet, the role of dermatologists in the investigation of HIV/AIDS and in the treatment of infected patients has largely been neglected in the historical literature. It is important to revisit dermatologists' historic contributions and problematic biases during this epidemic and honor the legacy of the dermatologists who were instrumental in treating and advocating for patients affected by HIV/AIDS.

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^111y1Uay]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in reducing the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma, HIV-infected individuals who have responded to treatment continue to be diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma. This study examines factors associated with the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma among cART-treated HIV-infected homosexual men and changes in their survival after its diagnosis over calendar time.
- **Methods**: Data were collected from HIV-infected homosexual men with well-estimated dates of HIV seroconversion (i.e. change in status from being HIV negative to having HIV antibodies detected). The incidence of Kaposi sarcoma was calculated. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to determine survival after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis in three calendar periods: before 1996, 1996–2000, and 2001–2006. Poisson models examined the effect of risk factors such as nadir CD4 cell count (i.e. the lowest CD4 cell count ever recorded for a person), duration of infection, and age at diagnosis on Kaposi sarcoma incidence in cART-treated men. All statistical tests were two-sided.
- **Results**: Among the 9,473 men, 555 were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma in the period 1986–2006, of whom 319 died. The percentage surviving 24 months after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis rose statistically significantly during the study period from 35% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 29% to 42%) before 1996 to 84% (95% CI = 76% to 90%) in 1996–2000 and to 81% (95% CI = 70% to 88%) in 2001–2006 (P < .001). Seventy men were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma after starting cART. Current (i.e. within 6 months) CD4 cell count was associated with survival outcomes.

### Molecularly targeted therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma in a kidney transplant patient: Case report, "what worked and what did not" [^112S2xEG]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Imatinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for which there is limited information regarding its effects on AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and none in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used for kidney transplants, exhibits antiangiogenic activity related to impaired production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); clinical benefit has been reported in Kaposi's sarcoma associated with renal grafts.
- **Case presentation**: Here, we report a case of an 80-year-old male who developed Kaposi's sarcoma nine months after receiving a living non-related donor kidney transplant at age 74. Three years after treatment with different chemotherapeutic agents for progressive cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma with no visceral involvement, he was prescribed Imatinib (200 mg/day for two weeks followed by 400 mg/day). After four weeks of treatment, he developed anasarca, further progression of Kaposi's sarcoma, and agranulocytosis. Imatinib was discontinued, and there was significant clinical recovery. One year later, his immunosuppressive therapy was changed to Sirolimus, and regression of the Kaposi's sarcoma occurred.
- **Conclusion**: The lack of benefit and severe toxicity associated with the use of Imatinib in this patient should alert clinicians of the potentially adverse consequences of its use in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. On the other hand, the positive response seen in this patient to Sirolimus, even following a long evolution of Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple chemotherapy regimens, and extensive cutaneous disease, further suggests its therapeutic potential.

### Panretin [^115uF4nn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Panretin® gel is not a systemic therapy and, therefore, cannot treat visceral Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) nor prevent the development of new KS lesions where it has not been applied. Visceral KS disease was not monitored in these trials, and the appearance of new KS lesions was not considered part of the response assessment in clinical trials.

Panretin® gel was evaluated in two multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies in patients with cutaneous lesions of AIDS-related KS. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the patients' cutaneous KS tumor response rate through 12 weeks of study drug treatment. This was assessed by evaluating from 3 to 8 KS index lesions according to the modified AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) response criteria as applied to topical therapy. This means evaluation was based on height and area reductions of the index lesions only; progressive disease in non-index lesions and new lesions were not considered progressive disease. Progressive disease was scored only in the treated index lesions.

A global evaluation by physicians was also carried out, which considered all of the patient's treated lesions (index and other) compared to baseline. In this evaluation, patients with at least a 50% improvement in the KS lesions were considered responders. In addition, photographs of lesions in patients considered responders by the modified ACTG criteria were examined by the FDA for a cosmetically beneficial response, defined as at least a 50% improvement in appearance compared to baseline, considering both the KS lesions and general appearance.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113uCjcQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend offering systemic therapy to patients with advanced symptomatic cutaneous, visceral, nodal, or oral disease. The goal is to reduce or reverse symptoms, lymphedema, or threat to organ function. It is important to recognize that complete remissions are rare. Treatment should be continued until unacceptable toxicity or a plateau in response is reached. Maintenance therapy beyond two cycles of systemic therapy after determining a plateau is not recommended. If the response is clinically acceptable, consider observing patients while continuing antiretroviral therapy in those with HIV. Otherwise, initiate alternative therapy.

### An unusual series of patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^111YQFcb]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS), an indolent vascular tumor, can present in myriad forms. Although five clinical subtypes have been discussed in the literature, not all lesions fit into one of these existing subtypes. In rare cases where the patient does not have any risk factors for KS, but the clinical presentation is suspicious, KS should still be considered in the differential diagnosis and ruled out with a biopsy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Kaposi sarcoma [^112tbfkv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most common neoplasm among people living with HIV today. In Sub-Saharan Africa, KS is also among the most prevalent cancers in men. HIV-positive individuals are not the only ones who present with KS; any immune-compromised person infected with KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus 8 is at risk. This includes the elderly, children in KSHV-endemic areas, and transplant recipients. KS diagnosis is based on the detection of the viral protein latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) in the biopsy. However, not all cases of KS are identical or respond to the same therapy. Standard KS therapy has remained unchanged for 20 years, but newer modalities are on the horizon and will be discussed.

### Management of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma [^112r36Th]. The Lancet Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a substantial reduction in the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality associated with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Similarly, concomitant advances in chemotherapy and supportive-care protocols have allowed for Kaposi's sarcoma to be managed more effectively compared to the pre-HAART era. Furthermore, developments in understanding the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma have identified several molecular targets that can potentially provide new therapeutic strategies.

This review discusses the role of conventional chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma. It also summarizes the status and future prospects of novel molecularly targeted agents in the treatment of this disease.

### Kaposi sarcoma of childhood: Inborn or acquired immunodeficiency to oncogenic HHV-8 [^113zNi4E]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Because of the rarity of pediatric KS, there is a paucity of literature on treatment and outcome stratification, with most treatment modality options extracted from literature of adults treated for KS. At the time of writing, there are no established consensus group therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of all four forms (epidemic, endemic, iatrogenic, and classic) of pediatric KS. Antiviral therapy (ganciclovir, valganciclovir) can be considered for the prevention of (primary) HHV-8 infection and subsequent KS development, with systemic chemotherapy (liposomal doxorubicin, liposomal daunorubicin, paclitaxel, vincristine, etoposide, and bleomycin) utilized in cases of pediatric KS with systemic disease. Intralesional chemotherapy (vinblastine, topical retinoic acid) is utilized in cases of localized disease.

As in adults, the control of HIV and the switch or diminution of immunosuppression is key to the control of epidemic and iatrogenic forms. In cases of epidemic KS, the Cochrane review concluded that chemotherapy and HAART in combination versus HAART alone are more likely associated with KS remission, although data are sparse. Children with endemic (African) KS who are HIV-negative, oftentimes in resource-limited settings, have better outcomes than those with HIV infection undergoing the same chemotherapeutic regimens.

Limited cases of pediatric iatrogenic (liver transplant) KS have shown a promising response to the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus and paclitaxel chemotherapy. Pediatric classic (Mediterranean) KS, also exceedingly rare.

Regarding the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend considering the observation of patients with limited cutaneous disease that is asymptomatic and cosmetically acceptable while initiating or continuing antiretroviral therapy. This involves the optimization of immune function and HIV viral suppression. It is important to recognize that remissions or stable disease may occur with antiretroviral therapy and the optimization of immune function and HIV viral suppression alone.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117Pqy7M]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines specifically address the management of limited cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma. They recommend treating patients with relapsed or progressive disease after first-line therapy as if they have advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal Kaposi sarcoma. It is advised to consider performing a biopsy of lesions in cases of progressive, relapsed, or refractory disease, as these may be areas of post-inflammatory pigment and/or mimickers of Kaposi sarcoma. If Kaposi sarcoma is confirmed, evaluate for inadequate HIV control as a contributing factor to inadequate Kaposi sarcoma control, and address possible changes in antiretroviral therapy in conjunction with an HIV specialist. Consider repeating the use of previously effective therapy if Kaposi sarcoma relapses or progresses after an initial response, particularly if the response was durable.

### Classic Kaposi's sarcoma treated with topical rapamycin [^114gAmCk]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative disorder caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). Research efforts have focused on studying the relative role of KSHV-encoded genes in Kaposi's sarcomagenesis to identify novel mechanism-based therapies for patients suffering from this tumor. Although several viral genes have potential for KS pathogenesis, compelling data point to the KSHV-encoded G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) as a leading candidate viral gene for the initiation of KS. Interestingly, the oncogenic potential of vGPCR seems to correlate with its capacity to activate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Rapamycin, the prototypical inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathway, has recently emerged as an effective treatment for KS when administered orally. In this case report, we present an immunocompetent patient with KS lesions treated with topical rapamycin, achieving clinical and histologic healing after 16 weeks of treatment. The topical application of rapamycin could be a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of KS.

### Phase II study of bevacizumab in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma receiving antiretroviral therapy [^112o57Ey]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Alternatives to cytotoxic agents are desirable for patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) contributes to KS pathogenesis. The study evaluated the humanized anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, in patients with HIV-KS.
- **Patients and methods**: Patients with HIV-KS who either experienced progression while receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least one month or did not regress despite HAART for at least four months were administered bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 8 and then every three weeks. The primary objective was to assess antitumor activity using modified AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) criteria for HIV-KS. HIV-uninfected patients were also eligible and observed separately.
- **Results**: Seventeen HIV-infected patients were enrolled. Fourteen patients had been receiving effective HAART for at least six months (median, one year). Thirteen patients had advanced disease (ACTG T(1)), thirteen patients had received prior chemotherapy for KS, and seven patients had a CD4 count less than 200 cells/μL. The median number of cycles was 10 (range, 1 to 37 cycles); median follow-up was 8.3 months (range, 3 to 36 months). Of 16 assessable patients, the best tumor responses observed were complete response (CR) in three patients (19%), partial response (PR) in two patients (12%), stable disease in nine patients (56%), and progressive disease in two patients (12%). The overall response rate (CR + PR) was 31% (95% CI, 11% to 58.7%). Four of five responders had received prior chemotherapy for KS.

### Radiotherapy in the management of classic Kaposi's sarcoma: A single institution experience from northeast Turkey [^11763DJo]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma is a rare adult neoplasm, and there has been no definitive consensus on a standard treatment, either local or systemic. Radiotherapy is an effective and suitable treatment modality.

Between 1996 and 2016, patients diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma and referred to our clinic for radiotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Ninety-two patients were examined in total, all of whom had non-HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. There were 36 females (39%) and 56 males (61%), resulting in a female-to-male ratio of 2:3. The median age at presentation was 72 years, with a range of 30 to 93 years.
- **Radiotherapy treatments**:
	- Sixty-eight patients (77%) were treated with 8 Gy in a single fraction.
	- Fifteen patients (16%) received 20 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction.
	- Four patients (4%) received 25 Gy at 2.5 Gy per fraction.
	- Five patients (6%) received 30 Gy at 3 Gy per fraction.

The median follow-up time was 72 months, ranging from 5 to 192 months. The complete response rate at 5 years was 91.6% for doses greater than 20 Gy and 89.6% for 8 Gy. Radiotherapy is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects, highlighting its effectiveness as a suitable treatment for classic Kaposi's sarcoma.

### Nonepidemic Kaposi sarcoma: A recently proposed category [^1162WbeV]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an indolent angioproliferative tumor thought to be dependent on viral replication, immune modulation, and inflammatory cytokines produced by infected endothelial and immune cells. Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is thought to cause KS and is documented in more than 95% of patients with KS. The skin is the most common site of presentation, although visceral disease, most commonly affecting the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract, may also occur. KS typically manifests as violaceous, dark brown, or black macules, papules, and nodules on the lower extremities that are prone to bleeding and ulceration. It has a slow-growing course in immunocompetent individuals. We present the unusual case of an HIV-negative yet high-risk man in whom cutaneous KS lesions developed on the face that exhibited a complete response to topical imiquimod and tretinoin. Our patient represents an additional case of the rare, underrecognized category known as nonepidemic KS.

### Insights into the molecular biology and sero-epidemiology of Kaposi's sarcoma [^111VGoJf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in established market economies has fallen since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it remains the most common tumor in individuals with HIV infection. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, and its role in the subversion of cellular machinery provides an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in immunobiology and carcinogenesis. This review focuses on discussing articles published from August 2001 to August 2002 that provide advances in our knowledge of this process and also on reviewing new data concerning the transmission and identification of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection in different populations.
- **Recent findings**: We have an improved understanding of the epidemiologies of classic, endemic, post-transplant, and AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. The role of specific genes in tumorigenesis has been further defined, with particular reference to the switch from latent to lytic infection and the involvement of cytokines and angiogenic factors.
- **Summary**: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is widespread in immunosuppressed individuals and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The study of Kaposi's sarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus represents an important model of the interplay between the immune system and cancer, and may lead to the development of clinically useful therapies, including vaccines.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115627NE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend initiating systemic Kaposi sarcoma-directed therapy as soon as possible in all patients with HIV who have symptomatic Kaposi sarcoma, such as edema, oral Kaposi sarcoma, or other manifestations that interfere with normal functions or activities. In patients with limited cutaneous disease, urgent initiation of systemic Kaposi sarcoma therapy should be considered if Kaposi sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is present. Signs of past immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome may also indicate the need for earlier initiation of systemic Kaposi sarcoma therapy. Antiretroviral therapy should not be delayed or discontinued unless life-threatening immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome develops. Reconstitution of immune function is important for obtaining and maintaining control or remission of Kaposi sarcoma.

### Terbinafine [^117GtQHB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.
- **Clinical studies**: Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated a mycological cure, defined as the simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Additionally, 59% of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5 mm of new unaffected nail growth), while 38% of subjects demonstrated a mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

	- In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, in which nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was observed. However, the pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established, and the clinical significance of this association is unknown.

	- Results of the fingernail trial, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated a mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of the subjects, and a mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the subjects.

	- The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial.

### Topical beta-blockers in dermatologic therapy [^114ApkWC]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an unusual vascular tumor, probably of lymphatic lineage, showing aberrant endothelial and mesenchymal differentiation. At the time of writing, an effective, low-risk treatment for KS has not been found. Topical treatment would be ideal for patients with disease confined to the skin, as it may slow disease progression for several years and pose lower risks of systemic side effects. In fact, some topical agents have been used, including retinoids, imiquimod, rapamycin, and recently timolol maleate solution, with varying results.

Molecular studies have shown that KS lesions are dependent on beta-adrenergic signaling for the reactivation of human herpes virus-8, which could explain why beta-blockers can reduce KS proliferation by suppressing cAMP and protein kinase A signaling pathways.

At the time of writing, 12 patients with KS treated with topical timolol have been described in the literature. All the patients (except one) responded rapidly to treatment in a time period between 5 and 24 weeks; different timing responses can be possibly related to lesion size.

Of the patients who experienced complete resolution, disease recurrence monitoring was not reported for 4 patients, while in the remaining patients no recurrence was reported at a mean follow-up of 12.3 months. There were no differences in response rate between immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients.

Most patients have been treated with 0.5% topical timolol; however, recently it has been reported that lower concentrations (0.1% instead of 0.5%) might also be efficacious.

### Modern approach to manage patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^111HvsQy]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

Whenever possible, active surveillance or local treatment should be preferred, given the generally benign course and even the potentially self-resolving nature of skin lesions in these KS forms (mostly classic KS). However, in the case of locally advanced, hyperalgesic lesions or extracutaneous manifestations, systemic treatment may be warranted. As mentioned above, most RCTs have been conducted and designed for HIV-related KS, and their conclusions have been derived for classic and endemic KS. Recently, in a multicenter retrospective study, liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel appear to be equally effective in classic and endemic KS, with a better tolerability profile for liposomal doxorubicin. IFNα, although effective in some patients, tends to be associated with lower response rates than paclitaxel and liposomal doxorubicin.

### Kaposi sarcoma of the larynx: A systematic review [^1128M46r]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) of the larynx is a rare disease with few cases reported in the literature. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of laryngeal KS, including patient characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library.
- **Review methods**: A systematic review of the published English literature was conducted. An electronic search and bibliographic examination of articles pertaining to laryngeal KS were performed. Demographic data, tumor site, treatment strategies, follow-up, and outcome were analyzed.
- **Results**: A total of 77 cases from 50 articles were included in the review. The mean age was 47.6 years (range, 8–81), with an 8.6:1 male-to-female ratio. The most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea (n = 35) and hoarseness (n = 25). Laryngeal KS arose most frequently in the supraglottic region (n = 16). Chemotherapy alone (n = 27) was the most common treatment modality in patients with AIDS-associated KS, and surgical excision alone (n = 7) was most common in patients with other subtypes of KS (e.g. classic, transplant-associated). Average follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 0.75–120). Most patients with AIDS-associated KS died of other causes (n = 25), but most patients with other subtypes of KS were alive with no evidence of disease at follow-up (n = 13).
- **Conclusion**: This review contains the largest pool of laryngeal KS cases at the time of writing. Long-term outcomes were generally unfavorable, often due to advanced HIV disease at the time of diagnosis.

### Incidence and mortality of non-AIDS-defining cancers among people living with HIV: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113jTBC2]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

It is well-established that people living with HIV (PLHIV) face a high risk of developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical cancer. With the widespread introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) worldwide, there has been a rise in incident non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) among PLHIV in both developed and developing countries, and this trend is projected to persist in the future. With potent antiretroviral drugs, PLHIV are experiencing longer lifespans, making age-related diseases, including different types of NADCs, increasingly important health issues in this population. Meanwhile, NADCs have become an increasingly significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide for those living with HIV.

For example, a study conducted in the US reported that from 2001 to 2015, 9.2% of deaths in PLHIV were attributable to NADCs, compared to 5.0% of deaths due to AIDS-defining cancers. During the same period, the population-attributable fractions of mortality for NADCs rose from 7.2% to 11.8%. Similar findings were also reported by cohort studies from Turkey and China.

The first meta-analysis on this topic, published in 2007, was based on seven studies, while the latest updated meta-analysis was published in 2009 and included an additional six studies. Both reviews reported an elevated incidence of most types of NADCs among PLHIV compared to the general population, particularly cancers related to infection and smoking.

### Chemotherapy of disseminated cutaneous classic Kaposi's sarcoma with vinblastine [^1136goNy]. The Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Classic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a rare, indolent, cutaneous malign proliferation disease predominantly affecting elderly men of Mediterranean and Jewish origin. Classic KS generally does not require treatment for a prolonged period. Systemic therapy is indicated for patients with advanced disease. We present here a 78-year-old woman with disseminated cutaneous classic KS who was successfully treated with single-agent vinblastine. Vinblastine is very effective, less toxic, and less costly in the treatment of elderly patients with disseminated classic KS.

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^112o3o5N]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in reducing the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma, HIV-infected individuals who have responded to treatment continue to be diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma. We examine factors associated with the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma among cART-treated HIV-infected homosexual men and changes in their survival after its diagnosis over calendar time.
- **Methods**: Data were from HIV-infected homosexual men with well-estimated dates of HIV seroconversion (i.e. change in status from being HIV negative to having HIV antibodies detected). Incidence of Kaposi sarcoma was calculated. We used Kaplan–Meier methods to determine survival after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis in three calendar periods: before 1996, 1996–2000, and 2001–2006. Poisson models were used to examine the effect of risk factors such as nadir CD4 cell count (i.e. the lowest CD4 cell count ever recorded for a person), duration of infection, and age at diagnosis for Kaposi sarcoma incidence in cART-treated men. All statistical tests were two-sided.
- **Results**: Among the 9473 men, 555 were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma in the period 1986–2006, of whom 319 died. The percentage surviving 24 months after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis rose statistically significantly during the study period from 35% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 29% to 42%) before 1996 to 84% (95% CI = 76% to 90%) in 1996–2000 and to 81% (95% CI = 70% to 88%) in 2001–2006 (P < 0.001). Seventy men were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma after starting cART. Current (i.e. within 6 months) CD4 cell count was associated with survival.

### Non-AIDS Kaposi's sarcoma in the head and neck area [^115pRM6n]. Head & Neck (2009). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma is classified into four types: classic (sporadic), African (endemic), iatrogenic (transplant recipients), and epidemic (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]-associated). This article provides a comprehensive review of non-AIDS Kaposi's sarcoma, featuring a literature review and a report of three cases.

Case materials were collected from our hospital's archive. The literature review was conducted through electronic and manual medical database searches. Biological aspects, diagnostic challenges, investigation protocols, and management modalities are discussed.

### Modern approach to manage patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^11455HXq]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

The extent of lesions and the severity of the disease are mainly related to the clinical settings of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and the severity of immunodeficiency. In immunocompetent patients with classic KS, KS lesions are mostly localized on the lower limbs and present as macules, papules, and often as nodules that may ulcerate. Local aggressiveness can occur, but symptomatic systemic extension is uncommon. Endemic KS often occurs with the same presentation. Nonetheless, it seems to differ from classic KS with more local aggressiveness and more ulcerated nodules. Of note, endemic KS had historically been described in four clinically distinct patterns, namely benign nodular cutaneous disease, aggressive localized cutaneous disease, florid mucocutaneous and visceral disease, and fulminant lymphadenopathic disease. However, this classification is almost exclusively based on reports published before the 1980s and is likely to be, at least in part, related to misdiagnosis of the HIV‐related form in patients from endemic areas before systematic HIV detection.

In immunodeficiency‐associated KS, the course of the disease may be chronic or rapidly progressive, depending on the alteration of the immune system. KS lesions are more likely to be extensive, associated with painful skin tumors, local skin and mucosal invasion, and systemic involvement. In epidemic KS, cutaneous lesions commonly present as multifocal and symmetric macules that may develop rapidly and evolve to papules and tumors in uncontrolled HIV infection.

Regarding the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, specifically concerning the management of limited cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma, the 2019 NCCN guidelines recommend offering the following first-line treatment options for HIV-negative patients with symptomatic and/or cosmetically bothersome limited cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma:

- **Local therapy**: Local treatments for individual lesions.
- **Radiotherapy**: Used for multiple lesions or when local therapy is not feasible.
- **Systemic therapy**: Appropriate for extensive disease or rapid tumor progression.
- **Clinical trial**: Participation in clinical trials may also be considered.

### Modern approach to manage patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^112Z2jsA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

The symptoms and lesions of iatrogenic KS are similar to those of epidemic KS and often manifest as extensive cutaneous lesions, with frequent lymph node and systemic involvement. Similar to epidemic KS, spontaneous remission after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy is expected, but indolent lesions may persist.

In cases of severe involvement, immunocompromised patients may develop KICS. KICS was initially described in PWH and, secondarily, in patients with solid organ transplantation. Conversely, it seems to be exceptional in immunocompetent patients, that is, in classical or endemic KS. As KICS was initially described as an "MCD-like syndrome", the clinical features are close to MCD, and KICS diagnosis supposes its exclusion.

### Modern approach to manage patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^115C6gXN]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

Liposomal doxorubicin is considered to be the first-line chemotherapy for advanced Kaposi sarcoma (KS). In the 1990s, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in HIV-related KS demonstrated its superiority over conventional cytotoxic therapies such as bleomycin and vincristine. In epidemic KS, RCTs have shown response rates ranging from 46% to 58%.

Paclitaxel is another chemotherapy that demonstrated efficacy in RCTs conducted in people with HIV (PWH), with overall response rates ranging from 56% to 71%, either in first-line or second-line treatment after liposomal doxorubicin. In a recent RCT in 2020, paclitaxel was more effective than etoposide monotherapy and the bleomycin and vincristine combination in PWH.

Nonetheless, RCTs comparing systemic treatments in patients with KS are lacking. Moreover, most trials evaluating the efficacy of systemic therapies were conducted before the modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. In PWH, only one head-to-head RCT was conducted for liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel, which reported similar efficacy with better tolerability for liposomal doxorubicin. Therefore, due to this better tolerance, the first choice is often liposomal doxorubicin in resource-rich settings. Conversely, in resource-limited countries, the first choice is often paclitaxel, in line with its better efficacy compared to other conventional chemotherapies.

Thereafter, within variable delays after treatment cessation and despite initial response, recurrence and, subsequently, retreatment is common. In cases of initial effectiveness, the same treatment regimen can be considered.

### Evidence of activity of irinotecan in patients with advanced AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma [^113yKnTk]. AIDS (2005). Low credibility.

Fourteen HIV-infected patients with advanced Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) received irinotecan 150 mg/m intravenously on days 1 and 10. All patients had relapsed or progressed during highly active antiretroviral therapy, which was administered as primary antineoplastic therapy. An objective response, consisting of partial remissions, occurred in 75% of the patients. Irinotecan was well tolerated; severe leukopenia occurred in only 33% of patients. In HIV-infected patients with advanced KS, irinotecan is both active and well tolerated.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115wCuxf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend monitoring patients with HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma, especially those with advanced immunosuppression, closely for opportunistic infections, marrow suppression with neutropenic fever, or thrombocytopenic bleeding. Collaboration with an HIV specialist is crucial to ensure adequate opportunistic infection prophylaxis appropriate to CD4+ T-cell count, which may temporarily decrease with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Growth factor support may be needed to facilitate systemic therapy.

### Treatment of severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-infected adults [^112mY8xD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma remains the most common cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa and the second most common cancer in HIV-infected patients worldwide. Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), there has been a decline in its incidence. However, Kaposi's sarcoma continues to be diagnosed in HIV-infected patients.
- **Objectives**: To assess the added advantage of chemotherapy plus HAART compared to HAART alone; and the advantages of different chemotherapy regimens in HAART and HAART naive HIV-infected adults with severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma.
- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, GATEWAY, the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the US National Institutes of Health.

### Kaposi's sarcoma: Etiology and pathogenesis, inducing factors, causal associations, and treatments: Facts and controversies [^117F5zWW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), an angioproliferative disorder, has a viral etiology and a multifactorial pathogenesis hinging on an immune dysfunction. The disease is multifocal, with a course ranging from indolent, with only skin manifestations, to fulminant, with extensive visceral involvement. All forms of KS share a common etiology in human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 infection, and the differences among them are due to the involvement of various cofactors. In fact, HHV-8 infection can be considered a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of KS, because further factors (genetic, immunologic, and environmental) are required.
- **Cofactors in pathogenesis**: The role of cofactors can be attributed to their ability to interact with HHV-8, affect the immune system, or act as vasoactive agents. This contribution surveys the state of knowledge on the many factors involved in KS pathogenesis, particularly highlighting the facts and controversies regarding the role of some drugs (quinine analogues and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) in the onset of the disease.

Based on these assessments, it is possible to hypothesize that cofactors could either favor or inhibit the onset of the disease, depending on the presence of other agents modulating pathogenesis, such as genetic predisposition, environmental factors, drug intake, or lymph flow disorders. It is possible that the same agents may act as either stimulating or inhibiting cofactors according to the patient's genetic predisposition.

### PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab in classic or endemic Kaposi's sarcoma: a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 study [^117AUyWa]. The Lancet Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Although the treatment of iatrogenic and HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma is well-defined and mostly based on restoring immune function, the treatment of classic and endemic Kaposi sarcoma is less well established. Chemotherapy or interferon α is used for patients with extensive cutaneous or visceral Kaposi sarcoma, but tolerance might be poor and long-term remission is rare. We aimed to evaluate the activity of pembrolizumab in classic and endemic Kaposi sarcoma with cutaneous extension requiring systemic treatment.
- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, single-arm, proof-of-concept, phase 2 trial in adults aged 18 years or older with histologically proven classic or endemic Kaposi's sarcoma with progressive cutaneous extension requiring systemic treatment and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1 in three hospitals in France. The patients were treated with 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks for 6 months (eight cycles) or until severe toxicity. The primary endpoint was the best overall response rate within the 6-month timeframe, defined by the occurrence of a complete response or partial response and assessed by an investigator using the modified AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) criteria.

Three or more responses among a total 17 patients were needed for the primary endpoint to be met, using a Simon's two-stage optimal design assuming a 30% response rate as desirable. For this final study analysis, all patients were included following the intention-to-treat principle.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113uVh91]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following subsequent systemic therapy options for patients with relapsed or refractory advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal disease in certain circumstances:

- **Albumin-bound paclitaxel**: If paclitaxel intolerant, administer 100 mg IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.
- **Etoposide**: 50 mg/day PO for 7 days in each 14-day cycle. After 2 cycles, escalate to 100 mg/day PO for 7 days in each 14-day cycle in patients without partial or complete response and no toxicity greater than Grade 2. The dose can be further escalated to 150 mg/day based on tolerance and response.
- **Imatinib**: 400 mg/day PO.
- **Nivolumab and ipilimumab**: Nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV every 6 weeks.
- **Nivolumab**: 480 mg IV every 4 weeks.
- **Pembrolizumab**: 200 mg IV every 3 weeks for up to 6 months.
- **Sirolimus**: For transplant-associated Kaposi sarcoma, a loading dose of 0.15 mg/kg PO followed by 0.04–0.06 mg/kg/day to maintain trough blood levels of 6–10 ng/mL, or 2 mg PO daily (adjust to maintain trough levels of 6–10 ng/mL).
- **Thalidomide**: For patients with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, starting at 200 mg/day PO, titrated to effect and tolerability.

### Steroids are a risk factor for Kaposi's sarcoma-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and mortality in HIV infection [^1125ohi3]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

This study was conducted at the Department of Research in Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, a national referral centre in Mexico City. Individuals attending our institution frequently have PCP or Mycobacterium tuberculosis pneumonia, so they usually receive antibiotics and glucocorticoids for the treatment of such infections. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of individuals with HIV infection and associated Kaposi's sarcoma, who started ART between January 2008 and August 2014 at our institution. The main outcomes of interest were KS-IRIS and Kaposi's sarcoma-related mortality. The main exposure of interest was the use of glucocorticoids.
- **Case definitions for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome**: Diagnosis of IRIS was based on the consensus criteria of the International Network for the Study of HIV-Associated IRIS, specified as follows: response to ART by receiving HIV ART and virologic response with more than 1 log 10 copies/ml decrease in HIV RNA; clinical deterioration of an infectious or inflammatory condition temporally related to ART initiation (< 1 year); and inability to explain symptoms by expected clinical course of a previously recognized and successfully treated infection, medication side-effect or toxicity, treatment failure, and complete nonadherence.
- **Procedures**: The retrospective review of medical records included sociodemographic variables such as age, sex, and risk factors for HIV infection. Variables from the clinical domain included…

### Clinical outcome features of non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma and the role of wide excision on survival: A retrospective cohort study [^115AczSC]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

This single-center, pragmatic, retrospective study compared outcomes among patients with non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma treated with broad excision or those not treated with surgery. Patients with an ICD diagnosis (C46: Kaposi's sarcoma) at CMUH between 1990 and 2023 were screened. Over 30 years, 39 patients were initially identified. After excluding 2 patients due to inadequate data to avoid misinterpretation, 37 patients remained. They were divided into two groups based on their HIV status: Kaposi's sarcoma with HIV and without HIV. Among them, 22 patients had non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma.

- **Figure 1**: Enrolled patients with ICD diagnosis (C46) and pathological records between 1990 and 2023. The patients were divided according to the results of the HIV test and then based on whether they underwent or did not undergo surgery.

Basic data from these patients were collected, including:

- **Demographics and clinical data**: Age, sex, comorbidities, diagnosed Kaposi's sarcoma data
- **Disease characteristics**: Kaposi's sarcoma lesion site and features, staging (European Journal of Dermatology staging)
- **Health status**: Immunosuppressive status, associated disorders, performance status at diagnosis
- **Treatment modalities**: Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, operation, and combined therapy
- **Outcomes**: Follow-up time, symptom-free time, response to treatment, cause of death if the patient died

The 22 patients with non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma were further categorized into two groups based on whether they underwent wide excision or not. Wide excision surgery with at least 2-cm margins was performed. Consequently, 13 patients had undergone wide excision surgery, while the remaining did not.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^112mSCM4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of terbinafine tablets. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
- **Blood and lymphatic system disorders**: Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.8)].
- **Immune system disorders**: Serious hypersensitivity reactions e.g. angioedema and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)], serum sickness-like reaction.
- **Psychiatric disorders**: Anxiety and depressive symptoms independent of taste disturbance have been reported with use of terbinafine tablets. In some cases, depressive symptoms have been reported to subside with discontinuance of therapy and to recur with reinstitution of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
- **Nervous system disorders**: Cases of taste disturbance, including taste loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Cases of smell disturbance, including smell loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Cases of paresthesia.
