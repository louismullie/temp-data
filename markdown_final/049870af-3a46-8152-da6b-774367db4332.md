## Question

What condition is represented by ICD-10 code Q56.4 on a newborn’s problem list?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what condition is represented by ICD-10 code Q56.4 on a newborn's problem list. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10 category and whether Q56 sits in the congenital anomalies chapter. Then, I should verify the exact subcategory for indeterminate sex and ambiguous genitalia. Next, I will check whether Q56.4 corresponds to a specific named entity or an unspecified/indeterminate designation. Finally, I will consider clinical implications and coding nuances that might matter for newborn care and documentation.

> Let me first confirm the ICD-10 structure. Q codes belong to Chapter XVII, which covers congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities, so Q56 would logically sit in that congenital anomalies block rather than in the perinatal conditions (P) or endocrine/metabolic (E) chapters, which aligns with how congenital anomalies are coded in pediatric and neonatal datasets [^927dcad4] [^9d42edec].

> Now, I need to check the precise meaning of Q56. Wait, let me verify the subcategory: Q56 pertains to indeterminate sex and pseudohermaphroditism, which in clinical terms corresponds to disorders of sex development (DSD) presenting with ambiguous genitalia or atypical genital findings at birth, and this is the standard ICD-10 grouping for these conditions [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the specific code Q56.4. I initially thought Q56.4 might map to a named syndrome, but wait, I should double-check the ICD-10 subcodes. Q56.4 is actually "Indeterminate sex, unspecified", which is used when the neonate has ambiguous genitalia or sex assignment is not yet determined, rather than a labeled syndrome like androgen insensitivity or congenital adrenal hyperplasia; those would typically be coded with more specific Q56 subcodes if the etiology is known, whereas Q56.4 reflects an unspecified DSD presentation at birth pending further evaluation [^notfound].

> Let me consider the clinical context and why this code appears on a newborn problem list. This code signals that the infant has atypical genitalia requiring newborn DSD evaluation, including karyotype, endocrine testing, and imaging, and it is commonly used when the phenotype is indeterminate and the etiology has not yet been established; this aligns with how congenital anomalies are flagged in neonatal records and with the need for specialty referral and staged diagnostic workup in DSD [^notfound].

> I should confirm coding implications for care teams. Using Q56.4 documents the clinical problem and supports appropriate referrals to pediatric endocrinology, urology, and genetics, and it distinguishes this presentation from other neonatal issues; importantly, it is not a perinatal condition code (P) nor an endocrine diagnosis (E), reinforcing that the issue is a congenital anomaly of external genitalia requiring evaluation rather than a transient neonatal adaptation problem [^notfound].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. ICD-10-CM Q56.4 on a newborn's problem list denotes indeterminate sex/unspecified ambiguous genitalia, i.e., a disorder of sex development presentation where the sex cannot be assigned at birth pending further diagnostic workup; this is a congenital anomaly code that triggers a standardized DSD evaluation pathway in the newborn period [^notfound].

---

The ICD-10 code Q56.4 denotes **indeterminate sex, unspecified** — a congenital anomaly of the external genitalia in which the sex cannot be assigned at birth due to ambiguous genitalia. This code is used when the phenotype is not clearly male or female and the specific etiology is not yet determined. Immediate evaluation is required to assess chromosomes, hormones, and anatomy to guide sex assignment and management [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of Q56.4

Q56.4 reflects a **disorder of sex development (DSD)** with ambiguous genitalia, meaning the external genitalia do not conform to typical male or female anatomy. This ambiguity may arise from chromosomal, hormonal, or anatomical abnormalities and requires a comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause and appropriate sex assignment [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When Q56.4 is documented, a **multidisciplinary approach** is essential, typically involving pediatric endocrinology, genetics, urology, and neonatology. The diagnostic evaluation includes:

- **Chromosomal analysis**: Karyotyping to determine genetic sex (XX, XY, or variants).
- **Hormonal assessment**: Measurement of androgens, estrogens, and gonadotropins to evaluate hormonal function.
- **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound or MRI to assess internal reproductive structures (gonads, uterus, vagina).
- **Genetic testing**: Targeted gene panels or exome sequencing to identify specific genetic mutations.

---

## Clinical management

Management of infants with Q56.4 is individualized and may include:

- **Sex assignment**: Based on chromosomal, hormonal, and anatomical findings, as well as long-term functional and psychosocial considerations.
- **Surgical intervention**: Reconstructive surgery may be considered, typically deferred until the child is older and a clear sex assignment has been established.
- **Hormonal therapy**: May be initiated if hormonal deficiencies or imbalances are identified.
- **Psychosocial support**: Counseling and support for families and the affected child are essential to address emotional and social challenges.

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

The prognosis for infants with Q56.4 varies depending on the **underlying cause** and the timeliness and appropriateness of management. With advances in medical and surgical care, many individuals with DSDs lead healthy, fulfilling lives. However, ongoing follow-up is necessary to monitor growth, development, hormonal function, and psychosocial well-being.

---

## ICD-10 coding considerations

Accurate coding of Q56.4 is essential for **medical documentation**, billing, and epidemiological tracking. It is important to ensure that the code is applied correctly and that additional codes are used to specify any associated conditions or complications.

---

ICD-10 code Q56.4 represents **indeterminate sex, unspecified**, indicating ambiguous genitalia in newborns. This condition requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary evaluation to determine the underlying cause and guide appropriate management, including sex assignment, surgical considerations, hormonal therapy, and psychosocial support.

REF:

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is designed to provide compatibility in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of mortality and morbidity statistics across the globe. The ICD has been revised periodically to incorporate changes in the medical field and the tenth revision (ICD-10) is currently in use in the US since October 1, 2015. Although the eleventh revision (ICD-11) was published by WHO in 2019, it has not been adopted in the US. Changes from ICD-10 to ICD-11 include new diagnostic codes, refinement of diagnostic criteria for existing diagnosis and steps in the direction of dimensionality (increase number of pertinent features) for some diagnoses. The ICD-10 provides various sections to include detailed codes for various diseases. For example, conditions originating in the perinatal period have codes ranging from P00-P96. Using the most specific code for the patient’s condition is critical for proper reimbursement. Instead of using a common code for respiratory distress (P22), being more specific and using P22.0 for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of newborn or P22.1 for transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN) will enhance diagnostic accuracy and assure proper reimbursement. ICD-10 codes are diagnostic codes that must support the CPT® codes being submitted for reimbursement. If there is a disconnect between the diagnosis and the billing code, insurance carriers will issue a denial.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients’ CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: “Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center”. Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization [-].

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Illness severity indicators in newborns by COVID-19 status in the United States, March-December 2020 [^c5e103c5]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To better understand COVID-19 in newborns, we compared in-hospital illness severity indicators by COVID-19 status during birth hospitalization.

Study Design

In a retrospective cohort of newborns born March-December 2020 in the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release, we classified COVID-19 status and severe illness indicators using ICD-CM-10 codes, laboratory data, and billing records. Illness severity indicators were compared by COVID-19 status, stratified by gestational age and race/ethnicity.

Result

Among 701,777 newborns, 209 had a COVID-19 diagnosis during the birth hospitalization. COVID-19 status differed significantly by race/ethnicity, gestational age, payor, and region. Late preterm/term newborns with COVID-19 had increased intensive care unit admission and sepsis risk; early preterm newborns with COVID-19 had increased risk for invasive ventilation. Risk for illness severity varied among racial/ethnic strata.

Conclusion

From March to December 2020, COVID-19 diagnosis in newborns was rare. More clinical data are needed to describe the risk profiles of newborns with COVID-19.

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

### Pregnancy outcomes for women with myasthenia gravis and their newborns: a nationwide register-based cohort study [^9d42edec]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Pregnancy and delivery outcomes identified by their respective ICD codes in the MBR were gestational diabetes (ICD‐10 code O24.4, ICD‐9 code 648.8), pre‐eclampsia (ICD‐10 code O14, ICD‐9 codes 642.4–642.7), oligohydramnios (ICD‐10 code O41.0, ICD‐9 code 658.0), premature rupture of membranes (PROM; ICD‐10 code O42, ICD‐9 code 658.1), antepartum hemorrhage (ICD‐10 code O46.8, ICD 9 codes 641.9, 762.1, 641.8), and postpartum hemorrhage (ICD‐10 code O72.1, O72.2, ICD‐9 codes 666.1, 666.2). Prolonged labor was identified by the ICD codes for primary and secondary uterine inertia (ICD‐10 codes O62.0, O62.1, O62.2, O63.1, ICD‐9 codes 661.0, 661.1). In checkbox format, labor onset was recorded in the MBR as spontaneous labor, induction of labor, or elective C‐section (missing data 2%). Mode of delivery was recorded in checkbox format in the MBR as spontaneous vaginal delivery, instrumental delivery, or delivery by C‐section.

The neonatal outcomes (missing data < 1%) were 5‐min APGAR, gestational age at birth, standardized birth weight for gestational age, sex, and congenital malformations (ICD‐10 codes Q and ICD‐9 codes 740–759). Neonatal MG diagnoses strictly included only the following infant ICD diagnosis codes in the MBR and PR: ICD‐10 codes P94.0 (transient neonatal MG), G70.0 (MG), G702 (congenital myasthenia), and ICD‐9 codes 775.2 (neonatal MG) and 358A (MG).

All outcomes were identified in the MBR. Further congenital malformations in the exposed infants only (maternal MG) were discovered by searching all diagnoses in the PR in the first 6 months of life. Neonatal mortality in the first 28 days of life and maternal mortality during and up to 42 days after pregnancy were recorded as ICD codes in the cause of death register.

### Hospital readmissions among infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^867ab9db]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Identification of Infant Cohorts and Main Outcome Measures

As shown in the Figure, we identified 18 442 499 weighted (4 003 752 unweighted) newborns in the 2016-2020 NRD by first limiting the sample to those younger than 1 year who also had an ICD-10-CM code for liveborn infants. The eTable in Supplement 1 shows the specific ICD-10-CM codes used for identifying infants and conditions. For these infants, we then selected the first hospitalization record for the relevant calendar year. Infants who died during the birth hospitalization were excluded. To allow for equal 90-day follow-up, our primary analysis was limited to newborns discharged from the birth hospitalization between January and September of each calendar year. In sensitivity analyses of all-cause readmissions, we included newborns discharged between January and December. We also compared infants discharged before or in September and those discharged after September of a given year.

Figure. 
Flow Diagram of Sample Selection

NOWS indicates neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.

To assess the incremental impact of NOWS, we used ICD-10-CM code P96.1 (infants with NOWS [neonatal withdrawal symptoms from maternal use of drugs of addiction]) to create a binary indicator of NOWS as the key exposure variable.(Note that to remain consistent with the term currently used by the American Academy of Pediatrics and federal agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, we refer to the condition traditionally known as neonatal abstinence syndrome as NOWS.)

The ICD-10-CM codes were also used to identify multiple gestation births and infants born with low birth weight (<2500 g), early preterm (ie, gestational age <34 weeks), or late preterm (gestational age between 34 weeks, 0 days and 36 weeks, 6 days).Full-term newborns were defined by the absence of a prematurity code.

The index date for determining 90-day readmission was the discharge date of the birth hospitalization. For cause of readmission, we used the principal diagnosis code and all secondary diagnosis codesand chose a priori to focus on medical problems common to infants with NOWS noted in prior research. For determining whether infants died during a readmission, we used the discharge disposition information in the NRD data.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^bf8fac0a]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In the critically-ill newborn population, the proportion of male patients was 57.7%, 60.6%, and 57.7% in the Broad, MCA/ID/DD/E, and Conservative populations, respectively, compared with 49.7% in the control cohort (P < 0.01 for all comparisons; Table 1). As in the pediatric population, critically-ill newborns generally had higher rates of comorbidities, including respiratory failure (up to five times higher), feeding problems (up to six times higher), lung contusion (up to 54 times higher), asphyxia (up to 17 times higher), pneumonia (up to four times higher), septicemia (up to 13 times higher), and shock (up to 96 times higher) (Supplemental Table 2). In the Broad cohort, Congenital anomalies were the most common clinical presentation, representing 62.7% of patients (Table 1). Other common presentations were: conditions presenting in the perinatal period (e.g. abnormal neonatal screening, some cardiac conditions, hypotonia, and others; 11.9%); and endocrine/metabolic (5.8%). In the subset of the population with MCA/ID/DD/E, the vast majority (86.4%) were MCA. The absence of ID/DD was expected, although the proportion with neurological presentations such as hypotonia, epilepsy, or seizure disorders was low (2.2%). Finally, in the Conservative population, the most common clinical presentations were congenital anomalies (51.6%), conditions presenting in the perinatal period (10.6%), and endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic conditions (10.0%). As above, these represent a population-based distribution of what types of patients have a suspicious ICD-9 or 10 code and received genetic testing.

### Prevalence and burden of illness of treated hemolytic neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in a privately insured population in the United States [^fb93f5a5]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Design and data source

This retrospective matched cohort study used the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD SM), a geographically dispersed managed-care repository with claims data on more than 45 million enrollees residing across all 50 states, to identify infants born from 01/01/2011 through 08/31/2017. The HIRD is one of the largest privately insured population databases in the U.S. This observational study was exempt from informed consent stipulations as researchers accessed a limited data set without individual enrollee identifiers and only summary statistics were reported. The study complied with all relevant provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

Study population

Newborns were linked to their birth mothers via shared health plan subscriber identification (ID) numbers. Mothers’ delivery dates were verified within 32 days of newborns’ dates of birth using delivery codes (Appendix : Table 7). Infants with 30-day or longer continuous enrollment after birth and mothers with at least 12 months of continuous health plan enrollment before delivery were included. All newborns, regardless of their estimated gestational age (GA), were included for NHB prevalence estimation. The treated hemolytic NHB and matched non-NHB cohorts were selected among newborns ≥35 weeks GA. We excluded newborns < 35 weeks GA as there was no clinical practice guidelines available for this group due to lack of evidence-based data, variabilities in clinical manifestations, and uncertainties about treatment benefits.

NHB population was defined as newborns with ≥1 International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10-CM diagnostic codes of NHB (ICD-9-CM = 773.0, 773.1, 773.2, 773.4, 774.x and ICD-10-CM = P55.x, P57.x, P58.x, P59.x) during the first 30 days after birth. Newborns with ≥1 ICD-9/10-CM diagnosis codes of ICD-9-CM = 773.0, 773.1, 773.2, 773.4, 774.0, 774.1, 774.7 and ICD-10-CM = P55.x, P57.x, P58.0, P58.1, P58.8, P58.9 were selected for the population of NHB with hemolysis indicators or hemolytic NHB (Appendix : Table 8).

### Causes of death and associated conditions (codac): a utilitarian approach to the classification of perinatal deaths [^4e816dc2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

A carefully classified dataset of perinatal mortality will retain the most significant information on the causes of death. Such information is needed for health care policy development, surveillance and international comparisons, clinical services and research. For comparability purposes, we propose a classification system that could serve all these needs, and be applicable in both developing and developed countries. It is developed to adhere to basic concepts of underlying cause in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), although gaps in ICD prevent classification of perinatal deaths solely on existing ICD codes.We tested the Causes of Death and Associated Conditions (Codac) classification for perinatal deaths in seven populations, including two developing country settings. We identified areas of potential improvements in the ability to retain existing information, ease of use and inter-rater agreement. After revisions to address these issues we propose Version II of Codac with detailed coding instructions.The ten main categories of Codac consist of three key contributors to global perinatal mortality (intrapartum events, infections and congenital anomalies), two crucial aspects of perinatal mortality (unknown causes of death and termination of pregnancy), a clear distinction of conditions relevant only to the neonatal period and the remaining conditions are arranged in the four anatomical compartments (fetal, cord, placental and maternal).For more detail there are 94 subcategories, further specified in 577 categories in the full version. Codac is designed to accommodate both the main cause of death as well as two associated conditions. We suggest reporting not only the main cause of death, but also the associated relevant conditions so that scenarios of combined conditions and events are captured.The appropriately applied Codac system promises to better manage information on causes of perinatal deaths, the conditions associated with them, and the most common clinical scenarios for future study and comparisons.

### Causes of death in children with congenital anomalies up to age 10 in eight European countries [^5dd26ef5]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Classification of cause of death

All causes of death were recorded using ICD-10 or ICD-9. Four registries were able to provide only the underlying cause of death. Other registries were able to report in addition to the underlying cause of death the primary/immediate cause of death, contributing cause of death and any other causes of death.

Deaths were categorised into neonatal (0–27 days), postneonatal (28–364 days) and child (365–3651 days). In England and Wales, the underlying cause for neonatal deaths was not specified and each cause was classified as related to infant, mother or either; main causes were listed before other (secondary) causes. For this study, in Wales, the first cause of death related to the infant was taken to be the underlying cause of death. In England, the first mention of a CA (if present) was taken to be the underlying cause.

Seven categories of cause of neonatal and post-neonatal deaths, based on a modified version of the UK Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) classification of neonatal and postneonatal causes of deathwere used in this study (see online supplemental appendix A). The ‘All other conditions’ group was very heterogeneous. It included neoplasms, metabolic disorders, jaundice and endocrine disorders, and external causes.

Similarly, the classification of cause of death for children aged 1–9 in this study was based on the UK ONS classification of causes of deathand was divided into 13 categories (see online supplemental appendix B).

To determine the accuracy of the CA recorded on death certificates, two paediatricians agreed a set of ICD-10 and ICD-9 codes corresponding to an ‘exact match’ for the child’s anomaly and a larger set of codes that were considered as an ‘acceptable match’ (see online supplemental appendix C). For example, for a child with spina bifida (ICD-10 code-Q05), if Q05 was on the death certificate this was considered an exact code; if there were codes for other neural tube defects Q00 (anencephaly) or Q01 (encephalocele) they were considered as acceptable codes. All the available causes of death were searched to determine if any exact or acceptable anomaly codes had been specified.

### Respiratory syncytial virus is the leading cause of United States infant hospitalizations, 2009-2019: a study of the national (nationwide) inpatient sample [^1ccc81e9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Population

The unit of analysis in this study was infant (<1 year) hospitalizations from January 2009 to December 2019. All newborn birth hospitalizations, the most common reason for inpatient hospital stays among infants, were excluded by ICD-9 (V30.XX–V39.XX) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (Z38.XX) codes. RSV hospitalization was identified by a primary diagnosis of RSV (ICD-9 : 079.6 or ICD-10 : B97.4); pneumonia due to RSV (ICD-9 : 480.1 or ICD-10 : J12.1); acute bronchiolitis due to RSV (ICD-9 : 466.11 or ICD-10 : J21.0); or acute bronchitis due to RSV (ICD-10 : J20.5). Bronchiolitis hospitalization was identified by a primary diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis due to other specified organisms (ICD-9 : 466.19 or ICD-10 : J21.8) or acute bronchiolitis, unspecified (ICD-10 : J21.9).

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification—ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is “especially relevant to pediatrics,” crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are “not one-to-one,” and DC: 0–5 “is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set” but “is intended to complement ICD-10-CM” with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Newborn health and child mortality across england [^a5d32f7b]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Neonatal Conditions

Infants who received care in a neonatal unit after birth and those who died on the first day of life were considered to have evidence of neonatal illness after birth. In addition, evidence of 3 specific neonatal conditions was identified using data from the death notification form, CDOP review, or BadgerNet record. First, preterm infants were defined as those born before 37 weeks’ gestation, plus those with a coded admission definition of preterm in the BadgerNet fields or text strings (ie, principal diagnosis at discharge, neurological diagnosis, cause of death [1a, 1b, or 2], principal reason for admission, and cause of death) (eTable 1 in Supplement 1) in the discharge record, or NCMD codes (ie, notification details, suspected cause of death, and cause of death [1a, 1b, or 2]) if death occurred in the first day of life, or from the CDOP review cause of death (immaturity or prematurity). Children without evidence of premature birth were assumed to not be preterm. Second, infants were identified as having likely hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) from text codes (eTable 1 in Supplement 1) or from the CDOP review final category of cause of death (ie, perinatal asphyxia or HIE). Third, congenital anomalies were identified as per the dedicated field within the BadgerNet record, by the presence of 1 of more text codes (eTable 1 in Supplement 1) or from the CDOP review final category of cause of death (ie, chromosomal, genetic, and congenital abnormality). Where 1 record identified a neonatal condition (eg, a recorded gestation of 35 weeks), this was sufficient to allocate the death to that group.

Chronic Conditions

For all deaths, other underlying childhood conditions were identified using NHS Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data for admitted patient care. NHS numbers contained in the notification of the deaths in NCMD were used to link to HES data, where all valid diagnosis codes (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10]) for all admissions for each child were used to identify relevant conditions, using clusters of codes identified from previous work.

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^e49a0c92]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death diagnostic shift and ICD categorization—Inconsistent reporting and changes in understanding have led to a diagnostic shift away from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) toward undetermined cause and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, creating variability in attribution and difficulty differentiating explained versus unexplained causes. For mortality surveillance in the United States, sudden infant death causes are grouped into SIDS (ICD-10 code R95), unknown or unspecified causes (ICD-10 code R99), and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD-10 code W75), which are included under sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) to allow consistent monitoring of mortality trends that include both explained and unexplained causes. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes are applied to cause-of-death determinations but may not reflect the certifier’s intent; the ICD-10-CM was adapted from the ICD-10 for morbidity reporting in US health care settings, and the ICD-10, not the ICD-10-CM, is used for official reporting of mortality statistics in the United States and other nations.

### Validation of ICD-10-CM codes for injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium: a medical record review [^46dfe7de]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

The ability of the O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify true injury cases is unknown. Furthermore, per the ICD-10-CM guidelines for Coding and Reporting,codes from Chapter 15, PCP (O00-O9A) ‘have sequencing priority over codes from other chapters. Additional codes from other chapters may be used in conjunction with Chapter 15 codes to further specify conditions.’ Specifically, O9A.2 ‘should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate injury, poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or under-dosing code, and then the additional code(s) that specifies the condition caused by the poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or underdosing’.Similarly, O9A.3-O9A.4 should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate codes to identify any associated current injury due to physical abuse or sexual abuse. However, it has not been studied how often and why the O9A.2-O9A.5 are listed as a secondary diagnosis, and what percentage of injuries complicating pregnancy-related outcomes are potentially missed when the definition for injury hospitalisations captures only principal diagnoses of O9A.2-O9A.5.

ICD-10-CM coding of inpatient and emergency department discharge data follows guidelines for assigning a principal diagnosis. In inpatient data, the principal diagnosis is defined as ‘that condition established after study to be the chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care’.This definition does not apply to hospital-based outpatient services, including emergency department visits. In outpatient settings, the first-listed diagnosis represents ‘the code for the diagnosis, condition, problem or other reason for the encounter/visit shown in the medical record as chiefly responsible for the service provided. In some cases the first-listed diagnosis may be a symptom when a diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the physician’.

This analysis evaluates the ability of O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify injuries in inpatient and emergency department discharge claims from one healthcare facility in Kentucky, looking additionally at the codes’ positive predictive value (PPV) when used as a principal diagnosis within inpatient data, as a secondary diagnosis within inpatient data, and in any position within emergency department data.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment—Pediatricians “should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child’s conditions and complexity,” and when “sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity.” Furthermore, payers “should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice.” New payment models “incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness,” and such risk-based models “must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs.” To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, “claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service,” exceeding “the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms.”

Brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)—implementation and quality improvement describe education through AAP communication outlets and stakeholder organizations, with a Web-based toolkit including caregiver handouts and a shared decision-making tool and efforts to address disease classification and diagnosis coding. Clinical workflow support includes an algorithm for diagnosis and management, structured history and physical examination templates to address relevant risk factors for BRUEs, and order sets and modified documents hosted on a Web-based learning platform that promotes crowd-sourcing. Administrative guidance notes that International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, diagnostic codes are used for billing, quality improvement, and research, that new codes for lower- and higher-risk BRUEs will need to be developed, and that in the interim the current code for an ALTE (799.82) will need to be used for billing purposes. Quality improvement initiatives providing Maintenance of Certification credit (e.g., AAP’s PREP and EQIPP) and collaborative opportunities through AAP Quality Improvement Innovation Networks will engage clinicians, with proposed measures including process evaluation, outcome assessment, and balancing issues, and future research needed to validate measures.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Specificity of international classification of diseases codes for bronchopulmonary dysplasia: an investigation using electronic health record data and a large insurance database [^14631499]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes in electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly used for health services research, in spite of unknown diagnostic accuracy. The accuracy of ICD codes to identify bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study in a single-center NICU (n=166) to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of ICD-10 codes for the diagnosis of BPD. Analysis of large insurance claims database (n=7887) to determine date of assignment of the code.

Results

The sensitivity of any BPD-related ICD codes ranged from 0.82 to 0.95, while the specificity ranged from 0.25 to 0.36. In a large national insurance database, the most common date of ICD-9 or ICD-10 code assignment was the day of birth, which is inconsistent with the clinical definition.

Conclusions

ICD codes registered for BPD are unlikely to accurately reflect the current clinical definition and should be interpreted with caution.

### Communicating exploratory unsupervised machine learning analysis in age clustering for paediatric disease [^7707a3b7]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2024). High credibility.

Data exclusions

As part of standard disclosure control procedure, extremely rare diagnoses (those with fewer than five patients with the condition in the dataset) were excluded from further analysis as well as those with invalid ICD-10 codes (assumption 3). Prenatal diagnosis referrals were excluded (assumption 4). ICD-10 codes from chapters ‘XVIII Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified’, ‘XIX Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes’, ‘XX External causes of morbidity and mortality’, ‘XXI Factors influencing health status and contact with health services’ and ‘XXII Codes for special purposes’ were excluded from the analysis since the aim was to examine age distributions and associations of only primary medical conditions (assumption 5). For the purposes of clustering only, diagnoses with a prevalence less than or equal to 0.01% (by unique number of patients) were excluded to reduce noise (assumption 6). Refer to online supplemental appendix for a more detailed breakdown of the exclusion process. For the purposes of the study the term ‘diagnoses’ refers only to those selected through the cohort and data specification described earlier; no independent or objective phenotyping was performed.

### An aetiological classification of birth defects for epidemiological research [^265f500e]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital anomaly registers collect data on antenatally and postnatally detected anomalies for surveillance, research, and public health purposes. Each anomaly is coded using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9/ICD-10) based on body systems, allowing accurate comparisons between registers for individual anomalies. When commencing an environmental, epidemiological study, it became clear to us that there is no standard classification that takes aetiology into account. This paper describes a new classification for use in studies addressing aetiology.

Method

A classification system was evolved and piloted using cases in a study of geographical variation in congenital anomaly prevalence.1 Cases that were difficult to categorise were noted, and after discussion with a team of experts, the classification was adjusted accordingly.

Results and Conclusion

A robust, hierarchical method of classifying birth defects into eight categories has been produced, for use at source of data registration in conjunction with, but independent of, ICD coding.

### Maternal disease factors associated with neonatal jaundice: a case-control study [^55b68a04]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source and variables

The National Health Insurance Service–National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) established by the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea was used. This database (DB) is a representative sample that randomly selected 1 million people, accounting for about 2.2% of the Korean population in 2002. Moreover, it contains sample data obtained from 2002 to 2013. In this study, the qualification DB and treatment DB of the NHIS-NSC were used. Five variables of the qualification DB (patient ID, sex, year, age, and income rank), five variables of statement data (patient ID, claim number, visit date, principal diagnosis, and additional diagnosis), and three variables of type of disease data (claim number, visit date, and diagnosis) in the treatment DB were utilized. Age is divided into 19 groups from 0 to 85 years old at 5-year intervals (age 0, 1–4, 5–9, …, and over 84). As the age of participants considered in this study was 15–49 years old, it was regrouped subsequently into three groups with ages 15–24, 25–34, and 35–49. The income rank is divided into 11 groups at deciles with medical aid beneficiaries, and it was regrouped into 5 groups at 20% intervals. Variables about diagnosis were distinguished using the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases, version 6 (KCD-6), which is the Korean modified version of the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10).

All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

### Pediatric high-impact conditions in the United States: retrospective analysis of hospitalizations and associated resource use [^0bb7a39d]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a retrospective study of children 0–18 years of age hospitalized with one or more of the ten leading causes of child death in 2006. Our data source was the 2006 version of the Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID), developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The database contains discharge records for nearly 3 million pediatric discharge records obtained from 3,739 hospitals in 38 states. The KID is the only national, all-payer database of hospitalizations for children and contains 80% of the normal non-newborn discharges and 10% of uncomplicated in-hospital births, from participating states. Each record in the KID contains multiple variables, including patient demographics, diagnosis-related groups, up to 15 International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure and diagnosis codes, and vital status at hospital discharge. Each record also includes a sample weight to allow for generation of nationally representative estimates.

Study sample and variable identification

Hospitalizations for the ten leading causes of child death in 2006 were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes in either the primary or secondary diagnosis fields, with the subsequent exclusion of diagnoses deemed not amenable to hospital care, including sudden infant death syndrome, homicide and suicide, because these three conditions often result in death prior to arrival in the hospital setting. The ten leading conditions of child death (and their corresponding ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes) in 2006 included: perinatal conditions (760.0-779.9), congenital malformations (740.0-759.9), chronic lower respiratory disease (277.0, 490–496), influenza & pneumonia (480–487), injury (800.00-959.99), malignant neoplasm (140.0-209.9), heart disease (390.0-398.9, 402, 404.9-429.9), benign neoplasm (210.0-239.9), septicemia (038, 995.92, 995.91, 771.81, 995.94, 790.7), and cerebrovascular disease (430–438).

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID—Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients’ specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of “U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified” should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient’s specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

3.2 Improving comparable reporting of deaths in the perinatal period

ICD‐11 provides guidance for the minimum data required to enable between country comparison. Individual countries, or subnational regions, may have additional reporting priorities and require a wider range of data to be collected. However, to enable valid international comparisons ICD‐11 recommends that local and national registration and reporting procedures should be arranged to ensure that the events and the criteria for their inclusion in the statistics for international comparison can be easily identified and extracted for global reporting.

Neonatal death

A neonatal death is a death during the first 28 completed days after live birth (days 0–27).

Groupings by chronological age

An early neonatal death is a death during the first 7 completed days after live birth (days 0–6).

A late neonatal death is a death 7–27 days after live birth.

2.3 Recommendations for recording of perinatal events

Reporting requirements for mortality statistics differ from individual‐level recording requirements to guide clinical care. To facilitate accurate reporting ICD‐11 recommends a minimum perinatal dataset be recorded for all births, including stillbirths, with gestational age and birth weight recorded to the degree of accuracy to which they measured (Table S1). Gestational age should ideally be recorded in days. If recorded in weeks, separate register columns for completed weeks and number of days since last completed week are recommended. For accurate birth weight reporting, record the actual weight measured (ideally using a calibrated electronic weighing scale to the nearest 10 g) instead of using pre‐defined weight categories (e.g. 500 g groupings) employed for statistical tabulation. Record chronological age at death in completed minutes or hours for the first 24 h (day 0), then days thereafter (days 1–27).

### Chronic conditions in children and young people: learning from administrative data [^bc61d426]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Development : Sources of ICD codes for chronic conditions were (1) a literature review of studies using ICD coding for chronic conditions in children using administrative health databases; (2) a systematic search of all ICD-10 codes; (3) analysis of codes in longitudinal cohorts of children with known chronic conditions to detect codes not previously included; and (4) examination of codes recorded for children with no apparent chronic conditions. The list of codes and groupings were reviewed by an independent panel of clinicians, and a further panel of experts in the epidemiology of chronic conditions in children using administrative health databases.

Feudtner classification

Definition : Any medical condition that can reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or one organ system severely enough to require specialty paediatric care and probably some period of hospitalisation in a tertiary care centre.

Data sources : Originally developed for use on cause of death on death records, but has subsequently been applied in hospital admission and emergency department data.

Coding system : First classification was developed using ICD-9 codes, but has now been updated for ICD-10. The codes are grouped into 10 (previously 9) groups based on body system or disease origin (eg, neonatal conditions). Examples of conditions include cerebral palsy, epilepsy (not including benign childhood epilepsy (G40.0) and petit mal (G40.7)), organ transplantation, dependence on devices. Does not include asthma or mental health problems such as depression or self-harm.

Development : The original classification was developed using the following steps:(1) development of initial list (based on clinical experience); (2) literature review of studies identifying children with high-cost conditions; and (3) initial analyses of cause of death in children without complex chronic conditions.

2.6 Death certification

Accurate child mortality data (including stillbirths) requires complete recording, reporting, and classification of births and deaths. ICD‐11 recommends cause of death certificates for all perinatal deaths, fetal or neonatal, using the standardized international form which has a dedicated “Fetal or Infant Death” section (Table S2).

Every effort should be made by death certifiers to differentiate between stillbirth (following a fetal death) and neonatal death (following a live birth), using information from the medical records, labor ward registers, perinatal audit and other sources.

### Heterogeneity in racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 severity among pediatric inpatients in a national healthcare database [^a35f9fe1]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Setting and Population

This study used a retrospective cohort extracted from the Premier Healthcare Database (Premier), which contains information on inpatient encounters from geographically diverse hospitals across the USA. Since 2012, Premier has included more than 11 million inpatient encounters per year. Outpatient and emergency department encounters are included from clinics within the same health system as participating hospitals, and unique patients can be tracked within each health system. Premier includes patient-, service-, and provider-level information, including International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, and charge master data that provide descriptions of diagnoses and services provided in the hospital. Data are considered deidentified in accordance with the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the Institutional Review Board at Children’s Minnesota determined that this study was not human subjects research.

The initial data query from Premier included all encounters with ICD-10 code U07.1 for a COVID-19 diagnosis occurring from January 2020 through September 2022 among patients less than 19 years old. For patients meeting these criteria, all patient encounters from the time frame were included in the extract. From this initial query, the cohort for this study included inpatient admissions with primary diagnosis of COVID-19 between April 2020 and September 2022. Additional exclusion criteria were patients with diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (ie, ICD-10 code M35.81), nonemergency/nonurgent admissions (ie, elective, newborn, trauma center, or unknown), and patients with unknown sex, race, or ethnicity. Only the first inpatient encounter with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 was included.

Data Definitions

Outcome measures of COVID-19 severity during an encounter were intensive care unit (ICU) admission or ventilator use as identified from charge master data. Race and ethnicity were determined from standardized billing forms (ie, UB-04); race was reported as White, Black, Asian, other, or unknown; and ethnicity was reported as Hispanic, not Hispanic, or unknown. For this study, race and ethnicity were categorized into three groups: the reference group of non-Hispanic White, Hispanic (of any race), and non-Hispanic Black (henceforth, the “non-Hispanic” descriptor will be implicit), similar to categorizations used in prior COVID-19 severity studies. Sample sizes for the remaining racial groups were insufficiently powered to detect effect modification.

### Consensus recommendations for optimizing electronic health records for nutrition care [^681631bc]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2020). High credibility.

Nutrition diagnosis and malnutrition coding—nutrition screening and assessment identify problems requiring treatment, and the Academy’s Nutrition Care Process utilizes nutrition diagnoses to standardize nutrition diagnostic terminology; a nutrition diagnosis as defined by the Academy describes a specific nutrition problem that can be improved or resolved through nutrition interventions. The domains of nutrition diagnoses include “intake,” “clinical,” and “behavioral-environmental” as defined on-page, while a medical diagnosis is used by health care providers and coders as described in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Malnutrition is one nutrition clinical domain and medical diagnosis (ICD-10 code) that affects patient care as well as appropriate coding, billing, and reimbursement; patients can be diagnosed with malnutrition in any health care setting, organizations should adopt explicit malnutrition criteria that all health care professionals can apply consistently, and the Academy and ASPEN published recommended criteria for the identification of adult and pediatric malnutrition.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) definition—In 2008, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expert panel established a surveillance-oriented definition using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 codes “that could be uniformly implemented,” defining AHT as “injury to the skull or intracranial contents of an infant or young child (<5 years of age) due to inflicted blunt impact and/or violent shaking.” The report notes the definition was engineered for “public health surveillance and research,” is intentionally broad and “not confined to exclusively intracranial findings,” and states this breadth helps reduce heuristic application of variables to diagnosis, minimizing circularity in research.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^d3607865]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite efforts to reduce stillbirths and neonatal deaths, inconsistent definitions and reporting practices continue to hamper global progress. Existing data frequently being limited in terms of quality and comparability across countries. This paper addresses this critical issue by outlining the new International Classification of Disease (ICD-11) recommendations for standardized recording and reporting of perinatal deaths to improve data accuracy and international comparison. Key advancements in ICD-11 include using gestational age as the primary threshold to for reporting, clearer guidance on measurement and recording of gestational age, and reporting mortality rates by gestational age subgroups to enable country comparisons to include similar populations (e.g., all births from 154days [22 +0 weeks] or from 196days [28 +0 weeks]). Furthermore, the revised ICD-11 guidance provides further clarification around the exclusion of terminations of pregnancy (induced abortions) from perinatal mortality statistics. Implementing standardized recording and reporting methods laid out in ICD-11 will be crucial for accurate global data on stillbirths and perinatal deaths. Such high-quality data would both allow appropriate regional and international comparisons to be made and serve as a resource to improve clinical practice and epidemiological and health surveillance, enabling focusing of limited programmatic and research funds towards ending preventable deaths and improving outcomes for every woman and every baby, everywhere.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Association of punitive and reporting state policies related to substance use in pregnancy with rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome [^ec9e8ecd]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Sample, Outcome, and Neonate-Level Covariates

Hospitalizations with deliveries resulting in live births (hereafter, neonates) were identified in the State Inpatient Databases using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)diagnosis codes V30.00 to V30.01, V31.00 to V31.01, V32.00 to V32.01, V33.00 to V33.01, V34.00 to V34.01, V35.00 to V35.01, V36.00 to V36.01, V37.00 to V37.01, V38.00 to V38.01, or V39.00 to V39.01. Neonates were identified as having NAS if their health record included the ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 779.5. Consistent with prior studies,,,, to exclude potentially iatrogenic cases of NAS (ie, neonates received opioids postnatally and had subsequent withdrawal), we excluded neonates with a birthweight of less than 1500 g or ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 772.10 to 772.14 (intraventricular hemorrhage), 779.7 (periventricular leukomalacia), 777.50 to 777.53 (necrotizing enterocolitis), 777.6 (spontaneous intestinal perforation), 770.7 (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), or 854.0 to 854.1 (intracranial injury).Neonates were excluded if birthweight was missing or if they had ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes corresponding to preterm births or extreme immaturity with subclassifications for birthweight less than 1500 g (ie, 765.11 to 765.15 or 765.01 to 765.05).

To control for individual factors with known associations with NAS, we identified neonate sex and created an indicator for preterm births (if ICD-9-CM code 765.0x or 765.1x was present).We also examined race/ethnicity as reported by the hospital (ie, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other or unknown) and expected primary payer for the birth hospitalization (ie, commercial, public coverage, or uninsured or self-pay). We excluded neonates who were missing data on sex or payer and those living in counties missing a 2003 Rural-Urban Classification Code (RUCC).

### Coding update of the SMFM definition of low risk for cesarean delivery from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM [^9ece1f72]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine developed a low risk for cesarean delivery definition based on administrative claims-based diagnosis codes described by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition is a clinical enrichment of 2 available measures from the Joint Commission and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine measure excludes diagnosis codes that represent clinically relevant risk factors that are absolute or relative contraindications to vaginal birth while retaining diagnosis codes such as labor disorders that are discretionary risk factors for cesarean delivery. The introduction of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification in October 2015 expanded the number of available diagnosis codes and enabled a greater depth and breadth of clinical description. These coding improvements further enhance the clinical validity of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition and its potential utility in tracking progress toward the goal of safely lowering the US cesarean delivery rate. This report updates the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition of low risk for cesarean delivery using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification coding.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^fd9e61cf]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Cause of death reporting

The present review has focused on the reporting of the death event and timing of the death, not the cause of death. Reporting of perinatal deaths by timing is an important marker of quality of care.At a minimum it requires assessment of fetal heart rate on admission in labor and vital status at birth, both of which should be routinely assessed for births in a facility by the healthcare provider. However, whilst these are usually assessed by health workers, although vital status at birth is recorded in routine data systems few low‐ and middle‐income settings record fetal heart rate on admission. Further efforts are needed to capture these data in health records and registers and provision made for these data to be collated for reporting at a local, regional and national level. Improving its measurement should be the first step towards enhancing data for deaths in the perinatal period, investments will also be needed in improving data around cause of death. Whilst accurate reporting of levels and timings of deaths in the perinatal period give high‐level insights into potential areas to target health systems investments, for example, if very high levels of intrapartum stillbirths are observed investment in referral and emergency obstetric and neonatal care systems could be targeted. However, to inform investments into targeted programmatic action and to close remaining implementation and biomedical research gaps will require investment to further understanding of the individual causes of death.

ICD‐11 also covers the standardized reporting of the causes of death in the perinatal period. In 2016 for the previous version of ICD, ICD‐10, WHO produced guidance for a standardized system for classifying causes of stillbirth and neonatal deaths globally: “The WHO application of ICD‐10 to deaths during the perinatal period: ICD‐PM.”This is an important step towards comparable estimates of cause of deaths in the perinatal period, especially for stillbirths where large number of classification systems current in use have limited comparability.However, a recent review found that ICD‐PM is applied inconsistently and suggesting possible solutions such as including a category for perinatal deaths of unknown timing, providing clearer explanations for consistent coding, and highlighting potential pitfalls of the system.Updated global guidance on classifying perinatal deaths according to the new ICD‐11 guidance, incorporating experiences and learnings from users of the ICD‐10 version, would be an important next step towards comparable cause of death estimates for this period.

### How accurate are international classification of diseases-10 diagnosis codes in detecting influenza and pertussis hospitalizations in children? [^97eec132]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Influenza and pertussis are major causes of pediatric morbidity. We measured the accuracy of their International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-AM) diagnosis codes using linked population-based laboratory and hospital data in 245,249 children. Influenza diagnosis codes had high specificity (98.6%) and modest positive predictive value (PPV; 84.1%) and sensitivity (86.1%, 95% CI: 83.4%-88.6%) for a laboratory-confirmed episode. For pertussis diagnosis codes, PPV (86.8%) and specificity (98.9%) were high, but sensitivity was poor (27.8%, 95% CI: 23.5%-32.4%). Measures varied according to age, remoteness, Aboriginality, severity, and detection method. Both laboratory and hospitalization data are needed to accurately determine the burden of pediatric influenza and pertussis.

### Neonatal outcomes according to different glucose threshold values in gestational diabetes: a register-based study [^53ff6696]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Study population and GDM groups

This study included singleton pregnant women who underwent an OGTT performed at 4–40 weeks of gestation during 2009. Women with pre-pregnancy type 1 or type 2 diabetes (ICD-10 codes E10–E11, E13, E14.9 or O24.0–O24.3) according to the MBR were excluded.

Women who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the IADPSG or NICE without meeting the Finnish criteria were untreated (Table 1). The treated groups met both the Finnish criteria for GDM and those of the IADPSG or NICE. Controls were normoglycemic according to all criteria. The untreated groups were compared to the normoglycaemic controls and to the treated GDM groups.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a composite of adverse neonatal outcomes comprising hypoglycaemia (ICD-10: P70.0–70.9), hyperbilirubinaemia (ICD-10: P59.0–59.9), birth trauma (Erb’s palsy [ICD-10: P14.0] or clavicle fracture [ICD-10: P13.4]) or perinatal mortality, which was defined as stillbirth or early neonatal death during the 7-day period after delivery. The secondary outcomes were the outcomes in the composite, which were analysed independently.

In all newborns exposed to GDM, glucose concentration was advised to be measured six times during the first 48 h. Hypoglycaemia was treated with intravenous glucose if a single plasma glucose measurement was ≤ 1.4 mmol/L or when the initial glucose concentration was 1.5–2.5 mmol/L and remained ≤ 2.5 mmol/L after supplementary feeding. In addition to GDM, other potential indications of a need for neonatal glucose screening in asymptomatic newborns included preterm birth, a birth weight of < 2.5 kg or > 4.5 kg or maternal use of β-blockers. A diagnosis of hypoglycaemia was recorded in the MBR if a newborn required any interventions for the condition such as intravenous glucose, although there are no unified diagnostic criteria for neonatal hypoglycaemia in Finland.

### Association between infant mortality attributable to birth defects and payment source for delivery-United States, 2011-2013 [^927dcad4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

This analysis used 2011–2013 Linked Birth and Infant Death Data from the National Vital Statistics System * for infants aged <1 year born to U.S. residents. The 2003 revision of the birth certificate included information on the payment source for delivery for the first time; thus, analysis of this variable was limited to states that adopted the 2003 revision. In 2011, 33 states and the District of Columbia (DC) (representing 76% of U.S. births) used the 2003 revision; in 2012, 36 states and DC (83%) used the revision, and in 2013, 38 states and DC used the revision (86%). Approximately 1.0%–1.2% of infant death records could not be linked to their corresponding birth certificates. The linkage completion by state ranged from 95.5%–100%, with approximately 50% of states linking all of their records each year. To accommodate nonlinked death records, estimates of the number of infant deaths for each state were weighted according to the percentage of records linked to a birth certificate by state and age group at death. Gestational age was based on last menstrual period (LMP). Birth and death records with unknown gestational age, gestational age of <20 weeks or >44 weeks, and implausible combinations of gestational age and birthweight were excluded (7.9% of infant deaths and 1.2% of live births). Births not covered by Medicaid or private insurance (18.8% of infant deaths and 17.1% of live births) were included in the totals used for rate calculations. Deaths attributable to major birth defects were defined as those for which the underlying cause of death on the death certificate was classified as a birth defect according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes Q00.0–Q99.9. Exceptions included the following: undescended testicles (Q53.1, Q53.2, and Q53.9) or cardiovascular conditions that were not considered structural heart defects (Q27.0–Q28.9); preterm births with an underlying cause of death considered to be a complication of prematurity (i.e. lung hypoplasia [Q33.6], persistent foramen ovale [PFO, Q21.1], and patent ductus arteriosus [PDA, Q25.0]); and all neonatal deaths among term infants with PFO or PDA as the underlying cause.

### Maternal characteristics and rates of unexpected complications in term newborns by hospital [^c1ccb551]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The Joint Commission Unexpected Complications in Term Newborns measure characterizes newborn morbidity potentially associated with quality of labor and delivery care. Infant exclusions isolate relatively low-risk births, but unexpected newborn complications (UNCs) are not adjusted for maternal factors that may be associated with outcomes independently of hospital quality.

Objective

To investigate the association between maternal characteristics and hospital UNC rates.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study was conducted using linked 2016 to 2018 New York City birth and hospital discharge datasets among 254 259 neonates at low risk (singleton, ≥37 weeks, birthweight ≥2500 g, and without preexisting fetal conditions) at 39 hospitals. Logistic regression was used to calculate unadjusted hospital-specific UNC rates and replicated analyses adjusting for maternal covariates. Hospitals were categorized into UNC quintiles; changes in quintile ranking with maternal adjustment were examined. Data analyses were performed from December 2022 to July 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

UNCs were classified according to Joint Commission International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) criteria. Maternal preadmission comorbidities, obstetric factors, social characteristics, and hospital characteristics were ascertained.

Results

Among 254 259 singleton births at 37 weeks or later who were at low risk (125 245 female [49.3%] and 129 014 male [50.7%]; 71 768 births [28.2%] to Hispanic, 47 226 births [18.7%] to non-Hispanic Asian, 42 682 births [16.8%] to non-Hispanic Black, and 89 845 births [35.3%] to non-Hispanic White mothers and 2738 births [1.0%] to mothers with another race or ethnicity), 148 393 births (58.4%) were covered by Medicaid and 101 633 births (40.0%) were covered by commercial insurance. The 2016 to 2018 cumulative UNC incidence in New York City hospitals was 37.1 UNCs per 1000 births. Infants of mothers with preadmission risk factors had increased UNC risk; for example, among mothers with vs without preeclampsia, there were 104.4 and 35.8 UNCs per 1000 births, respectively. Among hospitals, unadjusted UNC rates ranged from 15.6 to 215.5 UNCs per 1000 births and adjusted UNC rates ranged from 15.6 to 194.0 UNCs per 1000 births (median [IQR] change from adjustment, 1.4 [-4.7 to 1.0] UNCs/1000 births). The median (IQR) change per 1000 births for adjusted vs unadjusted rates showed that hospitals with low (<601 deliveries/year; -2.8 [-7.0 to -1.6] UNCs) to medium (601 to <954 deliveries/year; -3.9 [-7.1 to -1.9] UNCs) delivery volume, public ownership (-3.6 [-6.2 to -2.3] UNCs), or high proportions of Medicaid-insured (eg, ≥90.72%; -3.7 [-5.3 to -1.9] UNCs), Black (eg, ≥32.83%; -5.3 [-9.1 to -2.2] UNCs), or Hispanic (eg, ≥6.25%; -3.7 [-5.3 to -1.9] UNCs) patients had significantly decreased UNC rates after adjustment, while rates increased or did not change in hospitals with the highest delivery volume, private ownership, or births to predominantly White or privately insured individuals. Among all 39 hospitals, 7 hospitals (17.9%) shifted 1 quintile comparing risk-adjusted with unadjusted quintile rankings.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, adjustment for maternal case mix was associated with small overall changes in hospital UNC rates. These changes were associated with performance assessment for some hospitals, and these results suggest that profiling on this measure should consider the implications of small changes in rates for hospitals with higher-risk obstetric populations.

### Positive predictive value of, and, codes for identification of congenital heart defects [^5251385b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Differences in coding practices between administrative and clinical databases can lead to differences in case ascertainment and, subsequently, prevalence and outcome estimations.A hierarchal algorithm of 17 CHD subgroups found that the concordance statistic for the code hierarchy alone was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.77–0.80) and improved to 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88–0.90) after age, encounter type, and provider type were included in the algorithm.Therefore, algorithms and hierarchies,,,accounting for limitations of administrative coding are often applied to restrict a cohort to those individuals most likely to have the condition of interest, at the expense of unintentional exclusion of true cases from the data set.

Because of limitations in administrative data, restrictive case definitions may underestimate patients with CHD; however, unrestrictive case definitions that include the broader code groups 745.xx to 747.xx and Q20.x to Q26.x may overestimate patients with CHD. To understand limitations of and improve the quality of administrative data for CHD surveillance, we evaluated the PPV of select ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10‐CM CHD codes in 2 data sources and compared features associated with both true‐positive (TP) and FP cases.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^14409d67]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification—ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^a36ea6dd]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2 
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included.These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold.Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups.,,,, This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Positive predictive value of, and, codes for identification of congenital heart defects [^33cdf326]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background Administrative data permit analysis of large cohorts but rely on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ( ICD-9-CM ), and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification ( ICD-10-CM ) codes that may not reflect true congenital heart defects (CHDs). Methods and Results CHDs in 1497 cases with at least 1 encounter between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019 in 2 health care systems, identified by at least 1 of 87 ICD-9-CM / ICD-10-CM CHD codes were validated through medical record review for the presence of CHD and CHD native anatomy. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability averaged >95%. Positive predictive value (PPV) of ICD-9-CM / ICD-10-CM codes for CHD was 68.1% (1020/1497) overall, 94.6% (123/130) for cases identified in both health care systems, 95.8% (249/260) for severe codes, 52.6% (370/703) for shunt codes, 75.9% (243/320) for valve codes, 73.5% (119/162) for shunt and valve codes, and 75.0% (39/52) for "other CHD" (7 ICD-9-CM / ICD-10-CM codes). PPV for cases with >1 unique CHD code was 85.4% (503/589) versus 56.3% (498/884) for 1 CHD code. Of cases with secundum atrial septal defect ICD-9-CM / ICD-10-CM codes 745.5/Q21.1 in isolation, PPV was 30.9% (123/398). Patent foramen ovale was present in 66.2% (316/477) of false positives. True positives had younger mean age at first encounter with a CHD code than false positives (22.4 versus 26.3years; P =0.0017). Conclusions CHD ICD-9-CM / ICD-10-CM codes have modest PPV and may not represent true CHD cases. PPV was improved by selecting certain features, but most true cases did not have these characteristics. The development of algorithms to improve accuracy may improve accuracy of electronic health records for CHD surveillance.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^d97a8061]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms—Acute Q fever in adults occurs symptomatically in approximately half of infected persons and, after an incubation period of 2–3 weeks, most commonly presents as a nonspecific febrile illness that might occur with pneumonia or hepatitis. In North America in the 1980s, among 1,306 hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia cases, 30 cases (2.3%) were acute Q fever, and cough is often nonproductive in 50% of patients. Fever in untreated patients lasts a median of 10 days (range: 5–57 days), with the majority defervescing within 72 hours of doxycycline; duration increases with age, with 60% of patients aged >40 years having fever >14 days compared with 29% aged <40 years. Rash occurs in 5%–21% of patients. Mortality is <2%, and during the Netherlands outbreak of approximately 4,000 reported cases up to 50% of acute Q fever patients were hospitalized. Common diagnostic coding in one U.S. military series included fever, not otherwise specified (780.6); pneumonia, organism unspecified (486); and viral infection, not otherwise specified (079.99).

### Five and 10 minute APGAR scores and risks of cerebral palsy and epilepsy: population based cohort study in Sweden [^0ee8918c]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Definition of outcome

Identification of cases of cerebral palsy was based on the presence of one or more diagnostic codes for cerebral palsy (ICD-9 code 343; ICD-10 code G80), recorded between 1999 and 2012. Epilepsy in children was identified as follows: an occurrence of at least two diagnostic codes for epilepsy (ICD-9 code 345; ICD-10 code G40) on separate dates; or an occurrence of at least one diagnostic code for convulsions (ICD-9 code 780.3; ICD-10 code R56) and at least one diagnostic code for epilepsy, in separate medical encounters; the diagnosis of convulsions had to precede that of epilepsy. Diagnostic codes for cerebral palsy in all medical records were eligible for consideration. However, we restricted the diagnosis of epilepsy to the period after the child’s 27th day after birth, to avoid misclassifying neonatal convulsions as epilepsy. Only children with epilepsy who did not also have cerebral palsy were retained in the study (n=371 infants with epilepsy and cerebral palsy as a comorbidity were excluded). We considered the date associated with the first record of epilepsy or cerebral palsy to be the date of diagnosis, up to 16 years of age.

Main exposures

Apgar scores at five and 10 minutes were the main exposures. We analysed Apgar scores in several ways: revised categories (Apgar values of 0-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and 9-10) and each score value (Apgar values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10).

Malnutrition diagnosis documentation—Malnutrition diagnoses “have been mapped to ICD-10 codes: mild protein-calorie malnutrition is E44.1, moderate protein-calorie malnutrition is E44.0, and (unspecified) severe protein-calorie malnutrition is E43,” and compliant documentation includes “the diagnosis and its severity, … documented by a provider (physician, advanced practitioner provider);” “the clinical indicators to support the diagnosis, for example, weight loss of 10% in a 3-month time frame;” and “development of a treatment plan … for example, initiation of enteral nutrition (EN).” Malnutrition may be coded as “a secondary diagnosis that can affect the Medicare Severity–Diagnosis Related Group Complications or Comorbidities and Major Complications or Comorbidities,” and “Accurate documentation by physicians and advanced practice providers must be present to support coding, reimbursement, benchmarking, and high-quality patient care.”

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^277f97c0]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death terminology and classification—progress on reaching consensus highlights that considerations include historical convention, uncertainties at the time of death, geographical variations, training of death-scene investigators and death certifiers, and caregiver guilt and shame. It is essential for the forensic community and health care professionals to incorporate terminology that avoids placing blame; the medical examiner or coroner needs to effectively communicate investigation and autopsy findings and explain why conclusions may be inconclusive; and forensic, pediatric, and public health communities need consistent communication tools to acknowledge unsafe behaviors or environmental hazards without assigning blame, while clinicians must effectively message prenatal and unsafe sleep risks that may continue to pose a risk to surviving children. The page notes a need to consistently classify sudden infant deaths that are undetermined or unexplained and consensus on classifying accidental suffocation deaths in unsafe sleep environments in the absence of a biological marker. It also reports that the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) Panel on Sudden Unexpected Death in Pediatrics included forensic pathologists, pediatricians representing the AAP, and federal liaisons from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and NIH, and that an international expert panel met to discuss terminology and make ICD coding recommendations to the World Health Organization for International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 11th Revision (ICD-11).

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^d2ec0ec3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Q fever—Acute clinical features in adults and children include that prolonged fever (>10 days) with a normal leukocyte count, thrombocytopenia, and increased liver enzymes is suggestive of acute Q fever infection. Children with Q fever generally have a milder acute illness than adults and are more likely to have a rash than adults, with rash reported in up to 50% of children with acute Q fever. Women infected with Q fever during pregnancy are at increased risk for miscarriage and preterm delivery, and women of child-bearing age who receive a diagnosis of Q fever can benefit from pregnancy screening and counseling to guide health-care management decisions.

Q fever management—guideline aims and initial treatment stress timely recognition and therapy. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment shortens the illness and reduces the risk for severe complications, and in patients with chronic Q fever illness, early treatment might be lifesaving. Information in this report is designed to assist U.S. clinicians with the following: recognize common epidemiologic features and clinical manifestations of Q fever, consider Q fever as the cause of a patient’s illness if appropriate, obtain relevant history and diagnostic tests for Q fever, identify the limitations and utility of laboratory diagnostic testing, and make treatment decisions based on epidemiologic and clinical evidence. Clinicians should recognize that doxycycline is the treatment of choice for patients of any age with severe illness, manage infected children and pregnant women appropriately, provide effective risk communication for persons at high risk for Q fever exposure, and report suspect and confirmed cases to appropriate public health officials.

### Characteristics and outcomes of women with COVID-19 giving birth at US academic centers during the COVID-19 pandemic [^8f15eb83]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Prior studies on COVID-19 and pregnancy have reported higher rates of cesarean delivery and preterm birth and increased morbidity and mortality. Additional data encompassing a longer time period are needed.

Objective

To examine characteristics and outcomes of a large US cohort of women who underwent childbirth with vs without COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study compared characteristics and outcomes of women (age ≥18 years) who underwent childbirth with vs without COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021, at 499 US academic medical centers or community affiliates. Follow-up was limited to in-hospital course and discharge destination. Childbirth was defined by clinical classification software procedural codes of 134-137. A diagnosis of COVID-19 was identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of U07.1. Data were analyzed from April 1 to April 30, 2021.

Exposures

The presence of a COVID-19 diagnosis using ICD-10.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Analyses compared demographic characteristics, gestational age, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and discharge status. Continuous variables were analyzed using t test, and categorical variables were analyzed using χ2.

Results

Among 869 079 women, 18 715 (2.2%) had COVID-19, and 850 364 (97.8%) did not. Most women were aged 18 to 30 years (11 550 women with COVID-19 [61.7%]; 447 534 women without COVID-19 [52.6%]) and were White (8060 White women [43.1%] in the COVID-19 cohort; 499 501 White women (58.7%) in the non-COVID-19 cohort). There was no significant increase in cesarean delivery among women with COVID-19 (6088 women [32.5%] vs 273 810 women [32.3%]; P=.57). Women with COVID-19 were more likely to have preterm birth (3072 women [16.4%] vs 97 967 women [11.5%]; P<.001). Women giving birth with COVID-19, compared with women without COVID-19, had significantly higher rates of ICU admission (977 women [5.2%] vs 7943 women [0.9%]; odds ratio [OR], 5.84 [95% CI, 5.46-6.25]; P<.001), respiratory intubation and mechanical ventilation (275 women [1.5%] vs 884 women [0.1%]; OR, 14.33 [95% CI, 12.50-16.42]; P<.001), and in-hospital mortality (24 women [0.1%] vs 71 [<0.01%]; OR, 15.38 [95% CI, 9.68-24.43]; P<.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective cohort study found that women with COVID-19 giving birth had higher rates of mortality, intubation, ICU admission, and preterm birth than women without COVID-19.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^d719b817]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Accuracy of influenza ICD-10 diagnosis codes in identifying influenza illness in children [^2804e89c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Using data from a large, active, prospective, multicenter study during 4 influenza seasons from 2016 to 2020 and involving more than 32 000 children in either the ED or inpatient setting, this cohort study found that influenza ICD-10 codes were moderately sensitive and highly specific for identifying cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Importantly, influenza ICD-10 codes had both high PPV and NPV, with PPV being greatest in peak seasons. We evaluated different influenza season definitions that may be used in future studies, depending on the prioritization of higher PPV or NPV. In studies using data without access to laboratory testing results, the peak 13 week or peak 33% season definitions likely reduce misclassification of the influenza diagnosis compared with the October to March definition. Performance of influenza ICD-10 codes varied according to age and care setting. Our study provides guidance for the use of ICD-10 influenza diagnosis codes for influenza surveillance and epidemiologic studies when laboratory confirmation is not available.

### Categorizing hospitals by neonatal and pediatric diagnoses treated [^5c109f2b]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Traditional classification of children's and nonchildren's hospitals is based on physical structure and branding. We grouped hospitals with the most similar types of pediatric patients.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of 2.8 million hospitalizations in 3993 hospitals for patients 0 to 20 years in the 2019 Kids' Inpatient Database. After stratifying low-volume hospitals (greater than 100 annual admissions), we grouped the remaining hospitals using K-means clustering by case-mix of neonatal services and pediatric diagnosis diversity (DD).

Results

Clustering distinguished 6 hospital groups. Group 1 (n=1665 [1.6% of hospitalizations]) represented low pediatric volume hospitals (13 annual pediatric hospitalizations [IQR 3-82]). Group 2 (n=118 hospitals [1.1% of hospitalizations]) provided no neonatal care, had low DD (12 [IQR 4-34]), and had a median age of 17 years. Group 3 (n=1156 [19.7% of hospitalizations]) hospitals provided low-severity neonatal care with low DD (13 [IQR 7-19). Group 4 (n=674 hospitals, [24.0% of hospitalizations]) provided moderate-severity neonatal care (2.2 [ IQR 2.1-2.4]) and increased DD (24 [ IQR 6-34]). Group 5 (n=238 hospitals [20.5% of hospitalizations]) had a similar severity of neonatal care as group 4 (2.3 [IQR 2.1-2.5]), but 2.7 times greater DD (64 [IQR 55-77]). Group 6 (n=142 hospitals [33.0% of hospitalizations]) had the highest-severity neonatal care (2.6 [IQR 2.3-3.1]) and the greatest DD (127 [113-140]).

Conclusion

Children receive inpatient care across 6 groups of hospitals, distinguished by neonatal case-mix and DD. Future studies should investigate the utility of these groups for peer comparisons with health care use and outcomes.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^da217d43]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Standardized code sets—HIPAA mandate and ICD-10 governance in the United States—are described as follows: Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services mandates use of standardized code sets in support of electronic health care transactions, which include International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS); Current Procedural Terminology (CPT); National Drug Codes (NDCs); and Current Dental Terminology. The World Health Organization created the ICD-10 with adaptability for expansion and specificity for enhanced measurement, surveillance, research, and reporting across multiple domains, and it was clinically modified and initiated in the United States on October 1, 2015. The 4 cooperating parties that oversee and manage the ICD-10 in the United States are the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Health Information Management Association, and the American Hospital Association.

### Associations of maternal diabetes during pregnancy with psychiatric disorders in offspring during the first 4 decades of life in a population-based Danish birth cohort [^8d09d288]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Exposure

Exposure was defined as a maternal diabetes diagnosis registered during pregnancy.Thus, offspring born to mothers with a diagnosis of diabetes before childbirth were considered to have been exposed to maternal diabetes during pregnancy. Maternal diabetes was first classified into pregestational diabetes (PGDM) and gestational diabetes (GDM). Pregestational diabetes was further categorized as PGDM type 1 and type 2. To identify PGDM, we applied criteria by extracting the following International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8) equivalent codes of diabetes diagnosis and treatment: (1) a diagnosis of diabetes with ICD-10 codes of E10, E11, H36.0, and O24, excluding codes O24.4 and O24.9, or an ICD-8 code of 249 or 250; (2) receipt of podiatric treatment for diabetic conditions; (3) 2 redeemed prescriptions for insulin (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code A10A); or (4) 2 redeemed prescriptions for oral antidiabetics (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code A10B). Blood glucose measurements were not used owing to their poor validity.For GDM, we used ICD-10 codes O24.4 and O24.9 and ICD-8 code 634.74. Because diabetes was recorded using a single ICD-8 code (250) during the period from 1977 to 1986, we used 2 approaches to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes during that period: (1) a specific code for type 1 or type 2 diabetes conferred later or (2) age at diabetes onset (cutoff age for type 1, <30 years; cutoff age for type 2, ≥30 years).

### Comparison of metrics of neonatal intensive care unit antibiotic use [^2831e291]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source and study population

This retrospective cohort study used the Premier Health Database (PHD) data. This U.S. hospital-based repository includes administrative, healthcare utilization, and financial information from more than 750 hospitals and health systems. We included centers that consistently provided annual data from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021, with at least 20 NICU admissions each year. The study was classified as exempt by the institutional review board of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, with a waiver of informed consent due to the deidentified nature of the patient and center-level data.

Study definitions

Admission to the NICU was defined using room and board charges. The birth date was designated as the day of hospital admission since only inborn infants were included. Length of stay in days was determined based on hospital service days, including both admission and discharge days. AUR was defined as the total days with at least one antibiotic administration, which was not necessarily continuous, per 1,000 patient days. DOT was defined as the aggregate antibiotic days per 1,000 patient days, where each unique antibiotic administered on a given day contributed to the total. ASI was defined as the sum of assigned points for each antibiotic per day per 1,000 therapy days; ASI is based on activity against clinically relevant pathogens (range 1–13), with a higher ASI indicating a broader spectrum agent (Appendix; adapted from Gerber et al). Only antibiotics with an assigned enteral or parenteral route were included. For a post hoc analysis, early ASI was defined as aggregate ASI in the first three days after birth, and late ASI was defined as aggregate ASI beyond three days after birth. Additional variables were defined according to the PHD data dictionary. The hospital setting, or population served, was classified as urban or rural based on proximity to a city center. A hospital with teaching status was identified as a facility affiliated with a medical school accredited by either the American Medical Association or the Liaison Committee on Medical Education of the Association of American Medical Colleges. Geographic regions were defined using the U.S. Census Geographic Regions. Very low birth weight (VLBW) was assessed utilizing All Patients Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR DRGs) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, which indicated a birth weight under 1,500 grams. Gestational age <29 weeks was categorized using ICD-10 codes. Infant disposition was determined using Uniform Billing Form (UB-04) discharge status codes.

### Perinatal risk factors in Tourette's and chronic tic disorders: a total population sibling comparison study [^51c2aef6]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Outcome

The first instance of a recorded TD or CTD diagnosis in the NPR constituted the outcome using the classification of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in its 8th (ICD-8 code 306.2), 9th (ICD-9 code 307C) and 10th versions (ICD-10 codes F95.0 (transient tic disorder), F95.1 (chronic motor or vocal tic disorder), F95.2 (TD), F95.8 (other tic disorders) or F95.9 (unspecified tic disorder)). Using a previously validated algorithm,individuals who have transient tics as their only or final diagnostic code within the same year of the initial diagnosis are considered diagnosis-free. Furthermore, individuals who receive an initial diagnosis of transient, other or unspecified tics are only included if they receive at least an additional diagnosis of a tic disorder, except if the last available diagnosis is of a transient tic disorder given within the same year of the initial diagnosis. This approach results in nearly perfect inter-rater reliability and highly valid diagnoses, with a positive predictive value of 0.89 in ICD-8, 0.86 in ICD-9 and 0.97 in ICD-10.

Covariates

Data on all potential, measured confounders were collected from the MBR (year of birth of the index person, sex, parity and maternal age at childbirth) and the MGR (paternal age at childbirth).

For ICD-10 CM laterality, the guidance states: “For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available.” When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, “Right is always 1 Left is always 2 Bilateral is always 3.”

### Management of stillbirth: obstetric care consensus No, 10 [^f79e328f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Potential causes of stillbirth—attribution is often limited despite evaluation. The study of specific causes of stillbirth has been hampered by the lack of uniform protocols to evaluate and classify stillbirths and by decreasing autopsy rates. In most cases, stillbirth certificates are filled out before a full postnatal investigation has been completed and amended death certificates are rarely filed when additional information from the stillbirth evaluation emerges. In any specific case, it may be difficult to assign a definite cause to a stillbirth, and a significant proportion of stillbirths remains unexplained even after a thorough evaluation.

### Validation of ICD-10-CM codes for injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium: a medical record review [^c24c5613]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for injury, poisoning, physical or sexual assault complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (PCP) to capture injury encounters within both hospital and emergency department claims data.

Methods

A medical record review was conducted on a sample (n=157) of inpatient and emergency department claims from one Kentucky healthcare system from 2015 to 2017, with any diagnosis in the ICD-10-CM range O9A.2-O9A.4. Study clinicians reviewed medical records for the sampled cases and used an abstraction form to collect information on documented presence of injury and PCP complications. The study estimated the PPVs and the 95% CIs of O9A.2-O9A.4 codes for (1) capturing injuries and (2) capturing injuries complicating PCP.

Results

The estimated PPV for the codes O9A.2-O9A.4 to identify injury in the full sample was 79.6% (95% CI 73.3% to 85.9%) and the PPV for capturing injuries complicating PCP was 72.0% (95% CI 65.0% to 79.0%). The estimated PPV for an inpatient principal diagnosis O9A.2-O9A.4 to capture injuries was 90.7% (95% CI 82.0% to 99.4%) and the PPV for capturing injuries complicating PCP was 88.4% (95% CI 78.4% to 98.4%). The estimated PPV for any mention of O9A.2-O9A.4 in emergency department data to capture injuries was 95.2% (95% CI 90.6% to 99.9%) and the PPV for capturing injuries complicating PCP was 81.0% (95% CI 72.4% to 89.5%).

Discussion

The O9A.2-O9A.4 codes captured high percentage true injury cases among pregnant and puerperal women.

### Pregnancy-related complications in osteogenesis imperfecta [^3cb3dd71]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate obstetric and perinatal outcomes of pregnancies among patients with osteogenesis imperfecta using the French National Health Insurance Database.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Pregnancies were identified with an algorithm specifically developed for the French National Health Insurance Database to identify delivery stays using a combination of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) discharge codes and medical procedures. Exposure was osteogenesis imperfecta status based on the occurrence of ICD-10 code Q780 5 years before conception or during pregnancy. Outcomes included pregnancy, delivery, postpartum, and fetal complications based on hospital discharge data and reimbursements of medical procedures, medical devices, and drugs. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, adjusted for multiple pregnancies per participant with generalized estimating equations.

Results

The cohort included 8,850,969 pregnancies (5,823,322 patients) between January 2012 and December 2023. In total, 408 pregnant individuals (4.6/100,000) were identified with osteogenesis imperfecta. Compared with pregnant individuals without osteogenesis imperfecta, pregnant individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta had increased risks of antepartum hemorrhage (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.78, 95% CI, 1.01-3.14), chorioamnionitis (adjusted RR 2.79, 95% CI, 1.17-6.64), malpresentation (adjusted RR 1.65, 95% CI, 1.19-2.30), and preterm delivery (adjusted RR 2.11, 95% CI, 1.62-2.74). Cesarean delivery rates were notably higher in pregnant individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta (adjusted RR 2.59, 95% CI, 2.34-2.88), including among nulliparous individuals (adjusted RR 2.50, 95% CI, 2.22-2.81). Osteogenesis imperfecta was associated with major congenital anomalies (adjusted RR 5.04, 95% CI, 3.97-6.39 overall; adjusted RR 1.67, 95% CI, 1.09-2.56 when osteogenesis imperfecta was excluded from the congenital anomaly definition), especially cardiac anomalies. Postpartum analysis indicated no significant increase in fracture rates compared with prepregnancy periods.

Conclusion

In this nationwide cohort study, osteogenesis imperfecta was associated with both maternal and fetal complications. These findings underscore the need for specialized, multidisciplinary management of pregnancies in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta.

We derived nationally representative cohorts of singleton live births in 2003–2012 to resident mothers using linked administrative databases from England and Sweden. The English birth cohort was based on birth admissions identified in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).For each birth, two new records are created in HES—a birth admission for a baby and a delivery admission for the mother, both covering information about key risk factors at birth. The two records were probabilistically linked to enhance completeness of birth characteristics and socioeconomic factors in the birth cohort.Birth records were then linked to the baby’s subsequent hospital admissions and Office for National Statistics death registration records using a study-specific identifier generated by the data provider.We excluded 29% of births in hospitals with low completeness of recorded variables or poor linkage to mortality records. Detailed derivation and validation of the cohort is described elsewhere.The Swedish birth cohort was based on births identified in the Medical Birth Register.Births were linked to hospital recordsand death recordsusing the child’s pseudonymised personal identity number generated by the data provider.

Children were followed up from the 31st day of life until their fifth birthday, death or 31 December 2013, whichever occurred first. We excluded deaths at ≤27 days due to differences in death certification practices in England and Sweden.Deaths at 28–30 days were excluded as 75% of these deaths in the English birth cohort were missing all causes of death, which likely reflects a data extraction error by the data provider.

Outcomes

RTI-related deaths were defined as non-injury, non-SUDI with an appropriate International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) code recoded as any cause of death or any diagnosis in a hospital admission that started <31 days before death (listed in online supplementary appendix table 1).We excluded injury-related deaths as they are considered accidental and not a direct result of RTI. Deaths were classified as injury-related if the underlying cause of death included any code from chapter 20 of ICD-10.

SUDI was indicated if the underlying cause of death included any ICD-10 code from a code list recommended for international comparisons to minimise bias from differences in coding and investigative practices (listed in online supplementary appendix table 2).The code list included all unexpected deaths: SIDS, sudden deaths from unspecified causes and sudden deaths that were subsequently explained (eg, accidental suffocation).

2.7 Reporting criteria for international comparisons

Inclusion of fetal deaths and live births born at extremely low gestational ages disrupts the validity of international comparisons and is therefore not recommended.

For international comparisons countries should report all late gestation stillbirths (≥196 days [≥28 +0 weeks] or birth weight ≥1000 g, if gestational age unknown). Where possible, additionally report early gestation stillbirths (154–195 days [22 +0 –27 +6 weeks] or birth weight 500–999 g, if gestational age unknown) as a separate category (Table 2).

TABLE 2 
Recommendations for internationally comparable reporting of perinatal death statistics.

Whilst all neonatal deaths should be reported in the national data system, for international comparisons only those born ≥196 days (≥28 +0 weeks or birth weight ≥1000 g, if gestational age unknown) should be included. This recommendation represents a shift from previous recommendations and current practice in many countries. However, gestational age and birth weight should now be recorded for every birth and death, and national reporting systems should be adapted to facilitate reporting using these thresholds.

Where deaths before 154 days (<22 +0 weeks or <500 g, if gestational age unknown) are included in perinatal statistics they should be presented separately from deaths at 154 days or more (≥22 +0 weeks or <500 g, if gestational age unknown) and the lower limit for inclusion in perinatal statistics in the setting should be stated, for example, “20 +0 weeks of gestation” or “no lower gestational age limit.”

Indicators for international comparisons of perinatal mortality

To facilitate international comparisons, ICD‐11 recommends reporting the following rates:
Late gestation stillbirth rate = ([stillbirths ≥28 +0 weeks]/[total births ≥28 +0 weeks]) × 1000.
Early neonatal mortality rate = ([day 0–6 neonatal deaths born at ≥28 +0 weeks]/[live births born at ≥28 +0 weeks]) × 1000.
Perinatal mortality rate = ([stillbirths ≥28 +0 weeks + day 0–6 neonatal deaths born at ≥28 +0 weeks] /[total births ≥28 +0 weeks]) × 1000.

### Rates of neuropsychiatric disorders and gestational age at birth in a Danish population [^02587e5b]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Nonoptimal gestational durations could be associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities, yet evidence regarding finer classification of gestational age and rates of multiple major neuropsychiatric disorders beyond childhood is limited.

Objective

To comprehensively evaluate associations between 6 gestational age groups and rates of 9 major types and 8 subtypes of childhood and adult-onset neuropsychiatric disorders.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study evaluated data from a nationwide register of singleton births in Denmark from January 1, 1978, to December 31, 2016. Data analyses were conducted from October 1, 2019, through November 15, 2020.

Exposures

Gestational age subgroups were classified according to data from the Danish Medical Birth Register: very preterm (20-31 completed weeks), moderately preterm (32-33 completed weeks), late preterm (34-36 completed weeks), early term (37-38 completed weeks), term (39-40 completed weeks, reference), and late or postterm (41-45 completed weeks).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Neuropsychiatric diagnostic records (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes F00-F99) were ascertained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register up to August 10, 2017. Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% CI for neuropsychiatric disorders, adjusting for selected sociodemographic factors.

Results

Of all 2 327 639 singleton births studied (1 194 925 male newborns [51.3%]), 22 647 (1.0%) were born very preterm, 19 801 (0.9%) were born moderately preterm, 99 488 (4.3%) were born late preterm, 388 416 (16.7%) were born early term, 1 198 605 (51.5%) were born at term, and 598 682 (25.7%) were born late or postterm. A gradient of decreasing IRRs was found from very preterm to late preterm for having any or each of the 9 neuropsychiatric disorders (eg, very preterm: IRR,1.49 [95% CI, 1.43-1.55]; moderately preterm: IRR,1.23 [95% CI, 1.18-1.28]; late preterm: IRR,1.17 [95% CI, 1.14-1.19] for any disorders) compared with term births. Individuals born early term had 7% higher rates (IRR,1.07 [95% CI, 1.06-1.08]) for any neuropsychiatric diagnosis and a 31% higher rate for intellectual disability (IRR,1.31 [95% CI, 1.25-1.37]) compared with those born at term. The late or postterm group had lower IRRs for most disorders, except pervasive developmental disorders, for which the rate was higher for postterm births compared with term births (IRR,1.06 [95% CI,1.03-1.09]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Higher incidences of all major neuropsychiatric disorders were observed across the spectrum of preterm births. Early term and late or postterm births might not share a homogeneous low risk with individuals born at term. These findings suggest that interventions that address perinatal factors associated with nonoptimal gestation might reduce long-term neuropsychiatric risks in the population.

### Management of fever in infants and young children [^c17270f8]. American Family Physician (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for febrile infant, more specifically with respect to general principles, AAFP 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a diagnostic evaluation for neonates < 28 days of age with fever ≥ 38 °C, including a thorough history, physical examination, CBC, blood cultures, lumbar puncture, urinalysis, and urine culture.

### Standard terminology for fetal, infant, and perinatal deaths [^c7abe33e]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Perinatal mortality definitions and epidemiology—Perinatal mortality is the combination of fetal deaths and neonatal deaths, and in the United States in 2013 the fetal mortality rate for gestations of at least 20 weeks (5.96 fetal deaths per 1000 live births and fetal deaths) was similar to the infant mortality rate (5.98 infant deaths per 1000 live births). Depending on the definition used, fetal mortality contributes to approximately 40% to 60% of perinatal mortality, and accurately defining and reporting perinatal deaths is a critical first step with correct identification that will improve local, state, and national data.

### Idiopathic epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^b546b23f]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Appendix 2—International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction are as follows: Epiretinal membrane—ICD-9 CM 362.56; ICD-10 CM H35.371, H35.372, H35.373. Vitreomacular traction, adhesion—ICD-9 CM 379.27; ICD-10 CM H43.821, H43.822, H43.823. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned; unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Preparing for international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification implementation: strategies for maintaining an efficient workflow [^204c5163]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is required to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services health care billing data starting in October 2015 in the United States. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is an update to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and contains approximately 70,000 codes compared with 14,000 codes. We aimed to discuss how our institution is updating the coding system in a manner that alleviates the possible burden placed on providers including more coding information required and longer load times. We performed a simulation test including testing the diagnosis calculator, timing, and how well the new and old codes mapped. We conducted a gap analysis to ensure that coding could begin in October of 2015 with minimal service interruptions. We will describe strategies and procedures to transition between systems while maintaining efficiency and helping to improve classification.

### Mediators and adverse effects of child poverty in the United States [^1107af4b]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Tracking socioeconomic risk in health care settings using ICD-10-CM—compared with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) provides a more robust classification system that enables clinicians to track socioeconomic factors in patient care that may be related to families’ annual income level; by using the ICD-10-CM, child health clinicians can submit supplemental codes that include not only diagnosis, such as acute asthma exacerbation, but additional socioeconomic factors related to the asthma exacerbation and treatment, such as childhood poverty or the family’s inability to afford the recommended medical regimen; it will be important to capture this additional socioeconomic information with the sole use of ICD-10-CM codes to enable investigators to examine the putative impact of expanded codes on children’s health care.

Denominator ARDS identification approach—to balance feasibility and sensitivity, an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code–only denominator akin to NQF 0500 was contemplated but rejected because many patients with ARDS are not recognized by clinicians and an ICD-10-CM–based PM would have low sensitivity and limited impact; an alternative higher-sensitivity definition including all mechanically ventilated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was also rejected because LTVV may not benefit patients without ARDS and ATS PMs must remain evidence based; instead, to improve specificity, the committee opted for a strategy similar to NQF 3215 requiring electronic health record data extraction for Berlin Definition criteria, ventilator settings, ARDS risk factors, echocardiogram, and other evidence of cardiac dysfunction, despite added complexity judged necessary to support a meaningful PM.

Potential causes of stillbirth—evaluation limitations—are hampered by a lack of uniform protocols and decreasing autopsy rates; in most cases, certificates are completed before full postnatal investigation and amended certificates are rarely filed, making assignment of a definite cause difficult, and a significant proportion of stillbirths remains unexplained, even after a thorough evaluation.

### Death certificate-based ICD-10 diagnosis codes for COVID-19 mortality surveillance-United States, January-December 2020 [^7b0e2120]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Death certificates were processed using standard CDC protocols to convert all written text and diagnoses to ICD-10 codes. Individual data elements were extracted for analysis from death certificates that had the ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) listed in Part I (the section for reporting chain of events leading directly to death, the immediate cause of death, and the underlying cause of death) or Part II (the section for reporting all other significant conditions that contributed to death) of the death certificate for deaths that occurred during the calendar year 2020 (Supplementary Figure,) and had been reported to CDC by February 22, 2021. First, the location of ICD-10 diagnoses in relation to the COVID-19 diagnosis was used to categorize the co-occurring diagnoses as being in the chain of events that directly caused the death (chain-of-event conditions) or a significant condition contributing to death (significant contributing conditions). Any co-occurring ICD-10 code that appeared on the same line or above U07.1 in Part I was considered to be a chain-of-event condition. Any ICD-10 code that appeared on a line below U07.1 in Part I or in Part II was considered to be a contributing condition. Second, the highest-frequency ICD-10 codes noted in ≥1% of all death certificates with COVID-19 listed in Part I and at least one diagnosis other than COVID-19 were reviewed for consistency and plausibility with conditions known to be associated with severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (–). Conditions consistent with those known to be associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes were coded as chain-of-event or significant contributing conditions regardless of their location on the death certificate. For example, a death certificate with an ICD-10 code for respiratory failure listed below U07.1 would be coded as a chain-of-event condition because respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 led directly to the death. Third, less frequently appearing ICD-10 codes that were determined to be consistent with those associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes were also coded as chain-of-event or significant contributing conditions. Finally, death certificates were categorized into five mutually exclusive categories according to the ICD-10 codes recorded on the death certificate 1) only the ICD-10 code for COVID-19; 2) at least one other co-occurring ICD-10 code for a chain-of-event condition; 3) at least one other co-occurring ICD-10 code for a significant contributing condition; 4) an ICD-10 code for both a chain-of-event and significant contributing condition; or 5) an ICD-10 code that could not be categorized as a plausible chain-of-event or significant contributing condition based on current knowledge. Results were stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and setting of death reported on the death certificate. All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and Stata (version 15.0; StataCorp).
