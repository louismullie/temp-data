## Question

chelating agents, indication for use their doses and their target level when potassium is high

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of which potassium-lowering agents are "chelating agents", when to use them, what doses to give, and what potassium targets to aim for in hyperkalemia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and identify which drugs truly function as potassium binders. Then, I should verify the clinical indications for acute versus chronic hyperkalemia and the severity thresholds that trigger treatment. Next, I will review dosing for each binder in acute and maintenance settings, including special populations like hemodialysis. After that, I need to define target potassium ranges and monitoring cadence. Finally, I should integrate safety, drug–drug interactions, and how binders fit alongside RAAS inhibitor optimization and dialysis considerations, making sure I double-check any areas where guidance differs across societies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel therapies. "Chelating agents" in this context is imprecise; the correct pharmacologic class is potassium binders that sequester potassium in the gastrointestinal tract and increase fecal excretion, namely sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, patiromer, and the older polystyrene sulfonate resins, which are the agents relevant to the question [^113JTAg6].

> I need to check the clinical indications and severity thresholds that prompt binder use. For acute hyperkalemia, UK Kidney Association guidance supports sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for emergency management of severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L) and for acute management of moderate hyperkalemia (6.0–6.4 mmol/L), while patiromer can be considered for acute hyperkalemia ≥ 6.0 mmol/L; these are adjuncts to standard stabilization and intracellular shift therapies, not replacements [^114XyM8w] [^115QssEw] [^115hJrrW]. For chronic or persistent hyperkalemia, UKKA recommends patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate to manage persistent hyperkalemia ≥ 6.0 mmol/L in adults with CKD stage 3b–5 or heart failure who are on or would benefit from RAAS inhibitors, with the goal of enabling RAASi optimization rather than withdrawal [^113YXfBL] [^111k6kg1]. Hold on, I should verify outpatient triggers: UKKA also advises urgent hospital assessment for severe hyperkalemia detected in the community and consideration of assessment for mild–moderate hyperkalemia in acutely unwell patients, which aligns with broader safety algorithms [^111pfUau] [^116mZYBi].

> Now, dosing for sodium zirconium cyclosilicate — let me double-check the labeled regimen. For acute treatment, the recommended dose is 10 g orally three times daily for up to 48 hours; for continued treatment, 10 g once daily with titration in 5 g increments at intervals of one week or longer based on serum potassium, with a maintenance range of 5 g every other day to 15 g daily; in hemodialysis patients, start 5–10 g on non-dialysis days and adjust to pre-dialysis potassium after the long interdialytic interval, reassessing after one week and modifying to 5–15 g on non-dialysis days as needed [^1138bCS1]. Wait, I should verify onset: HARMONIZE showed median time to normokalemia around 2.2 hours in the open-label phase, which supports its role in acute management when used appropriately alongside other measures [^115yx13g].

> For patiromer, I should confirm both acute and maintenance dosing. In acute care settings, patiromer 8.4–25.2 g has been associated with a mean potassium reduction of about 0.5 mEq/L within 0–6 hours, suggesting clinically meaningful early effect, though it is not a substitute for stabilization or insulin/dextrose in emergencies; for chronic management, typical dosing starts around 8.4 g daily and is titrated to potassium, with UKKA recommending specialist initiation and ongoing monitoring, and FDA labeling supports treatment of hyperkalemia in adults, including those ≥ 12 years [^115WWEfb] [^111k6kg1] [^116bJR36]. Hold on, I should verify the practical point: patiromer can bind other oral medications, so it should be separated by at least 3 hours from other drugs to avoid interference, which is a key administration caveat [^116bJR36].

> I will now examine the older polystyrene sulfonate resins. Calcium polystyrene sulfonate (calcium resonium) may be considered as a short-term option in non-hospitalized patients with chronic hyperkalemia who do not meet criteria for patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, acknowledging limited contemporary evidence and tolerability concerns; sodium polystyrene sulfonate remains FDA-labeled for hyperkalemia but is generally deprioritized due to gastrointestinal adverse effects and rare colonic necrosis, especially with sorbitol, so if used, it should be short-term and with caution [^116ZpSJF] [^116yMuwA] [^1121GYoP]. Wait, let me verify comparative guidance: AAFP recommends preferring patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate over sodium polystyrene sulfonate because of better efficacy and lower risk of serious adverse effects, reinforcing the hierarchy of binder choice [^115LGsAq] [^1136i67Y].

> Next, I should review target potassium ranges and monitoring cadence. Clinically, we aim to restore normokalemia, typically 3.5–5.0 or 3.5–5.1 mEq/L depending on the assay and context, and maintain levels below 5.5 mEq/L in at-risk patients; UKKA advises regular monitoring in CKD, HF, and diabetes at 2–4 times per year, with increased frequency when potassium is 5.5–5.9 mmol/L or when RAAS inhibitors are initiated or uptitrated, and AAFP similarly emphasizes routine monitoring in CKD and HF populations [^115yx13g] [^116NkTYS] [^1176vexx] [^113YChVW]. Hold on, I should verify that these targets align with binder trials: HARMONIZE defined normokalemia as 3.5–5.0 mEq/L and showed sustained maintenance with SZC, supporting this target framework in practice [^115yx13g].

> I need to ensure I integrate safety, interactions, and special populations. Both patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are generally well tolerated; patiromer is associated with hypomagnesemia and gastrointestinal effects, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate with edema and hypokalemia at higher doses, so electrolytes should be monitored during titration; importantly, patiromer can reduce absorption of other oral medications, necessitating separation by about 3 hours, and in hemodialysis, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is dosed only on non-dialysis days with adjustments to pre-dialysis potassium after the long interval [^1138bCS1] [^116QojEn]. But wait, what if RAAS inhibitors are stopped? UKKA advises discontinuing patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate if RAAS inhibitors are stopped, given the rationale for binder use is to enable RAASi therapy rather than to treat hyperkalemia in isolation [^115g7HJe] [^112T6QDP].

> Let me consider how binders fit within the broader treatment algorithm so I don't overstate their role. In life-threatening hyperkalemia, immediate membrane stabilization with IV calcium, intracellular shifting with insulin/dextrose and beta-agonists, and definitive potassium removal with dialysis remain foundational; potassium binders are adjuncts for acute lowering and are central to chronic control, particularly to preserve RAAS inhibitors that improve cardiorenal outcomes, with multiple guidelines encouraging binder use to avoid unnecessary RAASi down-titration or discontinuation [^117T8che] [^113mcZV7] [^114ftkFP]. I should double-check that this aligns with heart failure guidance: while ACC/AHA/HFSA acknowledge binders can lower potassium, they note insufficient evidence that binders improve hard outcomes in HF, so binder use should be framed around potassium control and RAASi optimization rather than outcome claims [^1149P4de] [^116QojEn].

> Finally, I should confirm practical steps for persistent or recurrent hyperkalemia beyond binders. UKKA recommends structured dietary assessment by a renal dietitian for CKD patients with persistent potassium > 5.5 mmol/L, medication review to discontinue or reduce potassium-raising agents when feasible, and optimization of diuretics and metabolic acidosis correction as appropriate; in dialysis patients, urgent dialysis is indicated for severe hyperkalemia, and binders are used on non-dialysis days to blunt interdialytic rises, with dose titration to pre-dialysis targets after the long interval [^111GoG94] [^117RNkBj] [^1138bCS1]. Hold on, I should verify that these steps are consistent with CKD guidance: VA/DoD and KDOQI similarly emphasize binder use to preserve RAAS blockade, dietary strategies, and careful monitoring rather than reflexively stopping beneficial therapies, reinforcing this integrated approach [^111QeeCL] [^114ftkFP].

---

In hyperkalemia, **potassium binders** are indicated when serum potassium is ≥ 6.0 mmol/L or persistently ≥ 5.5 mmol/L, especially if RAAS inhibitors are needed [^116L8Ux5] [^111k6kg1]. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is dosed at **10 g TID for 48 hours** [^1138bCS1], then 5–15 g daily to maintain 3.5–5.0 mmol/L [^115yx13g]; patiromer starts at **8.4 g daily** [^116bJR36] and is titrated to the same target [^115yx13g]. These binders are preferred over sodium polystyrene sulfonate due to better efficacy and safety [^115LGsAq] [^1136i67Y]; monitor potassium and magnesium, and separate other oral medications by ≥ 2 hours to avoid absorption interference [^1138bCS1] [^116xsjtZ].

---

## Indications for potassium binders

Potassium binders are indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Severe hyperkalemia**: Serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L or ECG changes (peaked T waves, QRS widening, arrhythmias) [^112KvyxG] [^114ypRXH].
- **Moderate hyperkalemia**: Serum potassium 6.0–6.4 mmol/L, particularly if persistent or recurrent [^114ypRXH] [^115QssEw].
- **Persistent hyperkalemia**: Serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L in patients with CKD, heart failure, or diabetes, especially when RAAS inhibitors are indicated [^111k6kg1] [^116L8Ux5] [^114ftkFP].

---

## Dosing and administration of potassium binders

Key dosing and administration characteristics:

| **Aspect** | **Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (szc)** | **Patiromer** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial dose | 10 g orally three times daily for up to 48 hours [^1138bCS1] | 8.4 g orally once daily [^notfound] |
| Maintenance dose | 5–15 g once daily, adjusted to maintain serum potassium within the target range (3.5–5.0 mmol/L) [^115yx13g] | Adjust to maintain serum potassium within the target range (3.5–5.0 mmol/L) [^115yx13g] |
| Administration | Mix with water and administer orally; separate from other oral medications by at least 2 hours to avoid interference with absorption [^1138bCS1] | Mix with water and administer orally; separate from other oral medications by at least 3 hours [^notfound] |

---

### Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS)

SPS may be considered short term when newer binders are unavailable; the **initial dose** is 15–30 g orally or rectally, repeated every 4–6 hours until potassium normalizes. Due to gastrointestinal adverse effects, use caution [^115LGsAq] [^116ZpSJF].

---

## Target serum potassium levels

The **target serum potassium level** is 3.5–5.0 mmol/L (3.5–5.0 mEq/L) for both acute and chronic management. Maintain serum potassium below 5.5 mmol/L to reduce the risk of arrhythmias and other complications [^115h7Ejq] [^113YXfBL].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Monitoring**: Regular serum potassium and magnesium monitoring is essential during therapy [^1138bCS1] [^1176vexx].
- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, constipation, diarrhea), hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia may occur [^1138bCS1] [^111QeeCL].
- **Drug interactions**: Potassium binders can interfere with the absorption of other oral medications; administer other medications at least 2 hours before or after potassium binders [^1138bCS1] [^116xsjtZ].

---

Potassium binders are indicated for severe or persistent hyperkalemia, with **SZC and patiromer preferred** due to superior efficacy and safety. Target serum potassium is 3.5–5.0 mmol/L, with dosing individualized and adjusted based on response and monitoring.

Hyperkalemia represents a common and potentially life-threating electrolyte abnormality, a complication frequently observed in patients with heart failure, kidney disease, diabetes or in those receiving drug therapies influencing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Elevated serum potassium levels are often the result of impaired urinary potassium elimination, inadequate or reduced cellular potassium uptake, severe heart failure, use of medications influencing potassium levels in the circulation, or, more commonly, a combination of these factors. Strategies for the treatment of nonemergent hyperkalemia include the use of cation-exchange resins, polymers or other novel mechanisms of potassium trapping, including sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These agents differ in their pharmacology and mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, including onset and extent of potassium-lowering effect, dosage and administration, and potential safety and adverse effect profiles. In this review, an evaluation of these characteristics, including clinical evidence and safety concerns, in the management of nonemergent hyperkalemia will be explored.

### Clinical impact of suboptimal RAASi therapy following an episode of hyperkalemia [^113mcZV7]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite strong evidence for the cardiorenal protective effects of RAASis, findings from observational studies of routine clinical practice show that prescribing RAASi doses below the maximum target dose is common in patients with HF and CKD. A large European study found that while 67–92% of hospitalized patients with HF were treated with the recommended RAASi agents, two-thirds had not achieved the recommended target dose of those agents. Other studies have demonstrated that therapy with RAASis below the maximum dose increases the risk of major adverse cardiac events and mortality in both CKD and HF populations.

Current guidelines posit that HK should not be a barrier to RAASi optimization, but studies show that once RAASi is discontinued or down-titrated following an episode of HK, it is often not restarted or up-titrated. The international Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines for CKD, UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for HK, the HF guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) all emphasize the importance of managing HK to facilitate RAASi therapy, and recommend using anti-HK treatment with potassium binders. For example, the ESC 2021 HF guidelines stipulate that in patients with HK who are not on maximally tolerated, guideline-recommended target dose of RAASi, an anti-HK agent may be initiated, RAASi therapy should be up-titrated with close monitoring of potassium levels, and upon achieving normokalemia, the anti-HK treatment should be maintained. Considering the suboptimal tolerability profile of conventional binders, which hampers their long-term use, the guidelines recommend newer anti-HK agents (patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate [SZC]).

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^116Wy3ta]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The results from using SCZ were encouraging: the HARMONIZE trial showed that all three doses of SCZ were effective in lowering and maintaining normal potassium levels, including patients receiving RAASi therapy, who showed similar safety profiles. 58 In HARMONIZE‐Global study, normokalemia achieved in a geographically and ethnically diverse population of outpatients with hyperkalemia. 59 The most commonly reported AEs were oedema and constipation. 59 SZC corrects hyperkalaemia and maintains normokalaemia among outpatients regardless of the CKD stage. 1, 60

Unfortunately, these agents cannot be used as emergency treatment while the short duration of the above studies is a limitation in the management of chronic hyperlakemia. Although outcome studies are lacking, the use of potassium binders could play an important role in reaching target doses of RAASi by preventing the development of significant hyperkalemia. However, this hypothesis requires further research on combination treatment with potassium binders before guidelines can recommend their use in therapy.

### Updates on medical management of hyperkalemia [^117FVX6D]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder, more commonly present when the potassium excretion capacity is imparied. Hyperkalemia can lead to adverse outcomes, especially due to severe cardiac arrhythmias. It can also impair the cardiovascular effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) and potassium rich diets, as hyperkalemia frequently leads to their discontinuation.

Recent Findings

Potassium is a predictor of mortality and should be monitored closely for patients who are at risk for hyperkalemia. Acute hyperkalemia protocols have been revised and updated. Randomized trials have shown that the new anti-hyperkalemic agents (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) are effective hyperkalemia treatment options. The use of anti-hyperkalemic agents may allow for a less restrictive potassium diet and lower RAASi discontinuation rates.

Summary

Hyperkalemia should be monitored closely for high-risk patients, as it is associated with adverse outcomes. New therapies have demonstrated effective control, offering hope for potential use in patients that would benefit from diet or medications associated with an increase in serum potassium, indicating that the use of hyperkalemic agents can be associated with better outcomes.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^11512bk5]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a frequent and sometimes life-threatening condition that may be associated with arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction in patients with heart failure (HF). High potassium levels in HF represent both a direct risk for cardiovascular complication and an indirect biomarker of the severity of the underlying disease, reflecting neurohormonal activation and renal dysfunction. Evaluating the prevalence and significance of hyperkalemia in HF patients is essential for optimizing the use of potassium sparing agents, such the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which represent a well-established cornerstone and life-saving therapy. In this review we discuss recent findings and current concepts related to the epidemiology, pathological mechanisms and implications of hyperkalemia, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to counteract it in patients with HF. The balance between optimizing life-saving potassium sparing medication and minimizing hyperkalemia-associated risk is much needed in patients with HF. Although older potassium-binding agents are associated with serious adverse events, novel potassium-binding drugs are effective in lowering potassium levels and are generally well tolerated. Novel potassium-binding drugs, such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, may help to optimize therapy in HF and achieve guideline-recommended doses. Hyperkalemia is common in HF patients and is associated with a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications: Contrariwise, "moderate" potassium levels go with a better prognosis, while the emergence of new drugs, potassium binders, could allow target doses of RAASi to be achieved.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting [^112Ruzdf]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (serum K + > 5.0 mmol/L) is commonly observed among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Current international guidelines may not reflect the latest evidence on managing hyperkalemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and there is a lack of high-quality published studies in this area. This consensus guideline aims to provide recommendations in relation to clinical practice. Available published evidence was evaluated through a systematic literature review, and the nominal group technique was used to develop consensus recommendations from a panel of experienced nephrologists, covering monitoring, dietary restrictions, prescription of K + binders, and concomitant prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Recent studies have shown that K + binders reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia, but further evidence is needed in areas including whether reduced-K + diets or treatment with K + binders improve patient-centered outcomes. Treatment of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting is complex, and decisions need to be tailored for individual patients.

Abstract

Hyperkalemia is a frequent and sometimes life‐threatening condition that may be associated with arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction in patients with heart failure (HF). High potassium levels in HF represent both a direct risk for cardiovascular complication and an indirect biomarker of the severity of the underlying disease, reflecting neurohormonal activation and renal dysfunction. Evaluating the prevalence and significance of hyperkalemia in HF patients is essential for optimizing the use of potassium sparing agents, such the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) or angiotensin receptor‐neprilysin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which represent a well‐established cornerstone and life‐saving therapy. In this review we discuss recent findings and current concepts related to the epidemiology, pathological mechanisms and implications of hyperkalemia, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to counteract it in patients with HF. The balance between optimizing life‐saving potassium sparing medication and minimizing hyperkalemia‐associated risk is much needed in patients with HF. Although older potassium‐binding agents are associated with serious adverse events, novel potassium‐binding drugs are effective in lowering potassium levels and are generally well tolerated. Novel potassium‐binding drugs, such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, may help to optimize therapy in HF and achieve guideline‐recommended doses. Hyperkalemia is common in HF patients and is associated with a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications: Contrariwise, "moderate" potassium levels go with a better prognosis, while the emergence of new drugs, potassium binders, could allow target doses of RAASi to be achieved.

### Dispelling myths and misconceptions about the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^111gKdBN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, there are no consensus guidelines on the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition. Herein, we provide a succinct review of what we believe to be the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, examine current available literature, and discuss practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects. We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### Advances in the management of hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease [^111osyEJ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of hyperkalemia that increases both short-term and long-term mortality. Historically, managing hyperkalemia has relied upon dietary modifications, augmentation of urinary potassium excretion and enhanced enteral potassium elimination. This review discusses current treatments and their limitations and summarizes the evidence supporting novel agents for potassium lowering in patients with CKD.

Recent Findings

The introduction of two novel ion exchange resins represents the first new pharmacologic therapies for hyperkalemia in the last 50 years. Patiromer, which was recently approved for use in the United States, has been shown to be well tolerated and effective for decreasing serum potassium in patients with CKD when taken for up to a year. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for which approval is pending has also shown promise in treating both acute and chronic hyperkalemia in patients with CKD. Both medications have been well tolerated with minimal adverse events in relatively short-term follow-up.

Summary

Novel ion exchange resins have the potential to provide new strategies for safely and effectively managing hyperkalemia in the CKD population. This may decrease morbidity and mortality associated with hyperkalemia and allow more broad use of medications whose use is otherwise limited by hyperkalemia.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Utilization of potassium binders for the management of hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease: a position statement by US nephrologists [^113fXfCY]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Two potassium (K +) binders-patiromer sorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate-are recommended by international guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia. There is, however, no universally accepted best practice for how to appropriately utilize K + binders in the long-term clinical management of CKD. A panel of eight US-based nephrologists convened in October 2022 to develop a consensus statement regarding utilizing K + binders in clinical practice to help manage patients with nonemergent, persistent/recurrent hyperkalemia in CKD. Consensus was reached on the following topics: (1) identifying risk factors for hyperkalemia; (2) serum K + monitoring before and during K + binder use; (3) utilizing K + binders in patients receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and dialysis; and (4) when to initiate K + binders and their duration of use. These consensus statements for the use of K + binders may assist the nephrology community in optimizing management of hyperkalemia in patients across the spectrum of CKD.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

Strategies to avoid 'deprescribing' in hyperkalemia

RASi and MR antagonists might be legitimately withheld due to well-justified fears of hyperkalemia in patients with significant risk factors or in patients who prioritize avoidance of hyperkalemia (or other factors such as tablet burden) over any potential prognostic benefit. On the other hand, they may be withheld because of an exaggerated fear of hyperkalemia on the part of the physician or patient. To our knowledge, there have been no robust studies that have succeeded in exploring the underlying reasons for this gap in a large population.

Several potential strategies could be used to minimize 'deprescribing' and thus realize the potential benefit of RASis and MRAs in target patient groups. First, we could ensure that prescribing decisions are made in the context of accurate data regarding the presence — or risk — of hyperkalemia in any individual patient. Large datasets have been used to construct hyperkalemia 'risk scores'. Emerging technologies (such as wearable and needle-free potassium sensors) providing real-time [K +] e data could allow RASis/MRAs to be omitted only on hyperkalemic days rather than being permanently discontinued in high-risk patients.

Second, novel alternative drugs, such as non-steroidal MR antagonists, may confer less risk of hyperkalemia than conventional agents. These are being tested in clinical trials.

Third, one should not forget tried-and-trusted methods for lowering potassium levels. Effective dietary advice and dietetic input can play a vital role in limiting hyperkalemia. Administration of loop and thiazide diuretics can be a useful strategy in selected patients.

Finally, hyperkalemia could be avoided by the co-prescription of tolerable potassium binders (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate). This strategy was successful in preventing RASi deprescribing in a small RCT. So far, these novel agents appear to be a valuable addition to our therapeutic armoury. However, we should be relatively cautious about the introduction into widespread clinical practice and remain vigilant for side effects that may emerge during post-marketing surveillance. In clinical trials, patiromer was associated with adverse reactions including hypomagnesemia and gastrointestinal upset and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was associated with hypokalemia and oedema.

Commentary and clinical utility — dietary counseling and medication review are advocated as adjuncts to hyperkalemia management, and the KDOQI Work Group suggests considering the use of new potassium binders rather than stopping RAS inhibitors or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, with short-term sodium polystyrene sulfonate as an alternative in underresourced settings after attempts to obtain new binders. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are described as advantageous because they do not require three-times-daily administration like sodium polystyrene sulfonate, and strategies to maintain normal potassium include dietary adjustments, adjusting diuretic doses, and/or utilizing SGLT2 inhibitors; clinicians should also review herbal and prescribed products that can raise potassium and increase monitoring when indicated.

### Controversies in management of hyperkalemia [^114N7A4i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that can result in morbidity and mortality if not managed appropriately.

Objectives

This review evaluates the classic treatments of hyperkalemia and discusses controversies and new medications for management.

Discussion

Potassium (K+) plays a key role in determining the transmembrane potentials of "excitable membranes" present in nerve and muscle cells. K+ is the predominant intracellular cation, and clinical deterioration typically ensues when patients develop sufficiently marked elevation in extracellular fluid concentrations of K+ (hyperkalemia). Hyperkalemia is usually detected via serum clinical laboratory measurement. The most severe effect of hyperkalemia includes various cardiac dysrhythmias, which may result in cardiac arrest and death. Treatment includes measures to "stabilize" cardiac membranes, to shift K+ from extracellular to intracellular stores, and to promote K+ excretion. Calcium gluconate 10% dosed 10 mL intravenously should be provided for membrane stabilization, unless the patient is in cardiac arrest, in which case 10 mL calcium chloride is warranted. Beta-agonists and intravenous insulin should be given, and some experts recommend the use of synthetic short-acting insulins rather than regular insulin. Dextrose should also be administered, as indicated by initial and serial serum glucose measurements. Dialysis is the most efficient means to enable removal of excess K+. Loop and thiazide diuretics can also be useful. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not efficacious. New medications to promote gastrointestinal K+ excretion, which include patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, hold promise.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia can be deadly, and treatment requires specific measures including membrane stabilization, cellular shift, and excretion.

8 HYPERKALEMIA MANAGEMENT: FOCUS ON NEW TREATMENTS

The treatment of chronic hyperkalemia can be difficult and may be life‐threatening if left untreated. Potassium binders such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate is mainly used in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. This substance is only suitable for short‐term treatment since its use is associated with hypernatremia, volume overload and gastrointestinal complications. A suggested management of chronic hyperkalemia in HF patients is presented in Figure 1. However, their use is associated with adverse effects, their efficacy is ascertain and their effects are transient. In this regard, the introduction of patiromer, acting at the level of the gastrointestinal tract, in particular in the colon lumen, is relevant, 20, 21, 23, 24 may decrease serum potassium levels and enable treatment with RAASi and MRAs in significantly higher doses. Patiromer for oral suspension is a non‐absorbed, sodium‐free potassium binding polymer that exchanges calcium for potassium in the gastrointestinal tract. Patiromer beads are insoluble, have an average particle size of ≈100 μm and so are too large to be absorbed, excreted ≈24 to 48 h after intake and bind potassium predominantly in the lumen of the colon and this increases fecal potassium excretion, reducing levels of free potassium. 20, 21, 23, 24 The mean reduction of serum potassium levels by patiromer in large clinical trials was in the range 0.45 to 1 mmol/L. 52

FIGURE 1
Steps in the therapeutic management of hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure. RAASi, renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhbitors; MRAs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Zirconium cyclosilicate (SCZ, former ZS‐9) — an inorganic cation that allows a thermodynamically favorable catching of potassium ions‐ represent another significant pharmacologic advancements in the treatment of hyperkalemia. More specifically SCZ is an oral, nonabsorbed, high‐capacity cation‐binding compound that selectively exchanges K + for hydrogen and sodium ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract and has rapid onset of action. A single treatment with SCZ may reduce serum K + levels at 1 h after the initial dose, results in a continued and sustained reduction in serum K + levels for up to 48 h after the initial dose and has a favorable safety profile. 53 The mean reduction of serum potassium levels by SCZ in large clinical trials was in the range 0.3 to 1.1 mmol/L. 52

### Treatment of hyperkalemia: something old, something new [^1179RgeH]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment options for hyperkalemia have not changed much since the introduction of the cation exchange resin, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate, Covis Pharmaceuticals, Cary, NC), over 50 years ago. Although clinicians of that era did not have ready access to hemodialysis or loop diuretics, the other tools that we use today-calcium, insulin, and bicarbonate-were well known to them. Currently recommended insulin regimens provide too little insulin to achieve blood levels with a maximal kalemic effect and too little glucose to avoid hypoglycemia. Short-acting insulins have theoretical advantages over regular insulin in patients with severe kidney disease. Although bicarbonate is no longer recommended for acute management, it may be useful in patients with metabolic acidosis or intact kidney function. Kayexalate is not effective as acute therapy, but a new randomized controlled trial suggests that it is effective when given more chronically. Gastrointestinal side effects and safety concerns about Kayexalate remain. New investigational potassium binders are likely to be approved in the coming year. Although there are some concerns about hypomagnesemia and positive calcium balance from patiromer, and sodium overload from ZS-9 (ZS Pharma, Coppell, TX), both agents have been shown to be effective and well tolerated when taken chronically. ZS-9 shows promise in the acute treatment of hyperkalemia and may make it possible to avoid or postpone the most effective therapy, emergency hemodialysis.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1165QLYm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

There are a range of treatment options recommended for use in managing hyperkalaemia in adults with cardiorenal disease:
Loop and thiazide diuretics can be used to increase potassium excretion by increasing the delivery of sodium to the collecting ducts. Diuretics are recommended for use in treating mild‐to‐moderate hyperkalaemia in individuals with adequate renal function. Diuretics also have utility in those with hyperkalaemia and concomitant volume overload or hypertension.
Oral sodium bicarbonate may be considered in individuals with hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis, particularly in those with a serum bicarbonate level of < 22 mmol/L, but it is important to consider sodium load, particularly in those at risk of fluid overload. In those at risk of fluid overload, concurrent diuretic use should be considered.
Two novel potassium binders have recently been developed, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC). Both have demonstrated efficacy, and the ESC HF guidelines (2021) and the KDIGO guidelines for managing diabetes in CKD (2020) and for managing blood pressure in CKD (2021) recommend their use for treatment of RAASi‐associated hyperkalaemia.
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) has traditionally been used to treat hyperkalaemia, but there are questions regarding the safety and efficacy of this agent.

Hyperkalemia in CKD — practice points emphasize awareness of variability in potassium measurement and local formulary constraints, note no recommendations for timing to recheck potassium or for managing hyperkalemia, and provide dietary guidance. In CKD G3–G5 with emergent hyperkalemia, implement an individualized approach including dietary and pharmacologic interventions with assessment and education through a renal dietitian or an accredited nutrition provider. Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods) for people with CKD G3–G5 who experience hyperkalemia or when it is an emerging issue and for individuals with kidney failure receiving dialysis when intakes of potassium are variable, and consider dietary and pharmacologic strategies during disease periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances in hypertension — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment. A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension and should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Common laboratory disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine; hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of chronic kidney disease. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide-type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide-type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia can also be managed with initiation of potassium-lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### The management of hyperkalemia in patients with cardiovascular disease [^113km3w7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The development of hyperkalemia is common in patients with cardiac and kidney disease who are administered drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). As the results of large-scale clinical trials in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure demonstrate benefits of RAAS blockade alone or, in some cases, in combination therapies, the incidence of hyperkalemia has increased in clinical practice. Although there is potential for adverse events in the presence of hyperkalemia, there also are potential benefits of RAAS blockers that support their use in high-risk patient populations. Management of hyperkalemia may be improved by identifying the levels of potassium that may potentially induce harm and using appropriate strategies to avert the levels that may be dangerous or life threatening.

---

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116QojEn]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Hyperkalemia in heart failure (HF) — patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC): Hyperkalemia is common in HF as a result of the syndrome itself, comorbidities (diabetes, CKD), and use of RAASi, and can increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias and mortality. Both agents have been FDA approved for treatment of hyperkalemia for patients receiving RAASi. In the PEARL-HF trial, patiromer led to lower potassium levels, less hyperkalemia, and a higher proportion of patients able to increase spironolactone dose to 50 mg daily compared with placebo. The HARMONIZE trial included 94 patients (out of 258 total) with HF (87 of whom entered the double-blind phase). The SZC groups achieved lower potassium levels overall compared with placebo, and a higher proportion maintained normokalemia (potassium levels, < 5.1 mEq/L). Whether patiromer or SZC improve clinical outcomes is under investigation. Adverse effects for the newer potassium binders include hypomagnesemia (for patiromer) and edema (for SZC).

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for management of hyperkalemia during spironolactone optimization in patients with heart Failure [^115GPG1u]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but are underused in clinical practice. Observational data suggest that hyperkalemia is the leading obstacle for the suboptimal use of MRA.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the effects of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) in optimizing use of spironolactone among participants with HFrEF and hyperkalemia.

Methods

REALIZE-K (Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of SZC for the Management of High Potassium in Patients With Symptomatic HFrEF Receiving Spironolactone) was a prospective, double-blind, randomized- withdrawal trial in participants with HFrEF (NYHA functional class II-IV; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%), optimal guideline-directed therapy (except MRA), and prevalent or incident MRA-induced hyperkalemia. During open-label run-in, participants underwent spironolactone titration (target: 50 mg/day); those with hyperkalemia started SZC. Participants with normokalemia (potassium: 3.5–5.0 mEq/L) on SZC and spironolactone ≥ 25 mg/day were randomized to continued SZC or placebo for 6 months. The primary endpoint was optimal treatment response (normokalemia on spironolactone ≥ 25 mg/day without rescue therapy for hyperkalemia [months 1–6]). The 5 secondary endpoints were tested hierarchically. Exploratory endpoints included a composite of adjudicated cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure (HF) events (hospitalizations and urgent visits).

Results

Overall, 203 participants were randomized (SZC: 102; placebo: 101). Higher percentage of SZC- vs placebo-treated participants had optimal response (71% vs 36%; OR: 4.45; 95% CI: 2.89–6.86; P < 0.001). SZC (vs placebo) improved the first 4 secondary endpoints: normokalemia on randomization dose of spironolactone and without rescue therapy (58% vs 23%; OR: 4.58; 95% CI: 2.78–7.55; P < 0.001); receiving spironolactone ≥ 25 mg/day (81% vs 50%; OR: 4.33; 95% CI: 2.50–7.52; P < 0.001); time to hyperkalemia (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.37–0.71; P < 0.001); and time to decrease/discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.17–0.73; P = 0.006). There was no between-group difference in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score at 6 months (-1.01 points; 95% CI: -6.64 to 4.63; P = 0.72). Adverse events (64% vs 63%) and serious adverse events (23% vs 22%) were balanced between SZC and placebo, respectively. Composite of cardiovascular (CV) death or worsening HF occurred in 11 (11%) participants in the SZC group (1 with CV death, 10 with HF events) and 3 (3%) participants in the placebo group (1 with CV death, 2 with HF events; log-rank nominal P = 0.034).

Conclusions

In participants with HFrEF and hyperkalemia, SZC led to large improvements in the percentage of participants with normokalemia while on optimal spironolactone dose, and reduced risk of hyperkalemia and down-titration/discontinuation of spironolactone. Although underpowered for clinical outcomes, more participants had HF events with SZC than placebo, which should be factored into the clinical decision making.

### Real-world associations between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy, hyperkalemia, and outcomes: a clinical and scientific call to action [^111Enm43]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Recently, 2 new oral potassium‐binding agents have been developed and approved for physician use. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved patiromer, a polymer that exchanges potassium for calcium, as a therapy for management of hyperkalemia. 8 In the past year, the US Food and Drug Administration approved sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, a polymer that exchanges potassium for sodium and hydrogen, as a therapy for management of hyperkalemia. 9 Both have been shown to be safe and effective for long‐term management of hyperkalemia. They have not been shown to cause bowel necrosis as older agents have and are seen to be much more tolerable in terms of gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea. Additionally, there are small pilot data demonstrating that over a 4‐week period in a group of CHF patients, patiromer use allowed for continued spironolactone use. 10 Cost and need to time hours away from administration of other oral medications remain limitations.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure [^113mdRrN]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Disorders of potassium homeostasis can potentiate the already elevated risk of arrhythmia in heart failure. Heart failure patients have a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which further heightens the risk of hyperkalemia, especially when renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are used. Acute treatment for hyperkalemia may not be tolerated in the long term. Recent data for patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, used to treat and prevent high serum potassium levels on a more chronic basis, have sparked interest in the treatment of hyperkalemia, as well as the potential use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients who were previously unable to take these drugs or tolerated only low doses. This review discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and outcomes of hyperkalemia in heart failure; provides an overview of traditional and novel ways to approach management of hyperkalemia; and discusses the need for further research to optimally treat heart failure.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116AU5Ci]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

RAASi/MRA management in CKD with hyperkalemia includes a stepwise approach: Optimize serum bicarbonate levels; Consider potassium-exchange agents; Third-line (Last resort): Reduce or discontinue RAASi/MRA; restart in future if patient condition allows. Providers may consider reducing or stopping ACEI/ARB when eGFR drops below a given eGFR threshold or when hyperkalemia develops, but hyperkalemia associated with use of ACEI/ARB can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping ACEI/ARB. Protocols for RCTs of finerenone held the medication at potassium > 5.5 mmol/L; however, it may be appropriate to continue these medications in people with potassium of 5.5–6.0 mmol/L. We recommend involvement of nephrology when there is consideration of continuing ACEI/ARB/MRA when potassium > 5.5 mmol/L. The International Society of Nephrology provides an Optimization of RAASi Therapy Toolkit that includes guidance for managing hyperkalemia in patients on RAASi.

### New drugs to prevent and treat hyperkalemia [^112fGR6g]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperkalemia is frequent, but occurs mostly in patients with chronic kidney disease and is often the cause of discontinuation or omission of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart failure.

Recent Findings

Without much evidence in the literature on its efficacy, sodium polystyrene sulfonate is being used frequently in the clinical setting to treat hyperkalemia. In the last few years, two new promising agents have been developed to treat hyperkalemia - patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 9 (ZS-9). Both patiromer and ZS-9 have been shown to decrease potassium in patients with hyperkalemia and then to maintain normokalemia. Gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent with patiromer, and edema occurred in patients using high doses of ZS-9, possibly due to its high sodium content.

Summary

Although patiromer and ZS-9 are very promising in terms of safety and efficacy, many questions remain, mostly in terms of selection of patients, long-term effects and costs.

### Hyperkalemia in patients with chronic renal failure [^1158LEyx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Although hyperkalemia is much more common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the reported frequency of hyperkalemia varies markedly across studies, primarily due to differences in the ascertainment of hyperkalemia and the severity of CKD. Major risk factors for hyperkalemia among CKD patients include lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis), diabetes, older age and male gender. The use of two drugs to inhibit RAAS in diabetic CKD markedly increases the risk of hyperkalemia, as demonstrated in large multicenter clinical trials. Hyperkalemia has consistently been associated with an increased risk of adverse events compared with normokalemia, including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This risk is not explained by differences in comorbidity or estimated GFR, nor concomitant metabolic abnormalities such as acidosis among those with hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate has been used commonly for decades to treat hyperkalemia in CKD patients, but without any high-quality clinical data to support its efficacy and with an increased risk of rare but serious colonic complications. The newer oral potassium-binding agents, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, have been shown to be effective and safe for the non-emergent treatment of hyperkalemia in CKD patients, including patients treated with RAASis. Although the long-term use of these medications may permit continuation of RAASis in CKD patients with hyperkalemia, the overall impact of this approach (as compared with down-titration of RAASis and/or up-titration of diuretics) on long-term morbidity, mortality and quality of life remains uncertain.

INTRODUCTION

The introduction of new potassium binders (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) has refocused attention on hyperkalemia. There have also been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article we aim to present these recent advances in the context of a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We will highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice.

### Pivotal clinical trials, meta-analyses and current guidelines in the treatment of hyperkalemia [^112vUSSL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (HK) is the most common electrolyte disturbance observed in patients with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), is a potentially life-threatening clinical condition due to an increased risk of fatal arrhythmias, and strongly impacts the quality of life and prognosis of CKD patients. Moreover, while renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASIs) represent the most cardio-nephro-protective drugs used in clinical practice, the treatment with these drugs per se increases serum potassium (sK) values, particularly when heart failure and diabetes mellitus coexist. In fact, the onset or recurrence of HK is frequently associated with not starting, down-titrating or withdrawing RAASIs, and is an indication to begin renal replacement treatment in end-stage renal disease. Current strategies aimed at preventing and treating chronic HK are still unsatisfactory, as evidenced by the relatively high prevalence of HK also in patients under stable nephrology care, and even in the ideal setting of randomized clinical trials. Indeed, dietary potassium restriction, the use of sodium bicarbonate or diuretics, the withdrawal or down-titration of RAASIs, or the administration of old potassium binders, namely sodium polystyrene sulphonate and calcium polystyrene sulphonate, have limited efficacy and are poorly tolerated; therefore, these strategies are not suitable for long-term control of sK. As such, there is an important unmet need for novel therapeutic options for the chronic management of patients at risk for HK. The development of new potassium binders may change the treatment landscape in the near future. This review summarizes the current evidence on the treatment of chronic HK in cardio-renal patients.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment; a basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension and 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of diuretics, ACEi, ARB, and MRA. Hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, and hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics, especially when used in combination or in chronic kidney disease; ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Mitigation strategies include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combining medications with complementary electrolyte effects (for example, ACEi plus a thiazide-type or loop diuretic); treatment of hyperkalemia can include initiation of potassium-lowering drugs including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, with emphasis on taking them mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

For initial treatment of hyperkalemia, the recommended dose of LOKELMA is 10 g administered three times a day for up to 48 hours. Administer LOKELMA orally as a suspension in water [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

For continued treatment, the recommended dose is 10 g once daily. Monitor serum potassium and adjust the dose of LOKELMA based on the serum potassium level and desired target range. During maintenance treatment, up-titrate based on the serum potassium level at intervals of 1-week or longer and in increments of 5 g. Decrease the dose of LOKELMA or discontinue if the serum potassium is below the desired target range. The recommended maintenance dose range is from 5 g every other day to 15 g daily.

2.2 Dosage Adjustment for Patients on Chronic Hemodialysis

For patients on chronic hemodialysis, administer LOKELMA only on non-dialysis days.

The recommended starting dose is 5 g once daily on non-dialysis days. Consider a starting dose of 10 g once daily on non-dialysis days in patients with serum potassium greater than 6.5 mEq/L. Monitor serum potassium and adjust the dose of LOKELMA based on the pre-dialysis serum potassium value after the long inter-dialytic interval and desired target range.

During initiation and after a dose adjustment, assess serum potassium after one week. The recommended maintenance dose range is from 5 g to 15 g once daily, on non-dialysis days.

Discontinue or decrease the dose of LOKELMA if:

serum potassium falls below the desired target range based on the pre-dialysis value after the long interdialytic interval, or;
the patient develops clinically significant hypokalemia

2.3 Reconstitution and Administration

In general, other oral medications should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after LOKELMA [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Instruct patients to empty the entire contents of the packet(s) into a drinking glass containing approximately 3 tablespoons of water or more if desired. Stir well and drink immediately. If powder remains in the drinking glass, add water, stir and drink immediately. Repeat until no powder remains to ensure the entire dose is taken.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^115GDr43]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study End Points

The primary end point was the mean absolute reduction in serum potassium level from baseline at 3 distinct time intervals after patiromer administration: 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. These time intervals were prespecified to facilitate analysis in the absence of a standardized, institutional hyperkalemia protocol. Reduction of serum potassium levels was also assessed using relative (percentage) reduction owing to the hypothesized mechanism of more prominent lowering with higher baseline elevation. Outcomes were compared across prespecified subgroups based on care setting, patiromer dose, and baseline hyperkalemia severity stratified as mild (potassium level, 5.1–5.5 mEq/L), moderate (potassium level, 5.6–6.4 mEq/L), or severe (potassium level, ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). Subsequent use of any potassium binder was captured as well as standard-of-care hyperkalemia control measures (eg, calcium, albuterol, regular insulin coadministered with dextrose, and dialysis). Time to a second potassium binder dose and time to insulin dose were assessed. Incidence of hypokalemia, defined as a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L, and incidence of hypomagnesemia, defined as a serum magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL or less (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.4114), at 24 hours were recorded. Potassium laboratory test orders and their performance times after the initial patiromer administration were evaluated at intervals of 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. The time to the earliest recheck and the presence of repeated laboratory tests in each time interval were evaluated to provide insight on potassium monitoring patterns in real-world clinical practice without a treatment protocol.

### Revisiting RAAS blockade in CKD with newer potassium-binding drugs [^111e9CNv]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Among patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), current guideline recommendations mandate the use of agents blocking the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) as first-line antihypertensive therapy based on randomized trials demonstrating that RAAS inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive drug classes in slowing nephropathy progression to end-stage renal disease. However, the opportunities for adequate RAAS blockade in CKD are often limited, and an important impediment is the risk of hyperkalemia, especially when RAAS inhibitors are used in maximal doses or are combined. Accordingly, a large proportion of patients with proteinuric CKD may not have the anticipated renoprotective benefits since RAAS blockers are often discontinued due to incident hyperkalemia or are administered at suboptimal doses for fear of the development of hyperkalemia. Two newer potassium binders, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS-9), have been shown to effectively and safely reduce serum potassium levels and maintain long-term normokalemia in CKD patients receiving background therapy with RAAS inhibitors. Whether these novel potassium-lowering therapies can overcome the barrier of hyperkalemia and enhance the tolerability of RAAS inhibitor use in proteinuric CKD awaits randomized trials.

### Effect of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate on potassium lowering for 28 days among outpatients with hyperkalemia: the HARMONIZE randomized clinical trial [^115yx13g]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality that may be difficult to manage because of a lack of effective therapies. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is a nonabsorbed cation exchanger that selectively binds potassium in the intestine.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of zirconium cyclosilicate for 28 days in patients with hyperkalemia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

HARMONIZE was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating zirconium cyclosilicate in outpatients with hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) recruited from 44 sites in the United States, Australia, and South Africa (March-August 2014).

Interventions

Patients (n = 258) received 10 g of zirconium cyclosilicate 3 times daily in the initial 48-hour open-label phase. Patients (n = 237) achieving normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L) were then randomized to receive zirconium cyclosilicate, 5 g (n = 45 patients), 10 g (n = 51), or 15 g (n = 56), or placebo (n = 85) daily for 28 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was mean serum potassium level in each zirconium cyclosilicate group vs placebo during days 8–29 of the randomized phase.

Results

In the open-label phase, serum potassium levels declined from 5.6 mEq/L at baseline to 4.5 mEq/L at 48 hours. Median time to normalization was 2.2 hours, with 84% of patients (95% CI, 79%-88%) achieving normokalemia by 24 hours and 98% (95% CI, 96%-99%) by 48 hours. In the randomized phase, serum potassium was significantly lower during days 8–29 with all 3 zirconium cyclosilicate doses vs placebo (4.8 mEq/L [95% CI, 4.6–4.9], 4.5 mEq/L [95% CI, 4.4–4.6], and 4.4 mEq/L [95% CI, 4.3–4.5] for 5 g, 10 g, and 15 g; 5.1 mEq/L [95% CI, 5.0–5.2] for placebo; P < .001 for all comparisons). The proportion of patients with mean potassium < 5.1 mEq/L during days 8–29 was significantly higher in all zirconium cyclosilicate groups vs placebo (36/45 [80%], 45/50 [90%], and 51/54 [94%] for the 5-g, 10-g, and 15-g groups, vs 38/82 [46%] with placebo; P < .001 for each dose vs placebo). Adverse events were comparable between zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo, although edema was more common in the 15-g group (edema incidence: 2/85 [2%], 1/45 [2%], 3/51 [6%], and 8/56 [14%] patients in the placebo, 5-g, 10-g, and 15-g groups). Hypokalemia developed in 5/51 (10%) and 6/56 patients (11%) in the 10-g and 15-g zirconium cyclosilicate groups, vs none in the 5-g or placebo groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among outpatients with hyperkalemia, open-label sodium zirconium cyclosilicate reduced serum potassium to normal levels within 48 hours; compared with placebo, all 3 doses of zirconium cyclosilicate resulted in lower potassium levels and a higher proportion of patients with normal potassium levels for up to 28 days. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zirconium cyclosilicate beyond 4 weeks and to assess long-term clinical outcomes.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116HAUpi]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spans trials enrolling patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, ≤ 40%, and ≤ 30%. For spironolactone and eplerenone, the starting dose is 25 mg orally daily, increased to 50 mg daily orally after a month; for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 31 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m2, dosing should be reduced by half, and regular checks of serum potassium and renal function are advised approximately 1 week, then 4 weeks, then every 6 months after initiating or intensifying MRA, with more frequent testing for clinical instability. Safety concerns include when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and when MRA is initiated at serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L and continued ≥ 5.5 mEq/L; in trials, clinically significant hyperkalemia events were < 10% in EPHESUS and EMPHASIS-HF. Coadministration of MRA with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) mildly increases hyperkalemia risk, hyperkalemia risk was lower with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in chronic heart failure but not different in decompensated heart failure when compared with ACEi, diarrhea causing dehydration or loop diuretic therapy interruption should be a consideration for temporarily holding the MRA, and the efficacy of potassium binders (for example, patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to facilitate continuation of MRA is uncertain.

### Can novel potassium binders liberate people with chronic kidney disease from the low-potassium diet? A cautionary tale [^117Bq6M8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The advent of new potassium binders provides an important breakthrough in the chronic management of hyperkalemia for people with CKD. In addition to the direct benefits of managing hyperkalemia, many researchers and clinicians view these new medications as a possible means to safely transition patients away from the low-potassium diet to a more healthful eating pattern. In this review, we examine the mechanisms of potassium binders in the context of hyperkalemia risk related to dietary potassium intake in people with CKD. We note that whereas these medications target hyperkalemia caused by potassium bioaccumulation, the primary evidence for restricting dietary potassium is risk of postprandial hyperkalemia. The majority of ingested potassium is absorbed alongside endogenously secreted potassium in the small intestines, but the action of these novel medications is predominantly constrained to the large intestine. As a result and despite their effectiveness in lowering basal potassium levels, it remains unclear whether potassium binders would provide protection against hyperkalemia caused by excessive dietary potassium intake in people with CKD. Until this knowledge gap is bridged, clinicians should consider postprandial hyperkalemia risk when removing restrictions on dietary potassium intake in people with CKD on potassium binders.

### Hyperkalemia [^116MgUnZ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration also can be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life threatening. Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances — assessment and monitoring: A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension, including primary or secondary Aldosteronism and other endocrine causes, and a basic metabolic panel should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, ACEi (angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor), ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker), and MRA (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist). Common lab disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine. Hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide‑type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium‑sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of CKD. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide‑type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide‑type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia, other than emergency treatment for life‑threatening hyperkalemia, can also be managed with initiation of potassium‑lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid‑day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life‑threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

In our study, patients treated with patiromer experienced sustained reductions in their serum potassium level (mean [SD] reduction, 0.50 [0.56] mEq/L, an 8.5% decrease from baseline) within the first 6 hours of administration (mean [SD] blood sample obtainment time, 2.9 [1.8] hours) in all care settings, suggesting that its onset of action may be faster than previously reported. Furthermore, the association of patiromer with reduced serum potassium levels persisted across all baseline potassium ranges, with infrequent use of additional potassium control measures (such as insulin or repeated potassium binder doses) within the initial 24 hours after patiromer administration. The incidence of hypokalemia was low in our study, with patients experiencing mild hypokalemia (serum potassium level, < 3.5 mEq/L) in 0.2% of encounters compared with approximately 4.7% in clinical trial data. The incidence of hypomagnesemia (10.0%) was similar to that in clinical trial data (9.0%), although our study's cutoff was 1.7 mg/dL vs 1.4 mg/dL and we did not evaluate serum magnesium levels at baseline or a change in magnesium levels. Of interest, recently published rates of decreased potassium and magnesium levels from a 4-year global pharmacovigilance database of adverse drug events in patients who were prescribed patiromer in clinical practice were 0.45% and 0.16%, respectively. The variance in these rates across trial data, ambulatory surveillance, and institutional settings likely reflects different hyperkalemia causes, patient populations, and monitoring patterns.

### Management of hyperkalemia in chronic heart failure using sodium zirconium cyclosilicate [^112maKvG]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

SZC is a promising therapeutic option that immediately decreases approximately 1.0 mEq/L of serum potassium in patients with heart failure and hyperkalemia. However, caution should be exercised when utilizing SZC at a loading dose specifically in those with mild hyperkalemia. A maintenance dose, instead of loading dose, would be recommended in such a cohort as an initial dose.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — potassium binders for persistent hyperkalemia: In patients with chronic kidney disease, we suggest using potassium binders in the management of persistent, non-life-threatening hyperkalemia (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). The newer potassium binding agents, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC/ZS-9) and patiromer, significantly reduced mean potassium levels compared to placebo, and older agents, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) and Calcium Polystyrene Sulfonate (CPS), were shown to significantly reduce mean serum potassium when compared to placebo. One study suggests that use of potassium binders is effective at controlling hyperkalemia, which allows continuation of RAAS blockade in patients with CKD or heart failure. The overall strength of the evidence for the outcomes assessed in the evidence base is Low to Very low due to the limitations in the methodological quality of the included RCTs. Natale et al. indicated no difference in cardiovascular death or hospitalization between the newer potassium binding agents versus placebo; there were no hospitalizations noted with the older potassium binding agents or placebo, and in Dong et al., there were no recorded deaths with SPS or CPS. Two deaths, one of which was cardiovascular, were reported in the SZC/ZS-9 group and none in the other studied groups, and the authors did not specify whether the deaths were related to bowel necrosis or hyperkalemia. The side effect profile of potassium binders consists primarily of GI side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation, and with SPS there is a rare side effect of bowel necrosis seen with older formulations; treatment of hyperkalemia with potassium binders is appropriate in CKD to reduce the risk of life-threatening hyperkalemia and permit the use of medications to slow the progression of CKD.

### Patiromer for the management of hyperkalemia in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: the DIAMOND trial [^114LohvV]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias and mortality. Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) improve symptoms and reduce hospitalizations for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality for patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but they increase the risk of hyperkalemia, especially for those with concomitant chronic kidney disease and/or diabetes mellitus. Hyperkalemia, or the fear of inducing it, often leads to suboptimal use and dose of RAASi, especially mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), placing patients at an increased risk for adverse outcomes.

Patiromer is a novel potassium-binder that exchanges potassium for calcium in the gastrointestinal tract that can be used to improve control of serum potassium. Previous trials of patiromer have been limited in terms of duration of follow-up and sample size. The DIAMOND (Patiromer for the Management of Hyperkalemia in Participants Receiving RAASi Medications for the Treatment of Heart Failure) trial was designed to assess the longer-term ability of patiromer to control serum potassium, prevent hyperkalemia events, and improve outcomes and the proportion of patients achieving guideline-recommended doses of RAASi in patients with HFrEF with hyperkalemia related to RAASi use or a history thereof. Due to slow enrollment rates, changing hospitalization patterns, lower than expected event rates, the uncertainty of the course of the pandemic as a consequence of COVID-19, the primary endpoint was revised during the study from time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death or cardiovascular hospitalization, to changes in serum potassium levels from the baseline.

### Potassium binder [^1112hSj6]. Wikipedia (2008). Low credibility.

Potassium binders are medications that bind potassium ions in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby preventing its intestinal absorption. This category formerly consisted solely of polystyrene sulfonate, a polyanionic resin attached to a cation, administered either orally or by retention enema to patients who are at risk of developing hyperkalaemia. Newer drugs include another polyanionic polymer, patiromer, which exchanges calcium for potassium, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate crystals, which exchange sodium for potassium. Increased serum potassium levels are a condition likely to occur in patients with chronic kidney disease in advanced stages. Clinical use Potassium, the most abundant intracellular cation, is essential for life. An adequate gradient of potassium across the cell membrane is necessary in order to enable excitability of cell membranes. This is particularly important for nerve and muscle function.

In humans, mainly the kidneys are responsible for the regulation of serum potassium levels by excreting excess potassium via the urine. As kidney failure progresses, with a consequent decline of excretory function, potassium is likely to accumulate with probable harmful effects on the cellular membrane potential and cardiac arrhythmias as the primary symptom. If the physiological potassium blood level of between 3. 8 mmol/L and
5. 2 mmol/L is exceeded, hyperkalaemia is diagnosed. The mainstay of the treatment for chronic kidney disease patients is potassium removal through the dialysis procedure. However, dietary restrictions and pharmaceutical therapy with potassium binders are important complementary treatment options. Mechanism of action In general, potassium binders are artificial polyanionic resins that exchange bound cations for potassium ions in the distal large intestine.

After exchange, the released cation and potassium adhering to the resin are excreted with the faeces. This mechanism prevents intestinal absorption of alimentary potassium ions and thereby reduces serum potassium levels. There are two major classes of binders, differentiated by the cation attached to the resin in the original condition. Calcium resins release calcium ions in exchange for potassium ions, whereas sodium resins release sodium. Side effects Hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, nausea or vomiting are side effects commonly seen when polystyrene resins are used. Cases of colonic necrosis have been reported, particularly when sodium polystyrene sulfonate was used in combination with the laxative sorbitol. Additionally, electrolyte disturbances, systemic alkalosis or gastric irritation may occur. Furthermore, anorexia, nausea, vomiting or constipation as well as diarrhea have been recorded if high doses were applied.

### Hyperkalemia [^115Y2wLy]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Common causes of hyperkalemia include kidney failure, hypoaldosteronism, and rhabdomyolysis. A number of medications can also cause high blood potassium including mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists NSAIDs, potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Initial treatment in those with ECG changes is salts, such as calcium gluconate or calcium chloride. Other medications used to rapidly reduce blood potassium levels include insulin with dextrose, salbutamol, and sodium bicarbonate. Medications that might worsen the condition should be stopped and a low potassium diet should be started. Measures to remove potassium from the body include diuretics such as furosemide, potassium-binders such as polystyrene sulfonate and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, and hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is the most effective method.

For potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride and triamterene; both the drugs block epithelial sodium channels in the collecting tubules, thereby preventing potassium excretion into urine. Spironolactone acts by competitively inhibiting the action of aldosterone. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or celecoxib inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, leading to reduced production of renin and aldosterone, causing potassium retention. The antibiotic trimethoprim and the antiparasitic medication pentamidine inhibits potassium excretion, which is similar to mechanism of action by amiloride and triamterene. Mineralocorticoid deficiency or resistance can also cause hyperkalemia. Primary adrenal insufficiency are: Addison's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Beta2-adrenergic agonists act on beta-2 receptors to drive potassium into the cells.

Therefore, beta blockers can raise potassium levels by blocking beta-2 receptors. However, the rise in potassium levels is not marked unless there are other co-morbidities present. Examples of drugs that can raise the serum potassium are non-selective beta-blockers such as propranolol and labetalol. Beta-1 selective blockers such as metoprolol do not increase serum potassium levels. Increased extracellular potassium levels result in depolarization of the membrane potentials of cells due to the increase in the equilibrium potential of potassium. This depolarization opens some voltage-gated sodium channels, but also increases the inactivation at the same time. Since depolarization due to concentration change is slow, it never generates an action potential by itself; instead, it results in accommodation. Definitions Normal serum potassium levels are generally considered to be between 3. 5 and
5. 3 mmol/L. Levels above 5. 5 mmol/L generally indicate hyperkalemia, and those below
3.

5 mmol/L indicate hypokalemia. Prevention Preventing recurrence of hyperkalemia typically involves reduction of dietary potassium, removal of an offending medication, and/or the addition of a diuretic. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol are occasionally used on an ongoing basis to maintain lower serum levels of potassium though the safety of long-term use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate for this purpose is not well understood. High dietary sources include meat, chicken, seafood, vegetables such as avocados, tomatoes and potatoes, fruits such as bananas, oranges and nuts. Treatment Emergency lowering of potassium levels is needed when new arrhythmias occur at any level of potassium in the blood, or when potassium levels exceed 6. 5 mmol/L. Several agents are used to temporarily lower K⁺ levels. The choice depends on the degree and cause of the hyperkalemia, and other aspects of the person's condition.
