## Question

Melanoma prevention and detection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about melanoma prevention and detection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and burden to frame the problem. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for primary prevention, especially UV avoidance and sunscreen. Next, I will examine secondary prevention, including skin self-examination, clinician examination, and targeted screening, and I need to check the USPSTF stance and the risk of overdiagnosis. After that, I should review risk stratification tools and emerging technologies. Finally, I will synthesize practical, risk-adapted recommendations and highlight evidence gaps and future directions, making sure I continuously verify claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic context and why prevention and early detection matter. Melanoma accounts for roughly 1% of skin cancers but causes the most skin cancer deaths, with an estimated 98,000 new cases and 8,000 deaths in the US in 2023, and survival is tightly linked to stage at diagnosis, with 5-year survival about 99.5% for localized disease versus about 32% for distant disease, underscoring the potential value of early detection if truly achieved [^113kHSHX] [^117WDK2T]. Hold on, I should verify trends: incidence has increased over decades, though mortality has stabilized in some regions, likely reflecting earlier detection and improved therapies, yet disparities persist by sex, age, and race/ethnicity, with higher mortality in older men and in people with darker skin tones who are more often diagnosed later, which shapes prevention and screening priorities [^117WDK2T] [^1112VWbB].

> Now, I will examine primary prevention, starting with UV exposure reduction. UV radiation is the principal modifiable risk factor, and minimizing UV exposure through sun avoidance during peak hours, protective clothing, hats, sunglasses, and shade reduces risk; I need to ensure I anchor this to guideline-level advice, which the USPSTF supports via behavioral counseling for fair-skinned individuals and families with young children, and NCCN similarly emphasizes sun safety education and protective behaviors [^111RNnnv] [^1145oyGH] [^114oGm8d]. Wait, let me verify the counseling scope: USPSTF recommends counseling for ages 6 months to 24 years with fair skin and selectively for adults older than 24 with fair skin and risk factors, which aligns with a risk-targeted approach rather than blanket messaging [^111RNnnv] [^1145oyGH].

> Next, I should review sunscreen, and I need to be careful not to overstate certainty. High-quality data suggest regular use of broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen can reduce melanoma incidence, but observational studies have been inconsistent, and behavioral pitfalls like underapplication or increased sun exposure can blunt benefit. Thus, sunscreen should be paired with clothing and shade rather than used in isolation, and I should double-check that this nuance is reflected in current guidance, which indeed frames sunscreen as one component of a broader sun-protection strategy [^113pVVHV] [^1163spZn]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the evidence was uniformly strong, but I should correct that: while randomized data exist for keratinocyte cancers, melanoma-specific randomized prevention trials are limited, so the recommendation remains cautious and complementary to other measures [^113pVVHV].

> I will now examine indoor tanning, and I should confirm the magnitude of harm. Indoor tanning increases melanoma risk, particularly in younger users, and is estimated to cause thousands of melanomas annually in the US; community-level policies restricting minors' access are evidence-informed strategies to reduce exposure and downstream incidence, reinforcing the need for policy and education rather than relying on individual behavior alone [^113rGYsp]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with public health guidance: yes, community prevention frameworks emphasize restricting indoor tanning and environmental strategies to reduce UV exposure [^113rGYsp].

> Turning to secondary prevention, I need to check the status of population screening. The USPSTF issues an I statement for visual skin examination in asymptomatic adults, citing insufficient evidence of net benefit, modest diagnostic accuracy, and potential harms including overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies; this means routine population screening is not recommended, though clinicians may use judgment for individual patients with risk factors [^116cRQFs] [^111ugBhT] [^116hE2QC]. Let me verify the accuracy figures: sensitivity of clinician visual examination for melanoma ranges roughly 40–70% and specificity 86–98%, which explains false positives and the risk of overdiagnosis in low-prevalence settings [^113yhk9v].

> But wait, what about targeted screening in high-risk groups? I should review that separately. Observational and programmatic data suggest that surveillance of high-risk individuals can detect thinner melanomas, and serial dermatology-based programs have reported very early detection with no deaths in cohorts under close follow-up, though these are nonrandomized and susceptible to bias; nonetheless, professional guidelines commonly endorse risk-stratified surveillance for those with multiple nevi, atypical nevi, family history, or prior melanoma, using dermoscopy and sometimes total body photography to improve specificity over time [^117DmuKc] [^112UpXmv] [^116GhCqA]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while thinner detection is plausible, mortality benefit has not been proven in randomized trials, so shared decision-making is essential when recommending surveillance [^116hE2QC].

> I should confirm the role of skin self-examination (SSE). Case-control and observational data associate SSE with thinner melanomas and reduced risk of advanced disease, and SSE increases the likelihood of self-detection; however, confounding and recall bias are concerns, and randomized evidence is limited, so SSE is reasonable to recommend, especially in higher-risk patients, while acknowledging uncertainty about mortality impact [^111pPFto] [^111V8vSW]. Let me reconsider whether physician full-body skin examination adds value beyond SSE: some studies show no independent association with thinner tumors, suggesting SSE may be the key driver of earlier presentation in certain contexts, though combined strategies are commonly used in practice [^112Q7SPW].

> Next, I should review overdiagnosis, because it materially affects net benefit. Multiple analyses suggest that increased screening and biopsy intensity can detect indolent in situ or thin invasive melanomas that would not have caused harm, inflating incidence without clear mortality reduction; for example, German ecologic data showed an initial mortality dip that attenuated with longer follow-up, and Australian cohort data found higher melanoma and biopsy rates among screened individuals even after adjustment, consistent with overdiagnosis [^114h6Wpi] [^1175zePt] [^112Sbzwh]. I need to ensure I communicate this carefully: overdiagnosis does not negate the value of detecting truly dangerous melanomas, but it argues against indiscriminate screening and for targeted, risk-based approaches with clear patient counseling on potential harms [^116hE2QC].

> I will now examine risk stratification and emerging tools. Traditional factors such as nevus count, atypical nevi, family history, fair phenotype, and sunburn history inform risk, and several models show fair discrimination. Newer tools incorporate genomic risk via polygenic scores, which can identify high-risk individuals lacking obvious phenotypic markers, though calibration across diverse populations remains a challenge and clinical utility is still being established [^114Drt2T] [^114BDycP] [^116YCq2L]. Wait, let me verify behavioral impacts: randomized trials of genomic risk feedback show modest improvements in sun protection and skin examination behaviors without psychological harm, but effects vary by subgroup and do not consistently change objectively measured UV exposure, so these tools should be framed as adjuncts within broader prevention, not stand-alone solutions [^114EnfJi] [^112NXBbV].

> Let me consider diagnostic technologies that may refine early detection. Dermoscopy improves diagnostic accuracy over naked-eye examination and is standard in specialist settings, while total body photography can reduce the number needed to biopsy by enabling change detection over time; combining TBP with sequential digital dermoscopy further improves specificity, though prospective comparative trials are still needed to define outcomes and cost-effectiveness [^116GhCqA]. I should double-check that these tools are best reserved for higher-risk patients or specialized clinics to minimize harms and resource use, which aligns with current practice patterns and guideline emphasis on risk-adapted strategies [^112UpXmv].

> Now, I should synthesize practical recommendations. For primary prevention, prioritize UV avoidance, protective clothing and shade, and selective sunscreen use alongside behavioral counseling for fair-skinned individuals and families with young children; avoid indoor tanning and support community policies that reduce UV exposure, especially for youth [^111RNnnv] [^1145oyGH] [^113rGYsp]. For secondary prevention, do not implement routine population screening; instead, identify high-risk patients using clinical factors and, where appropriate, risk models, and offer education on SSE and clinician examination with dermoscopy at defined intervals, escalating to total body photography in very high-risk phenotypes, with explicit counseling on potential benefits and harms including overdiagnosis and biopsies [^116cRQFs] [^112UpXmv] [^116GhCqA]. Hold on, I should verify that this risk-adapted approach is consistent with major guidelines: yes, USPSTF's I statement and NCCN's emphasis on education and risk reduction support individualized, risk-based strategies rather than universal screening [^116cRQFs] [^114oGm8d].

> Finally, I need to highlight evidence gaps and future directions. Definitive randomized trials of targeted screening on melanoma mortality are still needed, as are studies in diverse populations to address disparities and calibrate risk tools. Implementation science must address how to sustain prevention counseling and risk-stratified surveillance in primary care, and digital health tools require rigorous evaluation to show they shorten time to care without increasing anxiety or unnecessary procedures [^116hE2QC] [^116hkMTu] [^1121gktC] [^117NGM9H]. I should confirm that guideline bodies explicitly call for better risk stratification and equity-focused research; the USPSTF's research agenda and contemporary reviews emphasize these priorities, reinforcing the need for precision prevention and careful outcome measurement [^116hkMTu] [^116hE2QC].

Melanoma prevention and detection rely on **UV avoidance** and **early detection**. Primary prevention centers on minimizing UV exposure [^116ebFjs] through sun protection, avoiding indoor tanning [^113rGYsp], and public education [^11322rR2], while secondary prevention focuses on early detection via regular skin self-examination and clinician skin exams in high-risk individuals [^111V8vSW]. Early-stage melanoma has a 99% 5-year survival [^113kHSHX], but routine population screening is not recommended due to insufficient evidence of mortality benefit and potential harms from overdiagnosis [^116cRQFs] [^113Nwisw]. Targeted screening of high-risk groups and patient education on skin changes are key strategies [^112UpXmv] [^114oGm8d].

---

## Primary prevention strategies

Primary prevention aims to **reduce UV exposure** and modify behaviors that increase melanoma risk [^116ebFjs].

- **Sun protection**: Use broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF ≥ 30), protective clothing, hats, and sunglasses; seek shade during peak UV hours [^114oGm8d] [^113pVVHV].

- **Avoidance of indoor tanning**: Strongly discourage indoor tanning, especially in youth, due to significant melanoma risk [^113rGYsp].

- **Public education campaigns**: Mass media and school-based programs improve sun protection behaviors and reduce UV exposure [^11322rR2].

---

## Secondary prevention strategies

Secondary prevention focuses on **early detection** through regular skin examinations and patient education [^117Q5e8g].

- **Skin self-examination (SSE)**: Regular SSE increases early detection and is associated with thinner melanomas and better outcomes [^111pPFto] [^111V8vSW].

- **Clinician skin examination**: Routine exams by clinicians improve early detection in high-risk patients, though population-wide screening remains unsupported [^112fBtYb] [^111ugBhT].

- **Risk stratification**: Identify high-risk individuals (fair skin, multiple atypical nevi, family history, prior melanoma) for targeted screening and education [^114Drt2T] [^116YCq2L].

---

## Early detection and diagnosis

Early detection significantly improves survival; **localized melanoma has a 99% 5-year survival**, whereas distant disease has ~32% [^113kHSHX]. Key early features include asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, diameter > 6 mm, and evolution (**ABCDE criteria**) [^notfound]. Dermoscopy improves diagnostic accuracy and reduces unnecessary biopsies [^116GhCqA] [^1121h1D8].

---

## Effectiveness of prevention and detection strategies

- **Sun protection and avoidance of indoor tanning**: Effective in reducing melanoma incidence, especially in high-risk populations [^113pVVHV] [^113rGYsp].

- **Skin self-examination and clinician examination**: Associated with earlier-stage detection and improved survival in high-risk groups [^112fBtYb] [^111pPFto].

- **Public education campaigns**: Effective in changing behaviors and reducing UV exposure, though long-term mortality impact is uncertain [^11322rR2] [^113qiPcj].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Overdiagnosis**: Increased screening may detect indolent lesions, causing overtreatment and psychological harm [^1175zePt] [^113Nwisw].

- **False positives and unnecessary biopsies**: Common in population screening, causing anxiety and costs [^1144Kf8E] [^111u9wGT].

- **Equity and access**: Disparities exist in awareness, access to care, and outcomes, especially in darker skin tones and underserved populations [^117WDK2T] [^1136kXD1].

## Current guidelines and recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| USPSTF | Insufficient evidence for routine population screening; selective screening for high-risk individuals [^116cRQFs] [^111ugBhT] |
| NCCN | Emphasizes patient education, SSE, and sun protection; no routine population screening [^114oGm8d] [^113xC9Ak] |
| AAD | Recommends regular SSE, sun protection, and targeted screening for high-risk patients [^notfound] |

---

## Emerging technologies and future directions

- **Artificial intelligence (AI)**: AI and digital tools may enhance early detection and risk assessment [^116GhCqA].

- **Personalized risk assessment**: Genomic and phenotypic models may enable tailored prevention and screening [^114BDycP] [^116YCq2L].

- **Mobile health applications**: Potential to support SSE and early consultation, though evidence is limited [^117NGM9H].

---

Melanoma prevention and detection require a multifaceted approach combining UV avoidance, public education, and targeted screening of high-risk individuals. Early detection significantly improves survival, but routine population screening is not recommended due to potential harms. Continued research and **equitable access** are essential to optimize outcomes [^116hkMTu] [^11322rR2].

### Advances in prevention and surveillance of cutaneous malignancies [^112fBtYb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Skin cancer affects 1 in 5 Americans, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment costs and rates of skin cancer and melanoma continue to rise, making preventative measures increasingly important. However, there is conflicting evidence about efficacy of primary and secondary prevention strategies in decreasing incidence and improving early diagnosis. The US Preventative Services Task Force 2016 guidelines did not endorse routine skin cancer screening because of "insufficient evidence". Yet, countries like Australia have shown the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of primary sun safety interventions and secondary prevention measures such as routine skin cancer surveillance. Additional emerging evidence shows that regular skin cancer screening in high-risk populations improves early detection and decreases melanoma mortality. New technology may enhance prevention, promote accurate diagnoses, and improve management of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Here, we place rising rates of melanoma within historical context, review costs, efficacy, and evidence for primary and secondary skin cancer prevention and examine the evolving role of novel technologies in the field.

### Population education in preventing skin cancer: from childhood to adulthood [^113qiPcj]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in populations of predominantly Caucasian origins. As the main cause of skin cancer is excessive sun exposure among a sun-sensitive population, most skin cancers are theoretically avoidable, and prevention is an important topic for public health purposes. The development of skin cancer may be limited by effective primary prevention campaigns, causing people to protect themselves from the sun. In order to be effective, the right people need to become aware of the risks and benefits; they also need to be convinced that they can take effective protective measures. Secondary skin cancer prevention aims to avoid skin cancer morbidity and mortality and is, therefore, mainly aimed at early detection of cutaneous melanomas. Around the world, elderly men are the worst off in terms of melanoma mortality statistics and would be an important target group for secondary prevention. Several prevention initiatives have been developed, including awareness campaigns and voluntary skin cancer screening days. So far, few of these initiatives have proven to be successful in changing population behavior and/or skin cancer related mortality. Most of these initiatives appealed more to (young) women rather than the elderly males who would benefit most. In this review, various aspects of primary and secondary skin cancer prevention are discussed, including the results of some of the primary and secondary prevention initiatives.

### Sunscreens as a preventative measure in melanoma: an evidence-based approach or the precautionary principle? [^116AvcFW]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Meta-analyses of observational case-control studies have demonstrated no association between sunscreen use and the development of malignant melanoma.

Objectives

To postulate whether modern sunscreens are likely to be effective as a preventative agent in melanoma and, if so, how many cases might be avoided by their use.

Methods

The potential number of melanomas prevented by encouraging the use of modern, high SPF, broad spectrum sunscreens during recreational summer exposure was estimated by combining the prevalence of their use with the relative risk of melanoma in nonusers compared with those people who regularly use these products.

Results

Notwithstanding the inherent uncertainties and assumptions that this approach involves, it is shown that significant numbers of melanomas might be avoided by regular sunscreen use during recreational summer sun exposure, and with them appreciable financial, social and emotional costs, even for very modest estimates of the benefit of broad-spectrum sunscreens.

Conclusions

Despite the lack of evidence demonstrating the efficacy of modern sunscreens in preventing melanoma, it is argued that it would be irresponsible not to encourage their use, along with other sun protection strategies, as a means of combating the year-on-year rise in melanoma incidence.

### Visual images for patient skin self-examination and melanoma detection: a systematic review of published studies [^1137BNB1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Early detection of skin cancer by patients is an important strategy for reducing morbidity and mortality caused by melanoma. However, the effectiveness of interventions or educational aids that use visual images to promote skin self-examination (SSE) and early melanoma detection has not been systematically investigated.

Objective

We undertook a systematic review of peer-reviewed research on SSE for skin cancer to examine the outcomes of studies that used visual images as part of their methodology. Our objective was to describe the impact of visual images on patient SSE knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and accuracy.

Methods

Seven databases were searched resulting in 5330 citations. A total of 25 studies met the inclusion criteria.

Results

Images positively affected knowledge and self-efficacy related to SSE. Images motivated the performance of SSE and increased the accuracy of SSE and melanoma detection. The types of visual images that were effective are described and the implications are discussed.

Limitations

Articles not uncovered by the search strategy may have been unintentionally excluded. Lack of image description in the studies made specific recommendations challenging.

Conclusion

The use of visual images to promote accurate and frequent SSE is encouraged.

### Screening and prevention measures for melanoma: is there a survival advantage? [^1152KK8R]. Current Oncology Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Controversy has emerged over the past decades regarding the value and impact of melanoma screening to detect early stage disease for improved prognosis. Those questioning the benefits of prevention efforts base their arguments on the absence of prospective, randomized studies demonstrating decreased melanoma mortality to justify the cost associated with screening and educational campaigns. For those in favor of melanoma screening, the lack of proven survival benefit is not a justification to abandon this approach, but rather a reflection of the lack of resources necessary to conduct a long-term trial. In 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)report did not recommend routine primary care screening for the general population given the absence of evidence. However, since the USPSTF report, a series of new studies are available, which support the potential benefit of screening and have the potential to significantly impact current policies regarding skin cancer screening, particularly for melanoma.

### Screening for skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1144Kf8E]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Basal and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common types of cancer in the United States and represent the vast majority of all cases of skin cancer; however, they rarely result in death or substantial morbidity, whereas melanoma skin cancer has notably higher mortality rates. In 2016, an estimated 76,400 US men and women will develop melanoma and 10,100 will die from the disease.

Objective

To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for skin cancer.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of screening for skin cancer with a clinical visual skin examination in reducing skin cancer morbidity and mortality and death from any cause; its potential harms, including any harms resulting from associated diagnostic follow-up; its test characteristics when performed by a primary care clinician vs a dermatologist; and whether its use leads to earlier detection of skin cancer compared with usual care.

Findings

Evidence to assess the net benefit of screening for skin cancer with a clinical visual skin examination is limited. Direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening in reducing melanoma morbidity and mortality is limited to a single fair-quality ecologic study with important methodological limitations. Information on harms is similarly sparse. The potential for harm clearly exists, including a high rate of unnecessary biopsies, possibly resulting in cosmetic or, more rarely, functional adverse effects, and the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer in adults (I statement).

### Total body photography for secondary prevention of melanoma [^116GhCqA]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In theory, total body photography (TBP) improves early recognition of melanoma because it facilitates the detection of small melanomas. In practice, TBP may also have undesirable effects, such as an inflation in the number of surgical procedures for benign lesions. In their excellent systematic review published in this issue of the BJD, Ji‐Xu et al. provide summary estimates of the number needed to biopsy (NNB) of TBP for the diagnosis of melanoma in high‐risk individuals.

They summarized data from 10 studies and calculated that on average 8.6 biopsies were needed to detect one melanoma. To put their results into perspective, they compared their number with the aggregate NNB of 14.8 reported in another meta‐analysis, which mostly included studies that used standard care without TBP. Therefore, it seems that TBP reduces the NNB. Although sensitivity and specificity could not be calculated, the smaller NNB suggests improved specificity in comparison with standard care. The fact that most melanomas detected by TBP were in situ indicates that the improved specificity is not outweighed by a decrease in sensitivity. However, the significance of comparing NNBs across different study settings and populations is limited and the authors correctly concluded that future studies should be prospective and compare TBP with standard care.

Although the NNB of 8.6 seems appropriate by current standards, it is still too high. We can do better! TBP is just one of many noninvasive diagnostic procedures for melanoma detection. Dermatoscopy, for example, is a noninvasive examination technique that improves the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis in comparison with inspection with the unaided eye. Like TBP, sequential digital dermatoscopy detects inconspicuous melanomas by observing changes over time. By combining TBP with digital dermatoscopy, a recently published cohort study achieved an NNB of 6.6 in a high‐risk population. Furthermore, recent advances in diagnostic artificial intelligence indicate that we can improve this number by supporting physicians in detecting outliers in wide‐field images ('ugly duckling sign')or aiding inexperienced readers in the interpretation of dermatoscopy images.

### Screening, early detection, and trends for melanoma: current status (2000–2006) and future directions [^1123Yi6S]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In the past 5 years, there have been notable strides toward the earlier recognition and discovery of melanoma, including new technologies to complement and augment the clinical examination and new insights to help clinicians recognize early melanoma. However, incidence and mortality rates throughout most of the developed world have risen over the past 25 years, while education and screening, potentially the best means for reducing the disease, continue to be severely underutilized. Much progress needs to be made to reach middle-aged and older men and persons of lower socioeconomic status who suffer a disproportionate burden of death from melanoma. Worldwide melanoma control must also be a priority, and comprehensive educational and screening programs should be directed to Northern Ireland and a number of Eastern European nations, whose 5-year survival rates range between 53% and 60%, mirroring those of the United States and Australia more than 40 years ago.

Learning Objective

After completing this learning activity, participants should be aware of the most recent melanoma epidemiologic data, both in the United States and internationally; worldwide early detection and screening programs; clinical strategies to recognize and improve the detection of early melanoma; the latest technologies for early detection of melanoma; and public and professional education programs designed to enhance early detection.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^113QvW7j]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Melanoma: Cutaneous — survival after recurrence and surveillance evidence indicate that while earlier detection is assumed to be beneficial because lower tumor burden and younger age are associated with improved response and survival, this has not been proven; prospective randomized trials are needed to assess whether surveillance improves survival and to determine optimal frequency and duration, and in their absence, patterns and risk factors after recurrence can guide schedule design.

### Behavioral counseling to prevent skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114tS9Kv]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion — burden of disease statistics emphasize the scale of skin cancer. Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer. In 2018, an estimated 91 270 new cases of melanoma are expected, representing 5.2% of all new cancer cases. An estimated 9730 persons will die of the disease, representing 1.6% of all cancer deaths. Although age-adjusted incidence rates increased from 1989 to 2014 (from 13.7 to 25.2 cases per 100 000 persons), death rates remained fairly stable (from 2.7 to 2.6 deaths per 100 000 persons). For nonmelanoma skin cancer, basal cell constitutes about 80% of cases and squamous cell about 20%, with an estimated 2000 deaths each year and an estimated 5.4 million cases diagnosed in 3.3 million persons in 2012.

### Screening for skin cancer in adults: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^112rPuxK]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Skin cancer, primarily melanoma, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.

Objective

To provide an updated systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force regarding clinical skin cancer screening among adults.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for relevant studies published from January 1, 1995, through June 1, 2015, with surveillance through February 16, 2016.

Study Selection

English-language studies conducted in asymptomatic populations 15 years and older at general risk for skin cancer.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Relevant data were abstracted, and study quality was rated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Melanoma incidence and mortality, harms from cancer screening, diagnostic accuracy, and stage distribution.

Results

No randomized clinical trials were identified. There was limited evidence on the association between skin cancer screening and mortality. A German ecologic study (n = 360,288) found a decrease of 0.8 per 100,000 melanoma deaths in a region with population-based skin cancer screening compared with no change or slight increases in comparison regions. The number of excisions needed to detect 1 skin cancer from clinical visual skin examinations varied by age and sex; for example, 22 for women 65 years or older compared with 41 for women aged 20 to 34 years. In 2 studies of performing visual skin examination, sensitivity to detect melanoma was 40.2% and specificity was 86.1% when conducted by primary care physicians (n = 16,383). Sensitivity was 49.0% and specificity was 97.6% when skin examinations were performed by dermatologists (n = 7436). In a case-control study of melanoma (n = 7586), cases diagnosed with thicker lesions (> 0.75 mm) had an odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75–0.98) for receipt of a physician skin examination in the prior 3 years compared with controls. Eight cohort studies (n = 236,485) demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between the degree of disease involvement at diagnosis and melanoma mortality, regardless of the characterization of the stage or lesion thickness. Tumor thickness greater than 4.0 mm was associated with increased melanoma mortality compared with thinner lesions, and late stage at diagnosis was associated with increased all-cause mortality.

Conclusions and Relevance

Only limited evidence was identified for skin cancer screening, particularly regarding potential benefit of skin cancer screening on melanoma mortality. Future research on skin cancer screening should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of targeted screening in those considered to be at higher risk for skin cancer.

### Melanoma is up: are we up to this challenge? [^112e6Q7v]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Linos and colleagues provide important evidence that the increasing incidence of melanoma is not solely from increases in thin melanomas discovered by more intensive screening. This underscores the inadequacy of primary prevention to date, and the importance of early detection for reducing mortality in the near future. The US Preventive Services Task Force finds insufficient evidence to recommend for or against skin self-examination and clinician skin examination. Neither is commonly practiced now, but both are required for effective early detection. Evidence regarding benefits, harms, and costs of melanoma screening will help in securing widespread endorsement of these activities.

### Effect of a skin self-monitoring smartphone application on time to physician consultation among patients with possible melanoma: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^115vm59Y]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

There is growing evidence that time to patient presentation to health care and initial management in primary care are key determinants of patient outcomes for most cancers. Compared with other cancers, melanoma has among the longest delays measured as median time to patient presentation. To understand possible reasons, recent studies have explored symptom appraisal and help-seeking among individuals recently diagnosed with melanoma. Factors contributing to later presentation to health care include having limited awareness of the seriousness of some skin changes, considering changes in skin as part of normal aging, and having concerns about wasting their own and their general practitioners' time.

Mass media campaigns have been the main population approach to reduce sun exposure and improve time to presentation. In Australia, public health campaigns such as Slip-Slap-Slop have been highly effective in primary prevention, and incidence rates for new melanoma are plateauing. Mass media approaches in the United Kingdom, such as SunSmart and the Be Clear on Cancer Skin Cancer campaign, have been less effective in reducing sun exposure or promoting consultations to health care. Initiatives in the United States have focused on educational and clinician-led approaches to minimizing exposure among children and young adults with fair skin types to UV radiation. Routine screening of the general population is not currently recommended internationally, although some countries (eg, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, the Netherlands) recommend regular skin checks and/or self-examination for certain subsets of patients with increased risk of melanoma.

### The effect of screening on melanoma incidence and biopsy rates [^1175zePt]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Cutaneous melanomas are common cancers in white‐skinned populations, and early detection is promoted as a means of reducing morbidity and mortality. There is concern that increased skin screening is leading to overdiagnosis of indolent melanomas with low risk of lethality. The extent of melanoma overdiagnosis associated with screening is unknown.

Objectives

To estimate possible overdiagnosis by comparing subsequent melanoma incidence and biopsy rates among people subjected to skin screening those who were not.

Methods

We recruited 43 762 residents of Queensland, Australia, aged 40–69 years, with no prior history of melanoma, selected at random from a population register in 2010. At baseline, participants completed a comprehensive melanoma risk factor survey and were asked if their skin had been examined by a doctor in the 3 years prior to baseline. We calculated incidence and relative risk of histologically confirmed melanoma (invasive and in situ) in years 2–7 of follow‐up, obtained through linkage to the cancer registry. In secondary analyses, we measured biopsy rates in years 2–6 of follow‐up. We used propensity score analysis to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

In total, 28 155 participants underwent skin screening prior to baseline. We observed 967 first‐incident melanomas (381 invasive) during 197 191 person‐years of follow‐up. Those screened had higher rates of melanoma (aHR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02–1.63) and subsequent skin biopses (aHR 1.85, 95% CI 1.69–2.04) than unscreened participants. The higher risk associated with skin screening was evident for in situ melanoma (aHR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09–1.92) but not invasive melanoma (aHR 1.05, 95% CI 0.72–1.54). In secondary analyses, where screening was defined as having a skin biopsy in the first year after baseline, we observed significantly increased risks of melanoma (aHR 1.53, 95% CI 1.23–1.89) and subsequent biopsies (aHR 2.64, 95% CI 2.46–2.84) relative to those who did not have a biopsy.

Conclusions

People who undergo skin screening subsequently experience higher rates of biopsies and melanoma (especially in situ melanoma), even after adjusting for all known risk factors, consistent with overdiagnosis.

What is already known about this topic?
Cutaneous melanomas are common cancers in white‐skinned populations for which early detection is promoted as a means of reducing morbidity and mortality.
There is concern that increased surveillance is leading to the overdiagnosis of indolent melanomas that are not destined to be lethal.
The extent of melanoma overdiagnosis associated with surveillance is not known.

What does this study add?
People subjected to skin examinations by a doctor or who undergo skin biopsies subsequently have higher numbers of biopsies and higher rates of melanoma than people not subjected to either, even after adjusting for all known risk factors.
These findings suggest that heightened surveillance leads to a proportion of melanomas being diagnosed that otherwise may not have come to clinical attention.

### A risk prediction tool for invasive melanoma [^116YCq2L]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Increasingly, strategies to systematically detect melanomas invoke targeted approaches, whereby those at highest risk are prioritized for skin screening. Many tools exist to predict future melanoma risk, but most have limited accuracy and are potentially biased.

Objectives

To develop an improved melanoma risk prediction tool for invasive melanoma.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based prospective cohort study (the QSkin Study) in Queensland, Australia, involved 10 years of follow-up from the baseline survey in 2011 and included individuals aged between 40 to 69 years who were melanoma-free at baseline and completed a comprehensive risk factor survey at recruitment. The data analysis was conducted from October 2024 to April 2025.

Exposures

Thirty-one candidate variables collected at baseline were identified a priori as potential predictors of future risk of invasive melanoma.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Histologically confirmed invasive melanomas newly diagnosed from baseline through to December 31, 2021, captured by data linkage to the Queensland Cancer Register. Follow-up was censored on diagnosis of melanoma in situ or death. Cox proportional hazards models with forward and backward selection approaches were used to identify the best-fitting model.

Results

Of 41 919 eligible participants, 55% were female, and the mean (SD) age at baseline was 55.4 (8.2) years. A total of 706 new invasive melanomas were identified during 401 356 person-years of follow-up. The best-fitting model retained 14 predictors (age, sex, ancestry, nevus density, freckling density, hair color, tanning ability, adult sunburns, family history, other cancer prior to baseline, previous skin cancer excisions, previous actinic keratoses, smoking status, and height) and 2 statistical terms (age squared, age-by-sex interaction), yielding an apparent discriminatory accuracy of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.73–0.76). The Youden index was optimized at a screening threshold selecting the top 40% of predicted risk, which captured 74% of cases (number needed to screen = 32).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study has identified an improved tool that offers enhanced accuracy for predicting the future risk of invasive melanoma compared with existing tools.

### Screening for reducing morbidity and mortality in malignant melanoma [^113Nwisw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Screening for malignant melanoma has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality from the disease through earlier detection, as prognosis is closely associated with the thickness of the lesion at the time of diagnosis. However, there are also potential harms from screening people without skin lesion concerns, such as overdiagnosis of lesions that would never have caused symptoms if they had remained undetected. Overdiagnosis results in harm through unnecessary treatment and the psychosocial consequences of being labelled with a cancer diagnosis. For any type of screening, the benefits must outweigh the harms. Screening for malignant melanoma is currently practised in many countries, and the incidence of the disease is rising sharply, while mortality remains largely unchanged.

Objectives

To assess the effects on morbidity and mortality of screening for malignant melanoma in the general population.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2018: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registries, checked the reference lists of included and other relevant studies for further references to randomised controlled trials (RCTs), used citation tracking (Web of Science) for key articles, and asked trialists about additional studies and study reports.

Selection Criteria

RCTs, including cluster-randomised trials, of screening for malignant melanoma compared with no screening, regardless of screening modality or setting, in any type of population and in any age group where people were not suspected of having malignant melanoma. We excluded studies in people with a genetic disposition for malignant melanoma (e.g. familial atypical mole and melanoma syndrome) and studies performed exclusively in people with previous melanomas.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes of this review were total mortality, overdiagnosis of malignant melanoma, and quality of life/psychosocial consequences.

Main Results

We included two studies with 64,391 participants. The first study was a randomised trial of an intervention developed to increase the rate of performance of thorough skin self-examination. The intervention group received instructional materials, including cues and aids, a 14-minute instruction video, and a brief counselling session, and at three weeks a brief follow-up telephone call from a health educator, aimed at increasing performance of thorough skin self-examination. The control group received a diet intervention with similar follow-up. The trial included 1356 people, who were recruited from 11 primary care practices in the US between 2000 and 2001. Participant mean age was 53.2 years and 41.7% were men. This study did not report on any of our primary outcomes or the following secondary outcomes: mortality specific to malignant melanoma, false-positive rates (skin biopsies/excisions with benign outcome), or false-negative rates (malignant melanomas diagnosed between screening rounds and up to one year after the last round). All participants were asked to complete follow-up telephone interviews at 2, 6, and 12 months after randomisation. The second study was a pilot study for a cluster-RCT of population-based screening for malignant melanoma in Australia. This pilot trial included 63,035 adults aged over 30 years. The three-year programme involved community education, an education and support component for medical practitioners, and the provision of free skin screening services. The mean age of people attending the skin screening clinics (which were held by primary care physicians in workplaces, community venues, and local hospitals, and included day and evening sessions) was 46.5 years, and 51.5% were men. The study included whole communities, targeting participants over 30 years of age, but information on age and gender of the whole study population was not reported. Study duration was three years (1998 to 2001), and outcomes were measured at the screening clinics during these three years. There was no further follow-up for any outcomes. The control group received no programme. The ensuing, planned cluster randomised trial in 560,000 adults was never carried out due to lack of funding. At the time of this review, there are no published or unpublished data on our prespecified outcomes available, and no results for mortality outcomes from the pilot study are to be expected. The risk of bias in these studies was high for performance bias (blinding study personnel and participants) and high or unclear for detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment). Risk of bias in the other domains was either unclear or low. We were unable to assess the certainty of the evidence for our primary outcomes as planned due to lack of data.

Authors' Conclusions

Adult general population screening for malignant melanoma is not supported or refuted by current evidence from RCTs. It therefore does not fulfil accepted criteria for implementation of population screening programmes. This review did not investigate the effects of screening people with a history of malignant melanoma or in people with a genetic disposition for malignant melanoma (e.g. familial atypical mole and melanoma syndrome). To determine the benefits and harms of screening for malignant melanoma, a rigorously conducted randomised trial is needed, which assesses overall mortality, overdiagnosis, psychosocial consequences, and resource use.

### Progress and prospects on melanoma: the way forward for early detection and reduced mortality [^111pjgnw]. Clinical Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

The public health problem of melanoma is difficult. Recent decades have seen substantial efforts directed at primary prevention, yet the incidence of melanoma continues to increase. Substantial efforts have been devoted to improving treatment, yet melanoma retains a poor prognosis if simple surgical excision is not curative. Early detection has made remarkable progress, however. Five-year relative survival has increased from approximately 80% in 1975 to greater than 90% in 1996. Even so, almost 8,000 Americans are projected to succumb to melanoma in 2005. Because most of these fatal melanomas are visible on the skin surface at a curable phase in their evolution, more can and must be done. To improve the early detection practices of clinicians, we have developed an eight-step Basic Skin Cancer Triage algorithm, which forms the core of a curriculum that we have shown can result in improved skills, attitudes, and practices. We are now in the process of attempting to test a Web-based version of that curriculum in a randomized trial. Skin self-examination also has tremendous potential for contributing to early detection of melanoma. We have tested an intervention to encourage thorough skin self-examination in a randomized trial and found it effective in increasing the performance of this procedure, on increase that is sustained for at least a year, while resulting in only short-term increases in surgical procedures on the skin. Early detection has not yet reached its full potential effect on the public health problem of melanoma and is poised to further reduce melanoma mortality.

### Assessing the incremental contribution of common genomic variants to melanoma risk prediction in two population-based studies [^1145eXHS]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Primary and secondary prevention strategies that reduce sun exposure and encourage increased sun protection and skin examination behaviors are important for reducing melanoma incidence and mortality, particularly for those identified as being at high risk. To date, identifying people at high risk for melanoma has focused on factors such as family history, phenotypic characteristics (fair skin, skin that burns easily, red hair, moles and freckling, solar and artificial UV radiation exposure, and previous keratinocyte skin cancers.

Common genomic variants may help identify people at high risk for melanoma, particularly those who lack these traditional risk factors. It is becoming more feasible to incorporate genomic profiles into risk prediction tools, given increased understanding of genomic risk factors and increased genomic testing in clinical practice. Development and assessment of melanoma risk prediction models that combine traditional and genomic risk factors is warranted to help improve melanoma prevention and population screening. For example, Australian general practice guidelines state that clinical assessment of melanoma risk should take into account multiple risk factors yet highlight the fact that there are no sufficiently well-validated risk models to assess the combined effects of all risk factors. Accurate identification of people at high risk for melanoma will also facilitate research on targeted screening strategies for those at higher risk.

Few studies have examined the contribution of multiple genomic risk factors to risk prediction over and above that of traditional risk factors. Limitations of previous studies have included lack of external validation, small sample size, lack of data on nevus phenotype or family history, and possible confounding by ethnicity.

We aimed to evaluate the incremental contribution of common genomic variants to melanoma risk prediction, including the contribution of variants associated with identified biological pathways, using data from two population-based studies in geographically disparate but genetically similar populations (Australia and the UK). Both studies were developed by the GenoMEL melanoma genetics consortium and used the same measurement protocols, facilitating external validation.

### Independent evaluation of melanoma polygenic risk scores in UK and Australian prospective cohorts [^114BDycP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our work also has multiple strengths. We used data from two large prospective cohorts, ensuring that the evaluations of melanoma PRSs were valid in different settings. Moreover, we calculated absolute risks that include competing mortality risks, which is important to not overestimate melanoma risks for older age groups. The results were reported according to best practice for PRS reporting, and details for the PRS have been deposited in the Polygenic Score Catalogto enable reuse. We also conducted thorough sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of our results.

In conclusion, newer melanoma PRSs derived from a larger meta‐analysis have better risk prediction performance than an earlier PRS, and could be used to tailor melanoma prevention and early detection strategies to different risk levels. Recalibration of 10‐year absolute risks may be necessary when applied to specific populations. Ensuring that risk prediction models are well calibrated and that they can be applied to diverse populations remain key aspects for future research.

### Screening for skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116hkMTu]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Research needs and gaps — studies are needed that provide consistent data showing the effects of screening on morbidity and mortality or early detection of skin cancer, particularly melanoma; clear descriptions of participants' risk factors for all types of skin cancer in study participants; morbidity and mortality outcomes in participants reflective of the US population with a diversity of skin tones; the effectiveness of screening in a range of primary care settings that reflect the variation in access to care in the US; the effectiveness of screening for reducing morbidity and mortality of acral lentiginous melanoma, which was the most frequently diagnosed melanoma in persons with darker skin color; validated risk assessment tools that effectively identify persons at highest risk for skin cancer and who might benefit from screening; and the impact of social determinants of health on skin cancer risk, prevention, screening, and treatment.

### Are we ready? assessing effectiveness and implementation of cancer control strategies in primary care: a comprehensive review of systematic reviews [^1121gktC]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Cancer prevention in primary care represents a dynamic process that integrates traditional modifiable risk factors and cancer control interventions with emerging evidence on new risk factors and potential strategies. Beyond the existing scientific evidence, it is crucial to ascertain which strategies have been adopted, effectively implemented, and sustained over time in primary care settings. The gap between research evidence and effective implementation of practices is a problem widely recognized significantly impedes meaningful progress in cancer control and despite abundant evidence supporting the effectiveness of these strategies in primary care, there remains a surprising scarcity of evidence on how best to implement and sustain them effectively in real-life settings.

This review aimed to summarise recent evidence regarding effective strategies for prevention, screening, and early detection of cancer in primary care, focussing on identifying relevant factors for implementation and recognizing validated factors for the sustainability of these interventions.

### Screening for skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112sSU5A]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Skin cancer screening evidence — nonrandomized studies of earlier detection included 6 nonrandomized observational studies (n = 2 947 595), with results that were either inconsistent or showed no association between routine clinician skin examination and increased detection; studies of stage at diagnosis and mortality included 9 nonrandomized studies (n = 1 326 051) showing a strong, consistent positive association between more advanced stage and increasing melanoma and all-cause mortality risk; in one good-quality US-based study (n = 185 219), compared with in situ disease at detection, adjusted hazard ratios for melanoma mortality were 5.8 (95% CI, 5.3–6.3) for localized, 31.5 (95% CI, 28.9–34.2) for regional, and 169.6 (95% CI, 154.2–186.6) for distant, and adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 1.5 (95% CI, 1.5–1.6), 3.8 (95% CI, 3.8–4.1), and 15.8 (95% CI, 14.9–16.7) for localized, regional, and distant, respectively; US-based studies showed higher melanoma mortality risk at all stages among men compared with women and at stage I among Asian American, Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific Islander adults compared with White adults, and no evidence was available assessing the association between stage at keratinocyte carcinoma detection and skin cancer or all-cause mortality.

### Survival from cutaneous malignant melanoma is improving, but is it because of a trend in decreasing melanoma thickness or the advent of new' revolutionary' therapeutics? [^117HY8hk]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on the findings of Zamagni et al.one might raise the question of whether there is a place for costly melanoma screening programmes in order to find early‐phase thin melanomas and, consequently, to reduce mortality. However, the investigators also report that the decrease in tumour thickness among male patients explains largely the survival improvement in patients diagnosed in 2008–2012 compared with those in 2003–2007, but not with those in 2013–2017. In addition, in the German melanoma screening programme (SCREEN) in Schleswig‐Holstein in 2003–2004, total body examination in 360 288 individuals led to an almost 50% reduction in mortality as reported in 2012. Even though the justification for untargeted population‐wide screening has been questioned, it should be remembered that there can be large variations within and between populations in different geographical regions. Targeted screening of defined risk groups and regular skin self‐examination can still be recommended– together with the use of effective medication in metastatic melanoma.

### State of the science of scale-up of cancer prevention and early detection interventions in low-and middle-income countries: a scoping review [^1154bJim]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Evidence suggests that cancer mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) will nearly double over the next 20 years. By 2040, cancer mortality in LMICs will account for almost 70% of the estimated 16 million global cancer deaths. To curb the growing global burden of cancer that is largely concentrated in LMICs, the WHO has launched several initiatives, including the Global Breast Cancer Initiative, the Global Strategy to Accelerate the Elimination of Cervical Cancer, and the Best Buys report that recommends cost-effective approaches for cancer prevention. Despite the clear evidence for cancer prevention and early detection interventions and the investments made to date, scale-up in LMICs has been slow. To reach at-risk populations and reduce inequities in cancer outcomes between high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs, effective guidance for scaling evidence-based cancer prevention and early detection interventions is urgently needed.

Scaling evidence-based cancer prevention and early detection interventions is challenging for both HICs and LMICs. Although HICs have implemented national and regional initiatives to reduce the cancer burden, disparities in access persist. In LMICs, there are a relatively large number of successful pilot and demonstration projects implementing evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for cancer prevention and early detection, - but many have experienced barriers in scaling these interventions to regional and national levels. Yet, there are examples of successful scale-up programs in LMICs to address other public health priorities although the disease complexity and continuums of care differ. For example, with appropriate funding, resources, and engagement at a national level, LMICs have demonstrated significant capacity to scale health services for HIV, maternal and child health, and malaria.

Currently, there is little guidance for scaling-up cancer prevention and early detection EBIs in resource-constrained environments, including what strategies are most effective and at what level (ie, individual, system). To begin to fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a scoping literature review focusing on LMICs. To select relevant articles, we used two common definitions of scale-up: (1) the WHO definition of deliberate efforts to increase the impact of effective intervention to benefit more people and to foster policy and program development on a lasting basisand (2) a definition by Milat et al, which defines scale-up as interventions shown to be efficacious on a small scale and/or under controlled conditions to be expanded under real-world conditions to reach a greater proportion of eligible population.

### Euromelanoma: a dermatology-led European campaign against nonmelanoma skin cancer and cutaneous melanoma. past, present and future [^115jDUn9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Euromelanoma is a dermatologist-led skin cancer prevention programme conducting an annual screening and public education campaign in over 20 European countries. Within its 10-year history, Euromelanoma has screened over 260,000 individuals across Europe, detecting a significant number of cutaneous melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, identifying high-risk individuals for further surveillance and promoting awareness on the suspicious features of melanoma and the hazardous effects of ultraviolet exposure. In this review article, we summarize the history of the Euromelanoma campaign, present its organizational structure and discuss the results of the campaign in individual countries and on a European scale. Euromelanoma has had a significant impact on melanoma prevention and early diagnosis in participating countries and, despite many challenges, has positively influenced public health attitudes towards regular mole examination and the implementation of preventive measures against skin cancer.

### Screening for skin cancer [^115ZiPrZ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Context

Malignant melanoma is often lethal, and its incidence in the United States has increased rapidly over the past 2 decades. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is seldom lethal, but, if advanced, can cause severe disfigurement and morbidity. Early detection and treatment of melanoma might reduce mortality, while early detection and treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer might prevent major disfigurement and to a lesser extent prevent mortality. Current recommendations from professional societies regarding screening for skin cancer vary.

Objective

To examine published data on the effectiveness of routine screening for skin cancer by a primary care provider, as part of an assessment for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

We searched the MEDLINE database for papers published between 1994 and June 1999, using search terms for screening, physical examination, morbidity, and skin neoplasms. For information on accuracy of screening tests, we used the search terms sensitivity and specificity. We identified the most important studies from before 1994 from the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, second edition, and from high-quality reviews. We used reference lists and expert recommendations to locate additional articles.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently reviewed a subset of 500 abstracts. Once consistency was established, the remainder were reviewed by one reviewer. We included studies if they contained data on yield of screening, screening tests, risk factors, risk assessment, effectiveness of early detection, or cost effectiveness.

Data Extraction

We abstracted the following descriptive information from full-text published studies of screening and recorded it in an electronic database: type of screening study, study design, setting, population, patient recruitment, screening test description, examiner, advertising targeted at high-risk groups or not targeted, reported risk factors of participants, and procedure for referrals. We also abstracted the yield of screening data including probabilities and numbers of referrals, types of suspected skin cancers, biopsies, confirmed skin cancers, and stages and thickness of skin cancers. For studies that reported test performance, we recorded the definition of a suspicious lesion, the "gold-standard" determination of disease, and the number of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative test results. When possible, positive predictive values, likelihood ratios, sensitivity, and specificity were recorded.

Data Synthesis

No randomized or case-control studies have been done that demonstrate that routine screening for melanoma by primary care providers reduces morbidity or mortality. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are very common, but detection and treatment in the absence of formal screening are almost always curative. No controlled studies have shown that formal screening programs will improve this already high cure rate. While the efficacy of screening has not been established, the screening procedures themselves are noninvasive, and the follow-up test, skin biopsy, has low morbidity. Five studies from mass screening programs reported the accuracy of skin examination as a screening test. One of these, a prospective study, tracked patients with negative results to determine the number of patients with false-negative results. In this study, the sensitivity of screening for skin cancer was 94% and specificity was 98%. Several recent case-control studies confirm earlier evidence that risk of melanoma rises with the presence of atypical moles and/or many common moles. One well-done prospective study demonstrated that risk assessment by limited physical exam identified a relatively small (< 10%) group of primary care patients for more thorough evaluation.

Conclusions

The quality of the evidence addressing the accuracy of routine screening by primary care providers for early detection of melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer ranged from poor to fair. We found no studies that assessed the effectiveness of periodic skin examination by a clinician in reducing melanoma mortality. Both self-assessment of risk factors or clinician examination can classify a small proportion of patients as at highest risk for melanoma. Skin cancer screening, perhaps using a risk-assessment technique to identify high-risk patients who are seeing a physician for other reasons, merits additional study as a strategy to address the excess burden of disease in older adults.

### The global burden of melanoma: results from the global burden of disease study 2015 [^113xC9Ak]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Regarding national melanoma treatment guidelines, a review article comparing the U.S. A. Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, found that the Australian Cancer Network (ACN), responsible for guideline generation in Australia and New Zealand, produced the strictest follow‐up recommendations for patients with melanoma of any stage, including the use of ultrasound in surveillance of lymph node recurrence. 30 While the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) does not issue a consensus on routine melanoma screening, the ACN has recommended against population‐based screening. The ACN and NCCN generally share recommendations regarding biopsy and excisions guidelines. 30

The GBD relies on the premise that estimates based on high‐quality analyses and prediction models, while imperfect, are better than no data at all. Estimations for areas lacking cancer data are dependent on covariate selection and regional patterns. This highlights the importance of a global effort to improve vital registration systems and cancer registries. There are a number of limitations to the use of the DALY in regard to melanoma. As mentioned above, because the stage of diagnosis is not incorporated, melanoma DALYs may change with time, as increased early detection leads to a higher proportion of detected melanomas at an early stage. Similarly, with recent progress in advanced melanoma treatment and prognosis, the disability from melanoma is likely to change over time, making temporal DALY comparisons difficult.

A recent report investigated DALYs from melanoma by stage among a large cohort of patients from the Belgian Cancer Registry. 31 Melanoma mortality, expressed as YLLs, was divided among the melanoma stages as follows: 28% stage I, 33% stage II, 26.2% stage III and 13% stage IV. Over half of melanoma morbidity, expressed as YLDs, was attributed to melanomas with node metastases, while 35% was attributed to localized melanomas and 13% to melanoma with distant metastases. For GBD 2015, stage of diagnosis was not incorporated into the GBD disability estimates. Melanoma stage of diagnosis could be included in future GBD 2015 data for high‐income countries. Another area of consideration in future GBD iterations is the particular burden imposed by early detection and preventative activities. Regardless of its shortcomings, the GBD provides high‐quality, comparative estimates of melanoma burden. As GBD results are now produced on an annual basis, the global collaboration continually works to improve existing estimates and incorporate new studies. Epidemiological assessments such as the GBD have the potential to influence research and public policy regarding melanoma pathogenesis, prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

### A systematic review comparing surveillance recommendations for the detection of recurrence following surgery across 16 common cancer types [^11472f8r]. BMJ Oncology (2025). High credibility.

We found several areas in which recommendations are frequently vague and non-specific. Many guidelines (n = 53) recommend indefinite surveillance and others (n = 22) do not mention the expected length of the recommended surveillance; decision-making about ending surveillance is left to individual clinicians. Patients not eligible for further treatment (for example, because they are too frail) are unlikely to see any benefit from continued surveillance for the early detection of recurrence. We also found that many guidelines recommending risk stratification did not clearly define the risk factors they suggest using and others gave only vague details of how surveillance schedules should differ between high and low-risk groups. This allows for variability in their interpretation by clinicians, likely to lead to variation in care. Given the limited evidence for the efficacy of any specific surveillance schedule, the impact of this on patient outcomes is not known. However, a standardised approach to surveillance is desirable, especially as variation in care has been identified as a key concern for patients receiving cancer follow-up care. Lack of clear definitions of risk factors was also seen in a previous review of follow-up guidelines for melanoma.

### Screening for skin cancer: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^112cbzBV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. The majority of skin cancer is nonmelanoma cancer, either basal cell cancer or squamous cell cancer. The incidence of both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer has been increasing over the past 3 decades. In 2001, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for skin cancer by using whole-body skin examination for early detection of skin cancer.

Purpose

To update the evidence of benefits and harms of screening for skin cancer in the general population.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and Cochrane Library searches from 1 June 1999 to 9 August 2005 for English-language articles; recent systematic reviews; reference lists of retrieved articles; and expert suggestions.

Study Selection

English-language studies were selected to answer the following key question: Does screening in asymptomatic persons with whole-body examination by a primary care clinician or by self-examination reduce morbidity and mortality from skin cancer? Randomized, controlled trials and case-control studies of screening for skin cancer were selected. One author selected English-language studies to answer the following contextual questions: Can screening with whole-body examination by primary care clinicians or by self-examination accurately detect skin cancer? Does screening with whole-body examination or by self-examination detect melanomas at an earlier stage (thinner lesions)?

Data Extraction

All studies for the key question were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria.

Data Synthesis

No new evidence from controlled studies was found that addressed the benefit of screening for skin cancer with a whole-body examination by a physician. One article of fair quality, which reanalyzed data from a 1996 study identified for the 2001 report for the USPSTF, provides limited but insufficient evidence on the benefit of skin self-examination in the reduction of morbidity and mortality from melanoma.

Limitations

Direct evidence linking skin cancer screening to improved health outcomes is lacking. Information is limited on the accuracy of screening by physicians or patients using real patients and lesions.

Conclusion

The limited evidence prevents accurate estimation of the benefits of screening for skin cancer in the general primary care population.

### Skin cancer in skin of color [^1136kXD1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Skin cancer is less common in persons with skin of color than in light-skinned Caucasians but is often associated with greater morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is crucial that physicians become familiar with skin cancer in persons of color so as to maximize the likelihood of early detection of these tumors. In dark-skinned ethnic groups, squamous cell carcinoma is most common; squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma usually occur on nonsun-exposed sites; and ultraviolet radiation is not an important etiologic factor for skin cancer with the exception of basal cell carcinoma. Races of intermediate pigmentation, such as Hispanics and Asians, share epidemiologic and clinical features of dark-skinned ethnic groups and Caucasians. Skin cancers pose a significant risk in skin of color and clinicians should focus on preventive measures in these groups such as regular skin exams, self-examination, public education, and screening programs.

Learning Objective

At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the epidemiology and unique clinical features of skin cancer in skin of color and be aware of strategies to prevent skin cancer in skin of color.

### Screening for skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114h6Wpi]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — the USPSTF reviewed 3 nonrandomized studies evaluating 2 skin cancer screening programs in Germany. One fair-quality study (SCREEN; n = 360 288 screened) measured melanoma mortality before and after a population-based screening program and, at the 5-year follow-up, melanoma mortality declined 49% in the screening region compared with surrounding areas without a screening program, but this mortality benefit attenuated at the 10-year follow-up. After nationwide implementation of routine screening that included free total skin examinations every 2 years, a fair-quality study reported that the mean unadjusted melanoma mortality rate per 100 000 population in Germany increased from 2.7 deaths to 3.4 deaths after initiation of the national screening program. Another nonrandomized but good-quality study (n = 1 431 237) found a higher proportion of melanoma deaths in the unscreened group vs the screened group during a 4-year observation period (171 deaths [5.9% of the screened group] vs 154 deaths [22.8% of the unscreened group]; unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.30–0.46]; P < .05), although this difference was attenuated on multivariable analyses and after adjustment for lead time bias. These data suggested that there is no observable melanoma mortality benefit from a national skin cancer screening program.

### Epidemiology, risk factors, prevention, and early detection of melanoma [^117Q5e8g]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence of melanoma has increased over the past several decades. Despite improved case mortality, overall deaths from melanoma have increased because of the large increase in incidence. Although we have a better understanding of the pathogenesis of melanoma and improved early diagnostic capabilities, the burden of disease and societal costs remain high. This article provides an update on the epidemiology of cutaneous melanoma worldwide and the common risk factors including heritable and modifiable risks, emphasizing the importance of education, early detection, and prevention in reducing the disease burden.

### Screening and early detection of skin cancer [^116Z2dRr]. Current Oncology Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States. US incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing faster than any other type of cancer. To minimize increasing morbidity and mortality rates, it is imperative that appropriate screening and early detection of skin cancer become more widespread. All physicians who see patients clinically have the potential for detecting skin cancers. The scope of skin cancer as a health-care problem is discussed. Evidence for the effectiveness and necessity of skin cancer screening and early detection is presented. Costs of screening and detection are discussed in relation to impact on treatment costs and overall costs of skin cancer burden. Current methods and recommendations for skin cancer screening and detection are reviewed, especially with regard to individuals and populations that may require more specialized or intensive screening and follow-up. Newer approaches involving instrument-assisted screening and detection of skin cancer are under intense development, and these exciting emerging technologies are reviewed.

### Interval cancers after skin cancer screening: incidence, tumour characteristics and risk factors for cutaneous melanoma [^113SAssC]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Cutaneous melanoma (CM) causes around 90% of deaths from skin cancer. The incidence has risen steadily worldwide over the last decades. As the tumour stage at diagnosis has a significant impact on the course of the disease, systematic skin cancer-screening programmes aimed at the early detection of melanomas might be a promising way to reduce melanoma mortality. However, conclusive evidence, as randomised controlled trials might provide, is lacking. A trial in Queensland, Australia, in which 9 of 18 communities were randomised to receive a melanoma screening programme, was not completed due to low funding. An updated systematic evidence review from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently found only limited evidence for skin cancer screening, particularly on melanoma mortality. On the basis of the review, the USPSTF does not recommend visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer in asymptomatic adults. In Germany, a nationwide skin cancer early detection programme with whole-body skin examinations was implemented in 2008. The decision was based on the results of a preceding pilot project, which had been conducted in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany (SCREEN project: Skin Cancer Research to provide Evidence for Effectiveness in Northern Germany), between 2003 and 2004. Following this project, a significant decline in melanoma mortality was observed in Schleswig-Holstein, whereas in the adjacent regions mortality rates were stable. Another registry-based study showed that after implementation of the SCREEN project, the regional incidence of advanced melanomas (TNM stages T2, T3 and for women also T4) decreased slightly, whereas thinner lesions (in situ and T1) occurred more frequently. On the other hand, within 5 years after implementation of the aforementioned German nationwide screening programme, no decline in melanoma mortality could be observed. In Schleswig-Holstein, the disease-specific mortality even rose between 2009 and 2013. It is unclear whether these observations data reflect an actual ineffectiveness of the current programme, which differs in some ways from the SCREEN project, or whether they are caused by too brief an observation period.

### Impact of personal genomic risk information on melanoma prevention behaviors and psychological outcomes: a randomized controlled trial [^115G3YUh]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Compared to Australian population data (Australian Bureau of Statistics), participants in our study were more likely to have been born in Australia (78% versus 70%), have higher education levels (45% with a university degree versus 28%), and have higher residence-based socioeconomic indicators (mean socio-economic indexes for areas [SEIFA] score 1,019 for those randomized versus 1,005 for those invited). They were also more likely to have a family history of melanoma (19% versus < 6% in other studies). Our findings are also limited to populations with European ancestry. It is essential that genomic databases include more diverse populations and that any potential benefits of genomics research be applied equitably across different populations subgroups.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that personal melanoma genomic risk information did not influence objectively measured patterns of sun exposure but had beneficial impacts on sun protection, sunburn and skin examinations, which varied by population subgroup, without evidence of psychological harm. These findings will inform a cost-effectiveness analysis, and have policy and clinical relevance regarding the potential use of genomic risk information for precision cancer prevention and early detection strategies at the population level.

### Skin cancer screening behaviours among individuals with a strong family history of malignant melanoma [^111V8vSW]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the clinical management of individuals at high risk of developing melanoma recommend that such persons be educated to recognise and document lesions suggestive of melanoma, perform skin self-examination (SSE) regularly (i.e. monthly) and engage in bi-annual full body skin examination conducted by a clinician and supported by dermoscopy and total body digital photography, as required. While there have been no controlled trials evaluating the impact of clinical skin examination (CSE) on melanoma mortality, prospective studies of high-risk groups have repeatedly demonstrated that the average thickness of melanomas detected is reduced under regular surveillance (e.g.). Therefore, to the extent that the prognosis of primary melanoma is related to its thickness, surveillance may be inferred to benefit such patients. It is also well established that a large proportion of melanoma patients (44–71%) detect their own malignant lesion. Case–control evidence indicates that performance of SSE is associated with a reduced risk of advanced disease, and that heightened skin awareness may increase the chances of survival. Thus, SSE and CSE are critical components of early detection programmes in melanoma.

### The role of sunscreen in protection from melanoma [^113pVVHV]. Dermatologic Clinics (2025). Medium credibility.

Melanoma is one of the leading causes of skin cancer deaths and is driven by ultraviolet (UV) radiation and subsequent DNA damage. Although studies on sunscreen's effectiveness in preventing melanoma are inconsistent and limited, the available high-quality data suggest that sunscreen use can reduce melanoma incidence. Challenges include increased sun exposure with sunscreen use, poor sunscreen application, and limited UVA protection of sunscreens. Current guidelines recommend broad-spectrum sunscreens with sun protection factor greater than 30, regular reapplication, and additional sun-protective measures. Ongoing research is essential to better understand melanoma and refine prevention strategies.

### Malignant melanoma 2003: predisposition, diagnosis, prognosis, and staging [^111VWBXP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

The incidence and mortality of melanoma has seemed to level off for certain groups after a steady increase during the last 50 years. This trend is suspected to be secondary to education efforts aimed at prevention and better detection and removal of thin, biologically benign melanomas. Since no effective systemic therapies exist for metastatic melanoma, early detection and removal of thin melanomas offer the best chance of cure. For thicker melanomas, sentinel lymph node biopsy has improved the accuracy of staging and prognostic evaluation. However, approximately one third of patients diagnosed with metastatic melanomas present without previous regional lymph node metastases. As the genomic understanding of melanoma's pathogenesis grows, new methods likely will be developed to more accurately identify the people at risk for melanoma, those who have high-risk melanomas, and those who have disseminated disease. We review current and potential biomarkers useful for the screening for and prevention, diagnosis, staging, and prognosis of melanoma.

### The effect of screening on melanoma incidence and biopsy rates [^111u9wGT]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous melanoma is a common and typically highly visible cancer, the incidence of which has been rising rapidly in many populations. Melanoma survival is correlated inversely with tumour thickness. Early detection is promoted as a compelling strategy for reducing the burden of melanoma;, however, early‐detection programmes provide benefit only if they reduce morbidity or mortality from this disease. To date, Germany is the only country in which a population‐based programme has been introduced for the early detection of melanoma and other skin cancers, although it remains an open question whether or not the programme has delivered mortality benefits. While there is no systematic programme for the early detection of melanoma in Australia, whole‐body skin examinations are commonly offered by primary care physicians, and there are many medical practitioners whose sole clinical activity is 'skin cancer detection and treatment'. As such, a sizeable proportion of the Australian population undergoes regular screening for melanoma and skin cancer each year.

There is concern that increased diagnostic scrutiny (including frequent skin examinations, more biopsies and shifts in pathological thresholds) is leading to the detection of indolent melanomas that would not otherwise have come to clinical attention during the lifespan of the patient, a phenomenon described as the 'cycle of melanoma overdiagnosis'. Overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment, patient harm and inflated costs. In oncology, the strongest evidence for the existence of overdiagnosis comes from long‐term follow‐up of randomized controlled trials comparing cancer incidence and mortality among participants randomized to screening vs. no screening. Although a pilot trial for melanoma screening has been executed successfully, no large‐scale trials with long‐term mortality follow‐up have yet been conducted, so indirect approaches have been taken to estimate the proportion of melanomas potentially overdiagnosed. For example, descriptive epidemiological analyses using administrative data suggest that up to 50% of melanomas detected may reflect overdiagnosis of otherwise indolent lesions. While informative, investigations based on aggregate rather than individual‐level data can be difficult to interpret because they do not consider a person's inherent risk of melanoma, and they cannot compare melanoma incidence among people exposed to screening or not.

### Impact of personal genomic risk information on melanoma prevention behaviors and psychological outcomes: a randomized controlled trial [^112NXBbV]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Primary and secondary prevention are crucial for skin cancer control. Most melanomas and other skin cancers are caused by ultraviolet radiation (UV) and are largely preventable through sun protection behaviors, and early detection is associated with improved prognosis.

The US Preventive Services Task Force has called for research targeting high-risk groups for skin cancer screening, surveillance, and behavioral counseling. Genomic risk is one approach to stratifying people according to personal risk. Common genomic variants each have small to moderate effect sizes for melanoma risk, and when aggregated in a polygenic risk score they have been shown to be as good as, or better than, other more traditional measures of melanoma risk such as skin type or family history. Genomic risk may also be easier to measure and can identify individuals at high risk despite an absence of traditional, often visible, risk factors.

Providing personal melanoma genomic risk information based on a polygenic risk score might motivate prevention behaviors in the general population, but there is limited evidence to support it. Most studies of genomic risk interventions in healthy participants have focused on smoking cessation, diet, and physical activity behaviors, and have been limited by small sample sizes, a high risk of bias, selected settings, and single or few genomic variants. The Multiplex Initiative included skin cancer as one of eight health conditions for the evaluation of genetic susceptibility testing but did not evaluate skin cancer prevention outcomes. Trials in Florida and New Mexico have assessed feedback of melanoma risk information in primary care settings based on carriage of MC1R genotype alone, although the behavioral outcomes are not yet published. Some studies have focused on providing information on rarer high-risk, single-gene variants to melanoma-prone families and shown increased motivation to improve sun-related behaviors. Providing genetic risk information about melanoma in these specialized contexts may well be expected to provide different outcomes than providing personalized genomic risk information to the general population. Nonetheless, tailored melanoma risk information based on traditional risk factors, not genotype information, targeted at people at moderate or high melanoma risk have also shown improvements in skin cancer-related behaviors.

We conducted the Melanoma Genomics Managing Your Risk Study, a large, population-based randomized controlled trial to evaluate our hypothesis that giving the public information on personal genomic risk of melanoma based on a polygenic risk score would motivate reduced sun exposure, and increased sun protection and early detection behaviors, with no psychological harms. We also hypothesized that the behavioral effect may differ according to the presence of traditional risk factors, such as sun-sensitive phenotype or family history of melanoma, as these factors may influence sun-related preventive behaviors and risk perception.

### Screening for skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^11581gwd]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Skin cancer burden and prevention — US epidemiology: Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the US, while most skin cancers do not cause serious health problems or death, and melanoma constitutes about 1% of skin cancers. An estimated 98,000 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the US in 2023, with 8,000 associated deaths. Preventive behaviors to reduce skin cancer risk include minimizing sun exposure, using sunscreen, and wearing protective clothing, and the USPSTF has a recommendation on behavioral counseling for skin cancer prevention.

### Serial screening for melanoma: measures and strategies that have consistently achieved early detection and cure [^117DmuKc]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of a serial screening program in achieving early detection and preventing death in patients at increased risk for melanoma.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Private dermatology practice.

Patients

The study included all patients at increased risk for melanoma who were screened in the program during the 17-year period, July 1, 1992-June 30, 2009 (= 1108 patients per year).

Main Outcome Measures

Survival and indicators of early detection.

Results

All melanomas that developed in program participants during the 17-year period were detected early and there were no deaths, metastases, recurrences, nor need for sentinel node biopsies. An analysis of melanoma cases seen in five recent years revealed additional evidence of consistent early detection: 80 percent of the lesions were in situ, no lesions were greater than 0.15 mm in Breslow depth, and all lesions were in the radial growth phase, a stage almost always associated with cure. Four measures, often absent in mass screening programs, contributed to very early detection and cure: thorough serial examinations, biopsying suspicious lesions (particularly pigmented lesions that were highly irregular and/or approaching black in color), recalling patients every six months to detect all melanomas in the radial growth phase, and educating patients on the need to return.

Conclusion

An office-based surveillance program that includes serial full skin examinations and ongoing recalls appears capable of detecting melanoma at a very early stage when cures can be realized in almost every case. Therefore, when patients present with recognized risk factors for melanoma, dermatologists should seriously consider recommending and performing such serial screening procedures.

### Clinical practice guidelines for identification, screening and follow-up of individuals at high risk of primary cutaneous melanoma: a systematic review [^112UpXmv]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Understanding how individuals at high-risk of primary cutaneous melanoma are best identified, screened and followed up will help optimize melanoma prevention strategies and clinical management. We conducted a systematic review of international clinical practice guidelines and documented the quality of supporting evidence for recommendations for clinical management of individuals at high risk of melanoma. Guidelines published between January 2000 and July 2014 were identified from a systematic search of Medline, Embase and four guideline databases; 34 guidelines from 20 countries were included. High-risk characteristics that were consistently reported included many melanocytic naevi, dysplastic naevi, family history, large congenital naevi, and Fitzpatrick Type I and II skin types. Most guidelines identify risk factors and recommend that individuals at high risk of cutaneous melanoma be monitored, but only half of the guidelines provide recommendations for screening based on level of risk. There is disagreement in screening and follow-up recommendations for those with an increased risk of future melanoma. High-level evidence supports long-term screening of individuals at high risk and monitoring using dermoscopy. Evidence is low for defining screening intervals and duration of follow-up, and for skin self-examination, although education about skin self-examination is widely encouraged. Clinical practice guidelines would benefit from a dedicated section for identification, screening and follow-up of individuals at high risk of melanoma. Guidelines could be improved with clear definitions of multiple naevi, family history and frequency of follow-up. Research examining the benefits and costs of alternative management strategies for groups at high risk will enhance the quality of recommendations.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^113AxWd5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

American Academy of Dermatology melanoma guideline — scope and exclusions — addresses treatment of pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) clinical stages 0 to IIC primary cutaneous melanoma (CM), including melanomas arising from the nail unit, who may also have histologic evidence of regional nodal disease at presentation via sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), from the perspective of the US dermatologist and other practitioners who treat melanoma. The guideline does not address primary melanoma of the mucous membranes or uveal melanoma, and topics beyond scope include melanoma prevention, screening/early detection, and diagnosis and management of atypical/dysplastic nevi and atypical Spitz tumors. Also beyond scope are management of nodal, in-transit, and distant metastasis, histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis and pathologic reporting of sentinel lymph node (SLN) specimens, and the use of available systemic adjuvant therapies or those being investigated for patients with CM who are at higher risk of metastasis (generally, AJCC stage IIB and IIC). Consultation with a physician or multidisciplinary group with specific expertise in melanoma, such as a medical oncologist, surgical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and/or dermatologist specializing in melanoma, should be considered for patients with high-risk CM.

### Risk factors and individual probabilities of melanoma for whites [^117RY1jF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Incidence and mortality of cutaneous melanoma is rising rapidly in the United States; therefore, identifying risk factors for melanoma and integrating them into a clinical and population risk estimation tool may help guide prevention efforts and identify participants for preventive interventions.

Methods

We examined risk factors for melanoma in three large prospective studies of women and men. We observed 152,949 women and 25,206 men free of cancer at baseline for up to 14 years.

Results

A total of 535 incident cases of invasive melanoma (444 women and 91 men) were included in the analysis. We combined the three studies to examine risk factors and to build a risk model to calculate melanoma risk score. Older age, male sex, family history of melanoma, higher number of nevi, history of severe sunburn, and light hair color were each associated with significantly elevated risk of melanoma and were included in the final risk prediction. Participants at the highest decile of risk had a more than three-fold increase in risk of melanoma compared with those in the lowest decile (observed relative risk, 3.61; expected relative risk, 4.20). The measure of discriminatory accuracy as summarized by an age-and sex-adjusted concordance statistic of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.65) indicated that the model had reasonable ability to differentiate those who will develop melanoma and those who will remain free from the disease.

Conclusion

We identified several risk factors for melanoma and developed statistical models with adequate performance and discriminatory accuracy.

### Strategies for early melanoma detection: approaches to the patient with nevi [^1128uTBh]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Given its propensity to metastasize and the lack of effective therapies for most patients with advanced disease, early detection of melanoma is a clinical imperative. Although there are no noninvasive techniques for the definitive diagnosis of melanoma, and the "gold standard" remains biopsy with histologic examination, a variety of modalities may facilitate early melanoma diagnosis and the detection of new and changing nevi. This article reviews the general clinical principles of early melanoma detection and various modalities that are currently available or on the horizon, providing the clinician with an up to date understanding of management strategies for their patients with numerous or atypical nevi.

Learning Objective

After completing this learning activity, participants should understand the clinical importance of early melanoma detection, appreciate the challenges of early melanoma diagnosis and which patients are at highest risk, know the general principles of early melanoma detection, be familiar with current and emerging modalities that may facilitate early melanoma diagnosis and the detection of new and changing nevi, know the advantages and limitations of each modality, and be able to practice a combined approach to the patient with numerous or clinically atypical nevi.

### Population, clinical, and scientific impact of national cancer institute's national clinical trials network treatment studies [^113XhqJQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study, representing the first time that the cumulative survival benefits of phase III trials across all adult cooperative groups has been examined, demonstrates that NCI-sponsored NCTN research has contributed meaningfully to extending the lives of patients with cancer, at a low cost. The 162 trials we examined contributed to gains of an estimated 14.2 million life-years to patients with cancer in the United States at a federal investment cost of $326 (USD) per life-year gained. The same studies are projected to contribute 24.1 million life-years by 2030. Most of the trials (87.7%) influenced guideline care recommendations, and the trials contributed enormously to the scientific literature, with primary trial reports nearly all published in high-impact journals and cited more than 165,000 times through 2020.

The NCTN groups are a vital component of the scientific infrastructure of the United States. Their genesis — accelerated by the 1973 National Cancer Act — has been a key driver in reducing the mortality rate from cancer. Since 1991, the mortality rate due to cancer in the United States has decreased by 31%. This reduction is partly attributable to improved screening and early detection, improvements in diagnosis, and the development of prevention strategies and interventions, but advances in treatment have also been critical and have been documented in recent assessments. From 2013 through 2017, cancer death rates decreased 1.5% on average, including 2.0% for Black persons. Recent improvements have been particularly apparent for certain diseases such as melanoma and lung cancer. - To contextualize the findings of this study, a gain of 14.2 million life-years through 2020 due to the contributions of NCTN trials has returned 4.2% of the 336.8 million years of life lost due to cancer from 1980 to 2020 in the US population (Data Supplement).

Recognizing early forms of melanoma may have significant impact on decreasing mortality from this malignancy. As a result, multiple efforts have focused on developing new and improving current early detection strategies. These include educating patients about the importance of performing skin self-examination, increasing rates of complete skin examinations by physicians in the context of routine care, initiating mass screening campaigns, creating specialized skin cancer clinics, and developing better diagnostic tools through advances in technology. In this article, the current state of these efforts is reviewed.

### Melanoma overdiagnosis: why it matters and what can be done about it [^112Sbzwh]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological data such as these suggest that routine skin examinations may not be as effective in preventing advanced‐stage melanoma and death as was hoped. Further indirect evidence of this is provided by a recent nationwide analysis of Netherlands Cancer Registry data. Researchers found that delays in screening caused by COVID‐19 may have had limited impact on the tumour characteristics of primary invasive melanomas, at least in the short term. One approach to increase benefits and decrease harms is to target screening to those at higher risk, as suggested by the US Preventative Services Task Force recommendations for research. Given the risk of melanoma overdiagnosis, it may be most helpful to target screening to those at highest risk of developing advanced‐stage melanoma or of dying from melanoma.

Information to develop risk tools that identify such people may be provided by cancer registry data that include all melanomas that progress to stage IV disease, regardless of stage at first diagnosis. In addition, where the initial diagnosis was early stage disease (which later progressed), detailed characterization of how these individuals (e.g. immune system) and their tumours (e.g. molecular and genetic markers) differ from the majority of people diagnosed with melanoma in situ or localized invasive melanoma may help to distinguish high‐risk lesions (where surveillance, investigations and treatment may be intensified) from potentially indolent ones (where de‐intensification may be possible). Until then, melanoma overdiagnosis is largely identifiable only at a population level, and requires population‐level interventions for its prevention. Such efforts are urgently needed to minimize harms from early melanoma detection, and ensure the delivery of sustainable, high‐value healthcare.

### State of the science on prevention and screening to reduce melanoma incidence and mortality: the time is now [^116ebFjs]. CA (2016). Low credibility.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Although overall cancer incidence rates are decreasing, melanoma incidence rates continue to increase about 3% annually. Melanoma is a significant public health problem that exacts a substantial financial burden. Years of potential life lost from melanoma deaths contribute to the social, economic, and human toll of this disease. However, most cases are potentially preventable. Research has clearly established that exposure to ultraviolet radiation increases melanoma risk. Unprecedented antitumor activity and evolving survival benefit from novel targeted therapies and immunotherapies are now available for patients with unresectable and/or metastatic melanoma. Still, prevention (minimizing sun exposure that may result in tanned or sunburned skin and avoiding indoor tanning) and early detection (identifying lesions before they become invasive or at an earlier stage) have significant potential to reduce melanoma incidence and melanoma-associated deaths. This article reviews the state of the science on prevention and early detection of melanoma and current areas of scientific uncertainty and ongoing debate. The US Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer and US Preventive Services Task Force reviews on skin cancer have propelled a national discussion on melanoma prevention and screening that makes this an extraordinary and exciting time for diverse disciplines in multiple sectors-health care, government, education, business, advocacy, and community-to coordinate efforts and leverage existing knowledge to make major strides in reducing the public health burden of melanoma in the United States.

### Risk prediction models for incident primary cutaneous melanoma: a systematic review [^114Drt2T]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Currently, there is no comprehensive assessment of melanoma risk prediction models.

Objective

To systematically review published studies reporting multivariable risk prediction models for incident primary cutaneous melanoma for adults.

Evidence Review

EMBASE, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched to April 30, 2013. Eligible studies were hand searched and citation tracked. Two independent reviewers extracted information.

Findings

Nineteen studies reporting 28 melanoma prediction models were included. The number of predictors in the final models ranged from 2 to 13; the most common were nevi, skin type, freckle density, age, hair color, and sunburn history. There was limited reporting and substantial variation among the studies in model development and performance. Discrimination (the ability of the model to differentiate between patients with and without melanoma) was reported in 9 studies and ranged from fair to very good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.62–0.86). Few studies assessed internal or external validity of the models or their use in clinical and public health practice. Of the published melanoma risk prediction models, the risk prediction tool developed by Fears and colleagues, which was designed for the US population, appears to be the most clinically useful and may also assist in identifying high-risk groups for melanoma prevention strategies.

Conclusions and Relevance

Few melanoma risk prediction models have been comprehensively developed and assessed. More external validation and prospective evaluation will help translate melanoma risk prediction models into useful tools for clinical and public health practice.

### Vital signs: melanoma incidence and mortality trends and projections-United States, 1982–2030 [^114MUzMG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Previous research suggests that melanoma trends reflect increases in cumulative exposure to UV and increases in skin cancer awareness and early detection. Despite increases in melanoma incidence, decreases in melanoma mortality among persons aged < 65 years have been observed, likely reflecting earlier detection and improved treatment. Meanwhile, increasing melanoma mortality rates among persons aged ≥ 65 years and increasing incidence for both thin and thick lesions, along with the substantial contribution of thin lesions at diagnosis to melanoma mortality (about 30%), suggest that cumulative overexposure to UV radiation plays a substantial role.

This report found that among persons aged 15–49 years higher melanoma incidence rates were observed among women, whereas among those aged ≥ 50 years, higher rates were observed among men. Higher rates among young females compared with young males might be attributable, in part, to the widespread use of indoor tanning among females, which is associated with an increased risk for melanoma. Nearly one-third of non-Hispanic white women aged 16–25 years engage in indoor tanning each year. Meanwhile, higher melanoma rates among older non-Hispanic white men may be attributable, in part, to lower rates of sun protection and more time spent outdoors throughout life compared with women. Additionally, men are less likely to use sunscreen compared to women; thus, clothing and wide-brimmed hats might be particularly effective sun protection options for males, as well as increasing the use of sunscreen.

The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, delays in melanoma reporting might result in an underestimate of cases; reporting delays are more common for cancers such as melanoma that are often diagnosed and treated in nonhospital settings such as physicians' offices. Second, incidence projections are based on data that represent approximately 10% of the US population and have a lower percentage of whites. Third, accurate confidence intervals are not available for the incidence and death projections. Fourth, the impact of a skin cancer prevention program is based on the assumption that a reduction in incidence could be achieved in 5 years. Fifth, the impact of a prevention program is extrapolated from a state in Australia to all of the United States, which has a different underlying population and health care system. Finally, cost estimates only include health care costs incurred in the initial year after diagnosis.

Our economic evaluation provides relevant medical and economic insights about the implications associated with delaying melanoma diagnosis due to suspended screening, which the global COVID-19 pandemic gave us the unique opportunity to investigate. Considering the assumptions and limitations of our methods, our estimates are meant to raise awareness about the importance of skin cancer screenings and the multidimensional costs associated with screening suspension. Thus, while we urge decision-makers to consider the implications of delaying screenings in future pandemic plans to optimize public health and limit possibly severe medical and economic sequelae of containment policy, we most importantly encourage policy-makers to further emphasize the role of preventative medicine on both a personal and economic level.

New evidence has accumulated over the past several years that supports improved melanoma outcomes associated with both clinician and patient screening. Population-based and workplace studies conducted in Australia and the Unites States, respectively, have shown decreases in the incidence of thick melanoma and overall melanoma mortality, and a year-long statewide screening program in Germany has shown a nearly 50% reduction in mortality 5 years after the screening ended. Current melanoma screening guidelines in the United States are inconsistent among various organizations, and therefore rates of both physician and patient skin examinations are low. As policymaking organizations update national screening recommendations in the United States, the latest research reviewed in part II of this continuing medical education article should be considered to establish the most effective recommendations. Patient and provider education will be necessary to ensure that appropriate patients receive recommended screening.

### Vital signs: melanoma incidence and mortality trends and projections-United States, 1982–2030 [^11322rR2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions and Comment

The health and economic burden of melanoma is substantial and without additional efforts is projected to increase through 2030. Without new interventions, the annual cost of treating newly diagnosed melanomas is projected to increase threefold from 2011 to 2030. Prevention strategies include reducing UV exposure from sunbathing and indoor tanning, and increasing the use of sun protection. A comprehensive skin cancer prevention program was estimated to avert 230,000 melanoma cases and $2.7 billion in initial year treatment costs from 2020 through 2030.

The estimated impact of a comprehensive skin cancer prevention program on the number of melanoma cases and treatment costs averted was based on findings from SunSmart, an Australian skin cancer prevention program. SunSmart is a multicomponent, community-wide intervention designed to raise awareness, change personal behaviors, and influence institutional policy and practices. SunSmart activities include mass media campaigns; programs with schools, workplaces, and sports programs; health care provider education; resource development and dissemination; and building capacity for skin cancer prevention at the community level. SunSmart was estimated to prevent more than 9,000 melanomas, avert over 1,000 deaths, and save 22,000 life-years in the state of Victoria during 1988–2003. SunSmart has also been shown to save $2.30 for every $1 invested.

The Affordable Care Act is reducing financial barriers to preventive services by requiring many plans to cover clinical preventive services rated A or B by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) without patient cost sharing. Behavioral counseling is now provided with no cost-sharing to counsel individuals aged 10–24 years with fair skin about minimizing their exposure to UV radiation to reduce risk for skin cancer. USPSTF has stated that current evidence is insufficient to recommend skin cancer screening; an updated recommendation is in progress.

Although rates of melanoma are highest among whites, persons who identify as non-white are also at risk for melanoma. Lack of awareness might result in underestimating risk. Blacks are more likely to report experiencing frequent sunburns and less likely to engage in certain protective behaviors, particularly sunscreen use, compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Melanoma survival is poorest among black populations who develop it in non–sun-exposed skin, possibly because of later diagnosis, lower perceived risk among patients and physicians, and a higher proportion of certain types of melanoma with poorer survival.

### Targeted melanoma prevention intervention: a cluster randomized controlled trial [^115cZghN]. Annals of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Targeted interventions to reduce the risk and increase the early detection of melanoma have the potential to save lives. We aimed to assess the effect of such an intervention on patient prevention behavior.

Methods

We conducted a pilot clustered randomized controlled trial, comparing a targeted screening and education intervention with a conventional information-based campaign in 20 private surgeries in western France. In the intervention group, 10 general practitioners identified patients at elevated risk for melanoma with a validated assessment tool, the Self-Assessment Melanoma Risk Score (SAMScore), examined their skin, and counseled them using information leaflets. In the control group, 10 general practitioners displayed a poster and the leaflets in their waiting room and examined patients' skin at their own discretion. The main outcome measures were sunbathing and skin self-examinations among patients at elevated risk, assessed 5 months later with a questionnaire.

Results

Analyses were based on 173 patients. Compared with control patients, intervention patients were more likely to remember the campaign (81.4% vs 50.0%, P = 0.0001) and to correctly identify their elevated risk of melanoma (71.1% vs 42.1%, P = 0.001). Furthermore, intervention patients had higher levels of prevention behaviors: they were less likely to sunbathe in the summer (24.7% vs 40.8%, P = 0.048) and more likely to have performed skin self-examinations in the past year (52.6% vs 36.8%, P = 0.029). The intervention was not associated with any clear adverse effects, although there were trends whereby intervention patients were more likely to worry about melanoma and to consult their general practitioner again about the disease.

Conclusions

The combination of use of the SAMScore and general practitioner examination and counseling during consultations is an efficient way to promote patient behaviors that may reduce melanoma risk. Extending the duration of follow-up and demonstrating an impact on morbidity and mortality remain major issues for further research.

### Impact of personal genomic risk information on melanoma prevention behaviors and psychological outcomes: a randomized controlled trial [^112Eo8ev]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design

The study protocol and statistical analysis plan have been previously published. We provide brief details here, according to CONSORT guidelines. We used a randomized controlled trial design (Fig. 1). The study was conducted in Australia, a country with high ambient UV and the highest melanoma incidence in the world. The theoretical foundation of the study design and measures draws on constructs from protection motivation theory and the health belief model, which help explain how health information may influence protective behaviors; this is described in more detail in the published protocol. Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee at The University of Sydney (2017/163) and all participants gave informed consent.

Fig. 1
CONSORT flow diagram.

*Participants excluded from analysis of primary outcome where they had no ultraviolet (UV) dosimeter data.

Participants

Eligible participants met the following criteria:
Aged 18–69 years at the time of recruitment. This age group was selected to maximize the impact of the intervention, in relation to primary prevention behaviors preventing future melanoma and other skin cancers, and skin checks leading to early detection and better prognosis. Participants ≥ 70 years were not included because there is less capacity to impact future melanoma incidence and they are more likely to have comorbidities that may influence time outdoors.
No personal history of melanoma, since this will alter personal risk estimates and behaviors.
Full or part European ancestry, as genomic risk estimates for melanoma have been derived from populations with European ancestry and so may be less accurate for other ethnicities.

Recruitment took place during the spring/summer seasons between October 2017 and February 2019, with 12-month follow-up also during spring/summer from October 2018 to March 2020. Potential participants aged 18–69 years, sampled to be representative of Australians' State and Territory locations of residence, were sent a study invitation pack via the Australian Government's Department of Human Services' Medicare database (see Supplementary Methods for more recruitment details).

### Impact of personal genomic risk information on melanoma prevention behaviors and psychological outcomes: a randomized controlled trial [^1142jQFQ]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Polygenic scores are increasingly of interest for population risk stratification for cancer screening and prevention, yet few studies have evaluated their real-world clinical utility and public health impact in sufficiently powered clinical trials. This population-based trial evaluated the impact of providing personalized melanoma genomic risk information, based on a polygenic risk score, on sun-related prevention and early detection behaviors. Contrary to the null findings from a previous systematic review on the impact of communicating genetic risks for a range of diseases on risk-reducing health behaviors, our findings highlight potential opportunities for using a polygenic risk score for precision melanoma prevention and early detection in the general population.

The most pronounced behavioral effect of the intervention was on reducing sunburn incidence. Sunburns at any age are a well-established, strong risk factor for melanoma; thus, the reduction in sunburn incidence observed in this study could have considerable impact on reducing melanoma incidence in the population.

A key finding was that the impact of the intervention on behavioral outcomes differed according to population subgroups. The stronger effects of the intervention for people with high traditional melanoma risk is important as the majority of melanomas in the population occur in this subgroup, thus corresponding to where most gains in prevention can be found. We also found that effect modification of the primary outcome by genetic determinism, with a protective effect evident among those perceiving weaker genetic determinism. Thus, addressing pre-existing deterministic views in the provision of personal genomic risk information to the population could facilitate behavior change. This finding may also be relevant for older people who may have fatalistic attitudes toward sun protection behaviors if they believe that "the damage is already done". The stronger intervention effect on sun protection behaviors among participants aged 45–69 years may impact future melanoma incidence for this age group as sun protection measures such as sunscreen use have been shown to be effective in reducing melanoma incidence when used at any age. The importance of skin cancer prevention at all ages was emphasized in our general educational booklet and is important to counter fatalistic attitudes. Stronger effects of the genomic risk intervention among women than men was also observed by Godino et al. for the effect of a type 2 diabetes genetic risk estimate on physical activity. Women may also be more willing than men to engage in preventive strategies.

### The value of screening in melanoma [^112v67jj]. Clinics in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The incidence of cutaneous melanoma has increased substantially in most white populations during the past several decades. Despite improvements in the early recognition of melanoma and the use of novel diagnostic techniques that enhance our diagnostic capabilities, disease-related mortality remains a significant public health issue. In the absence of effective treatment approaches for advanced disease, the best means for reducing deaths by melanoma are screening as well as professional and public education. The role of population-or community-based screening remains controversial, but evidence from self-selected screening campaigns, health care professional surveillance, and specialized pigmented lesions clinics underscores the value of screening and early detection programs, particularly in high-risk groups. Annual screening campaigns coupled with intense media promotion have become commonplace in many countries, and despite their low yield of melanoma detection, the dissemination of educational material and information to the public during these events is important in increasing public awareness. Future directions should include using screening campaigns to target middle-aged and older men and persons of lower socioeconomic status, who suffer most from the burden of the disease and its associated mortality. On a worldwide scale, comprehensive educational and screening campaigns should be implemented or intensified in underserved areas and geographic regions with lower survival rates, such as Eastern European countries. A better understanding of the biology of the disease, already occurring with notable strides, will help us to define better those individuals who will benefit most from screening and early detection efforts. Technologic advances and new diagnostic modalities will afford a more reliable and vigilant surveillance of high-risk individuals, whereas the wide use of the Internet will enhance the distribution of relevant information to the public with the ultimate goal of achieving a better control of melanoma.

### Cutaneous melanoma: public health approach to early detection [^111VWiRS]. Dermatologic Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Melanoma is a major public health problem. There will be a projected 60,000 cases of invasive melanoma diagnosed in 2005, and that number is increasing each year. Fortunately, the prognosis is improving as well, but we still have approximately 8000 deaths per year related to this tumor. To reduce this number of deaths, we need to look at the skin — inspect — and see — recognize potential early melanomas when we look at them. Most of the population does not see a dermatologist regularly, and there are many barriers to general clinicians inspecting the skin, including inadequacy of dermatologic skills. Patients are ultimately responsible for their own skin, but only a small proportion of people actually perform thorough skin self-examination on a recommended monthly basis. There are various tools used by some dermatologists to facilitate early detection, including total body and lesional photography and epiluminescence microscopy (dermoscopy) of lesions. A basic skin cancer triage algorithm has been developed and tested in primary care, with promising results for improving practice. The general population also needs better guidance on early melanoma detection. Hence, instead of relying on the "ABCDs" for a morphologic diagnosis, the message of "a new or changing skin lesion" is being promoted to facilitate early diagnosis of thin, curable tumors. Together, patients and clinicians can improve early detection to reduce melanoma-related mortality.

### Effect of a skin self-monitoring smartphone application on time to physician consultation among patients with possible melanoma: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^117NGM9H]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this phase 2 randomized trial, the use of a SSM smartphone application did not have an effect on the rate at which participants with higher risk of melanoma consulted with family practice physicians regarding skin changes. Therefore, significant uncertainty remains regarding the best strategies to promote early detection of melanoma. For those with moderate risk of melanoma, behavioral approaches, such as using an SSM smartphone application to prompt timely consultation, remain an option, promoted particularly among policy makers, but our trial does not offer even preliminary randomized clinical trial evidence to support this. While such applications have not been shown to have value in diagnosing melanoma, they may have more promise as monitoring tools to identify skin changes. Further evidence on how to ensure people with increased risk of melanoma engage with and use these applications and whether this leads to earlier detection is needed. Until then, the role of smartphone applications as a strategy to detect melanoma earlier remains unclear.

### The melanoma epidemic: res ipsa loquitur [^111miUpR]. The Oncologist (2003). Low credibility.

Many have debated whether or not we are in the midst of a melanoma epidemic. Some facts are clear and helpful to this debate, while others are less clear. The incidence and mortality of melanoma have increased over the last several decades, but the incidence has risen faster than the mortality. The incidence has risen 3%-7% on average over several decades and even more rapidly among Caucasian men and the elderly. In the U.S., the incidence in men is higher than in women after the age of 40, and the difference between men and women increases from age 40 until the end of life. The incidence in the U.S. has risen most rapidly among in situ and localized lesions, but distant and regional disease have increased as well. Among localized disease, in the U.S. from 1988–1997, all stages increased by comparable amounts. This strongly argues against the idea that the increase in incidence of melanoma is only due to early detection of thin lesions or biologically benign lesions, at least during the time period studied. On the other hand, early detection of thin lesions may well account for lower increases in mortality than incidence and improvements in survival. Survival has increased from approximately 60% in the 1960s to 89% in recent years. Improvements in survival appear to be related to earlier diagnosis, rather than an improvement in survival of a given stage. Studies consistently point to a major role for UV light exposure as the most important risk factor for those individuals with a phenotypic susceptibility. Public health efforts aim at primary and secondary prevention strategies. Primary prevention strategies attempt to prevent people from developing melanoma, primarily through avoiding exposure to UV light. There is a particular emphasis on avoidance of UV light exposure in childhood and young adulthood, when it appears the risk is greatest. When strict avoidance cannot be adhered to, sunscreens have been logically recommended. Secondary prevention strategies include screening campaigns and educational campaigns. Many of these strategies appear promising but require further rigorous testing. The melanoma epidemic has arisen for a variety of reasons including: a true increase in melanomas of malignant behavior, a particularly high increase in localized and in situ lesions, and an increase in the number of biopsies performed, which may have resulted in an increased detection of less aggressive lesions. The contribution of possible changes in the diagnostic criteria for melanoma to the increased incidence remains unknown.

### Skin cancer screening: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^116hE2QC]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Skin cancer is the most common cancer type and is a major cause of morbidity.

Objective

To systematically review the benefits and harms of screening for skin cancer to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from June 1, 2015, through January 7, 2022; surveillance through December 16, 2022.

Study Selection

English-language studies conducted in asymptomatic populations 15 years or older.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently appraised the articles and extracted relevant data from fair- or good-quality studies; results were narratively summarized.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Morbidity; mortality; skin cancer stage, precursor lesions, or lesion thickness at detection; harms of screening.

Results

Twenty studies in 29 articles were included (N = 6 053 411). Direct evidence on screening effectiveness was from 3 nonrandomized analyses of 2 population-based skin cancer screening programs in Germany (n = 1 791 615) and suggested no melanoma mortality benefit at the population level over 4 to 10 years' follow-up. Six studies (n = 2 935 513) provided inconsistent evidence on the association between clinician skin examination and lesion thickness or stage at diagnosis. Compared with usual care, routine clinician skin examination was not associated with increased detection of skin cancer or precursor lesions (5 studies) or stage at melanoma detection (3 studies). Evidence on the association between clinician skin examination and lesion thickness at detection was inconsistent (3 studies). Nine studies (n = 1 326 051) found a consistent positive association between more advanced stage at melanoma detection and increasing risk of melanoma-associated and all-cause mortality. Two studies (n = 232) found little to no persistent cosmetic or psychosocial harms associated with screening.

Conclusions and Relevance

A substantial nonrandomized evidence base suggests a clear association between earlier stage at skin cancer detection and decreased mortality risk. However, nonrandomized studies suggest little to no melanoma mortality benefit associated with skin cancer screening with visual skin examination in adolescents or adults and no association between routine clinician skin examination and earlier stage at melanoma detection. Evidence is inconsistent regarding whether clinician skin examination is associated with thinner melanoma lesions at detection.

### Screening, early detection, education, and trends for melanoma: current status (2007–2013) and future directions: part I. epidemiology, high-risk groups, clinical strategies, and diagnostic technology [^1121h1D8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

While most cancers have shown both decreased incidence and mortality over the past several decades, the incidence of melanoma has continued to grow, and mortality has only recently stabilized in the United States and in many other countries. Certain populations, such as men > 60 years of age and lower socioeconomic status groups, face a greater burden from disease. For any given stage and across all ages, men have shown worse melanoma survival than women, and low socioeconomic status groups have increased levels of mortality. Novel risk factors can help identify populations at greatest risk for melanoma and can aid in targeted early detection. Risk assessment tools have been created to identify high-risk patients based on various factors, and these tools can reduce the number of patients needed to screen for melanoma detection. Diagnostic techniques, such as dermatoscopy and total body photography, and new technologies, such as multispectral imaging, may increase the accuracy and reliability of early melanoma detection.

### Reducing mortality in individuals at high risk for advanced melanoma through education and screening [^112p2det]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Incidence and mortality rates of melanoma throughout most of the developed world have increased in the past 25 years. We propose that reduction of deaths from melanoma can be best enhanced by strong collaborations between experts in dermatology, primary care, oncology, cancer education and health systems research, epidemiologists, and behavioral scientists, among others. Public and professional educational campaigns should be guided by an understanding of 3 underlying but overlapping roots: epidemiology and preventable mortality (an understanding of who is most likely to be given the diagnosis of thick or late-stage melanoma), biology (an investigation of tumor types that are relatively common but potentially most lethal), and sociology (an analysis of the changes needed in social structures to improve access to those most in need of early detection programs). We review these major concepts, concentrating on the key risk factors for advanced melanoma.

### A systematic review of interventions to improve adherence to melanoma preventive behaviors for individuals at elevated risk [^117WynMG]. Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for melanoma prevention targeted to individuals at elevated risk due to personal and/or family history.

Methods

Through literature searches in 5 search databases (through July 2014), 20 articles describing 14 unique interventions focused on melanoma prevention among individuals at elevated risk for the disease were identified. Interventions targeting only patients undergoing active treatment for melanoma were excluded.

Results

The average study quality was moderate. The majority of interventions (6 out of 9, 66% of studies) led to improvements in one or more photoprotective behaviors, particularly for improvements in use of protective clothing (3 out of 5, 60% of studies), and frequency and/or thoroughness of skin self-examinations (9 out of 12, 75%). Fewer interventions (5 out of 14, 36%) targeted uptake of total body skin examinations (60% led to improvements). Also, fewer interventions targeted all three preventive behaviors (5 out of 14, 36%).

Conclusions

Findings suggest that future interventions should aim to improve adherence across multiple preventive behaviors, over a longer time period (past 8months post-intervention), and target high-risk children. Studies should include adequate sample sizes to investigate moderators and mediators of intervention effectiveness. Interventions may be strengthened by new techniques, such as incorporating family members (e.g., to improve thoroughness of skin self-examinations) and eHealth technology.

### Five-year outcomes of a melanoma screening initiative in a large health care system… [^112gcNHm]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question Is primary care–based melanoma screening associated with melanoma incidence. Findings In this quality improvement study among 595 799 patients, primary care–based melanoma screening was associated with increased detection of thin melanoma. While decreased incidence of thick melanoma was observed in screened vs unscreened patients, this difference was not statistically significant. Interventions Primary care clinicians were offered training in melanoma identification through skin examination and encouraged to offer annual screening to patients 35 years and older. Main Outcomes and Measures Thickness of melanomas diagnosed in screened and unscreened patients. Results. After adjusting for age, sex, and race, screened patients were more likely than unscreened patients to be diagnosed with in situ or thin invasive melanoma. Conclusions and Relevance In this quality improvement study, primary care–based melanoma screening was associated with increased detection of thin melanoma, raising concern about overdiagnosis. Further studies with longer follow-up are needed to determine the influence of screening on the incidence of thick melanoma and outcomes associated with high costs and poor outcomes, such as metastasis. an increase in melanoma detection, particularly for in situ melanoma, and a decrease in the median thickness of invasive melanoma, but no difference in the incidence of melanoma thicker than 1 mm, in patients who were screened compared with those who were not screened. 4 We now report findings of melanoma incidence and thickness from the first 5 years of the UPMC primary care screening program. We also found that screened patients were more likely than unscreened patients to be diagnosed with interval melanomas that were in situ or thin invasive lesions.

### Disease risk scores for skin cancers [^116j7ks4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Cancer screening and early diagnosis are recognized as key public health strategies for reducing cancer burden. Each year, more than 14 million people worldwide are diagnosed with cancer, and 8.8 million will die from cancer, representing one in six deaths globally. It has been estimated that 50–60% of cancers could be prevented or successfully treated by efficient cancer prevention and early detection programs. Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, and it is also among the more preventable forms of cancer. In the United States, one in five Americans are likely to develop skin cancer during their lifetime. Even melanoma, the more aggressive form among the three main skin cancers, which include basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), has a 5-year survival rate of 98%, if diagnosed at an early stage. Despite being preventable, more than 15,000 Americans die every year from skin cancer.

Public health efforts for prevention have focused on education regarding the danger of sun exposure and increasing adoption of sun-protective habits. For early skin cancer detection, medical organizations have recommended full body skin examination, a quick, inexpensive, and noninvasive method. Unfortunately, there is no convincing evidence that visual skin examination is an effective method to detect skin cancer in the general population. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have identified many additional risk factors, including skin pigmentation, skin susceptibility to sun exposure, family history of skin cancer, and genetics. There is thus a considerable interest in the development of new cost-effective screening programs that integrate all risk factors, environmental and genetics, and accurately identify asymptomatic individuals with high risk of developing skin cancer. The ultimate goals of screening would be to identify individuals at high risk, construct personalized skin cancer monitoring plans for these individuals, detail how early and frequently skin cancer detection programs should be implemented, and to anticipate the type and intensity of potential treatments.

Melanoma continues to be an important public health issue, both inside and outside the United States. As the rates of new melanoma cases has been steadily increasing, it is important to recognize and understand risk factors, both endogenous and exogenous, as early detection of this malignancy can change prognosis. Recognition and improved understanding will allow us to better develop public education programs, increase awareness, change risk behaviors, and subsequently lower incidence and mortality from melanoma in the future.

### Melanoma death prevention: moving away from the sun [^113hJ9s8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

This evidence-backed editorial addresses the limitations of solely primary prevention campaigns and outlines the proven efficacy of early detection/secondary prevention strategies with respect to melanoma. It synthesizes experience from several outreach efforts that have resulted in sustained improvements in knowledge and self-skin examination behaviors. Data demonstrate that educational campaigns emphasizing increased knowledge about melanoma and self-screening practices correlate with thinner tumors. The editorial also confronts the lack of data around skin cancer screening per the US Preventative Services Task Force. It explains how we might address the issue to obtain solid evidence to back a recommendation for screening of high-risk populations in the future. Cost-efficacy of skin cancer screening is also addressed. Lastly, lessons learned from other cancers, particularly breast cancer, with respect to successful educational campaign creation and development of an effective cause marketing campaign for advocacy are discussed. Hypothetical ideas for a screening algorithm and for educational/media campaigns are presented with the hope of triggering thoughtful discussion and forward momentum.

### Role of dermatologists in treating melanoma [^1168FFfT]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2006). Low credibility.

Melanoma is a major focus of dermatology training and practice, with dermatologists playing a central role in managing melanoma through primary prevention, secondary prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of thinner tumors. Dermatologists have led public health efforts to raise melanoma awareness, promulgate the early warning signs of melanoma, and promote melanoma prevention through sun protection. Dermatologists have unique expertise in melanoma risk assessment and the clinical diagnosis of melanoma through visual inspection and the use of diagnostic aids, including dermoscopy and photographically assisted follow-up. Increasing incidence of melanoma, earlier melanoma detection, narrower excision margins, and improved surgical training in dermatology have recently combined to enhance the role of dermatologists in melanoma care. For patients with thin primary melanomas, dermatologists are increasingly assuming complete care, including wide local excision and long-term surveillance for both disease recurrence and detection of new primary melanoma. Conversely, the advent of sentinel lymph node biopsy and adjuvant therapy has made melanoma management more complex and has intensified the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the disease. In this context, dermatologists contribute significantly to the formation, administration, and implementation of multidisciplinary melanoma programs.

Between February and April 2016, in an open randomized controlled trial across four general medical practices in New South Wales, Australia, 272 patients were randomly allocated to receive (i) real-time model-generated personalized melanoma risk assessment and tailored melanoma-prevention advice or (ii) generic melanoma-prevention advice. We measured self-reported melanoma-prevention behaviours at baseline and 6 weeks and the intervention's feasibility and acceptability.

Results

Follow-up questionnaires were completed by 185 patients at 6 weeks: 174 assessed as average risk and 11 as high or very high risk. There were no statistically significant differences between intervention and control patients in sun protection, sun exposure or early diagnosis behaviours. When stratified by melanoma risk, average risk patients in the intervention group appeared to show greater sun protection at 6 weeks (mean difference = 0.23, on a scale of 1–5; 95% confidence interval: 0.01 to 0.45; P = 0.04) than patients in the control group; the P value for interaction between intervention and risk category was 0.10. There was favourable feedback from patients and general practitioners.

Conclusions

Web-based delivery in general practice of real-time, model-generated personalized melanoma risk prediction and tailored melanoma-prevention advice is feasible and acceptable. An apparent increase in sun protection behaviour in average risk patients warrants further evaluation in different risk groups.

### Recent skin self-examination and doctor visits in relation to melanoma risk and tumour depth [^111pPFto]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the potential benefit of skin self-examination for melanoma prevention and early detection.

Objectives

To determine whether skin self-examination is associated with reduced melanoma risk, self-detection of tumours, and reduced risk of deeper melanomas.

Methods

We used data from a population-based case-control study (423 cases, 678 controls) to assess recent skin self-examination in relation to self-detection, melanoma risk and tumour depth (≤ 1 mm; > 1 mm). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of interest.

Results

Skin self-examination conducted 1–11 times during a recent year was associated with a possible decrease in melanoma risk (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.54–1.02). Melanoma risk was decreased for those who conducted skin self-examination and saw a doctor (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.30–0.90). Among cases, those who examined their skin were twice as likely to self-detect the melanoma (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.47–3.38), but self-detection was not associated with shallower tumours. Tumour depth was reduced for those who conducted skin self-examination 1–11 times during a recent year (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.18–0.81), but was not influenced by seeing a doctor, or by conducting skin self-examination and seeing a doctor.

Conclusions

Risk of a deeper tumour and possibly risk of melanoma were reduced by skin self-examination 1–11 times annually. Melanoma risk was markedly reduced by skin self-examination coupled with a doctor visit. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that our findings reflect bias or confounding. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the potential benefits of skin self-examination for melanoma prevention and early detection.

### Melanoma epidemiology and public health [^114jo1np]. Dermatologic Clinics (2009). Low credibility.

This article reviews the research on, and examines the epidemiology and prevention of melanoma. Despite the great quantity of research into environmental and genetic causes, and the ease of diagnosis, incidence and mortality have risen in all developed countries during the last half century. Patient and physician education, and public health programs aimed at prevention, have had varied success. The authors conclude that, until we have better data on how to prevent skin cancer of all types, the best solutions are education of high-risk populations about skin self-evaluation in combination with physician examination to practice; and sun protection.

### Educational and screening campaigns to reduce deaths from melanoma [^115ij77m]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Many deaths of melanoma can be prevented through identification and screening of persons at greatest risk of disease. Herein, we discuss various strategies to reduce avoidable mortality — including targeted screening of persons with changing moles and middle-aged and older men of lower socioeconomic status. We also propose the framework for a randomized screening trial for melanoma.

### Impact of personal genomic risk information on melanoma prevention behaviors and psychological outcomes: a randomized controlled trial [^114EnfJi]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the impact of personal melanoma genomic risk information on sun-related behaviors and psychological outcomes.

Methods

In this parallel group, open, randomized controlled trial, 1,025 Australians of European ancestry without melanoma and aged 18–69 years were recruited via the Medicare database (3% consent). Participants were randomized to the intervention (n = 513; saliva sample for genetic testing, personalized melanoma risk booklet based on a 40-variant polygenic risk score, telephone-based genetic counseling, educational booklet) or control (n = 512; educational booklet). Wrist-worn ultraviolet (UV) radiation dosimeters (10-day wear) and questionnaires were administered at baseline, 1 month postintervention, and 12 months postbaseline.

Results

At 12 months, 948 (92%) participants completed dosimetry and 973 (95%) the questionnaire. For the primary outcome, there was no effect of the genomic risk intervention on objectively measured UV exposure at 12 months, irrespective of traditional risk factors. For secondary outcomes at 12 months, the intervention reduced sunburns (risk ratio: 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.54–0.96), and increased skin examinations among women. Melanoma-related worry was reduced. There was no overall impact on general psychological distress.

Conclusion

Personalized genomic risk information did not influence sun exposure patterns but did improve some skin cancer prevention and early detection behaviors, suggesting it may be useful for precision prevention. There was no evidence of psychological harm.

### Screening for skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113yhk9v]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Accuracy of screening tests and risk assessment — based on foundational evidence, the sensitivity of visual skin examination by a clinician to detect melanoma ranged from 40% to 70% and specificity ranged from 86% to 98%. Evidence evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of visual skin examination to detect keratinocyte carcinoma was limited and inconsistent, and no new studies from the current review reported diagnostic accuracy for an asymptomatic screening population.

NCCN Melanoma: Cutaneous — patient education and risk reduction emphasize providing patient education in regular skin and lymph node self-examination, and clinicians are encouraged to recommend avoidance of behaviors that may increase the risk of future melanomas; this includes patient education in principles of sun safety, including sun avoidance during peak hours, use of sun-protective clothing/hat/eyewear, and regular application of broad-spectrum sunscreen to exposed skin when outdoors, particularly in individuals with sun sensitivity/light complexion. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Demographic, behavioural and physician-related determinants of early melanoma detection in a low-incidence population [^112Q7SPW]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Knowledge of the factors that influence early detection of melanoma is important in developing strategies to reduce associated mortality.

Objectives

To identify sociodemographic, behavioural and medical care-related factors associated with melanoma thickness in a low-incidence population but with a high case fatality.

Patients and Methods

In a multicentre, retrospective, survey-based study of 202 patients with a recent diagnosis of invasive melanoma (< 1 year), we collected data on demographic and behavioural factors, attitudes towards prevention, access to medical care, frequency of skin self-examination (SSE) and physician skin examination (PSE) in relation to melanoma thickness.

Results

Thinner tumours (≤ 1 mm, 80 melanomas) were associated with female sex (P ≤ 0.049), nonnodular (superficial spreading melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma) histological subtypes (P < 0.001), absence of ulceration (P ≤ 0.001), and location other than lower extremity or trunk location (P ≤ 0.004). Patients married at the time of diagnosis or who performed SSE during the year prior to diagnosis were more likely to have thinner tumours than those who did not [odds ratio (OR) 3.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48–8.04 and OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.10–5.34, respectively]. Full-body skin examination by a physician was not significantly associated with thinner melanoma (OR 1.99, 95% CI 0.66–6.07).

Conclusions

SSE was shown to be an important factor in the detection of thin melanoma, in contrast to partial or full-body PSE, which did not show any statistically significant effect on tumour thickness.

### Risk factors for the development of primary cutaneous melanoma [^114QCqEb]. Dermatologic Clinics (2012). Low credibility.

Melanoma is an important public health problem in the United States and worldwide. The incidence of melanoma continues to increase at a high rate and deaths from melanoma are also increasing. The endogenous risk factors that are currently recognized are in many cases surrogates for genetic markers yet to be determined. Exogenous risk factors need to be better defined and understood to help develop better public education programs that can change risk behaviors and subsequently lower future incidence and mortality from melanoma.

### Community skin cancer prevention… [^113rGYsp]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Preventing Melanoma June 2015 9, 000 More than 9, 000 Americans die of melanoma each year. 2x Rate of new cases of melanoma doubled from 1982 to 2011. 21, 000 Using proven community prevention programs could avoid an estimated 21, 000 new melanoma cases each year. Melanoma can be caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet rays from sun or sources such as indoor tanning. Without additional prevention efforts, melanoma will continue to increase in the next 15 years. Communities and policy makers play a major role in these skin cancer prevention efforts. Communities and policymakers can:

- Increase shade at playgrounds, public pools, and other public spaces.
- Promote sun protection in recreation areas, including the use or purchase of hats, sunscreen, and sunglasses.
- Encourage employers, childcare centers, schools, and colleges to educate employees and students about sun safety and skin protection.
- Restrict the availability and use of indoor tanning by minors.
- The annual cost for treating melanoma has grown faster than the annual treatment costs for all cancers combined.
- The annual cost of treating new melanoma patients is projected to triple from 2011 through 2030.
- Using proven community skin cancer prevention programs could prevent an estimated 21, 000 melanomas and save $250 million per year by
2030. UV exposure causes more than 90% of melanomas in the US.
- Tans and sunburns are the body's response to damage from UV exposure. A tan is a sign of damaged skin.
- More than 1 in 3 Americans report getting sunburned every year.
- Indoor tanning exposes people to more intense UV rays than the sun. About 6, 200 melanomas are estimated to be caused each year by indoor tanning.
- Nearly 1 of 3 young non-Hispanic white women ages 16–25 uses indoor tanning each year.
