## Question

what prophylaxis should be given during high dose steroids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what prophylaxis should be given to patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "high-dose" and the thresholds that truly change infection risk and immunologic competence. Then, I should verify the primary infectious target for prophylaxis, which is usually Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and confirm risk factors that escalate concern. Next, I will stratify risk and decide when prophylaxis is indicated, followed by selecting the preferred agent and alternatives if needed. After that, I need to layer in non-infectious prophylaxis domains like bone, GI, glucose, VTE, and latent infections. Finally, I will set monitoring, duration, and discontinuation triggers, and consider special populations such as transplant, oncology, rheumatic diseases, and pediatrics, making sure to check each recommendation against guideline language and strength of evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm what constitutes "high-dose" corticosteroid therapy in a way that meaningfully affects immune risk. Prednisone-equivalent doses at or above 20 mg daily for at least one month are commonly used as a threshold in respiratory and infectious disease literature and are associated with impaired vaccine immunogenicity and increased opportunistic infection risk, though I should note this threshold emerged pragmatically rather than from a single definitive trial [^116QnqEG]. I should also recognize that "supraphysiologic" exposure begins above roughly 4–6 mg prednisone daily for 3–4 weeks, which is the exposure range that starts to threaten adrenal axis function, a distinct but related safety consideration when planning duration and tapering [^1171fF7m]. Wait, I need to check another convention used in critical care: some steroid literature defines "high-dose" hydrocortisone as more than 500 mg per day, but that definition was created for dose-stratified analyses rather than as a clinical risk threshold for infection prophylaxis, so I should not over-apply it to outpatient immune risk decisions [^116MVEoz].

> Next, I will verify the primary infectious risk to target, and here Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia remains the most consequential and preventable opportunistic infection associated with prolonged high-dose steroid exposure, with incidence and mortality rising notably in certain populations and in the presence of concomitant immunosuppression [^117JLkFQ]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal prophylaxis for all steroid users; the 2023 EULAR recommendations emphasize a "consider prophylaxis" approach tailored to underlying disease, dose, duration, and add-on immunosuppressants rather than blanket mandates, which I need to keep front and center while weighing risk-benefit for an individual patient [^115gY1K2].

> I should now stratify risk systematically before I decide to start prophylaxis. High-risk scenarios include autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases commencing high-dose steroids in combination with agents such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or biologics, where EULAR advises considering PJP prophylaxis with explicit attention to the risk-benefit ratio across diseases like sarcoidosis, SLE, dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, Behçet's, adult-onset Still's disease, axial spondyloarthritis, and Sjögren's, as well as other contexts with intensified immunosuppression such as malignancy or transplant recipients [^117JLkFQ] [^112TzyPq] [^117JYdwR] [^113F9ek4] [^116M6FeM] [^1176kzht] [^111SN6p7] [^115mhomP]. But wait, what if the steroid course is short or monotherapy only; in those moderate-risk situations with brief pulse dosing or when risk factors are reversible, it is reasonable to individualize, monitor closely, and defer prophylaxis unless new risks accumulate, staying aligned with the EULAR "consider" framing rather than rigid thresholds [^115gY1K2].

> I will now examine first-line PJP prophylaxis choices. TMP-SMX is the preferred agent because of its superior efficacy and favorable overall tolerability in most patients, with practical regimens including one double-strength tablet daily for highest-risk profiles or three times weekly for many others, recognizing that regimen selection should be individualized by risk, tolerance, and cytopenia profile [^115gY1K2] [^117JLkFQ]. If TMP-SMX is contraindicated due to severe sulfonamide allergy or significant myelosuppression, reasonable alternatives include dapsone with prior G6PD testing, atovaquone, or inhaled pentamidine, but I should confirm that all of these are generally less protective than TMP-SMX and should be reserved for true intolerance scenarios, which is consistent with risk-benefit logic rather than superiority data for alternatives [^115gY1K2].

> Let me consider additional prophylaxis layers commonly needed alongside high-dose steroids, making sure I do not overgeneralize. For glucocorticoid-induced bone loss, early prevention with calcium, vitamin D, and a potent oral bisphosphonate such as alendronate or risedronate is advised in patients at risk of fracture, with thresholds determined by clinical risk and bone density, which has been long-standing practice and remains endorsed in expert reviews on glucocorticoid toxicity mitigation [^114facbA]. For upper GI risk, especially with prior ulcer disease or concurrent NSAIDs, gastroprotection with a proton pump inhibitor is appropriate as part of comprehensive steroid toxicity prevention, recognizing this is targeted rather than universal [^114facbA]. I should confirm venous thromboembolism prophylaxis indications during hospitalization based on the clinical context; for example, patients admitted with acute severe ulcerative colitis on high-dose IV steroids should receive LMWH as standard, which illustrates that VTE prophylaxis is dictated by the medical condition and setting rather than steroids alone [^1131n7k9]. I need to ensure latent infection risk is addressed proactively; the hydrocortisone label reminds me to provide isoniazid chemoprophylaxis in prolonged steroid use for those with latent TB or tuberculin reactivity, and to enact varicella and measles exposure precautions in non-immune patients, steps that often get overlooked in steroid starts but are safety-critical [^1179kqnK]. For ICU patients at high risk for invasive candidiasis, fluconazole prophylaxis is reasonable in settings with high rates of invasive disease, but this is a setting-specific recommendation and not a default for routine ward steroid use, so I should not conflate them [^115WenzM]. Finally, regarding steroid-induced hyperglycemia, insulin remains first-line in the inpatient setting, and adding an SGLT2 inhibitor in appropriate type 2 diabetes patients can mitigate glycemic excursions and reduce insulin requirements, though this should be individualized and monitored for euglycemic ketoacidosis risk in real-world practice [^1131nTJ9].

> Next, I should review monitoring and duration, and I need to be cautious not to imply precision where the evidence is consensus-driven. Before prophylaxis, a baseline complete blood count, renal function, and hepatic panel help anticipate TMP-SMX cytopenia or renal dose adjustments, with periodic monitoring thereafter to detect hematologic toxicity early, which is standard safety practice even if not tied to a single trial [^115gY1K2]. For duration, a pragmatic approach is to continue PJP prophylaxis for as long as the patient remains on high-dose steroids or on combination immunosuppression that maintains elevated risk, then reassess as doses fall and immune competence recovers, which aligns with EULAR's individualized, risk-based stance and with the recognition that steroid-associated infection risk can persist beyond the last dose [^115gY1K2] [^1179kqnK]. Hold on, I should verify my impulse to state a fixed "4–6 weeks after stopping steroids" rule; that interval is commonly used in practice but is not a universally codified standard in these references, so I will frame this as a risk-based extension rather than a mandated window, particularly if lymphopenia or other immunosuppressants persist [^115gY1K2].

> I should double-check how to operationalize discontinuation triggers in a way that is clinically coherent and evidence-aware. Many clinicians step down or stop PJP prophylaxis once prednisone-equivalent dosing falls below immunosuppressive thresholds and remains stable, which for practical purposes often means below about 15–20 mg daily for several weeks, but I need to emphasize this is a pragmatic convention informed by the same 20 mg/day literature used for vaccine immunogenicity and PJP risk, not a prescriptive rule, and should be integrated with the totality of immunosuppression and patient factors such as lymphocyte counts [^116QnqEG] [^117JLkFQ]. Let me also remember that alternate-day therapy can lessen HPA suppression but does not eliminate infectious risk if cumulative immunosuppression is high, so any decision to stop prophylaxis should incorporate disease activity, concurrent agents, and recovery of host defenses, not just the calendar or an alternate-day schedule [^117PuJ1E] [^115gY1K2].

> Now, special populations require a moment of focused verification. In solid organ transplant recipients, PJP prophylaxis with TMP-SMX is standard for months after transplantation and during intensified immunosuppression, and although that practice is transplant-protocol driven rather than steroid-only guidance, it underscores how background immunosuppression determines a very low threshold to maintain prophylaxis during steroid escalations for rejection or flare, which is consistent with comprehensive prevention strategies in immunosuppressed hosts and the immunosuppressive frameworks described for agents like everolimus combined with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids [^114facbA] [^115zjuD9]. In oncology, the threshold to initiate PJP prophylaxis should be lower when prolonged high-dose steroids are used because PJP in solid tumor patients has abrupt presentations and high mortality; even though baseline solid tumor risk is low, prolonged steroids increase incidence to around 1.3 percent in some cohorts, and multiple series link 20 mg prednisone daily for at least a month with substantial risk, so I should not delay prophylaxis in this situation [^117JLkFQ]. For rheumatic diseases, I should reiterate that EULAR's "consider prophylaxis" framing applies across diagnoses and combinations, requiring patient-specific risk-benefit assessments rather than automatic prophylaxis for every steroid start, which keeps me aligned with the guideline's nuance [^115gY1K2]. In pediatrics, I should confirm that "high-dose" thresholds are typically set relative to weight, with many immunization and immunosuppression schemas using greater than 2 mg/kg/day prednisone for at least a month as a meaningful risk threshold, while acknowledging the pediatric evidence base is less consistent and requires individualized judgment and weight-based dosing if prophylaxis is used [^116QnqEG].

> I will now implement the clinical decision pathway in a narrative, and I need to correct an earlier inclination. First, I calculate the prednisone-equivalent dose and anticipated duration, then enumerate concurrent immunosuppressants and patient-specific risks like age, lymphopenia, malnutrition, or malignancy to estimate net state of immunosuppression, after which I decide on PJP prophylaxis with TMP-SMX for high-risk profiles and consider it for intermediate-risk scenarios while documenting the risk-benefit rationale, which matches EULAR's approach to individualized decisions rather than categorical mandates [^115gY1K2]. Wait, I initially thought to label this as a "Grade 1A recommendation per EULAR", but that is not correct here; EULAR uses "consider" language for high-dose steroid contexts with a risk-benefit framing instead of issuing a uniform graded mandate, so I am revising that wording to remain guideline-concordant while still being decisive when risk is high [^115gY1K2]. After infectious prophylaxis is set, I add non-infectious safeguards for bone, GI, glucose, VTE, and latent infections as indicated, I educate the patient about duration and monitoring, and I schedule lab surveillance and follow-up to reassess need as steroid doses taper and immunosuppression changes, maintaining vigilance for adverse drug effects and breakthrough infections during therapy [^114facbA] [^1131n7k9] [^1179kqnK] [^115WenzM] [^1131nTJ9].

> In summary, the highest-yield, preventable infectious risk in prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, for which TMP-SMX prophylaxis should be started in clearly high-risk situations and considered in intermediate-risk cases using a patient-specific risk-benefit assessment, while additional prophylaxis for bone, GI, glucose, thrombosis, and latent infections should be layered per comorbid risk and clinical setting, always aiming for the lowest effective steroid dose for the shortest feasible duration with active monitoring for toxicity and timely de-escalation as immune risk recedes [^115gY1K2] [^117JLkFQ] [^114facbA] [^115WenzM] [^1131nTJ9] [^1179kqnK].

During high-dose steroid therapy, **PJP prophylaxis** is indicated for patients receiving ≥ 20 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for ≥ 4 weeks, especially when combined with other immunosuppressants [^115gY1K2]. TMP-SMX is **first-line** (SS daily or DS three times weekly); use atovaquone, dapsone, or aerosolized pentamidine if intolerant [^116TrH1t]. All patients should receive **calcium 1,000–1,200 mg/day** and **vitamin D 800–1,000 IU/day**; add **bisphosphonates** if high fracture risk or prolonged steroids [^114facbA] [^113bWnw8]. Provide **VZV** and **influenza** vaccination [^116QnqEG], monitor for hyperglycemia [^1131nTJ9], and consider **LMWH** for thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients [^1131n7k9].

## Infectious prophylaxis

### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis

High-dose steroids increase **PJP risk** [^115gY1K2]; prophylaxis is recommended for patients on ≥ 20 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for ≥ 4 weeks [^117JLkFQ], especially with additional immunosuppressants [^112TzyPq]. For PJP, **first-line prophylaxis** is TMP-SMX (SS daily or DS three times weekly); **alternative agents** include atovaquone, dapsone, or aerosolized pentamidine if TMP-SMX is not tolerated or contraindicated [^111SN6p7].

---

### Viral prophylaxis

Administer **varicella-zoster virus (VZV)** vaccination to seronegative patients before starting steroids when feasible, and **influenza** vaccination is recommended annually [^116QnqEG].

---

## Bone health prophylaxis

High-dose steroids cause rapid **bone loss and fracture risk**; provide **calcium 1,000–1,200 mg/day** and **vitamin D 800–1,000 IU/day**, and initiate **bisphosphonates** in high-risk patients or those on prolonged steroids [^114facbA] [^113bWnw8].

---

## Gastrointestinal prophylaxis

Steroids increase **GI ulcer risk**, especially with concomitant NSAIDs; **proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** are indicated for patients with additional GI risk factors (e.g. NSAIDs, prior ulcers) [^114facbA].

---

## Metabolic and cardiovascular prophylaxis

Steroids can cause **hyperglycemia** [^1131nTJ9], hypertension, and dyslipidemia; monitor glucose and initiate insulin or oral agents as needed for **hyperglycemia**, and manage **hypertension and dyslipidemia** per guidelines [^113T9E8i].

---

## Thromboprophylaxis

Steroids increase **thromboembolism risk**; consider **low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)** in high-risk patients (e.g. hospitalized, immobilized, active malignancy) [^1131n7k9].

---

## Summary table of prophylactic measures during high-dose steroid therapy

| **Prophylaxis** | **Indication** | **Recommended agents** |
|-|-|-|
| PJP | ≥ 20 mg/day prednisone ≥ 4 weeks | TMP-SMX; atovaquone; dapsone; pentamidine |
| Bone health | All patients | Calcium; vitamin D; bisphosphonates |
| GI protection | GI risk factors | PPIs |
| Hyperglycemia | All patients | Insulin; oral agents |
| Thromboprophylaxis | High-risk patients | LMWH |
| Vaccination | All patients | VZV; influenza |

### Pneumocystis in metastatic lung cancer, a pragmatic approach in support of prophylaxis [^117JLkFQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In patients with lung cancer, especially those with brain metastasis, corticosteroids are commonly prescribed. Life expectancy in these cases is often limited to a few months or years, leading physicians to generally refrain from prescribing chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis spp. A retrospective study indicated that fewer patients with solid tumors (3.9%) received prophylaxis compared to those with hematological malignancies (63.6%).

Lung cancer, like other solid tumors excluding central nervous system cancer, is generally at low risk for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) with an incidence of less than 25 cases per 100,000 patient-years. However, for patients with solid cancer undergoing corticosteroid treatment, the incidence of PJP rises to 1.3%. PJP is often more abrupt and fulminant in patients with neoplastic disease, with a much higher mortality rate, approaching 50%, and a significant risk factor of mortality with an odds ratio of 2.66. Various studies have shown that 55%–87% of patients with PJP had previously used corticosteroids, and 18%–31% had a solid tumor. The use of steroids, even at low doses (equivalent to ≥ 20 mg/day prednisone for ≥ 1 month), is the most important predisposing factor for developing PJP. ATS guidelines recommend prophylaxis when prednisone doses exceed 20 mg/day for more than 1 month.

Recent guidelines and two general reviews recommend prophylaxis for patients with solid cancer receiving prolonged, high-dose corticosteroid treatment (16–25 mg of prednisolone/day or ≥ 4 mg dexamethasone daily for ≥ 4 weeks) regardless of the cancer stage.

Concerning the toxicity of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP–SMX), 85% of patients do not experience any toxic effects.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^1131n7k9]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid therapy for ASUC: We recommend that patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) should be treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone 60 mg daily or hydrocortisone 100 mg every six hours (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence) and should receive prophylactic low-molecular weight heparin (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Agreement: 97.8%).

Intravenous corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone 100 mg four times daily or methylprednisolone 60 mg every 24 hours are the cornerstone of treatment of ASUC. Methylprednisolone has less mineralocorticoid effect than hydrocortisone at these doses and causes significantly less hypokalemia. There is no real advantage to administering higher doses; a bolus injection is as effective as a continuous infusion. Although a meta-regression analysis failed to show a relationship between dose and colectomy rate above the equivalent of 60 mg methylprednisolone, 400 mg hydrocortisone is equivalent to 80 mg methylprednisolone. In children and adolescents, a dose of 1–1.5 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 60 mg is recommended.

In the landmark study by Truelove and Witts, oral cortisone 100 mg daily was prescribed to 213 patients with acute flares of varying severity. Clinical remission was achieved in 41% of steroid-treated patients versus 16% on placebo. In a subsequent study, 49 patients with severe ulcerative colitis (UC) were treated with intravenous prednisolone 21-phosphate, and a clinical remission rate of 73% was noted five days after treatment. Definitions and terms differed widely in these studies.

### A comparative study between methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone as an initial anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate COVID-19 pneumonia: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^112wePkW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are well-known and readily available anti-inflammatory medications that much evidence has shown to be effective in COVID-19 patients. Based on the RECOVERY trial, a medium-dose regimen (6 mg of DXM once daily) was beneficial only for COVID-19 patients who received respiratory support or had inflammation that required control. Subsequently, several studies reported that a high-dose to pulse regimen was also beneficial in COVID-19 patients with severe and critical illnesses and appeared to improve outcomes more than a medium-dose regimen. Based on the evidence, three main factors should be considered to predict the advantage of systemic corticosteroids: (1) degree of inflammation, (2) dose of corticosteroids, and (3) drug tissue concentration.

COVID-19 patients who manifest severe to critical illness or meet hyperinflammatory response conditions will deteriorate as these conditions indicate that anti-inflammatory treatment is required to mitigate the inflammatory process. This is important not only in the early phase of COVID-19 pneumonia but also ARDS in the terminal phase of infection to lessen inflammation and tissue injury. In the early stage of COVID-19 pneumonia, the timing of administration is determined by the benefit of inflammation control over the risk of prolonged viral shedding, which has to be discussed. Studies by Raef Fadel et al. and Pablo Monedero et al. have shown that early (within 48 h) corticosteroids use in moderate to critically ill patients results in lower mortality, shorter stays in ICU, and decreased organ dysfunction.

### Glucocorticoid dosing and implications for vaccination: Evolution of global definitions [^116QnqEG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Despite widespread adoption of "high-dose" glucocorticoid definitions across international immunization guidelines (e.g. prednisone-equivalent dosing > 20mg/day, or > 2mg/kg/day in children), the rationale remains unclear. Literature searches were performed through academic databases for this narrative review to identify relevant evidence regarding glucocorticoid dosing on vaccine responses and safety. In people receiving prednisone at 20mg/day, antibody titers and seropositivity are reduced, whereas the impact of low- to medium-dose glucocorticoids (7 to 20mg/day) on vaccine efficacy remains inconclusive. Due to inconsistent pediatric dosing regimens, data is insufficient to support a unified "high-dose" glucocorticoid threshold. Non-live vaccines are well tolerated in patients receiving glucocorticoids with rheumatic/inflammatory disorders, but enhanced reactogenicity after live vaccination may occur in those with severe immunodeficiencies. Clinicians should consider individual risk-benefit profiles, rather than following strict dosing thresholds, when curating immunization programs for patients prescribed glucocorticoids.

### Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis: Systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^116MVEoz]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The systematic review was conducted following the recommendations of The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the PRISMA statement. The protocol was published on PROSPERO, ID: CRD42013005617.

In addition to an overall analysis including all doses, two separate analyses were conducted for high and low-dose steroids. The cut-off value for high and low-dose steroids was chosen arbitrarily. High doses were defined as daily doses of more than 500 mg hydrocortisone, while low doses were defined as a daily intake of 500 mg or less. Other steroids were recalculated into the equivalent hydrocortisone dose. When doses were expressed in milligrams per kilogram body weight, doses were calculated assuming a body weight of 75 kg.

Eligibility criteria included randomized clinical trials that involved adult patients (age > 18 years) with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, or any combinations thereof. Trials with patients with SIRS were excluded when SIRS criteria were not explicitly described in their methods section. Trials were also excluded when evaluating steroids for the prevention of the occurrence of SIRS. No limitations were made regarding the underlying cause of illness. There were no restrictions on the duration of treatment (days) or whether administration occurred continuously or intermittently. All types of steroids were included.

Trials were included independently of the type of control intervention: placebo, no intervention, or any other control intervention. Co-interventions were allowed provided that they were similar across the intervention and control groups.

### Controversies in rheumatology: Maintenance therapy with low-dose glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis [^117DbN1m]. Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of the use of glucocorticoids in clinical medicine, the risk-benefit ratio of these still very important drugs has been debated. There is no doubt that they produce many desirable therapeutic effects quickly and reliably. However, their potential to cause adverse effects, especially with prolonged use in high doses, limits their applicability.

We discuss the arguments against and in favor of maintenance therapy with low-dose glucocorticoids in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and present recent studies, assessments, and conclusions on this question.

### Benefits and risks of low-dose glucocorticoid treatment in the patient with rheumatoid arthritis [^1148NWYB]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

With increases in the number and mechanisms of action of potent traditional and biologic DMARDs available for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the goals of treatment have been elevated. There is still an unmet need to allow more patients to achieve the highest levels of disease control. Substantial evidence indicates that low-dose glucocorticoid (GC) treatment, when combined with conventional DMARDs, can significantly slow disease progression and increase the number of patients who achieve disease remission. Therefore, GCs remain a useful adjunctive treatment for RA and other systemic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Physicians and health care providers have had concerns about long-term GC treatment due to the well-known adverse events associated with high doses of these drugs. However, adverse events with GCs are dose-related, and longer-term use of low-dose GCs may still be a viable therapeutic option for some patients.

Multiple approaches have been undertaken to improve the benefit–risk profile for GC treatment in patients with RA, including the development of a delayed-release low-dose prednisone formulation that has shown some clinical benefit. Additional approaches are in earlier stages of development. Optimal use of low-dose GCs has the potential to improve long-term outcomes for patients with RA.

- **Rheumatology key messages**: Addition of low-dose glucocorticosteroids to synthetic DMARDs improves structural outcomes, decreases inflammatory markers, and reduces symptom severity in RA patients. New approaches to glucocorticoid delivery may further improve RA outcomes.

### Otrexup [^111oYnSX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroids**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should not be administered prior to or concomitantly with the high doses of methotrexate, such as those used in the treatment of osteosarcoma. Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs with high-dose methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

	- Caution should be used when NSAIDs and salicylates are administered concomitantly with lower doses of methotrexate, including Otrexup. These drugs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model and may enhance its toxicity.

	- Despite the potential interactions, studies of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have usually included the use of constant dosage regimens of NSAIDs without apparent problems. It should be appreciated, however, that the doses used in rheumatoid arthritis (7.5 to 15 mg/week) are somewhat lower than those used in psoriasis, and larger doses could lead to unexpected toxicity. Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low-dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs, including salicylates, has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate.

- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: Use caution if high-dose methotrexate is administered to patients receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Case report

### Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis: Systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1114vmtD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In the intensive care unit (ICU), up to 25% of admissions are related to sepsis, and an additional 12% of patients develop sepsis during their stay. Sepsis, and if deteriorating, septic shock, have high morbidity and mortality rates. Depending on the definition of sepsis, mortality varies from 27% to 54%. To decrease this high rate of morbidity and mortality, several interventions have been suggested. Bundled interventions, like those of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, aim to improve outcomes for patients by including measures such as early antibiotics, glucocorticosteroids (steroids), and supportive care.

Based on supposed pathophysiological mechanisms, two rationales for steroids in sepsis have been put forward. The first rationale is that high-dose steroids may suppress the excess inflammatory response in sepsis. In the 1970s and early 1980s, high-dose steroids (30 mg/kg methylprednisolone or equivalent dose) were used in sepsis. However, in the late 1980s, the use declined based on negative results of randomized clinical trials; nonetheless, in some centers, high-dose steroids are still used in clinical practice today. The second rationale, introduced in the 1990s, is that low-dose steroids may address a relative adrenal insufficiency. Many trials have been conducted, but the pathophysiological basis of the second rationale is still questioned. Possibly, both high and low-dose steroids can have beneficial or harmful effects in sepsis.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^111Vkt1Y]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, there is no established dosage or duration of oral corticosteroids (OCS) that is determined to control asthma symptoms without causing adverse effects (AEs). Experts are calling for "OCS stewardship" to reduce the risks, including adrenal insufficiency (AI), related to OCS use. To mitigate the potential for AEs, OCS use should be minimized by optimizing inhaled and biologic therapies for asthma. The availability of newer biologics has allowed for the advent of OCS‐sparing therapies in asthma, although the process by which long‐term corticosteroids should be tapered and/or discontinued has not been established. Consideration should be given to the risk of symptom recurrence and withdrawal‐induced AI.

In 2020, a consensus statement on the use of OCS was issued by 131 practitioners of specialties who frequently use OCS, mostly pulmonologists, respiratory disease specialists, and allergists. Of the participating experts, more than 95% concurred that, ultimately, the goal in asthma should be to avoid the use of OCS. When OCS are required, the dosage and duration should be minimized as much as possible. Experts also agreed that individualized tapering to a minimally effective dosage, or complete discontinuation, should be attempted in all patients receiving OCS for maintenance therapy regardless of comorbid conditions. For AI risk, the experts agreed that AI is insufficiently assessed and that patients on long‐term OCS therapy should be assessed for the risk and presence of AI, including patients receiving OCS dosages in excess of 2.0 g per year or more than four repeat courses of short‐term OCS in one year.

### Corticosteroids for treating sepsis [^113tKS4r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Sepsis occurs when an infection is complicated by organ failures, as defined by a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of two or higher. Sepsis may be complicated by impaired corticosteroid metabolism. Administering corticosteroids may benefit patients. The original review was published in 2004 and was updated in 2010 and again in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effects of corticosteroids on death at one month in patients with sepsis, and to determine whether the dose and duration of corticosteroids influence patient response to this treatment.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (October 2014), EMBASE (October 2014), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS; October 2014), and reference lists of articles. We also contacted trial authors. The original searches were performed in August 2003 and in October 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of corticosteroids versus placebo or supportive treatment in patients with sepsis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All review authors agreed on the eligibility of trials. One review author extracted data, which were checked by the other review authors and by the primary author of the paper when possible. We obtained some missing data from trial authors and assessed the methodological quality of trials.

- **Main results**: We identified nine additional studies since the last update, for a total of 33 eligible trials (n = 4268 participants). Twenty-three of these 33 trials were at low risk of selection bias.

### Prednisone [^117PuJ1E]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Certain corticosteroids, due to their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g. dexamethasone and betamethasone).

The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex occurs between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m., and it is minimal between 4 p.m. and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least when administered during the period of maximal activity (a.m.).

- **Individualized therapy**: In using alternate day therapy (ADT), it is important to individualize and tailor therapy for each patient. Complete control of symptoms may not be possible for all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help patients understand and tolerate possible symptom flare-ups that may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy can be added or increased at this time if needed.

- **Acute flare-up management**: In the event of an acute flare-up, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is established, alternate day therapy may be re-instituted.

Although many undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, physicians must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient being considered for corticoid therapy.

### Concurrent SGLT2 inhibitor use in patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalised for high-dose corticosteroid therapy: Mitigated iatrogenic hyperglycaemia [^1131nTJ9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

High-dose corticosteroid therapy is vital for anti-inflammation or immunosuppression in certain diseases, but it often causes hyperglycaemia, which is treated with insulin injections. Steroid-induced hyperglycaemia can result from both high-dose and consistent low- to intermediate-dose corticosteroids. Approximately 10%–15% of hospitalised patients consistently use corticosteroids, leading to hyperglycaemia in 56%–86% of individuals, regardless of preexisting diabetes. Insulin is the recommended treatment for this hyperglycaemia.

Given that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) added to insulin therapy typically lower glycaemia and reduce insulin requirements in patients with diabetes, we hypothesised that SGLT2i could mitigate hyperglycaemia induced by high-dose corticosteroid therapy in individuals with diabetes. Consequently, we investigated the effects of SGLT2i on hyperglycaemia caused by high-dose intravenous corticosteroid pulse treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Prolonged perioperative antibiotics: A hidden problem [^115LF2dB]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

National guidelines generally recommend 24 hours or less of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. In a freestanding, regional children's hospital, the duration of antibiotic surgical prophylaxis was evaluated to identify targets for standardization of practice.

All procedures performed in 2017 were extracted from the local data warehouse; those involving an incision were considered surgical procedures and correlated to antibiotic data. Antibiotic courses were reviewed if administered for more than 24 hours, or if the duration or indication for prophylaxis was uncertain. The total duration of prophylaxis, including discharge prescriptions, was calculated in hours for all procedures and categorized by department and by the quantity of prophylaxis received: none, a single dose, multiple doses within 24 hours, and more than 24 hours. The percentage of procedures and total days of potential excess were calculated.

A total of 15,651 procedures were included; 5,009 met criteria for chart review, and after further exclusions, 12,895 procedures were included in the analysis. In total, 55% of all 12,895 procedures received prophylaxis. A single dose was given in 30%. Over 24 hours was administered in 11%, and 14% received multiple doses in less than 24 hours (both potential excess). Results were evaluated by surgical subspecialty and procedure type. There were 5,733 cumulative days of surgical prophylaxis administered after 24 hours (potential excess).

In 2017, up to 25% of procedures received potentially unnecessary perioperative prophylaxis, indicating that national guidance specific to this issue is needed.

### Darzalex Faspro [^112jwrh4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Administer the following pre-medications 1–3 hours before each dose of Darzalex Faspro:

- **Pre-medication**: Acetaminophen 650 mg to 1,000 mg orally; Diphenhydramine 25 mg to 50 mg (or equivalent) orally or intravenously; and Corticosteroid (long- or intermediate-acting).

- **Monotherapy**: Administer methylprednisolone 100 mg (or equivalent) orally or intravenously. Consider reducing the dose of methylprednisolone to 60 mg (or equivalent) following the second dose of Darzalex Faspro.

- **In combination**: Administer dexamethasone 20 mg (or equivalent) orally or intravenously prior to every Darzalex Faspro administration. When dexamethasone is the background regimen-specific corticosteroid, the dexamethasone dose that is part of the background regimen will serve as pre-medication on Darzalex Faspro administration days. Do not administer background regimen-specific corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) on Darzalex Faspro administration days when patients have received dexamethasone (or equivalent) as a pre-medication.

Administer the following post-medications:

- **Monotherapy**: Administer methylprednisolone 20 mg (or an equivalent dose of an intermediate- or long-acting corticosteroid) orally for 2 days starting the day after the administration of Darzalex Faspro.

- **In combination**: Consider administering oral methylprednisolone at a dose of less than or equal to 20 mg (or an equivalent dose of an intermediate- or long-acting corticosteroid) on the day after administration of Darzalex Faspro.

### Advancing diagnostics and therapy to reach universal cure in childhood ALL [^115JBxnb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Treatment of childhood ALL involves multiagent chemotherapy, administered in rotating combinations combined with CNS prophylaxis, over approximately 2–2.5 years. Regimens typically include induction, followed by one or two consolidation courses, (delayed) intensification, and maintenance. Five drugs form the backbone: glucocorticoids (prednisone and dexamethasone), vincristine, asparaginase, methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine. Additional drugs include anthracyclines (daunorubicin and doxorubicin), cytosine arabinoside (araC), and cyclophosphamide.

Dexamethasone has greater antileukemic efficacy but more side effects than prednisone. Regular 5- to 7-day pulses of corticosteroids and vincristine are widely used during maintenance, but their value is debatable and likely depends on the other components of therapy and the patient subset. The benefit of high-dose versus intermediate-dose methotrexate also depends on the type of ALL. Truncation of the asparaginase schedule because of intolerance or silent inactivation of the drug increases the relapse risk.

Therapeutic drug monitoring is used to detect silent inactivation of asparaginase and facilitates the timely switch to alternative asparaginases. How much asparaginase is needed for each subtype defined by MRD or genetics remains to be elucidated.

### Low-dose methylprednisolone treatment in critically ill patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia [^112JDFqr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring intensive care unit admission is associated with significant acute and long-term morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that the downregulation of systemic and pulmonary inflammation with prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone treatment would accelerate pneumonia resolution and improve clinical outcomes.

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial recruited adult patients within 72–96 hours of hospital presentation. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio; an intravenous 40 mg loading bolus was followed by 40 mg/day through day 7, with progressive tapering during the 20-day treatment course. Randomization was stratified by site and the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) at the time of randomization. Outcomes included a primary endpoint of 60-day all-cause mortality and secondary endpoints of morbidity and mortality up to 1 year of follow-up.

Between January 2012 and April 2016, 586 patients from 42 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers were randomized, falling short of the 1420 target sample size due to low recruitment. A total of 584 patients were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference in 60-day mortality between the methylprednisolone and placebo arms (16% vs. 18%; adjusted odds ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.57–1.40). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes or complications.

In conclusion, in patients with severe CAP, prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone treatment did not significantly reduce 60-day mortality. The treatment was not associated with increased complications.

### High-dose versus low-dose corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113bDVNR]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical efficacy of corticosteroids remains unclear. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the use of high-dose versus low-dose corticosteroids on the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Setting**: Electronic search for randomized controlled trials and observational studies (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL).

- **Participants**: Hospitalized adults aged ≥ 18 years who were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive.

- **Interventions**: High-dose and low-dose corticosteroids.

- **Measurements and main results**: A total of twelve studies (n = 2759 patients) were included in this review. The pooled analysis demonstrated no significant difference in mortality rate between the high-dose and low-dose corticosteroids groups (n = 2632; OR: 1.07 [95% CI: 0.67, 1.72], p = 0.77, I² = 76%, trial sequential analysis = inconclusive). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate (n = 1544; OR: 0.77 [95% CI: 0.43, 1.37], p = 0.37, I² = 72%), duration of hospital stay (n = 1615; MD: 0.53 [95% CI: -1.36, 2.41], p = 0.58, I² = 87%), respiratory support (n = 1694; OR: 1.51 [95% CI: 0.77, 2.96], p = 0.23, I² = 84%), duration of mechanical ventilation (n = 419; MD: -1.44 [95% CI: -4.27, 1.40], p = 0.32, I² = 93%), incidence of hyperglycemia (n = 516; OR: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.58, 1.43], p = 0.68, I² = 0%) and infection rate (n = 1485; OR: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.64, 1.16], p = 0.33, I² = 29%).

The meta-analysis demonstrated that high-dose corticosteroids did not reduce mortality rate. However, high-dose corticosteroids did not pose higher risks in other measured outcomes.

### Initial high-dose prophylaxis and extended taper for mushroom keratoplasty in vascularized herpetic scars [^112AkXGr]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

To report the outcomes of initial high-dose and extended taper of antiviral and steroid prophylaxis for the treatment of eyes with high-risk vascularized herpetic corneal scars that underwent 2-piece mushroom keratoplasty (MK), a prospective interventional case series was conducted.

In this single-center study, 52 consecutive eyes with vascularized (≥ 2 quadrants) herpetic corneal scars underwent 2-piece microkeratome-assisted MK. Initial high-dose and extended taper of combined oral and topical antiviral and steroid prophylaxis was administered. Outcome measures included best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), refractive astigmatism (RA), endothelial cell density, immunologic rejection, herpetic recurrence, and graft failure rates.

Excluding patients with vision-impairing comorbidities, baseline BSCVA (1.73 ± 0.67 logMAR) significantly improved annually during the first 2 years (P < .001, P = 0.016), reaching 0.17 ± 0.18 logMAR at year 2, and remaining stable up to 10 years (P = 0.662). At 2 years, 86% of eyes achieved ≥ 20/40, 55% achieved ≥ 20/25, and 18% achieved ≥ 20/20 Snellen BSCVA. RA exceeded 4.5 diopters in 7% of cases after wound revision for high-degree astigmatism in 7 cases. Endothelial cell loss was 40.9% at 1 year with an annual decline of 3.1% over 10 years. The 10-year cumulative risk for immunologic rejection, herpetic recurrence, and graft failure was 9.7%, 7.8%, and 7.6%, respectively.

These findings suggest that initial high dose and extended taper of antiviral and steroid prophylaxis for MK in high-risk, vascularized herpetic corneal scars achieves clinical outcomes over a long-term period.

### How I treat refractory acute GVHD [^116wMGyr]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients who do not respond to primary therapy, which usually consists of glucocorticoids (steroids). Approaches to therapy of acute GVHD refractory to "standard" doses of steroids have ranged from increasing the dose of steroids to the addition of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, the use of immunotoxins, additional immunosuppressive/chemotherapeutic interventions, phototherapy, and other means. While many pilot studies have yielded encouraging response rates, in most of these studies, long-term survival was not improved compared to that seen with the use of steroids alone. A major reason for failure has been the high rate of infections, including invasive fungal, bacterial, and viral infections.

It is difficult to conduct controlled prospective trials in the setting of steroid-refractory GVHD, and a custom-tailored therapy dependent upon the time after HCT, specific organ manifestations of GVHD, and severity is appropriate. All patients being treated for GVHD should also receive intensive prophylaxis against infectious complications.

### Adjuvant corticosteroid treatment in adults with influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia [^112NsHDk]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

To determine the impact of adjuvant corticosteroids administered to patients hospitalized with influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia, the effects were assessed using multivariate Cox regression and a propensity score-matched case-control study. Nosocomial infections and viral shedding were also compared.

The study was conducted in hospitals with influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia patient admissions in 84 cities and 16 provinces of Mainland China. Adolescent and adult patients aged over 14 years with severe laboratory-confirmed infections were screened from April 2013 to March 2015. There were no interventions in the study.

The study population comprised 288 cases hospitalized with influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia. The median age was 58 years, with 69.8% male patients and 51.4% having at least one underlying disease. The in-hospital mortality was 31.9%. Two hundred and four patients (70.8%) received adjuvant corticosteroids; among them, 193 had hypoxemia and lung infiltrates, 11 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 11 had pneumonia only. Corticosteroids were initiated within 7 days (interquartile range, 5.0–9.4 days) of the onset of illness, with the maximum dose equivalent to 80 mg methylprednisolone (interquartile range, 40–120 mg). The median treatment duration was 7 days (interquartile range, 4.0–11.3 days). Cox regression analysis showed that compared with the patients who died, the patient's dataset remains incomplete.

### Rasuvo [^114WFzBE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroids

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should not be administered prior to or concomitantly with the high doses of methotrexate, such as those used in the treatment of osteosarcoma. Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs with high-dose methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Caution should be used when NSAIDs and salicylates are administered concomitantly with lower doses of methotrexate, including Rasuvo. These drugs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model and may enhance its toxicity.

Despite the potential interactions, studies of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have usually included constant dosage regimens of NSAIDs without apparent problems. It should be appreciated, however, that the doses used in rheumatoid arthritis (7.5 to 15 mg/week) are somewhat lower than those used in psoriasis, and larger doses could lead to unexpected toxicity. Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low-dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs, including salicylates, has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 blockers

Use caution if high-dose methotrexate is administered to patients receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.

### Corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of influenza [^117NkXac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Specific treatments for influenza are limited to neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes. Corticosteroids show evidence of benefit in sepsis and related conditions, most likely due to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Although commonly prescribed for severe influenza, there is uncertainty over their potential benefits or harms. This is an update of a review first published in 2016.

- **Objectives**: To systematically assess the effectiveness and potential adverse effects of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of influenza, taking into account differences in timing and doses of corticosteroids.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2018, Issue 9), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to October week 1, 2018), Embase (1980 to 3 October 2018), CINAHL (1981 to 3 October 2018), LILACS (1982 to 3 October 2018), Web of Science (1985 to 3 October 2018), abstracts from the last three years of major infectious disease and microbiology conferences, and references of included articles. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry on 3 October 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and observational studies that compared corticosteroid treatment with no corticosteroid treatment for influenza or influenza-like illness. We did not restrict studies by language of publication, influenza subtypes, clinical setting, or age of participants.

### Advances in risk assessment and prophylaxis for central nervous system relapse in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^1129eFAW]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

The optimal timing of CNS prophylaxis, particularly with high-dose intravenous methotrexate, remains incompletely elucidated. CNS relapse typically occurs during or within 5–6 months of induction treatment. The incidence of early CNS events forms the rationale for the introduction of CNS-directed therapy concurrently with systemic induction treatment, but this must be balanced with the risks of toxicity due to concomitant therapy.

For high-risk DLBCL patients who are appropriate candidates for high-dose systemic methotrexate, we favor inclusion at a dose of 3500 mg/m² on day 15 of the 21-day R-CHOP cycle for up to a total of three doses, usually administered in alternating R-CHOP cycles. An alternative schedule is to administer three or four doses of intravenous methotrexate immediately following the completion of R-CHOP, although this risks earlier CNS progression. Methotrexate can be administered at 10- to 14-day intervals when given as monotherapy following the completion of R-CHOP.

A recommended algorithm for risk stratification and prophylaxis is shown in Figure 2.

### Low-, medium-, and high-dose steroids with or without aminocaproic acid in adult hematopoietic SCT patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^116S9UdN]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a poorly understood complication of transplantation that carries a high mortality rate. Patients commonly deteriorate and require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Treatment with high-dose steroids and aminocaproic acid (ACA) has been suggested. The study examined 119 critically ill adult hematopoietic transplant patients treated for DAH. Patients were subdivided into low-, medium-, and high-dose steroid groups with or without ACA. All groups had similar baseline characteristics and severity of illness scores. The primary objectives were assessing 30, 60, and 100-day mortality, as well as ICU and hospital mortality.

- **Mortality rates**: Overall mortality at day 100 was high at 85% among the 119 patients. In the steroids and ACA cohort (n = 82), there were no significant differences in 30, 60, 100-day, ICU, and hospital mortality between the dosing groups. In the steroids-only cohort (n = 37), the low-dose steroid group had a lower ICU and hospital mortality (P = 0.02). Adjunctive treatment with ACA did not produce differences in outcomes.

- **Multivariate analysis**: Medium- and high-dose steroids were associated with higher ICU mortality (P = 0.01) compared with the low-dose group.

The data suggest that treatment strategies may need to be reanalyzed to avoid potentially unnecessary and harmful therapies.

### Darzalex IV [^1122xLXw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommended concomitant medications**:

	**Pre-infusion medication**: Administer the following pre-infusion medications 1 to 3 hours before every DARZALEX infusion:

	- **Corticosteroid (long- or intermediate-acting)**:

		- **Monotherapy**: Administer methylprednisolone 100 mg (or equivalent) intravenously. Following the second infusion, consider reducing the dose to 60 mg (or equivalent) administered either orally or intravenously.

		- **In combination**: Administer dexamethasone 20 mg (or equivalent) orally or intravenously. When dexamethasone is the background regimen-specific corticosteroid, the dexamethasone dose that is part of the background regimen will serve as pre-medication on DARZALEX infusion days [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Do not administer background regimen-specific corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) on DARZALEX infusion days when patients have received dexamethasone (or equivalent) as a pre-medication.

	- **Acetaminophen**: 650 mg to 1,000 mg orally.

	- **Diphenhydramine**: 25 mg to 50 mg (or equivalent) orally or intravenously.

	**Post-infusion medication**: Administer the following post-infusion medications:

	- **Monotherapy**: Administer methylprednisolone 20 mg (or an equivalent dose of an intermediate- or long-acting corticosteroid) orally for 2 days starting the day after the administration of DARZALEX.

	- **In combination**: Consider administering oral methylprednisolone at a dose of less than or equal to 20 mg (or an equivalent dose of an intermediate- or long-acting corticosteroid) beginning the day after the administration of a DARZALEX infusion.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^115NiiPm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The recommendations are worded as recommend (strong recommendation) and suggest (weak recommendation). The quality of evidence behind the recommendations is classified as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), and strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the working group members are not formally graded but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence or good clinical practice, are not graded at all (also see "Methods" section).

- **General recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy of non-endocrine conditions and recommendations regarding patient education**:
	- R 1.1 — We recommend that, in general, patients on, or tapering off glucocorticoids for non-endocrine conditions do not need to be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist.
	- R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy (good clinical practice).
	- R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy (good clinical practice).

- **Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome**:

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: Consensus statements from an international task force by the American College of Critical Care Medicine [^1177twrz]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The objective was to develop consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients.

- **Participants**: A multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine was convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. In addition, international experts in endocrinology were invited to participate.

- **Design/methods**: The task force members reviewed published literature and provided expert opinion from which the consensus was derived. The consensus statements were developed using a modified Delphi methodology. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, which classifies recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2), and the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C) based on factors that include the study design, the consistency of the results, and the directness of the evidence.

- **Results**: The task force coined the term critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency to describe the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that occurs during critical illness. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is caused by adrenal insufficiency together with tissue corticosteroid resistance and is characterized by an exaggerated and protracted proinflammatory response. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency should be suspected in hypotensive patients who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents.

### PediaPred [^113T9E8i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case regarding dose and duration of treatment, and whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids in patients with hypothyroidism and those with cirrhosis. Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

- **Cardio-renal**: As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, or renal insufficiency.

- **Endocrine**: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

### Optimum management of glucocorticoid-treated patients [^114facbA]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are taken by approximately 2% of the US adult population at any given time. The powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive benefits of these drugs must, however, be weighed against their multisystem adverse effects. Clinicians should always prescribe the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time. Patients should be informed of the short-term and long-term adverse effects to expect, particularly if the dose of glucocorticoids is expected to exceed the equivalent of approximately 7.5 mg prednisone daily for 2 months or more.

At the commencement of glucocorticoid therapy, a patient's blood pressure, lipid profile, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) level, and fasting glucose level should be measured, and baseline bone densitometry performed. Bisphosphonate therapy should be initiated for postmenopausal women and men with a bone density T-score below -1 or for those with a history of fracture. Regular ophthalmic screening for cataracts and glaucoma is warranted, and patients at high risk of gastric ulceration — especially those simultaneously taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — should receive proton-pump inhibitors.

Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections is appropriate for high-risk populations, such as organ-transplant recipients. Trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole can be given to high-risk populations, such as organ transplant recipients. The duration of weaning from glucocorticoid treatment should be proportionate to treatment duration. Appropriate preventive therapy can mitigate many of the adverse effects associated with glucocorticoid therapy.

Regarding preventative measures for thyroid eye disease, specifically concerning corticosteroid prophylaxis, the EUGOGO 2021 guidelines recommend administering oral prednisone/prednisolone prophylaxis in patients treated with radioactive iodine who are at risk of progression or de novo development of Graves' orbitopathy. This is particularly advised for smokers, individuals with severe or unstable hyperthyroidism, and those with high serum thyrotropin receptor antibody levels. The guidelines specify the following regimens:

- **High risk**: 0.3–0.5 mg/kg/body weight as a starting dose, tapered, and withdrawn after 3 months
- **Low risk**: 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/body weight, tapered, and withdrawn after 6 weeks

### Repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal respiratory disease [^115XAz6M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

It is not clear whether there is a benefit in repeating the dose of prenatal corticosteroids for women who remain at risk of preterm birth after an initial course.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of a repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (February 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1965 to November 2006), EMBASE (1988 to November 2006), and Contents (1997 to November 2006).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of women who have already received a single course of corticosteroids seven or more days previously and are still considered to be at risk of preterm birth; outcomes compared for women randomised to receive a repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids, with women given no further prenatal corticosteroids.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We assessed trial quality and extracted the data independently.

- **Main results**: Five trials, involving over 2000 women between 23 and 33 weeks' gestation, are included. Treatment with repeat dose(s) of corticosteroid was associated with a reduction in occurrence (relative risk (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.93, four trials, 2155 infants) and severity of any neonatal lung disease (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.75, three trials, 2139 infants) and serious infant morbidity (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.93, four trials, 2157 infants). Mean birthweight was not significantly different between treatment groups.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^114GM4hY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia is a common and serious painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids, known for their anti-inflammatory properties, might be beneficial in its prevention. This document updates a review initially published in 2008, with a previous update in 2010.

- **Objectives**: To examine the efficacy of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

- **Search methods**: We updated the searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (16 April 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012), LILACS (January 1982 to April 2012), and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to 2012). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors, and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset. These were compared with no treatment or placebo but not with other treatments. We did not include quasi-RCTs (trials in which a systematic method of randomization, such as alternation or hospital number, was used).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors identified potential articles, extracted data, and independently assessed the risk of bias of each trial. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors.

- **Main results**: Five trials were included.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1171fF7m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, likely affecting the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses risk for adrenal insufficiency is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

- **Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency**: 3–4 weeks or greater.
- **Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency**: Any dose greater than a daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone).

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

- **Physiologic daily dose equivalent**: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above-mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability.
- **Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy**: Any dose greater than physiological daily dose equivalent (see above).
- **Short-term glucocorticoid therapy**: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration.
- **Long-term glucocorticoid therapy**: Glucocorticoid therapy greater than the specified duration.

### Cortef [^1179kqnK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated.

- **Immunosuppression and increased risk of infection**: Corticosteroids, including CORTEF, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can reduce resistance to new infections, exacerbate existing infections, increase the risk of disseminated infections, increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections, and mask some signs of infection. Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider CORTEF withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed.

- **Tuberculosis**: If CORTEF is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged CORTEF therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis.

- **Varicella zoster and measles viral infections**: Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including CORTEF. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella.

### Prevention and management of secondary central nervous system lymphoma [^114UY25j]. Haematologica (2023). Low credibility.

Strategies for prophylaxis of central nervous system disease include:

- **Intrathecal chemotherapy**: Prophylaxis with intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) and/or cytarabine, often combined with steroids, has been used historically in aggressive B-cell lymphomas. However, in the rituximab era, the majority of retrospective studies and post-hoc analyses from prospective trials showed a lack of efficacy of IT prophylaxis. Recent retrospective series, including older patients and high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), have shown similar results with no apparent benefit of IT prophylaxis.

Testicular DLBCL represents a particular scenario in which IT prophylaxis might have a role in the prevention of CNS disease, according to two prospective single-arm studies conducted by the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG). The IELSG10 study (n = 53) showed a low risk of CNS relapse for patients treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) plus contralateral testicular irradiation and four doses of IT MTX (5-year cumulative risk of 6%) compared to patients in previous retrospective series. Moreover, following a median follow-up of 5 years, no CNS relapses occurred in the IELSG30 trial analyzing 54 patients treated with R-CHOP, contralateral radiotherapy, and intensified CNS prophylaxis with two doses of end-of-treatment high-dose (HD)-MTX (1.5 g/m) plus four doses of IT liposomal cytarabine. These trials have informed clinical practice, and as a result, many centers have incorporated IT MTX and end-of-treatment HD-MTX as CNS prophylaxis in this particular lymphoma.

### Concurrent sglt2 inhibitor use in patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalised for high-dose corticosteroid therapy: Mitigated iatrogenic hyperglycaemia [^115vD8Zu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

We retrospectively collected electronic medical records of patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalised at Kyoto University Hospital between April 2014 and March 2022 who received high-dose corticosteroid therapy for facial paralysis or idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. These patients received intravenous corticosteroid therapy with 200 mg of prednisolone sodium succinate daily for 3 days, followed by 100 mg daily for 3 days, and 50 mg daily for another 3 days. Older patients received a half-dose. Preprandial blood glucose levels were measured using point-of-care (POC) testing devices (PocketChem BG, Arkray, Kyoto, Japan). Data on additional insulin doses used during steroid therapy were also collected. The study was approved by the Kyoto University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine Ethics Committee (R2305–3).

Eligible patients were identified from medical records using the medical information unit is sorting system. The criteria were as follows:

- **Primary diagnosis**: Facial paralysis or idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss
- **Comorbid diagnosis**: Type 2 diabetes
- **Intravenous medication**: Prednisolone sodium succinate administration
- **Monitoring records**: POC capillary (finger-stick) glucose monitoring by healthcare professionals in hospitals

Exclusion criteria included:

- **Early discharge**: Before the third prednisolone dose
- **Incomplete records**: Lack of three daily preprandial blood glucose measurements in the hospital

Demographic and clinical information, including medications, anthropometric data, and HbA1c and preprandial blood glucose levels, were also collected and analyzed.

### Jevtana [^116gE1zt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosing information**: The recommended dose of Jevtana is based on the calculation of the Body Surface Area (BSA) and is 20 mg/m², administered as a one-hour intravenous infusion every three weeks in combination with oral prednisone, 10 mg daily throughout Jevtana treatment. A dose of 25 mg/m² may be used in select patients at the discretion of the treating healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14)]. Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF is recommended in patients with high-risk clinical features. Consider primary prophylaxis with G-CSF in all patients receiving a dose of 25 mg/m² [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Premedicate at least 30 minutes prior to each dose of Jevtana with the following intravenous medications to reduce the risk and/or severity of hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]:

	- **Antihistamine**: Dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg, or diphenhydramine 25 mg, or equivalent antihistamine
	- **Corticosteroid**: Dexamethasone 8 mg, or equivalent steroid
	- H2 antagonist

	- Antiemetic prophylaxis is recommended and can be given orally or intravenously as needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Jevtana injection single-dose vial requires two dilutions prior to administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

- **Dose modifications for adverse reactions**: Reduce or discontinue Jevtana dosing for adverse reactions as described in Table 1. Patients at a 20 mg/m² dose who require dose reduction should decrease the dosage of Jevtana to 15 mg/m² [see Adverse Reactions].

### Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in ventilated very low birth weight preterm neonates [^114Z9orn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity in preterm infants, with inflammation playing a significant role in its pathogenesis. The use of inhaled corticosteroids may modulate the inflammatory process without causing high systemic steroid concentrations, thereby reducing the risk of adverse effects. This paper updates a review published in 2012 (Shah 2012), and it accompanies a related review on "Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for treating bronchopulmonary dysplasia in ventilated very low birth weight preterm neonates".

- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids started within the first 7 days of life on preventing death or BPD in ventilated very low birth weight infants.

- **Search methods**: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 1), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 23 February 2017), Embase (1980 to 23 February 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 23 February 2017). Additionally, we searched clinical trials registers, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing inhaled versus systemic corticosteroid therapy (irrespective of dose and duration) starting in the first seven days of life in very low birth weight preterm infants receiving assisted ventilation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Clinical outcomes data were extracted and analyzed using appropriate methodologies for synthesis and interpretation of the collected data.

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 [^1153b4ZV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID-19. Nonetheless, the size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, and to keep up at the time of writing with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender, or ethnicity. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids, and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances.

### How to prevent steroid induced osteoporosis [^113bWnw8]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The first choice for the prevention of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis is a potent oral bisphosphonate, for example, alendronate or risedronate. Intravenous bisphosphonates should be considered for patients intolerant of the oral route. For patients receiving chronic low-dose corticosteroids, treatment with calcium and vitamin D may prevent further bone loss. The use of parathyroid hormone is promising.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^111SuPHt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, serious, painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids, due to their anti-inflammatory properties, might be beneficial in this context. This paper is an update of a review first published in 2008 and previously updated in 2013. The objective was to assess the effects, both benefits and harms, of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

The search methods involved updating searches in June 2022 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing PHN. Searches were conducted in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trial registers. Bibliographies of identified trials were reviewed, authors contacted, and pharmaceutical companies approached to identify any additional published or unpublished data.

The selection criteria included all RCTs involving corticosteroids, administered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously, for people of all ages with herpes zoster of any severity within seven days of onset. These were compared with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments.

For data collection and analysis, two review authors independently identified potential articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of each trial and the certainty of the evidence. Disagreements were resolved through discussion among the co-authors, following standard Cochrane methodology.

In the main results, five trials with a total of 787 participants met the inclusion criteria. No new studies were identified for this update. All identified trials were randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled.
