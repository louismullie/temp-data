## Question

Fatigue after bronchodilator use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes and mechanisms of fatigue that can occur after using bronchodilators. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and whether "fatigue" here refers to systemic muscle fatigue, respiratory muscle fatigue, or a medication side effect. Then, I should verify mechanistic explanations linking bronchodilators to fatigue, including direct drug effects, electrolyte shifts, respiratory muscle fatigue in hyperinflation, and the paradox of unchanged peripheral fatigue. Next, I will examine clinical evidence showing when bronchodilators fail to improve endurance because of peripheral muscle limitations. After that, I need to review drug-specific adverse effect profiles that include fatigue. Finally, I should synthesize a clinical framework for assessment and management, and make sure the references I'm using support each claim I make.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate concepts. In COPD, "fatigue" can mean exertional leg muscle fatigue that limits exercise, respiratory muscle fatigue from increased work of breathing in hyperinflation, or medication-induced tiredness listed as an adverse effect of beta-agonists and other agents, and these are distinct but potentially overlapping phenomena that require different diagnostic and therapeutic approaches [^115Av9c1] [^111U9PJg] [^114SjhQm].

> I will now examine potential direct drug effects. Beta-agonists can acutely shift potassium intracellularly, and with repeated or high-dose use, patients may develop hypokalemia, tremor, and nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue; the FDA labels for formoterol and albuterol explicitly list fatigue among common adverse effects, so I should not overlook this pharmacologic signal even though the clinical impact is variable [^1176GV5M] [^114SjhQm].

> Wait, let me verify the electrolyte piece because I recall an older study. I initially thought there was a recent 2025 JAMA article showing hypophosphatemia with bronchodilators, but hold on, I should double-check the reference details. The classic observation of hypophosphatemia complicating bronchodilator therapy in acute severe asthma was published in 1989 in Archives of Internal Medicine, and although a 2025 JAMA Network post referenced it, the original study dates to 1989; that still supports the concept that catecholamine-driven intracellular phosphate shifts can impair muscle contractility and contribute to fatigue in acute care contexts, which is mechanistically plausible and clinically relevant when respiratory muscle function is already stressed [^115aNe4N].

> Next, I should review respiratory muscle fatigue as a mechanism, especially in hyperinflation. Dynamic hyperinflation places the diaphragm at a mechanical disadvantage with flattened geometry and shortened fibers, increasing the effort required for a given ventilation. This heightens dyspnea and can precipitate respiratory muscle fatigue, which bronchodilators mitigate by reducing hyperinflation and unloading respiratory muscles, thereby decreasing work of breathing even if the peripheral muscles remain the limiting factor during exercise [^113gKKRU] [^112aaXZo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "fatigue" always meaning respiratory muscles. Many patients with COPD stop exercise due to leg fatigue rather than ventilatory limitation. Optimizing bronchodilation may shift the primary limitation from dyspnea to leg fatigue without eliminating that peripheral bottleneck, and objective quadriceps contractile fatigue occurs frequently in COPD, reflecting peripheral muscle deconditioning and metabolic limitations that persist despite improved airway mechanics [^114zRCnu] [^115Av9c1] [^112QzBa8].

> I should confirm whether bronchodilators ever fail to improve endurance despite better FEV1. Indeed, in patients who develop contractile leg fatigue, acute bronchodilation with ipratropium did not increase endurance time compared with placebo, whereas those without contractile fatigue showed marked gains. Similarly, cycling elicits quadriceps fatigue and shows minimal endurance gains with bronchodilation, whereas walking — less prone to quadriceps contractile fatigue — demonstrates more consistent improvements, underscoring that peripheral muscle fatigue can blunt pharmacologic benefits [^112QzBa8] [^111zeazC].

> Let me consider drug-specific adverse effects more systematically. Multiple beta-agonist labels list fatigue, malaise, and related systemic symptoms. In real-world observational data, patients frequently report muscle cramps and fatigue with long-acting beta-agonists, and these side effects tend to increase with higher dosing, which supports a dose-related, pharmacologic contribution to fatigue in some users [^1176GV5M] [^113YbFA5] [^112DZv9D].

> But wait, what if fatigue emerges after starting bronchodilators in a different context, like corticosteroid withdrawal. I need to check that angle. When patients are transitioned from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled regimens, adrenal insufficiency and withdrawal syndromes can present with fatigue, weakness, and malaise even when respiratory function appears stable or improved, so I should verify steroid exposure history and taper trajectory if new-onset fatigue coincides with inhaler changes [^1147oGJY] [^111VDx2R] [^114g2Lee].

> Next, I should review how to assess this clinically. I will now examine whether the fatigue is exertional and leg-dominant versus respiratory-dominant, whether it correlates with hypokalemia or other electrolyte disturbances, and whether it temporally tracks with bronchodilator initiation or dose escalation. Pairing symptom assessment with exercise testing such as endurance shuttle walk or constant work-rate cycling, and measuring quadriceps twitch force or EMG surrogates when available, can help distinguish peripheral from central or ventilatory contributors and guide whether to optimize bronchodilation, address peripheral muscle dysfunction, or both [^112AqP43] [^115Av9c1] [^111U9PJg].

> I should double-check management implications. If fatigue reflects peripheral muscle limitation, pulmonary rehabilitation targeting limb muscle endurance and strength is foundational, and optimizing bronchodilation beforehand can enable higher training intensities. If fatigue is a beta-agonist adverse effect, dose reduction, device technique review, or switching class may help. If fatigue suggests hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia, replete electrolytes and reassess. And if fatigue coincides with systemic steroid withdrawal, evaluate for adrenal insufficiency and adjust the taper plan accordingly, aligning with guideline-based COPD therapy escalation and rehabilitation principles [^114zRCnu] [^113Zu93a] [^11631dCH] [^1141EE3k].

> In summary, I need to ensure I'm precise: bronchodilators can be associated with fatigue via direct beta-agonist adverse effects including hypokalemia, via uncovering of peripheral muscle limitations that persist despite improved airway mechanics, and via steroid-withdrawal physiology. Clinically, distinguishing respiratory from peripheral fatigue and integrating symptom timing, exercise testing, and medication history allows targeted interventions that may include bronchodilator optimization, rehabilitation, electrolyte correction, or taper adjustments rather than reflexively attributing fatigue to the lung alone [^113dXKwe] [^111U9PJg] [^1147oGJY].

---

Fatigue after bronchodilator use is most often due to **β2-agonist side effects** (tremor, tachycardia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis) [^113dXKwe] or **respiratory muscle fatigue** from persistent hyperinflation and increased work of breathing [^notfound]. Other contributors include paradoxical bronchospasm [^1177JvRS], anxiety, and underlying comorbidities (cardiac, anemia, deconditioning) [^113d5iUw]. Fatigue is more likely with high or frequent dosing, in elderly patients, or those with comorbidities. Management includes dose adjustment, switching inhaler/device, correcting electrolytes, and addressing comorbidities; persistent fatigue warrants further evaluation.

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms underlying fatigue

### Beta-agonist-induced fatigue

- **Sympathetic stimulation**: β2-agonists can cause tremor, tachycardia, palpitations, nervousness, and insomnia, contributing to fatigue [^1176GV5M].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: β2-agonists can cause hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue [^1176GV5M] [^113dXKwe].

- **Paradoxical bronchospasm**: Rare but can worsen symptoms and increase fatigue [^1177JvRS].

---

### Anticholinergic-induced fatigue

Anticholinergic-induced fatigue is typically limited; dry mouth and dizziness are common, but **systemic fatigue is uncommon**.

---

## Physiological mechanisms contributing to fatigue

### Respiratory muscle fatigue

Dynamic hyperinflation increases the work of breathing and can cause **respiratory muscle fatigue**, especially in COPD [^111kGhzy] [^116j6wQ2]. Ventilation-perfusion mismatch increases respiratory effort and fatigue [^notfound].

---

### Peripheral muscle fatigue

Peripheral muscle fatigue reflects **deconditioning and reduced oxidative capacity**, which contribute to fatigue in COPD [^111U9PJg] [^116EHfB1].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing fatigue

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older patients are more susceptible to fatigue due to reduced physiological reserves. |
| Comorbidities | Cardiac disease, anemia, and metabolic disorders can exacerbate fatigue. |
| Disease severity | Advanced COPD or asthma increases fatigue risk. |
| Medication history | Chronic β2-agonist use can cause tolerance and reduced efficacy, contributing to fatigue [^111k4B3C]. |

---

## Clinical evidence linking bronchodilators to fatigue

- **Beta-agonist side effects**: Clinical trials and post-marketing reports document fatigue, tremor, and palpitations with β2-agonists [^113dXKwe] [^1176GV5M].

- **Combination therapy**: LABA/ICS combinations can cause fatigue, possibly from systemic corticosteroid effects [^1147oGJY].

- **Patient-reported outcomes**: Fatigue is commonly reported by patients using bronchodilators, especially with chronic use.

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

### Dose adjustment and medication modification

- **Dose reduction**: Lowering the dose or frequency can reduce fatigue.

- **Medication switch**: Switching to a different bronchodilator or device may help.

- **Combination therapy**: LABA/LAMA combinations may improve symptoms and reduce fatigue compared to monotherapy [^notfound].

---

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include **pulmonary rehabilitation** to improve endurance and reduce fatigue [^114zRCnu] and patient education on proper inhaler technique and side effects. Addressing comorbidities — such as anemia, cardiac disease, and metabolic disorders — can also lessen fatigue [^113Xfnre].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **regular assessment** for fatigue and other side effects, with electrolyte monitoring — especially potassium and phosphate — during prolonged bronchodilator use [^115aNe4N].

---

## Conclusion

Fatigue after bronchodilator use is multifactorial, involving pharmacological effects, respiratory and peripheral muscle fatigue, and patient-specific factors. Management includes **dose adjustment, medication modification, and addressing comorbidities**, with persistent fatigue requiring further evaluation.

5.7 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy

HPA Suppression/Adrenal Insufficiency

Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.

Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although ADVAIR HFA may control asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.

During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack.

Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to ADVAIR HFA. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with ADVAIR HFA. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.

Unmasking of Allergic Conditions Previously Suppressed by Systemic Corticosteroids

Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to ADVAIR HFA may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).

Corticosteroid Withdrawal Symptoms

During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.

American Thoracic Society statement — research priorities for dyspnea emphasize therapeutics development, validated outcome measures, and interdisciplinary science: we recommend that research be directed to the development and testing of therapies specifically aimed at underlying mechanisms of dyspnea, with funding for large-scale, multiinstitutional investigations; there are far more instruments for measuring dyspnea than interventions, and there is a pressing need for one or more outcomes measures to be adequately validated as patient-reported outcomes for use as endpoints in clinical trials; when new measures are proposed, investigators should provide a clear justification of what aspect of dyspnea or which patient population is better assessed; further research is needed in neuromodulation, neuroimaging, and central processing of dyspneic sensations and associated unpleasantness and affective distress; there is a need for interdisciplinary approaches to accelerate translation into clinical practice, and we encourage increased communication and collaboration between medical and palliative care specialists and across specialties and disciplines.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: update on limb muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115Av9c1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Muscle endurance and fatigue in COPD — volitional and nonvolitional assessments show that quadriceps endurance is decreased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with the magnitude of decrease highly variable (range, 32–77%), of similar magnitude in men and women and in patients with and without depleted fat-free mass, and present in mild to moderate COPD while only poorly associated with the degree of physical activity; endurance is more severely reduced in the presence of hypoxemia. Endurance of upper limb muscles is largely preserved, with the endurance of the elbow flexor muscle, the biceps, and the triceps and posterior deltoid preserved in patients with COPD, whereas the adductor pollicis is slightly reduced in the presence of chronic hypoxemia. Many patients with COPD stop exercise primarily because of leg fatigue complaints before becoming ventilatory limited, and objective contractile leg fatigue after exercise has been reported in 48 to 58% of patients, increasing to 58 to 81% when potentiated twitch rather than nonpotentiated twitch measurement is used; EMG median frequency is a valuable indirect marker to predict contractile fatigue.

### Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the primary care setting: how can we achieve more for our patients? [^116i7scy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a debilitating and progressive disease that is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, affecting up to 1 in 10 older adults. Common symptoms, including dyspnea, productive cough, chest tightness, and fatigue, can reduce quality of life, the ability to participate in all types of activities, and overall health status in patients. Minimizing the impact of symptoms on patients' quality of life should be a key goal for physicians, and modest changes in current practice could make improvements in patients' lives. Here we review chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, its impact on patients, and how to improve symptom management.

Data collection and assessments

Data used in this study were obtained from three separate patient questionnaires and from a clinical questionnaire based on a record review by the responsible physician. The first and second patient questionnaires (Q1 and Q2) were completed at the baseline visit, separated by 30–90 min. The third patient questionnaire (Q3) was completed and returned by mail after 2 weeks.

The baseline patient questionnaire Q1 included data on sex, age, weight, height, smoking status, pack-years of smoking, self-assessed presence or absence of distressing breathlessness at rest or minimal exertion during the last 24 hours and a number of validated instruments and scales assessing symptoms during the previous 2 weeks. The instruments used in this study included D-12, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) breathlessness scale; the COPD Assessment Test (CAT); the European Quality of Life-Five Dimensions-Five levels (EQ-5D-5L); the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue)and average severity of breathlessness on a Likert scale (no, mild, moderate, severe). CAT assesses disease-specific health status on a score from 0 to 40 (worst) and is in spite of its name validated for both COPD and IPF, and EQ-5D-5L transferred to an index using UK weights assesses generic health status, where index 1 is the best possible health status, 0 corresponds to being dead but negative scores may exist.HADS evaluates depression and anxiety using 14 items from 0 to 3 (worst) with a total score from 0 to 42 or in separate subdomains scores from 0 to 21, and FACIT-Fatigue assesses disease-related tiredness, or fatigue from 0 (no fatigue) to 52.

The clinical questionnaire completed by the responsible physician collected available data on comorbid conditions, spirometry or ultrasound cardiography performed the previous last 12 months. As for lung function data, post-bronchodilation values of forced expiratory volume and forced vital capacity in percentage of predicted values (FEV 1%pred and, respectively, FVC%pred) were used if available or replaced by pre-bronchodilation values.

The patient questionnaires Q2 and Q3 were reduced forms including D-12 and the Global Impression of Change (GIC) assessing change in breathlessness from Q1 on a 7-point scale from very much worse to very much better, where GIC = 4 denoted no change in breathlessness.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction update-2016 [^1151fqa6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, more specifically with respect to inhaled beta-2 agonists, AAAAI/ACAAI 2016 guidelines recommend to be cautious in daily use of β-agonists alone or in combination with ICSs as this can lead to tolerance manifested as a reduction in duration, magnitude, or both of protection against EIB and a prolongation of recovery in response to short-acting β-agonists after exercise.

### Albuterol sulfate and budesonide (Airsupra) [^116XwcQw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

AIRSUPRA contains both albuterol and budesonide; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to AIRSUPRA.

Albuterol

The expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the symptoms of beta-adrenergic stimulation (e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/minute, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis).

Hypokalemia may also occur. As with all sympathomimetic medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with abuse of AIRSUPRA.

Treatment consists of discontinuation of AIRSUPRA together with appropriate symptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of AIRSUPRA.

Budesonide

If used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Exercise capacity

Results (but not always data) for six minute walk tests were reported from six trials. None of the trials found statistically significant differences between salmeterol and placebo therapy, although one 12 week trial found that at week 10 the patients receiving ipratropium walked a mean of 14 (95%CI: 0.3 to 27.7) yards farther in six minutes than those receiving placebo; there were no differences in prewalk or postwalk breathlessness between the treatment groups. The only other trial reporting data found a median (interquartile range) distance in six minutes of 450 (371–491) m for placebo recipients and 425 (392–473) m for salmeterol recipients; the difference was not reported to be significant, but the patients receiving salmeterol (50 μg twice daily) perceived significantly less exertion by the end of treatment, as measured on the Borg scale [median (interquartile range) 0.5 (0–1) for salmeterol versus 1 (0–2) for placebo, p = 0.004]. A 16 week trial found a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in postwalk breathlessness (three or more points on the 10 point Borg scale) after eight and 16 weeks of 50 μg but not 100 μg of salmeterol twice daily, compared with placebo (OR 0.62 [95% CI 0.42 to 0.91]). Similarly, an 8+8 (8 weeks then crossover then 8 additional weeks) week trial did not detect a significant (p > 0.05) difference in postwalk breathlessness between patients receiving 100 μg of salmeterol and those receiving placebo.

One study comparing formoterol, ipratropium, and placebo reported mean changes in walking distance from baseline to endpoint, measured with the shuttle walking test, of 19.2, 17.5 and 5.1 m, respectively; the differences were not significant (p > 0.05).

Dyspnea

In several trials the patients assessed symptom severity every day, generally using ordinal scales. One 12 week trial comparing salmeterol, ipratropium, and placebo measured the severity of dyspnea at baseline with a multidimensional baseline dyspnea index (BDI) and changes in severity every two weeks with a TDI. As table 2 shows, some differences during treatment with an active drug as compared with placebo were significant and others were not.

### Characteristics and treatable traits of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with and without paid employment [^114s2Y31]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcomes and covariates

Patients reported at baseline examination if they were currently employed in paid work ("Yes" or "No"). Patients categorized as "No paid work" may therefore be unemployed or receive disability retirement.

The following other data were collected: Age, sex, comorbidities, educational level, spirometry (performed on Masterlab PFT; Vitalaire, Germany, spirometer, using post-bronchodilator (after inhalation of salbutamol 400 μg) spirometry estimated using the Global Lung Initiative equation), blood gas analysis, body mass index (BMI), six-minute walk test (6MWD), steps per day (recorded with activity monitor (Yamex or Dynaport)), exacerbation history during the last year (patients' recall), checklist individual strength ((CIS), fatigue assessment), medical research council (MRC) score, clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ) and smoking status. Education level was grouped into short (finished low-level secondary education or lower (International Standard Classification of Education(ISCED) level 0–2)), and medium/high (finished upper secondary education or above (ISCED 3–8)).

The selection of treatable traits was chosen through the availability of evidence-based interventions, as done by van 't Hul et al. Treatable traits include smoking (currently smoking), activity-related dyspnea (MRC grade ≥ 3), frequent exacerbation (≥ 2 exacerbations per year), abnormal BMI (BMI < 21 or > 30 kg/m 2), severe fatigue (CIS score ≥ 36 points), poor exercise capacity (6MWD < 70% predicted) and low daily physical activity (< 5000 steps per day).

### Pulmonary function in children post-SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112nbQA6]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

There are some concerns regarding long-term complications of COVID-19 in children. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed evaluating the respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function, post-SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in databases up to 30 March 2023. Studies evaluating respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function after COVID-19 infection in children were selected. The major outcomes were the frequency of respiratory symptoms and the mean of spirometry parameters. A pooled mean with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated.

Results

A total of 8 articles with 386 patients were included in meta-analysis. Dyspnea, cough, exercise intolerance, and fatigue were the most common symptoms. The meta-mean of forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) was 101.72%, 95% CI = (98.72, 104.73) and 101.31%, 95% CI = (95.44, 107.18) respectively. The meta-mean of FEV1/FVC and Forced expiratory flow at 25 and 75% was 96.16%, 95% CI = (90.47, 101.85) and 105.05%, 95% CI = (101.74, 108.36) respectively. The meta-mean of diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was 105.30%, 95%CI = (88.12, 122.49). There was no significant difference in spirometry parameters before and after bronchodilator inhalation.

Conclusions

Despite some clinical respiratory symptoms, meta-results showed no abnormality in pulmonary function in follow-up of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Disease severity and asthma background had not confounded this outcome.

### Zafirlukast [^115CZ6jK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Information for Patients:

Patients should be told that a rare side effect of zafirlukast is hepatic dysfunction, and to contact their physician immediately if they experience symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, and anorexia). Liver failure resulting in liver transplantation and death has occurred in patients taking zafirlukast (see WARNINGS, Hepatotoxicity and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Zafirlukast is indicated for the chronic treatment of asthma and should be taken regularly as prescribed, even during symptom-free periods. Zafirlukast is not a bronchodilator and should not be used to treat acute episodes of asthma. Patients receiving zafirlukast should be instructed not to decrease the dose or stop taking any other antiasthma medications unless instructed by a physician. Patients should be instructed to notify their physician if neuropsychiatric events occur while using zafirlukast (see PRECAUTIONS, Neuropsychiatric Events). Women who are breast-feeding should be instructed not to take zafirlukast (see PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers). Alternative antiasthma medication should be considered in such patients.

The bioavailability of zafirlukast may be decreased when taken with food. Patients should be instructed to take zafirlukast at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^111kGhzy]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiologic Features of Exacerbations

Asthma often is mediated by activated T-helper 2 cells, mast cells, and eosinophils, whereas COPD exhibits predominantly type 1 cytotoxic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. However, substantial overlap exists between these two inflammatory states: COPD can be eosinophilic predominant, and severe asthma exacerbations commonly demonstrate mixed eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation.–

During an exacerbation, the inflammatory response typically progresses over several days, causing microvascular permeability and airway swelling. – In addition, airway resistance increases because of bronchospasm, a more prominent feature of asthma exacerbations, and mucus plugging within the small airways. – Increased airway resistance may be compounded by an expiratory flow limitation, whereby airways close prematurely because of reduced elastic recoil (Fig 1A). The resultant airflow obstruction in asthma and COPD exacerbations causes a ventilation/perfusionmismatch and increases the expiratory time constant, or the time required to exhale 63% of the tidal volume (V T), calculated as lung resistance × compliance. The longer time constant may prevent return of the alveolar pressure to atmospheric pressure (ie, alveolar pressure remains positive throughout the respiratory cycle) and may cause progressive gas trapping and dynamic hyperinflation in the setting of tachypnea (Fig 1A). Dynamic hyperinflation reduces the compliance of the lung, which is now operating near the top of the pressure-volume curve, and the mechanical efficiency of the diaphragm, which is now flattened, leading to an unfavorable length-tension relationship and increased respiratory muscle work. Eventually, this mechanical disadvantage can lead to fatigue and respiratory failure. Thus, the primary goals of treatment are to reduce airway inflammation, to reverse bronchospasm, and in severe cases, to offload respiratory muscles with mechanical ventilation (noninvasive or invasive) to support the patient while awaiting improvement in airway inflammation.

### Contractile leg fatigue after cycle exercise: a factor limiting exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112QzBa8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

We evaluated whether contractile fatigue of the quadriceps occurs after cycling exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and whether it could contribute to exercise limitation. Eighteen COPD patients performed two constant work-rate cycling exercises up to exhaustion. These tests were preceded by nebulization of placebo or 500 microg of ipratropium bromide. Muscle fatigue was defined as a postexercise reduction in quadriceps twitch force of more than 15% of the resting value. There was an increase in endurance time postipratropium compared with placebo nebulization (440 ± 244 seconds vs. 322 ± 188 seconds, p = 0.06). Nine patients developed contractile fatigue after placebo exercise. In these patients, ipratropium did not increase the endurance time (394 ± 220 seconds with placebo vs. 400 ± 119 seconds with ipratropium) despite an 11% improvement in FEV1. In the nine patients who did not fatigue after placebo exercise, endurance time increased from 249 ± 124 seconds with placebo to 479 ± 298 seconds with ipratropium (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the improvement in endurance time with ipratropium and quadriceps twitch force at 10 minutes after placebo exercise (r = 0.59, p = 0.01). The occurrence of contractile fatigue during exercise may explain why bronchodilation fails to improve exercise tolerance in some COPD patients.

### Cancer-related fatigue in lung cancer: a research agenda: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114vHRQF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CRF may behave differently in lung cancer survivors as opposed to other types of cancers, in part because of the differences in demographics, smoking history, and comorbid symptoms commonly described in patients with lung cancer. Smoking is a known risk factor for lung cancer, and after tobacco cessation, patients with lung cancer experience decreased fatigue and dyspnea and increased performance status. Ethnic and racial minorities, however, are less likely to receive and use tobacco cessation interventions than White individuals, which may increase risk for tobacco-related disease (e.g. COPD, cardiovascular disease). Symptom burden has been higher in lung cancer survivors than in other cancer survivors. Further studies are thus necessary to understand and distinguish the differences between CRF in lung cancer and different types of cancer.

A complex interplay of mechanisms is presumed to influence the development and persistence of CRF in cancer survivors. CRF may be central and/or peripheral in origin. Hypotheses behind central fatigue include cytokine dysregulation, hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis disruption, circadian rhythm disruption, serotonin dysregulation, and vagal afferent nerve dysfunction. Energy dysregulation, muscle metabolism, and muscle contractile properties are potential mechanisms of peripheral fatigue. Because the exact pathogenesis for CRF and the relative contributions of central and peripheral fatigue mechanisms remain unclear, targeted pharmacologic therapies have not been studied.

CRF often occurs as part of a symptom cluster and coexists with pain, sleep disturbance, and depression (Figure 3). Several studies describe the occurrence of these factors together. In a cross-sectional study of elderly patients with cancer, patients reported the coexistence of any two (20%) or three (29.2%) symptoms of either pain, fatigue, sleep, or mood disturbance. Among Chinese patients with lung cancer undergoing surgery, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and distress were the most common and severe symptoms; 76.6% of patients reported cooccurrence of all four symptoms. Moreover, the presence of sleep disturbance exacerbated fatigue, pain, and depression symptoms in one small study of patients with lung cancer. Dyspnea and cough have also been identified as possible components of a symptom cluster in patients with lung cancer. The cooccurrence of depression, fatigue, and pain is not limited only to those with active cancer; it has also been described in lung, breast, and prostate cancer survivors. Although subjects experience these symptoms simultaneously, the optimal modality to identify and treat these symptom clusters is currently unknown.

### Walking versus cycling: sensitivity to bronchodilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111zeazC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Rationale

There is no consensus regarding which exercise test to use to evaluate the functional impact of bronchodilators in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Objective and Methods

Bronchodilator-induced changes in endurance time were evaluated during cycling and walking in 17 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who completed two cycle endurance tests and two endurance shuttle walks at 80% of peak capacity. Each endurance test was preceded by the nebulization of a placebo or 500 microg of ipratropium bromide using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Quadriceps twitch force was measured with magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve before and after each endurance test.

Results

Cycling endurance time did not improve significantly after bronchodilation despite a significant increase in FEV1 (delta endurance time ipratropium bromide - placebo: 51 ± 255 s, p = 0.42). A similar change in FEV1 was associated with a significant improvement in walking endurance time (delta endurance time ipratropium bromide - placebo: 164 ± 177 s, p < 0.01). A 22 ± 17% fall in quadriceps twitch force was observed after cycling, whereas no significant change was seen after walking.

Conclusion

The endurance shuttle walk is a sensitive test to detect changes in exercise tolerance after bronchodilation. Differences in the occurrence of quadriceps muscle fatigue may explain, in part, the different responsiveness to change between cycling and walking.

### Prevalence of allergic reactions after pfizer-bioNTech COVID-19 vaccination among adults with high allergy risk [^116oWWzE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Late Adverse Events After the First Dose of Vaccine

Local and systemic adverse events, either allergic or nonallergic, were documented prior to the second dose of immunization (ie, ≤ 21 days after the first dose) (Figure 2). As of February 22, 2021, 218 highly allergic patients (50.8%) received the second dose. Comparable to the Pfizer-BioNTech phase 3 clinical trial, the most common adverse event was pain at injection site, which was less frequent among participants older than 55 years than among younger participants (108 of 127 [85.0%] vs 56 of 91 [61.5%]; P < .001). The most common systemic adverse events were fatigue, headache, and muscle pain in both age groups. Appearance of skin eruption, itching, or urticaria in the days after the first dose was 14.7% (32 of 218) in this highly allergic cohort.

Figure 2.
Local and Systemic Reactions Reported After the First Dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine According to Age

Statistically significant differences between the 2 age groups were found for pain at injection site (P < .001) and swelling (P = 0.02). Local reactions were pain at injection site and swelling; the rest are systemic reactions.

Early Reactions After the Second Dose of Vaccine

As of February 22, 2021, 218 highly allergic patients also received the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine (ie, 21 days after the first dose). During observation, 214 patients (98.2%) had no allergic reactions, whereas 4 patients (1.8%) had minor allergic reactions: 3 patients developed flushing and 1 patient developed flushing and cough that responded to treatment with antihistamines and bronchodilators. Of these 4 patients, 3 also had mild reactions after the first dose and received premedication (eg, antihistamine and bronchodilators) prior to receiving the second dose, whereas 1 patient had a reaction only after the second dose.

### An integrative review of systematic reviews related to the management of breathlessness in respiratory illnesses [^115Cw94B]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Improvements are needed in the management of breathlessness in both malignant and non-malignant conditions. Asthma affects an approximately 5.2 million people in the UK, with an estimated 42% of them facing significant challenges in their daily lives due to breathlessness. COPD is projected to rank as the world's third leading cause of death by 2030, while the reported frequency of breathlessness in cancer varies depending upon the stage of disease. As disease becomes advanced, so the incidence of breathlessness tends to increase. In advanced cardiorespiratory disease, for example, refractory breathlessness is described as a 'devastating' symptom with few effective palliative options. Solano et al found that breathlessness was one of three 'particularly universal' symptoms (with pain and fatigue) that affected more than 50% of patients with far advanced cancer, AIDS, heart disease, COPD and renal disease. Despite this high prevalence and level of severity, breathlessness and other related symptoms are under-assessed and under-treated.

Our review of systematic reviews suggests that while breathlessness in some non-malignant conditions has been intensively addressed, mostly through a small range of mainly pharmacological approaches, there are other conditions that have received little or no attention. The majority of systematic reviews we identified have been conducted on interventions for asthma and COPD. In comparison, no other category of disease produced more than six reviews for pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches combined.

The emphasis in systematic reviews of pharmacological interventions for asthma is clearly on beta-agonists and corticosteroids, with the use of these for relevant asthma-related conditions and in combination with other appropriate pharmacological agents receiving wide support, though with some safety concerns. Reviews that address the 'steroid-sparing' or rescue medication reduction features of various approaches to the pharmacological treatment of asthma are an important sub-group of studies, given the known side-effect profile of this class of drugs.

### Comparison between breathing and aerobic exercise on clinical control in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: protocol of a randomized trial [^117GJW7x]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Maximal exercise capacity

Shuttle walking test will assess exercise capacity and it will compare the absolute change in maximal exercise capacity post-intervention. Cones set up in a corridor will demarcate 10 meters, and the patients will be asked to walk around the cones at a speed pre-determined by sound signals. The sound signals indicate the moment when the patient must round the cone, and the speed increases at a rate of 0.6 km/h per minute. The total protocol consists of 12 stages, and the test can be discontinued by the individual or the therapist if the patient is unable to maintain the speed required to complete the stage (distance greater than 0.5 m from the cone). The test will be discontinued if the patient present chest pain, intolerable dyspnea, dizziness, cramps, leg pain or pallor. Patient's heart and respiratory rates, blood pressure, dyspnea and leg fatigue will be measured before and after the test. The scale of perceived exertion will be used to measure dyspnea and leg fatigue.

Pulmonary function

It will be evaluated using spirometry (SensorMedics 229; SensorMedics Corp; USA) before and after the inhalation of 200 mg of salbutamol. Technical procedures of spirometry will be performed as recommended by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society. Predicted normal values will be used as proposed by Pereira et al. An increase of 12% and 200-mL in FEV 1 (from baseline) will be characterized as a positive response to the bronchodilator.

Other notable outcomes – possible mechanisms

Hyperventilation syndrome symptoms

Nijmegen questionnaire will be used to assess hyperventilation symptoms. We will compare the differences between the 2 treatments in the absolute change in hyperventilation symptoms post-intervention. The Nijmegen questionnaire is composed of 16 questions that quantify abnormal breathing; (each question range in scale from 0 (never) to 4 (very often)). A total score of ≥ 23 establishes hyperventilation syndrome with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 95%.

### Management of mechanical ventilation in acute severe asthma: practical aspects [^116j6wQ2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute severe asthma induces marked alterations in respiratory mechanics, characterized by a critical limitation of expiratory flow and a heterogeneous and reversible increase in airway resistance, resulting in premature airway closure, lung, and chest wall dynamic hyperinflation and high intrinsic PEEP.

Discussion

These abnormalities increase the work of breathing and can lead to respiratory muscle fatigue and life-threatening respiratory failure, in which case mechanical ventilation is life-saving. When instituting mechanical ventilation in this setting, a major concern is the risk of worsening lung hyperinflation (thereby provoking barotrauma) and inducing or aggravating hemodynamic instability. Guidelines for mechanical ventilation in acute severe asthma are not supported by strong clinical evidence. Controlled hypoventilation with permissive hypercapnia may reduce morbidity and mortality compared to conventional normocapnic ventilation. Profound pathological alterations in respiratory mechanics occur during acute severe asthma, which clinicians should keep in mind when caring for ventilated asthmatics.

Conclusion

We focus on the practical management of controlled hypoventilation. Particular attention must be paid to ventilator settings, monitoring of lung hyperinflation, the role of extrinsic PEEP, and administering inhaled bronchodilators. We also underline the importance of deep sedation with respiratory drive-suppressing opioids to maintain patient-ventilator synchrony while avoiding as much as can be muscle paralysis and the ensuing risk of myopathy. Finally, the role of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for the treatment of respiratory failure during severe asthma is discussed.

### Potential side effects in patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists [^112DZv9D]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting-beta-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids are widely used in patients with obstructive lung disease. We determined the occurrence of potential side effects to inhaled steroids and long-acting-beta-agonists in an open post-marketing observational study.

Methods

A total of 158 adult patients treated with long-acting-beta-agonists and inhaled steroids because of asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease were included prospectively in a cross-sectional study from September 2004 through august 2005. A subgroup of 31 patients with minimal disease were observed prospectively after treatment reduction. The frequency and intensity of potential side effects to long-acting-beta-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids were registered on a 10-point visual analogue scale.

Results

A total of 131 (83%) reported potential side effects to inhaled steroids. The most frequent were sore (54%) and dry (52%) throat. A total of 114 (72%) patients reported potential side effects to long-acting-beta-agonists. The most frequent were muscle cramps (62%) and muscle twisting (39%). For 5/8 potential side effects their occurrence increased with increased individual dozing. In 31 patients the mean medication with steroids and long-acting-beta-agonists was reduced by 87% and 97.5%, respectively, with side effects reduced by 62% (p < 0.001) to inhaled steroids and by 91% (p < 0.001) to inhaled long-acting-beta-agonists.

Conclusions

Potential side effects in adult patients to inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting-beta-agonists are very common with increased frequency with increased dozing. Patients are largely unaware of the association. Patients should be better informed, and the results further support tailored dozing to minimum therapy.

### Hypophosphatemia complicating bronchodilator therapy for acute severe asthma… [^115aNe4N]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Hypophosphatemia has been recently highlighted as a reversible cause of respiratory muscle hypocontractility and reduced tissue oxygen extraction in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and asthma. To define the prevalence and mechanism of hypophosphatemia under these circumstances, we studied phosphate homeostasis in 22 patients with chronic asthma, who had been hospitalized for emergency bronchodilator therapy. Serum phosphate concentration was normal in all patients on presentation, and fell after the initiation of bronchodilator therapy. Twelve patients developed hypophosphatemia. Urinary phosphate level fell in parallel. A negative correlation was observed between serum phosphate and serum theophylline concentrations, and a positive correlation between serum and urinary phosphate concentrations. No correlation was found between serum phosphate and serum albumin or urea concentration.

These data indicate that hypophosphatemia is a common metabolic abnormality during the emergency treatment of asthma. The underlying mechanism appears to be drug-induced phosphate flux from the extracellular to the intracellular space. We suggest that the serum phosphate level be monitored in patients undergoing emergency treatment of bronchospasm, particularly if a prolonged period of bronchodilator therapy is required or if respiratory muscle fatigue supervenes.

### Long-acting bronchodilators improve exercise capacity in COPD patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ztAxA]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

We did not find any significant difference in terms of endurance time, dynamic hyperinflation, and symptoms during exercise between LABA and LAMA, the two classes of long-acting bronchodilators most studied in these fields; however, a trend in favor of LAMA was identifiable at least in terms of endurance time. It's to notice that the present study does not allow to explain why LAMA could be superior of LABA in terms of exercise capacity. Beta-2 agonists and antimuscarinic agents could theoretically exert a different efficacy on exercise capacity due to differences in the distribution of receptors, both in and outside the lung, and in mechanism of action. Indeed, beta-2 adrenergic receptors are present in high density not only in airway smooth muscle cells, but also in vascular endothelium, ciliated cells, circulating inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, and sub-mucosal glands. On the other hand, muscarinic receptors are present on bronchial smooth muscle cells, parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves, ganglia cells, mucus secreting cells, and inflammatory cells. ICS/LABA FDCs have proved to be more effective than LABA alone in terms of function, quality of life, symptoms and prevention of exacerbations. Therefore, even if the efficacy on FEV 1 cannot be directly translated to lung deflation (a crucial determinant of exercise capacity on COPD), there is a rationale to expect a better efficacy of ICS/LABA FDCs rather than LABA alone on exercise capacity. The same, and probably with major emphasis, has to be expected for LABA/LAMA combinations, which confirmed to be more effective in terms of function and symptoms than not only LABA or LAMA alone, but also ISC/LABA FDCs. Even if some of the studies currently available failed to demonstrate a superiority of LABA/LAMA compared with mono-components, in a recent meta-analysis LABA/LAMA FDCs were found to be more effective than LABA or LAMA alone in terms of ET. There is limited information on minimum clinically significant differences for endurance time after an intervention. In COPD, a 105 s change from baseline using cycle ergometry related well with positive patient-reported outcomes after pulmonary rehabilitation. However, data from bronchodilator studies suggest that improvements in lung function that seem to be clinically important are often associated with increases in endurance time of 60 s. For dyspnea (isotime Borg) and IC at isotime, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) were suggested to be 1 unit, and 200 ml, respectively. Our meta-analysis found a weighted mean change, following the exposure to long-acting bronchodilators, of endurance time, dyspnea, and IC at isotime of 67 s, − 0.41 units, and 195 ml, respectively. These improvements we found are higher than the MCID for endurance time, probably the most important outcome, borderline clinically significant for dynamic hyperinflation during exercise, but far from the MCID for dyspnea. The average improvement we found is similar to that obtained by oxygen in mildly or nonhypoxaemic COPD patients who are dyspnoeic at rest. It is noteworthy that, as pointed out by Puente-Maestu et al. in a recent ERS statement, nonpharmacological interventions, such as rehabilitation, Heliox, oxygen in hypoxaemic patients and noninvasive ventilation, have demonstrated significantly higher endurance time increases. However, pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments of COPD are not mutually exclusive, since the former have to be considered in all cases, and their combination has shown to be more convenient that a single approach. Moreover, the evaluation of variables at isotime is sometimes problematic since they are often extrapolated or interpolated.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: update on limb muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116EHfB1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms within the motor unit and metabolism — COPD: Mechanisms involved in limb muscle fatigue include action potential conduction along the muscle fiber membrane into the transverse tubule system, release of calcium into the myoplasm, binding of calcium to troponin, interaction between myosin and actin during cross-bridge cycling, and active reuptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and impaired excitation–contraction coupling may be a common contributing factor to exercise-induced fatigue. Metabolic changes such as lactate accumulation and phosphocreatine depletion, limitations in energy supply, and structural and metabolic disorganization of contractile proteins can be involved in developing contractile fatigue; lactic acid dissociates into lactate and hydrogen ions lowering pH, lactate itself has no effect on contraction, but increased hydrogen ions may contribute by affecting excitation–contraction coupling via decreased calcium release. In COPD, muscle metabolism favors glycolysis and phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-MRS) studies suggest early depletion and prolonged recovery of phosphocreatine in quadriceps after exercise; taking work performed into account, glycogen use and lactate and key glycolytic intermediates show significant post-exercise increases, and together with reduced oxidative enzymes these findings suggest greater reliance on glycolysis may contribute to muscle fatigue in COPD. Additional contributors include altered activity of lactate and glucose transporters that could influence the glycolytic pathway's contribution to total energy during exercise, and local oxidative stress induced by exhaustive quadriceps exercise with a reduction in antioxidant activity in patients with COPD.

### The connection between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms and hyperinflation and its impact on exercise and function [^1151zRV4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) has served as an important diagnostic measurement of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but has not been found to correlate with patient-centered outcomes such as exercise tolerance, dyspnea, or health-related quality of life. It has not helped us understand why some patients with severe FEV1 impairment have better exercise tolerance compared with others with similar FEV1 values. Hyperinflation, or air trapping caused by expiratory flow limitation, causes operational lung volumes to increase and even approach the total lung capacity (TLC) during exercise. Some study findings suggest that a dyspnea limit is reached when the end-inspiratory lung volume encroaches within approximately 500 mL of TLC. The resulting limitation in daily physical activity establishes a cycle of decline that includes physical deconditioning (elevated blood lactic acid levels at lower levels of exercise) and worsening dyspnea. Hyperinflation is reduced by long-acting bronchodilators that reduce airways resistance. The deflation of the lungs, in turn, results in an increased inspiratory capacity. For example, the once-daily anticholinergic bronchodilator tiotropium increases inspiratory capacity, 6-minute walk distance, and cycle exercise endurance time, and it decreases isotime fatigue or dyspnea. Pulmonary rehabilitation and oxygen therapy both reduce ventilatory requirements and improve breathing efficiency, thereby reducing hyperinflation and improving exertional dyspnea. Thus, hyperinflation is directly associated with patient-centered outcomes such as dyspnea and exercise limitation. Furthermore, therapeutic interventions — including pharmacotherapy and lung volume — reduction surgery — that reduce hyperinflation improve these outcomes.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, such as formoterol fumarate inhalation solution, as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) for asthma increase the risk of asthma-related events. Formoterol fumarate inhalation solution is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].

6.1 Beta2-Agonist Adverse Reaction Profile

Adverse reactions to formoterol fumarate inhalation solution are expected to be similar in nature to other beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists including: angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, dry mouth, muscle cramps, palpitations, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis.

### Potential diaphragm muscle weakness-related dyspnea persists 2 years after COVID-19 and could Be improved by inspiratory muscle training: results of an observational and an interventional clinical trial [^111j5F2x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

(For further details, see the online supplement.)

Participants completed clinical questionnaires to determine dyspnea on exertion (the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale, the Borg dyspnea scale, and the Clinical Respiratory Questionnaire) and fatigue (the modified Fatigue Severity Index). The Borg dyspnea scale scores were also determined before and after a 6MWT without supplemental oxygen. Exertional dyspnea severity during the 6MWT was classified as mild/none (Borg dyspnea scale score, 0–1), moderate (Borg score, 2–5), or severe (Borg score, 6 or higher).

Whole-body plethysmography was performed according to current guidelines before and after bronchodilation (D CO was determined after bronchodilation only). Arterialized earlobe samples for capillary blood gas analysis were obtained during breathing of room air without supplemental oxygen.

An inspiratory muscle fatigue protocol evaluation was performed. Using the inspiratory muscle trainer device, initial resistance was set at maximum SNIP followed by five breaths through the device to demonstrate a maximal inspiratory effort of 10 on a visual analogue scale (0 = breathing without resistance; 10 = maximum effort). After a 10-minute rest period, resistance was decreased in 10% steps until self-reported effort after five breaths was rated as 4–7 on the VAS. Participants were then asked to breathe continuously through the IMT device until task failure, and twPdi and the diaphragm voluntary activation index (DVAI) were determined every 2 minutes. Surface electrodes were used to continuously obtain electromyographic activity of the left and right diaphragm, the parasternal intercostal muscle, and the sternocleidomastoidous (Figure 2), as described previously.

After another 20-minute rest, diaphragm ultrasound was performed on the right hemidiaphragm and parasternal intercostal ultrasound was performed on the left and right sides (Figure 2), both as previously described. The parasternal intercostal thickening ratio was calculated as thickness at total lung capacity divided by thickness at functional residual capacity (Figure 2).

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac diseases. An urgent need for integrated care [^113d5iUw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health issue with high social and economic costs. Concomitant chronic cardiac disorders are frequent in patients with COPD, likely owing to shared risk factors (e.g., aging, cigarette smoke, inactivity, persistent low-grade pulmonary and systemic inflammation) and add to the overall morbidity and mortality of patients with COPD. The prevalence and incidence of cardiac comorbidities are higher in patients with COPD than in matched control subjects, although estimates of prevalence vary widely. Furthermore, cardiac diseases contribute to disease severity in patients with COPD, being a common cause of hospitalization and a frequent cause of death. The differential diagnosis may be challenging, especially in older and smoking subjects complaining of unspecific symptoms, such as dyspnea and fatigue. The therapeutic management of patients with cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities may be similarly challenging: bronchodilators may have cardiac side effects, and, vice versa, some cardiac medications should be used with caution in patients with lung disease. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence of the relationship between COPD and the three most frequent and important cardiac comorbidities in patients with COPD: ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. We have chosen a practical approach, first summarizing relevant epidemiological and clinical data, then discussing the diagnostic and screening procedures, and finally evaluating the impact of lung-heart comorbidities on the therapeutic management of patients with COPD and heart diseases.

### Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol HFA) [^115bG7xp]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

No human overdosage data has been reported for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol HFA.

Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol HFA contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol HFA. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol HFA together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage.

Fluticasone Propionate

Chronic overdosage of fluticasone propionate may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Salmeterol

The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of salmeterol are those of excessive beta‑adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms of beta-adrenergic stimulation (e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis). Overdosage with salmeterol can lead to clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which can produce ventricular arrhythmias.

As with all inhaled sympathomimetic medicines, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with an overdose of salmeterol.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^113gKKRU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Work/effort sensation in dyspnea — experimental determinants and disease impact — can be produced by external resistive or elastic loads, by volitional hyperpnea, or by weakening the respiratory muscles via operating length changes, fatigue, or partial neuromuscular blockade, and with weakened respiratory muscles the motor command requirement increases and the perception of inspiratory effort and work is substantially magnified even without increased ventilation; breathing discomfort is much greater in patients with cardiopulmonary disease and frequently limits exercise.

### Six-minute walking versus shuttle walking: responsiveness to bronchodilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112AqP43]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The responsiveness of the endurance shuttle walk to functional changes following bronchodilation has recently been reported. The current literature suggests that the 6 min walking test (6MWT) is less responsive to bronchodilation than the endurance shuttle walk.

Aim

To compare bronchodilator-induced changes in exercise performance with the 6MWT and the endurance shuttle walk.

Methods

In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 14 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) 50 (8)% predicted) completed two 6MWTs and two endurance shuttle walks, each preceded by nebulised placebo or 500 microg ipratropium bromide. Cardiorespiratory parameters were monitored during each walking test with a portable telemetric gas analyser. Quadriceps twitch force was measured by magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve before and after each walking test.

Results

The 6 min walking distance did not change significantly after bronchodilation despite a significant increase in FEV(1) of 0.18 (0.09) litres (p < 0.001). A similar change in FEV(1) (0.18 (0.12) litres, p < 0.001) was associated with a significant improvement in the distance walked on the endurance shuttle walk (Deltadistance ipratropium bromide — placebo = 144 (219) m, p = 0.03). Quadriceps muscle fatigue was infrequent (< 15% of patients) after both walking tests.

Conclusion

The endurance shuttle walk is more responsive than the 6MWT for detecting changes in exercise performance following bronchodilation.

### Sick leave in patients with obstructive lung disease is related to psychosocial and work variables rather than to FEV1 [^116FUGSZ]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate associations between sick leave in workers with asthma or COPD and disease-related variables, psychosocial variables, and work characteristics. Hundred and eighty-nine patients with physician-diagnosed asthma (N = 118) or COPD (n = 71) who had paid work in the past 12 months completed questionnaires on sick leave, health complaints, functional limitations, work characteristics and psychosocial issues, and underwent a pulmonary function test (FEV1 and FVC before and after bronchodilation). Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate variables independently associated with high sick leave (i.e. more than twice a year and/or longer than 1 month per episode). Asthma patients, not having an emotionally difficult job, with low job satisfaction, who had changed employers, utilized job control, and who encountered pulmonary aggravating factors at work were found to have a higher incidence of sick leave. COPD patients, who had informed the employer or colleagues about the disease, who did not have difficult tasks at work, who did not hide dyspnea and limitations, and who reported high fatigue were showing higher sick leave. FEV1 and FVC were not associated with sick leave in either group. It was concluded that psychosocial variables, work characteristics, functional limitations, and complaints play a more important role in sick leave in workers with asthma and COPD than FEV1.

### Long acting beta2 agonists for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with poor reversibility: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^116Nvp3a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Quality of life

HRQoL was evaluated in four trials In a salmeterol study a subset of a larger patient group was asked to complete the disease-specific SGRQ and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) at baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment. The SGRQ has three components: distress due to respiratory symptoms, effects of disturbances on mobility and physical activity, and psychosocial impact of the disease; negative changes represent improvement. Data from 283 patients (95 in the placebo group and 94 in each salmeterol group) were analysed; data for others were excluded because of noncompletion of one or both questionnaires at 16 weeks or inability to meet quality control criteria or both. Salmeterol 50 μg (but not 100 μg) twice daily was associated with significantly greater improvement in mean (standard deviation) SGRQ scores from baseline to endpoint than was placebo: -6.8 (13.2) versus -1.4 (11.7) for total score and -8.0 (17.6) versus 0.0 (15.7) for impact score. No significant differences between placebo and either dose of salmeterol were observed in any of the domains of the SF-36 except for "role-emotional": these scores were significantly worse for recipients of salmeterol 100 μg than for recipients of placebo.

In the 52 week study).), health status was assessed with the SGRQ. The adjusted mean score was not statistically different in salmeterol recipients, at 45.2 (95%CI: 44.4 to 46.0) versus placebo recipients, at 46.3 (95%CI: 45.3 to 47.2). In an 8 week study the magnitude of improvement for salmeterol versus placebo recipients rated on an SF-36 scale was significantly greater for the dimensions of "general health" (p = 0.008), "health change" (p = 0.026); physical functioning" (p = 0.008) and "vitality energy and fatigue" (p = 0.008)

In the trial comparing formoterol, ipratropium, and placebo HRQoL was also evaluated with the disease specific SGRQ. Of the 183 patients, 144 completed the assessment; reasons for not doing so were not reported. The changes from baseline to endpoint in total score were negligible in all three groups, at 0.0, -0.5, and 1.5, respectively.

### Evaluation of the effects of olodaterol on exercise endurance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: results from two 6-week crossover studies [^112Hr8E2]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

Patients with moderate to very severe COPD (Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] 2–4) were included in the studies if they met the following inclusion criteria: persistent airway obstruction with post-bronchodilator FEV 1 < 80% of predicted normal and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /forced vital capacity [FVC] < 70%; aged 40–75 years; and with a smoking history of > 10 pack-years. At variance with many COPD exercise endurance trials, the presence of static lung hyperinflation (i.e. increased functional residual capacity [FRC]) was not an entry requirement, since the intention of the study was to evaluate the effects of olodaterol on exercise endurance in a broad patient population. Key exclusion criteria included: a significant disease other than COPD that could influence patients' safety during the study; history of asthma; myocardial infarction in the previous year; unstable or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia; or hospitalisation due to heart failure in the previous year. In addition, patients were not eligible to take part if their exercise performance was limited for a reason other than fatigue or dyspnoea, such as arthritis, angina pectoris, claudication or morbid obesity, or if they had any contraindications to exercise as outlined by the European Respiratory Society Task Force on clinical exercise testing. Patients with a cycling endurance time of ≥ 25 min at pre-randomisation evaluation were also excluded.

### Common symptoms in advanced cancer [^113Xfnre]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The key points of this article are anorexia and cachexia are: A major cause of cancer deaths. Several drugs are available to treat anorexia and cachexia. Dyspnea in cancer usually is caused by several factors. Treatment consists of reversing underlying causes, empiric bronchodilators, cortico-steroids — and in the terminally ill patients-opioids, benzodiazepines, and chlorpromazine. Delirium is associated with advanced cancer. Empiric treatment with neuroleptics while evaluating for reversible causes is a reasonable approach to management. Nausea and vomiting are caused by extra-abdominal factors (drugs, electrolyte abnormalities, central nervous system metastases) or intra-abdominal factors (gastroparesis, ileus, gastric outlet obstruction, bowel obstruction). The pattern of nausea and vomiting differs depending upon whether the cause is extra- or intra-abdominal. Reversible causes should be sought and empiric metoclopramide or haloperidol should be initiated. Fatigue may be caused by anemia, depression, endocrine abnormalities, or electrolyte disturbances that should be treated before using empiric methylphenidate. Constipation should be treated with laxatives and stool softeners. Both should start with the first opioid dose.

### Effect of tiotropium on night-time awakening and daily rescue medication use in patients with COPD [^114syuwM]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Tiotropium is an effective long-acting inhaled bronchodilator with duration of action of more than 24 h; this effect is supported in this study by the observed improvement in morning PEFR. Tiotropium's long duration of action is also supported by its effect on night-time awakening. Although during the baseline period, the likelihood of patients reporting night-time awakenings was similar in both groups, by Week 13 there was a significant reduction in these events in patients treated with tiotropium as compared with placebo (adjusted overall treatment means 0.356 and 0.421, respectively; p < 0.001). This difference achieved statistical significance, but its clinical importance is questionable. However, the data are the mean of scores from many patients whose night-time awakenings were relatively infrequent (see below). The treatment effect was evident in those who had reported night-time awakenings during the run-in period and were experiencing the symptoms of interest when randomized to treatment. The improvement in night-time symptoms in the tiotropium-treated group was paralleled by reduced rescue medication use, which was seen throughout the 24-h day. Although rescue medication use was lowest between midnight and 6 am, there were still significantly fewer doses taken by patients receiving tiotropium compared with those receiving placebo over this time period (significantly fewer for seven out of 13 weeks and for the overall Weeks 1–13 mean). There were also positive effects on health status and overall levels of fatigue from the intervention, but how much of this could be attributed to the decrease in night-time symptoms is hard to assess. Improvements in early morning symptoms have been reported with other bronchodilator combinations and with other long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, although these changes have not always been confirmed when assessed in larger patient groups. Nevertheless, it seems likely that an improvement in lung mechanics overnight will either suppress the production of symptoms or possibly increase the threshold of lung function impairment that needs to be achieved to trigger an awakening. At present there are insufficient data to know which mechanisms are more important. Other studies looking at the effect of tiotropium on awakenings have failed to show an effect, likely due to limitations in study design. This emphasizes the difficulty of applying existing questionnaire methodology where random differences in initial night-time awakenings can occur between treatment groups, as was the case with the Beier et al. study.

### Evaluation of the effects of olodaterol on exercise endurance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: results from two 6-week crossover studies [^111aoDCc]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Caution should be exercised when comparing increases in endurance time across studies due to a number of confounding factors, including differences in patient characteristics and phenotypes. Variation in the improvement in expiratory flow following bronchodilation from one study population to another may contribute to the observed differences in effect size between studies. In light of this, an important methodological difference between our studies and previous exercise trials was that the presence of static lung hyperinflation was not a prerequisite for participation in our trials. Also at variance with previous trials, patients with post-bronchodilator FEV 1 ≤ 80% predicted were permitted in our trials, including a larger proportion of GOLD 2 patients (69% of the total patient population). Although olodaterol also enhanced exercise capacity in these patients, the inclusion of patients with milder COPD may have mitigated the observed effect sizes of the study medication on exercise capacity to some extent.

The multifactorial nature of exercise limitation in patients with COPD may also contribute to the variability in exercise response to bronchodilators from one study to another. This phenomenon is illustrated by the results of replicate studies with tiotropium, in which similar lung-function improvements resulted in notable differences in the magnitude of improvement in endurance time, varying from 21% in the first study to 40% in the second study.

An unexpected finding in the present studies was the reduction in endurance time in the placebo group after 6 weeks of treatment, compared to pre-randomisation baseline, which has not been observed in previous studies. Whether this was a reflection of a time-dependent decrease in exercise capacity over the 23-week observation period or a deterioration related to the lack of optimal bronchodilation in the placebo group is difficult to ascertain because only a single, pre-randomisation baseline exercise test was included to limit the burden on study participants. However, the concomitant reduction in IC that was also observed prior to exercise in the placebo group would argue for the latter explanation. A reduction in post-treatment exercise endurance, compared to pre-randomisation baseline, was also observed in the placebo groups of two recently completed, replicate, 6-week, crossover trials of similar design (NCT01533922 and NCT01533935; manuscript in preparation), while in a 12-week, parallel-group, exercise study, exercise endurance time in the placebo group was reduced after 6 weeks, but increased after 12 weeks, compared to baseline (NCT01525615; manuscript in preparation).

### Effects of training and albuterol on pain and fatigue in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy [^111PkE9M]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

We recently reported a randomised controlled trial on the efficacy of strength training and the beta2-adrenergic agonist albuterol in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Strength training and albuterol appeared safe interventions with limited positive effect on muscle strength and volume. We concurrently explored the prevalence and the characteristics of pain and fatigue in the participating FSHD patients, because these are probably underreported but clinically relevant symptoms in this disorder. Next, we studied the effects of albuterol and strength training on pain, experienced fatigue, health-related functional status and psychological distress.

Methods

Sixty-five patients were randomised to strength training of elbow flexors and ankle dorsiflexors or non-training. After 26 weeks, albuterol (sustained-release, 8 mg bid) was added in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Outcomes comprised self-reported pain, experienced fatigue, functional status and psychological distress obtained with validated questionnaires at 52 weeks.

Results

Eighty percent of patients reported chronic persistent or periodic, multifocal pains. Thirty-four percent of the participants were severely fatigued. Strength training and albuterol failed to have a significant effect on all outcomes.

Conclusions

Pain and fatigue are important features in FSHD. Strength training and albuterol do not have a positive or negative effect on pain, experienced fatigue, functional status and psychological distress.

5.10 Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms

As with other inhaled medicines, Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol HFA can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol HFA, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol HFA should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted. Upper airway symptoms of laryngeal spasm, irritation, or swelling, such as stridor and choking, have been reported in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol HFA.

5.11 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol HFA [see Contraindications (4)].

5.12 Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects

Excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation has been associated with seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia [see Overdosage (10)]. Therefore, Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol HFA, like all products containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.

Salmeterol, a component of Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol HFA, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of salmeterol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.

5.7 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy

Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Suppression/Adrenal Insufficiency

Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.

Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although BREO ELLIPTA may control COPD or asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.

During periods of stress, a severe COPD exacerbation, or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their healthcare practitioner for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress, a severe COPD exacerbation, or a severe asthma attack.

Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to BREO ELLIPTA. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with BREO ELLIPTA. Lung function (FEV1or peak expiratory flow), beta-agonist use, and COPD or asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.

Unmasking of Allergic Conditions Previously Suppressed by Systemic Corticosteroids

Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to BREO ELLIPTA may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).

Corticosteroid Withdrawal Symptoms

During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.

### Respiratory disease mortality in the United Kingdom compared with EU15 + countries in 1985–2015: observational study [^113w9jJn]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Patient involvement

To better understand the direct implications of this work on patient knowledge and experience across health systems, we presented our findings to patients with a variety of chronic lung conditions from countries used in this investigation. Specifically, we circulated the results of the current investigation to a total of six patients among the network of the European Federation of Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients Associations and the European Lung Foundation: three with Bronchiectasis (two from the UK, one from the Netherlands), two with Asthma (one from the UK, one from the Netherlands), as well as one with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (from Ireland). Patients were asked to comment on the potential implications of this research as well as areas of focus for future research. Patients responded to four questions: all questions were equal to every patient although everyone responded according to their experience, their national healthcare system, and their disease. Responses from patients are summarised as a general answer (non-disease specific) in box 1.

Box 1
Patient perspectives on chronic lung diseases, possible explanations for the results of the current investigation, and areas of interest for future research work

There is wide agreement from patients around the fact that early and correct diagnosis is vital. However, education and awareness is paramount to ensuring adequate management of chronic lung diseases as it will ensure the access to a proper treatment plan and will allow patients to adapt to a healthier lifestyle (eg, quitting smoking, improving physical activities, and avoiding environmental triggers).
Possible explanations for the differences in reported outcomes from these conditions across health systems may include different health behaviours and patient adherence to treatments rather than the medical issues themselves. Poor adherence can have many reasons: for example, side effects of medicines, forgetfulness or lack of motivation, or even opposition against a rigid treatment regimen. Adherence to treatment can be improved through awareness and health literacy; support from family, friends, and patient groups; access to specialised nurses and respiratory physiotherapists; better drugs and devices; digital health; and involving expertise in the areas of adding behaviour, learning styles, stages of change, influencing factors, and self efficacy.
Research priorities should include searching for the mechanisms underlying of lung diseases and how to repair damaged lungs as well as developing personalised medicines and new curative treatments. Other priorities include: identification of subtypes of disease, assessing the effectiveness of patients and healthcare proxy communication, avoiding exacerbations and preventing fatigue, research on microbiome and better oxygen delivery systems, as well as improving adherence, promoting patient centeredness and health literacy, especially on environmental triggers.

### Stratification of COPD patients towards personalized medicine: reproduction and formation of clusters [^117NqV8L]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We performed three independent cluster analyses of COPD patient characteristics. In the first analysis, we aimed to identify clusters that corresponded with the ABCD groups. Secondly, we investigated the reproducibility of Burgel's clusters in our study population. Thirdly, we added six new variables, QOL, fatigue, satisfaction relationship, air trapping and steps per day and activities of daily living to the parameter of the second analysis.

Setting and participants

Data were part of a registry study of patients with asthma and COPD, who were newly referred to the Franciscus Gasthuis and Vlietland Hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, a center of excellence for asthma and COPD. All referred COPD patients (n = 155) who completed a previously published comprehensive assessment during the period December 2012 till December 2017 were included. The diagnosis of COPD was based on an assessment by a pulmonologist and confirmed by spirometry (FEV1 / forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.7). In this study, we used pseudonymized assessment data. Ethics approval for this study was waived by the Institutional Research Board of the Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, because routinely collected health care data were used after pseudonymization.

Data collection

The following variables were collected for all patients:

Lung function. FEV 1, FVC, and static and dynamic hyperinflation were performed according to the ATS/ ERS taskforce "standardization of spirometry". Values for post-bronchodilation dynamic hyperinflation were measured by metronome-paced tachypnea after bronchodilation (400 µg of inhaled salbutamol). Lower levels of air trapping (dynamic hyperinflation after bronchodilation measured in liters decreasing inspiratory capacity) reflect poor outcome. All tests were performed with the Vmax Sensor Medics Viasys, type 6200 Encore.

Pack years. A pack year is defined as twenty cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year.

Body mass index (BMI): BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, expressed in units kg/m 2.

Fig. 1
Study design schematic

Pre- and 2-h post-dose at the start and end (i.e. after 3 weeks) of each treatment period, patients undertook plethysmography and spirometry assessments. Plethysmography parameters included residual volume (RV), total lung capacity (TLC), RV/TLC ratio, and functional residual capacity (FRC). Spirometry, assessed with standardised spirometry equipment and a central reading service, comprised slow inspiratory manoeuvres to assess resting inspiratory capacity (IC), followed by forced manoeuvres to assess FEV 1 and forced vital capacity (FVC). Pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period and post-dose after 3 weeks (in both cases after forced spirometry), patients completed a constant work-rate cycle ergometry test (at 80% of the W max of the incremental exercise test), during which dyspnoea and muscle fatigue were assessed using a modified Borg scale, and IC was measured (prior to initiation, every 2 min during loaded pedalling, and at the end of exercise). Inhaled salbutamol was permitted as rescue medication throughout the study (including during the run-in and washout periods) but not within 6 h prior to any spirometry or cycle ergometry assessment; patients recorded this rescue medication use daily.

All patients provided written informed consent prior to any study-related procedure. The study was approved by the independent ethics committees at each institution (listed in the supplement), and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and Good Clinical Practice. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05097014, registered 27th October 2021). The protocol was amended three times; none of the amendments were substantial or impacted recruitment.

### Effect of tiotropium on night-time awakening and daily rescue medication use in patients with COPD [^115RqnEV]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Several small studies found night-time awakenings due to COPD symptoms were associated with decreased health status. In this study, night-time awakenings in patients with COPD were examined and effects of tiotropium therapy evaluated.

Methods

This study was a post hoc, exploratory, pooled analysis of twin, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials. Patients with stable moderate-to-severe COPD were randomized to tiotropium HandiHaler® (n = 550) or placebo (n = 371) and followed for 13 weeks. During a 2-week, pre-treatment baseline period and for 13 weeks on treatment, self-reported night-time awakenings due to COPD symptoms, rescue medication (albuterol) use, and morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were recorded daily. Nightly, COPD-related awakenings were scored: 0 = no awakenings; 1 = 1 awakening; 2 = 2–3 awakenings; or 3 = awake most of the night. Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and energy–fatigue questionnaires were completed at baseline and during treatment.

Results

Patients were aged 65.2 ± 8.7 years (mean ± SD), with a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 of 36.1 ± 13.5% predicted normal at baseline. Data for night-time awakenings and albuterol use were available for 543 (99%) patients on tiotropium and 352 (95%) on placebo. At baseline, 280 (51.5%) patients on tiotropium and 179 (50.1%) on placebo reported ≥ 1 COPD-related night-time awakening per week. Over the 13-weeks' treatment, tiotropium was associated with fewer night-time awakenings, with mean ± SE overall awakening scores per week of 0.356 ± 0.006 compared with 0.421 ± 0.007 for placebo (p < 0.001); means were significantly lower for tiotropium versus placebo in patients with baseline awakenings (p < 0.001), but not for those without baseline awakenings. COPD-related night-time awakenings were associated with increased nocturnal rescue medication use and lower HRQoL ratings in both treatment arms. Following start of treatment, tiotropium decreased patients' use of rescue medication compared with placebo, and morning and evening adjusted means for PEFR were higher for tiotropium compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Tiotropium is associated with decreased COPD-related night-time awakenings. Night-time awakenings are associated with increased nocturnal rescue medication use and may be a surrogate marker of symptom control in patients with COPD.

### Zafirlukast (Accolate) [^111ysK9T]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Information for Patients:

Patients should be told that a rare side effect of ACCOLATE is hepatic dysfunction, and to contact their physician immediately if they experience symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, and anorexia). Liver failure resulting in liver transplantation and death has occurred in patients taking zafirlukast (see WARNINGS, Hepatotoxicity and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

ACCOLATE is indicated for the chronic treatment of asthma and should be taken regularly as prescribed, even during symptom-free periods. ACCOLATE is not a bronchodilator and should not be used to treat acute episodes of asthma. Patients receiving ACCOLATE should be instructed not to decrease the dose or stop taking any other antiasthma medications unless instructed by a physician. Patients should be instructed to notify their physician if neuropsychiatric events occur while using ACCOLATE (see PRECAUTIONS, Neuropsychiatric Events). Women who are breast-feeding should be instructed not to take ACCOLATE (see PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers). Alternative antiasthma medication should be considered in such patients.

The bioavailability of ACCOLATE may be decreased when taken with food. Patients should be instructed to take ACCOLATE at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.

### Effect of salbutamol on neuromuscular function in endurance athletes [^111CxurF]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The potential ergogenic effects of therapeutic inhaled salbutamol doses in endurance athletes have been controversially discussed for decades. We hypothesized that salbutamol inhalation may increase peripheral muscle contractility, reduce fatigability, and improve force recovery after a localized exercise in endurance athletes.

Methods

Eleven healthy, nonasthmatic male athletes with high aerobic capacities were recruited to be compared in a double-blinded, randomized crossover study of two dose levels of salbutamol (200 and 800 μg) and a placebo administered by inhalation before a quadriceps fatigue test. Subjects performed an incremental exercise protocol consisting in sets of 10 intermittent isometric contractions starting at 20% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) with 10% MVC increment until exhaustion. Femoral nerve magnetic stimulation was used during and after MVC to evaluate neuromuscular fatigue after each set, at task failure, and after 10 and 30 min of recovery.

Results

Initial MVC and evoked muscular responses were not modified with salbutamol (P > 0.05). The total number of submaximal contractions until task failure significantly differed between treatments (placebo, 72 ± 7; 200 µg, 78 ± 8; and 800 µg, 82 ± 7; P < 0.01). MVC and evoked muscular responses were similarly reduced with all treatments during the fatiguing task (all P > 0.05). Voluntary activation was unaffected by the fatiguing task and treatments (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

Supratherapeutic inhaled doses of β2-agonists increased quadriceps endurance during an incremental and localized fatiguing task in healthy endurance-trained athletes without significant effect on neuromuscular fatigue. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms.

### Improving physical activity in COPD: towards a new paradigm [^112kWiYC]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating disease affecting patients in daily life, both physically and emotionally. Symptoms such as dyspnea and muscle fatigue, lead to exercise intolerance, which, together with behavioral issues, trigger physical inactivity, a key feature of COPD. Physical inactivity is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Increasing activity levels is crucial for effective management strategies and could lead to improved long-term outcomes. In this review we summarize objective and subjective instruments for evaluating physical activity and focus on interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation or bronchodilators aimed at increasing activity levels. To date, only limited evidence exists to support the effectiveness of these interventions. We suggest that a multimodal approach comprising pulmonary rehabilitation, pharmacotherapy, and counselling programs aimed at addressing emotional and behavioural aspects of COPD may be an effective way to increase physical activity and improve health status in the long term.

### Optimizing bronchodilation in the prevention of COPD exacerbations [^111Ma78F]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Single bronchodilation versus placebo in the prevention of exacerbations

The two main classes of bronchodilators are β 2 -agonists and muscarinic receptor antagonists. Both classes of bronchodilators improve patients' ability to breathe by relaxing airway smooth muscle, thereby reducing respiratory muscle activity and dynamic hyperinflation, and improving ventilatory mechanics. Exacerbations are mainly triggered by infections associated with small airway inflammation, however environmental conditions, such as pollution, may also initiate or amplify these events. The mechanisms by which bronchodilators prevent exacerbations are unclear, yet are thought to include decreased hyperinflation and mechanical stress, decreased mucus production and enhanced mucociliary clearance, the improvement of symptom severity and fluctuation, and potential anti-inflammatory properties. Compared with placebo, the use of tiotropium 18 μg once daily (q.d.) was associated with sustained reductions in lung hyperinflation and inspiratory capacity both at rest and during exercise, contributing to improvements in exertional dyspnea and increased exercise endurance in patients with COPD. Treatment with formoterol 12 μg twice daily (b.i.d.) significantly enhanced mucus clearance compared with tiotropium 18 μg q.d. in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD. AUGMENT demonstrated that treatment with both formoterol 12 μg b.i.d. and aclidinium 400 μg b.i.d. significantly improved dyspnea and health status compared with placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Compared with formoterol 12 μg b.i.d. tiotropium 18 μg q.d. demonstrated a superior anti-inflammatory activity profile, significantly reducing the production of superoxide and pro-inflammatory mediators in COPD patients.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, such as formoterol fumarate inhalation solution, as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) for asthma increase the risk of asthma-related events. Formoterol fumarate inhalation solution is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].

6.1 Beta2-Agonist Adverse Reaction Profile

Adverse reactions to formoterol fumarate inhalation solution are expected to be similar in nature to other beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists including: angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, dry mouth, muscle cramps, palpitations, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis.

### Mometasone furoate (Asmanex) [^114GfWUC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older: The safety results of the 10 trials that were 8 to 12 weeks in duration were pooled because patients with asthma in these studies were previously maintained on bronchodilators and/or inhaled corticosteroids. The safety results of the one 12-week clinical trial in patients with asthma previously treated with oral corticosteroids are presented separately.

In the pooled 8- to 12-week clinical trials, adverse reactions were reported in 70% of patients treated with ASMANEX TWISTHALER (n = 1750) compared to 65% of patients taking placebo (n = 720). Table 2 displays the common adverse reactions (≥ 3% in any patient group receiving ASMANEX TWISTHALER) that occurred more frequently in patients treated with ASMANEX TWISTHALER compared to patients treated with placebo.

The following other adverse reactions occurred in these clinical trials with an incidence of at least 1% but less than 3% and were more common on ASMANEX TWISTHALER therapy than on placebo:

Body as a Whole: fatigue, flu-like symptoms, pain

Gastrointestinal: gastroenteritis, vomiting, anorexia

Hearing, Vestibular: earache

Resistance Mechanism: infection

Respiratory: dysphonia, epistaxis, nasal irritation, respiratory disorder, throat dry

In the 12-week trial in adult asthmatics who previously required oral corticosteroids, the effects of ASMANEX TWISTHALER therapy administered as two 220-mcg inhalations twice daily (n = 46) were compared with those of placebo (n = 43). Adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, reported in more than 3 patients in the ASMANEX TWISTHALER treatment group, and which occurred more frequently than in placebo were (ASMANEX TWISTHALER % vs. placebo %): musculoskeletal pain (22% vs. 14%), oral candidiasis (22% vs. 9%), sinusitis (22% vs. 19%), allergic rhinitis (20% vs. 5%), upper respiratory infection (15% vs. 14%), arthralgia (13% vs. 7%), fatigue (13% vs. 2%), depression (11% vs. 0%), and sinus congestion (9% vs. 0%). In considering these data, an increased duration of exposure for patients on ASMANEX TWISTHALER treatment (77 days vs. 58 days on placebo) should be taken into account.

5.7 Transferring Patients From Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy

Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.

Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although BREYNA may provide control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.

During periods of stress, a severe asthma attack or a severe COPD exacerbation, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress, a severe asthma attack, or a severe COPD exacerbation.

Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to BREYNA. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with BREYNA. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] or morning peak expiratory flow [PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma or COPD symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.

Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to inhaled corticosteroids or BREYNA may unmask conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). Some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.

### Actions of β ₂-adrenoceptor agonist drug on neuromuscular function after fatigue [^115HbraV]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The effects of β2-agonists on human skeletal muscle contractile function are unclear, more particularly in the presence of fatigue. Moreover, it remains to be ascertained whether central motor drive during voluntary contractions could counter for eventual contractile alterations induced by β2-agonists. This study explored central and peripheral neuromuscular adjustments of the quadriceps induced by β2-agonist terbutaline after fatiguing exercise.

Methods

On 2 d, nine men performed 120 intermittent (5-s contraction/5-s relaxation) submaximal (50% maximal voluntary contraction [MVC]) voluntary contractions, 2 h after having ingested a terbutaline (8 mg) or placebo capsule, in a double-blind randomized order. The isometric knee extension peak torque of single twitch and tetanic (10 and 100 Hz) contractions and of MVC was recorded before (PRE) and after (POST) the fatiguing exercise. Twitch maximal rate of torque relaxation (-dT/dt) was also calculated. Central motor drive was estimated via quadriceps electromyogram recorded during the submaximal voluntary contractions.

Results

In PRE and POST conditions, MVC and twitch peak torque were not modified by terbutaline. PRE twitch -dT/dt was 22% higher in terbutaline compared with placebo (P < 0.005), but it did not differ significantly between treatments at POST. The evoked torque of 10- and 100-Hz tetanus were significantly lower in terbutaline compared with placebo, regardless of time (-16% and -17% respectively, P < 0.05). Central motor drive during voluntary exercise did not differ between treatments.

Conclusions

These results demonstrate that terbutaline affected the contractile function of the quadriceps muscle during electrically evoked contractions both before and after fatiguing exercise. However, this did not impair the maximal voluntary force-generating capacity of the knee extensors and did not result in any compensatory adjustments of the central nervous system.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: diagnosis and management [^112YD3HW]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction describes the narrowing of the airway that occurs with exercise. More than 10 percent of the general population and up to 90 percent of persons previously diagnosed with asthma have exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Common symptoms include coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness with exercise; however, many athletes will present with nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue and impaired performance. Spirometry should be performed initially to evaluate for underlying chronic asthma, although results are often normal. An empiric trial of short-acting beta₂ agonists or additional bronchial provocation testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Nonpharmacologic treatment options include avoiding known triggers, choosing sports with low minute ventilation, warming up before exercising, and wearing a heat exchange mask in cold weather. Short-acting beta₂ agonists are recommended first-line agents for pharmacologic treatment, although leukotriene receptor antagonists or inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting beta₂ agonists may be needed in refractory cases. If symptoms persist despite treatment, alternative diagnoses such as cardiac or other pulmonary etiologies, vocal cord dysfunction, or anxiety should be considered.

### The reversibility of increased airways resistance in chronic heart failure measured by impulse oscillometry [^113vw5yj]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic heart failure complain of breathlessness and fatigue on exercise. Airways resistance is increased and lung compliance is reduced in chronic heart failure patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether the pulmonary abnormalities are reversible and whether any improvements lead to changes to exercise capacity or symptoms.

Methods

Twelve patients with stable chronic heart failure and 10 matched controls underwent repeated assessment of airways resistance using impulse oscillometry and peak exercise testing with metabolic gas exchange after receiving nebulized saline as placebo or combined salbutamol and ipratropium bromide in a double-blind crossover randomized fashion.

Results

Patients had lower peak oxygen consumption and a steeper slope relating ventilation to carbon dioxide production than controls. Bronchodilators reduced peripheral airways resistance in patients (0.53 versus 0.38, P < .02) and controls (0.21 versus 0.19, P < .005) and increased measures of compliance in both groups. There was no effect on the peak oxygen consumption, exercise time, ventilation to carbon dioxide slope, or anaerobic threshold. There was an increase in peak tidal volume (VT) in both groups but this did not lead to an increase in peak ventilation. The slope relating symptoms to ventilation (ie, Borg/VE) was significantly reduced in the patients after bronchodilators (17% ± 8%, P < .05). The relationship between the improvement in VT and reduction in gradient of the Borg/VE slope was significant (r = .40, P < .05).

Conclusions

Nebulized bronchodilators improve airways resistance, lung reactance, and peak tidal volume during exercise in chronic heart failure but do not increase peak exercise capacity. They do, however, reduce the symptom of breathlessness.

### Clinical review: severe asthma [^116dSvRn]. Critical Care (2002). Low credibility.

Severe asthma, although difficult to define, includes all cases of difficult/therapy-resistant disease of all age groups and bears the largest part of morbidity and mortality from asthma. Acute, severe asthma, status asthmaticus, is the more or less rapid but severe asthmatic exacerbation that may not respond to the usual medical treatment. The narrowing of airways causes ventilation perfusion imbalance, lung hyperinflation, and increased work of breathing that may lead to ventilatory muscle fatigue and life-threatening respiratory failure. Treatment for acute, severe asthma includes the administration of oxygen, beta2-agonists (by continuous or repetitive nebulisation), and systemic corticosteroids. Subcutaneous administration of epinephrine or terbutaline should be considered in patients not responding adequately to continuous nebulisation, in those unable to cooperate, and in intubated patients not responding to inhaled therapy. The exact time to intubate a patient in status asthmaticus is based mainly on clinical judgment, but intubation should not be delayed once it is deemed necessary. Mechanical ventilation in status asthmaticus supports gas-exchange and unloads ventilatory muscles until aggressive medical treatment improves the functional status of the patient. Patients intubated and mechanically ventilated should be appropriately sedated, but paralytic agents should be avoided. Permissive hypercapnia, increase in expiratory time, and promotion of patient-ventilator synchronism are the mainstay in mechanical ventilation of status asthmaticus. Close monitoring of the patient's condition is necessary to obviate complications and to identify the appropriate time for weaning. Finally, after successful treatment and prior to discharge, a careful strategy for prevention of subsequent asthma attacks is imperative.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: update on limb muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111U9PJg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exercise intolerance and leg fatigue are characterized by the following on-page findings: a significant portion stops exercise because of leg fatigue, and the impact of leg fatigue on the exercise response to acute bronchodilation was evaluated; in that study, bronchodilation with ipratropium bromide did not enhance exercise tolerance in patients who developed contractile fatigue after cycling exercise as it did in those without contractile leg fatigue. Lower capacity for muscle aerobic metabolism may influence exercise tolerance; increased lactic acidosis for a given work rate increases ventilatory needs by increasing nonaerobic carbon dioxide production and may be exacerbated by a tendency to retain carbon dioxide during exercise. Perturbation in muscle energy metabolism is another potential contributor, and direct biopsy measurements after constant work rate exercise (at 80% peak work rate) showed accumulation of muscle lactate, degradation of muscle PCr, and loss of muscle ATP in COPD, with similar magnitude to healthy control subjects but occurring at substantially lower absolute exercise work rates; this observation was replicated using plasma ammonemia as a surrogate for adenine nucleotide loss.

5.3	Infusion-Related Reactions

GAZYVA can cause severe and life-threatening infusion-related reactions (IRRs). Sixty-five percent of patients with CLL experienced a reaction to the first 1,000 mg of GAZYVA infused. Thirty-seven percent of patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and 60% of patients with previously untreated NHL experienced a reaction on Day 1 of GAZYVA infusion. IRRs have occurred within 24 hours of receiving GAZYVA. IRRs can also occur with subsequent infusions. Symptoms may include hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, and respiratory symptoms (e.g., bronchospasm, larynx and throat irritation, wheezing, laryngeal edema). The most frequently reported symptoms include nausea, fatigue, chest discomfort, dyspnea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, hypertension, hypotension, flushing, headache, pyrexia, and chills [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Premedicate patients with acetaminophen, anti-histamine, and a glucocorticoid [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Closely monitor patients during the entire infusion. Reduce infusion rate, interrupt infusion or permanently discontinue GAZYVA for IRRs based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Institute medical management (e.g., glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, and/or oxygen) for IRRs as needed.

For patients with preexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions, monitor more frequently throughout the infusion and the post-infusion period since they may be at greater risk of experiencing more severe reactions. Hypotension may occur as part of the IRR to GAZYVA. Consider withholding antihypertensive treatments for 12 hours prior to, during each GAZYVA infusion, and for the first hour after administration until blood pressure is stable. For patients at increased risk of hypertensive crisis, consider the benefits versus the risks of withholding their antihypertensive medication as is suggested here.

At visit 3, both R5-R20 greater than 0.07 kPa/(L/s) and AX greater than 0.44 kPa/L showed significant associations with dyspnea after adjusting for age, sex, severity of infection, history of smoking, and BMI (aOR for R5-R20: 12.84, 95% CI: 1.31–125.71, p = 0.028; aOR for AX: 7.60, 95% CI: 1.14–50.48, p = 0.036) (Fig. 4 A, C). Furthermore, older age was also significantly associated with dyspnea, but lung function parameters or EIH did not predict the development of dyspnea. Detailed analysis of clinical variables associated with dyspnea and fatigue using logistic regression is presented in Supplementary Tables C1 – C4. 22% (14/64) patients received bronchodilator treatment during the cohort study. We categorized PASC patients into those with and without the usage of bronchodilators and compared pulmonary function, IOS parameters, and symptoms between visits. Improvement in FEV1%pred and FEV1/FVC was observed in both groups. However, IOS parameters, the percentage of abnormality of IOS parameters, or dyspnea did not improve in either group (see supplement Table D). Univariable logistic regression analyses were further employed to assess the associations between long COVID dyspnea and fatigue, and the usage of bronchodilators. The insignificant result indicated that the usage of bronchodilators does not impact long COVID dyspnea and fatigue (details are provided in supplement Table C1–4).

5.7 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy

HPA Suppression/Adrenal Insufficiency

Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.

Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although BREZTRI AEROSPHERE may provide control of COPD symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does not provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.

During periods of stress, or a severe COPD exacerbation, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their healthcare practitioner for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress, or a severe COPD exacerbation.

Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to BREZTRI AEROSPHERE. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE. Lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] or morning peak expiratory flow [PEF]), beta-agonist use, and COPD symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.

Unmasking of Allergic Conditions Previously Suppressed by Systemic Corticosteroids

Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to BREZTRI AEROSPHERE may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).

Corticosteroid Withdrawal Symptoms

During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.

### GP consultation rates for sequelae after acute COVID-19 in patients managed in the community or hospital in the UK: population based study [^113yuxBR]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

We found that patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital and those managed in the community had higher GP consultation rates for most symptoms and diseases, received more prescriptions, and were more likely to use healthcare resources after covid-19 than in the 12 months before infection, although the rates in the two groups differed. For example, although the rates for primary care consultations for symptoms such as fatigue, breathlessness, and palpitations were similar between the two groups, patients in the community were more likely to consult their GP because of loss of taste and smell and muscle pain; patients admitted to hospital were more likely to report ongoing problems related to nausea and delirium.

Although healthcare use increased in both groups after covid-19 relative to levels before the pandemic, the increase was higher in patients admitted to hospital for all types of healthcare use. Nevertheless, healthcare use in the group managed in the community increased by 18% after covid-19 compared with levels before the pandemic, highlighting the need for adequate ongoing provision of care for this population. We also found that some outcomes improved after vaccination in the cohort managed in the community, giving hope that with time and increased vaccination rates most sequelae will resolve. We also saw a decrease over time in drug prescriptions, in particular for bronchodilators. Whether fewer prescriptions was a consequence of lack of improvement in symptoms with bronchodilators or increased recognition of dysfunctional breathing after covid-19 needs further investigation.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) limb muscle fatigue during activity and training — studies highlight the potential contribution of distal limb muscle fatigue in daily physical activities in patients with COPD, and report that lower limb muscle electrical activity behaved similarly to healthy controls despite a markedly lower walking distance during a 6-minute walk; moreover, the occurrence of muscle fatigue may also modulate the response to exercise training programs, with patients with COPD developing quadriceps fatigue during exercise training having larger training effects compared with those who did not fatigue during the same session, and other likely consequences of muscle atrophy and poor limb muscle function in COPD include reduction in quality of life and greater use of health care resources.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) — β2-agonists and tolerance: Summary Statement 20 states, "Be cautious in daily use of β2-adrenergic agents alone or in combination with ICSs because this can lead to tolerance". [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Evidence: A]. Prolonged duration of a bronchoprotective effect "for as long as 12 hours" has been shown after the first dose in β2-agonist–naive patients, but "the optimal dosing interval for bronchoprotection for EIB might be closer to 6 hours on average", and "β2-agonist sensitivity can recover within 72 hours after the last dose of β2-agonist". Tolerance "might not develop when β-agonist use is limited to an interval of 48 to 72 hours", yet it can be manifested by "a decrease in the effectiveness of SABAs and by a shortening of duration of LABA effects, with one study demonstrating this in less than 3 hours". Use of LABAs as daily monotherapy "is not recommended", whereas "LABAs alone used intermittently, up to 3 times a week, do not appear to be associated with tolerance and can be prescribed for EIB".

### Hypercapnia: what is the limit in paediatric patients? A case of near-fatal asthma successfully treated by multipharmacological approach [^111QGKVX]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

We describe a case of prolonged severe hypercapnia with respiratory acidosis occurring during an episode of near-fatal asthma in an 8-year-old boy, followed by complete recovery. After admission to the intensive care unit, despite treatment with maximal conventional bronchodilatative therapy, the clinical picture deteriorated with evident signs of respiratory muscle fatigue. The child was sedated, intubated and mechanically ventilated. Magnesium sulphate, ketamine and sevoflurane were gradually introduced together with deep sedation, curarization and continuous bronchodilatative therapy. Ten hours after admission, arterial pCO2 reached 39 kPa (293 mmHg), pH was 6.77 and pO2 8.6 kPa (65 mmHg). Chest radiograph showed severe neck subcutaneous emphysema, with signs of mediastinal emphysema. No episode of haemodynamic instability was seen despite severe prolonged hypercapnia lasting more than 14 h. Oxygenation was maintained and successful recovery followed without neurological or cardiovascular sequelae. This case shows the cardiovascular and neurological tolerance of a prolonged period of supercarbia in a paediatric patient. The most important lesson to be learned is the extreme importance of maintaining adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation during an asthma attack. The second lesson is that when conventional bronchodilators fail, the intensivist may resort to the use of drugs such as ketamine, magnesium sulphate and inhalation anaesthesia. In this context deep sedation and curarization are important not only to improve oxygenation, but also to reduce cerebral metabolic requirements.

### Albuterol sulfate (albuterol sulate) [^113YbFA5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of albuterol are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms of beta-adrenergic stimulation (e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis).

As with all inhaled sympathomimetic medicines, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with an overdose of Albuterol Sulfate HFA Inhalation Aerosol.

Treatment consists of discontinuation of Albuterol Sulfate HFA together with appropriate symptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of Albuterol Sulfate HFA.

### Effects of acute salbutamol inhalation on quadriceps force and fatigability [^111Fb4DX]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Oral beta2-agonist administration improves muscle function in persons without asthma. We performed a double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover study to assess whether acute inhaled salbutamol administration improves muscle strength and fatigability in healthy moderately trained subjects.

Methods

Quadriceps muscle strength was measured during maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and femoral nerve magnetic stimulation (potentiated single twitch, TwQpeak) before and after (i) a maximal incremental cycling test (n = 10) and (ii) 50 maximal isometric one-leg extensions (n = 9). Each exercise test was performed on three occasions, after salbutamol (200 and 800 microg) or placebo inhalation.

Results

Before exercise, treatments had no significant effect on MVC [(placebo) 597 ± 146 N vs (200 microg) 629 ± 151 N vs (800 microg) 610 ± 148 N] and TwQpeak [(placebo) 215 ± 83 N vs (200 microg) 227 ± 69 N vs (800 microg) 250 ± 84 N]. Maximal power during cycling and maximal force during leg extensions did not differ between treatments. Treatments had no effect on MVC and TwQpeak reductions at 30 min [MVC: (placebo) -8 ± 9% vs (200 microg) -9 ± 7% vs (800 microg) -8 ± 5%; TwQpeak: (placebo) -29 ± 13% vs (200 microg) -23 ± 15% vs (800 microg) -20 ± 8%] and 60 min [MVC: (placebo) -12 ± 17% vs (200 microg) -6 ± 9% vs (800 microg) -8 ± 8%; TwQpeak: (placebo) -20 ± 21% vs (200 microg) -19 ± 23% vs (800 microg) -8 ± 7%] after cycling. Similarly, reductions in MVC and TwQpeak were not significantly different between treatments at 30 [MVC: (placebo) -11 ± 9% vs (200 microg) -12 ± 7% vs (800 microg) -8 ± 16%; TwQpeak: (placebo) -37 ± 12% vs (200 microg) -33 ± 20% vs (800 microg) -32 ± 16%] and 60 min [MVC: (placebo) -10 ± 11% vs (200microg) -11 ± 6% vs (800 microg) -8 ± 20%; TwQpeak: (placebo) -30 ± 11% vs (200 microg) -28 ± 24% vs (800 microg) -27 ± 15%] after leg extensions. Treatments did not modify maximal voluntary activation at any time of the protocol.

Conclusion

Acute therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of inhaled salbutamol have no effect on quadriceps strength, fatigue, and recovery in men without asthma.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^112aaXZo]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Bronchodilators in COPD — mechanism, effects, dose–response, and use: "Bronchodilators are medications that increase FEV1 and/or change other spirometric variables" and "act by altering airway smooth muscle tone", with improvements in expiratory flow reflecting "widening of the airways rather than changes in lung elastic recoil". They "tend to reduce dynamic hyperinflation at rest and during exercise, and improve exercise performance", though "The extent of these changes, especially in patients with severe and very severe COPD, is not easy to predict from the improvement in FEV1 measured at rest". Dose–response curves are "relatively flat with all classes of bronchodilators", and increasing the dose of "either a beta2-agonist or an anticholinergic by an order of magnitude, especially when given by a nebulizer, appears to provide subjective benefit in acute episodes" but "is not necessarily helpful in stable disease". In practice, these medications are "most often given on a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms"; toxicity "is also dose-related", and "Use of short acting bronchodilators on a regular basis is not generally recommended".

ICU Stay Routine Follow-Up

The severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome on the day of intubation was determined using the Berlin Definition. Laboratory parameters, arterial blood gas analysis, and ventilation variables, including the P 2 /F O 2 ratio, were extracted from medical records. At follow-up approximately 15 months later, patients underwent pulmonary function testing, ECG, and transthoracic echocardiography. Serum, plasma, and whole blood samples were obtained and analyzed.

With support from a trained study team, patients answered clinical questionnaires to determine dyspnea (Medical Research Council dyspnea scale, Borg dyspnea scale) and fatigue (modified Fatigue Severity Index). Whole-body plethysmography (MasterLab, Viasys) was performed according to current guidelines before and after bronchodilation (diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide was determined after bronchodilation only). Samples for capillary blood gas analysis were taken from the arterialized earlobe of all patients while breathing room air without supplemental oxygen (ABL 800 flex, Radiometer). Borg dyspnea scale scores were determined before and after a 6-minute-walk test without supplemental oxygen. Patients were then classified into three subgroups based on the severity of reported dyspnea after the 6-minute-walk test: mild or no dyspnea (Borg dyspnea scale score, 0–1; Medical Research Council dyspnea scale score, I), moderate dyspnea (Borg dyspnea scale score, 2–5; Medical Research Council dyspnea scale score, II/III), or severe dyspnea (Borg dyspnea scale score, ⩾6; Medical Research Council dyspnea scale score, IV/V).

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^114zRCnu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pharmacotherapy to maximize exercise training benefits in COPD — bronchodilators and corticosteroids: In chronic airflow limitation, pharmacologic therapy is a key component to prevent and control symptoms, reduce exacerbations, and improve exercise tolerance and health status. Both short-acting and long-acting bronchodilators increase exercise capacity in COPD and may be especially effective for individuals with a ventilatory exercise limitation; with optimal bronchodilation, the primary locus of limitation may shift from dyspnea to leg fatigue, allowing greater peripheral muscle exercise. Optimizing maintenance bronchodilator therapy within pulmonary rehabilitation augments exercise tolerance benefits, possibly by enabling higher training intensities, and optimization before exercise training is generally routine. Although inhaled corticosteroids are indicated for severe COPD with recurrent exacerbations, no effects on exercise capacity have been shown.

### Improving dyspnea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: optimal treatment strategies [^113jSDJf]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease with a global impact in terms of morbidity and mortality. Patients usually consult their doctor because of symptoms, and among those, dyspnea at rest or under exercise is one of the most common. The sensation of dyspnea is experienced differently among individuals with COPD and may be based on diverse factors, such as muscle fatigue, patient perception, or trapped volumes. Treatment algorithms for COPD emphasize a stepwise approach to therapy depending on the severity of the disease, which, for reasons of convenience, is primarily based on spirometric impairment. Drugs that alter bronchial smooth muscle tone and increase inspiratory capacity have clinical efficacy for the dyspneic patient, most likely based on their effect on lung function, whereas the effects of antiinflammatory therapy with inhaled corticosteroids is more difficult to explain. The following short review aims to give an overview of the available clinical information of clinical trials performed over the last couple of years.

### Caffeine for asthma [^117JcD1J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Caffeine has a variety of pharmacological effects. It is chemically related to the drug theophylline which is used to treat asthma. Accordingly, interest has been expressed in its potential role as an asthma treatment. A number of studies have explored the effects of caffeine in asthma, this is the first review to systematically examine and summarise the evidence.

Objectives

Caffeine is a weak bronchodilator and it also reduces respiratory muscle fatigue. It has been suggested that caffeine may reduce asthma symptoms. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of caffeine on lung function and identify whether there is a need to control for caffeine consumption prior to lung function testing.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and the reference lists of articles. We also contacted study authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of oral caffeine compared to placebo in adults with asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers.

Main Results

Six trials involving a total of 55 people were included. The studies were all of cross-over design and of high quality. In comparison with placebo, caffeine appears to improve lung function for up to two hours after consumption. Forced expiratory volume in one minute showed a small improvement up to two hours after caffeine use (standardised mean difference -0.73, 95% confidence interval -1.20 to -0.25). Mid-expiratory flow rates also showed a small improvement with caffeine and this was sustained up to four hours. An updated search in June 2001 did not identify any further studies.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Caffeine appears to improve airways function modestly in people with asthma for up to four hours. People may need to avoid caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing.

### Management of dyspnea in advanced cancer: ASCO guideline [^116yKtA3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — bronchodilators: Patients who were prescribed bronchodilators for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma should continue with their use. However, bronchodilators should not be used in patients without evidence of bronchospasm, and if used, bronchodilators should not exceed the maximum daily dose because supratherapeutic doses may reduce bronchodilator effects while increasing cardiovascular adverse effects.

### Practice parameter update: the care of the patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: drug, nutritional, and respiratory therapies (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1129nMyw]. Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) — targeted respiratory interventions for clearing secretions summarize peak cough flow thresholds, device effects, and guidance. PCEFs greater than 160 L/min are needed to clear secretions, and assistive devices are recommended when the PCEF falls below 270 L/min. Mechanical insufflation/exsufflation (MIE) increased the PCEF by 17% in healthy controls, 26% in bulbar patients, and 28% in nonbulbar patients, and manually assisted cough increased flow by 11% in bulbar and 13% in nonbulbar patients; with MIE via tracheostomy tube and an inflated cuff more effective than ordinary suctioning, and SpO2, peak inspiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, and work of breathing all improved with better comfort. High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) in 9 patients with ALS showed no benefit in rate of decline of FVC or survival, and in a controlled study of 46 patients it was associated with less breathlessness and fatigue but more coughing at night. Conclusions state that MIE is possibly effective for clearing upper airway secretions in ALS with reduced peak cough flow, although the clinically meaningful difference is unknown (4 Class III studies), whereas HFCWO is unproven (2 Class III studies with conflicting results). Recommendations state that MIE may be considered to clear secretions in patients with ALS who have reduced peak cough flow, particularly during an acute chest infection (Level C), and that there are insufficient data to support or refute HFCWO for clearing airway secretions in patients with ALS (Level U). Clinical context notes that mucolytics such as guaifenesin or N-acetylcysteine, a ß-receptor antagonist, nebulized saline, or an anticholinergic bronchodilator such as ipratropium are widely used; however, no controlled studies exist in ALS.

### Stratification of COPD patients towards personalized medicine: reproduction and formation of clusters [^117GVFqg]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Third cluster analysis: addition of six new variables based on behaviour

In the third cluster analysis, 98 patients with COPD were selected for which 14 variables were available: in addition to the eight variables described above (Table 2) we included the following six variables: QOL, fatigue, satisfaction relationship, air trapping, steps per day, and activities of daily living (Fig. 1). The first five components of the PCA contained ~ 68.5% of the information (eigenvalue > 1). Correlations between these five components and the fourteen variables are shown in Additional file 1: Table S3. Second, Ward's cluster analysis was performed, resulting in the identification of four new clusters (n = 22, n = 26, n = 24, n = 26) that mainly differed from each other in the number of steps per day, NCSI QOL and NCSI activities of daily living (Table 4, Fig. 4). The variables age, PY, mMRC and NCSI satisfaction relationship and NCSI fatigue largely overlapped across the four clusters. Cluster 1 was defined by worse scores on NCSI QOL, NCSI satisfaction relationship, NCSI activities of daily living and NCSI fatigue. Cluster 2 was defined by the best scores on CCQ, depression scale, NCSI QOL, NCSI activities of daily living and most median steps per day 7010 [IQR 5063–9343]. Cluster 3 was characterized by the highest BMI values (33 [IQR 30–36]), low levels of NCSI QOL 11.5 [6.7–17.9] but the lowest levels of dynamic hyperinflation measured in liters decreasing inspiratory capacity after bronchodilation (− 0.12 [IQR − 0.27 to − 0.04L]). Cluster 4 was defined by the highest level of NCSI activities of daily living (20.9 [12.3–26.0]). The new clusters with extra variables were not comparable to the clusters from the second cluster analysis reproducing clinical phenotypes.

### Fatigue in the radiation therapy patient: current management and investigations [^115LnfiA]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Fatigue is one of the most common and distressing symptoms experienced by cancer patients. Research conducted over the past few years has documented that initiation of radiation therapy typically results in significant increases in fatigue severity. Preliminary evidence suggests that, among disease-free patients, this heightened fatigue remits to levels approaching those reported before initiation of treatment in the weeks or months after treatment completion. Potential sources of fatigue are varied and may include anemia, cytokine activation, psychological distress, concomitant symptoms and side effects, and concurrent medications. Efforts to manage fatigue in cancer patients should focus on correcting potential etiologies and relieving symptoms. For patients experiencing fatigue related to anemia, treatment with an erythropoietic agent should be considered. Preliminary evidence suggests that moderate exercise during radiation therapy may also be helpful in relieving fatigue. Additional research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these therapies as well as other intervention strategies, such as the use of antidepressant and psychostimulant medications.

### Inhaled β-agonist therapy and respiratory muscle fatigue as under-recognised causes of lactic acidosis [^117Nhg3n]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 49-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presented with significant tachypnoea, fevers, productive cough and increased work of breathing for the previous 4 days. Laboratory data showed elevated lactate of 3.2 mEq/L. Continuous inhaled ipratropium and albuterol nebuliser treatments were administered. Lactate levels increased to 5.5 and 3.9 mEq/L, at 6 and 12 h, respectively. No infectious source was found and the lactic acidosis cleared as the patient improved. The lactic acidosis was determined to be secondary to respiratory muscle fatigue and inhaled β-agonist therapy, two under-recognised causes of lactic acidosis in patients presenting with respiratory distress. Lactic acidosis is commonly used as a clinical marker for sepsis and shock, but in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion and severe hypoxia, alternative aetiologies for elevated levels should be sought to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful medical interventions.
