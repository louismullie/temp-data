## Question

Is hiprex related to formaldehyde?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Hiprex (methenamine hippurate) is related to formaldehyde, and if so, how. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the active components in Hiprex. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic mechanism and whether formaldehyde generation is required. Next, I will look for direct evidence that formaldehyde appears in urine during therapy. After that, I need to assess the strength and specificity of this relationship and any exceptions. Then, I should consider clinical implications such as urine pH dependence, safety, contraindications, and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion anchored in guideline and trial data to ensure clinical relevance [^111xqJVd] [^1133YdKb].

> Let me first confirm the formulation and components to avoid starting from an assumption; Hiprex is the brand for methenamine hippurate tablets, each containing 1 g of methenamine hippurate, which is the hippuric acid salt of methenamine, with the methenamine and hippuric acid moieties being the pharmacologically relevant parts, while excipients include tartrazine, among others [^115dx72o] [^111xqJVd].

> Wait, let me verify the core mechanism before drawing any conclusions; the FDA labeling is explicit that antibacterial activity occurs because the methenamine component is hydrolyzed to formaldehyde in acidic urine, and hippuric acid contributes mild antibacterial activity and helps maintain urine acidity, with optimal efficacy at pH around 5.5 or below, a mechanism similarly described for methenamine mandelate where methenamine hydrolyzes to ammonia and the bactericidal agent formaldehyde [^111xqJVd] [^114AyQWc].

> I need to check for direct evidence that formaldehyde is actually present during therapy; the prescribing information notes interference with urine estriol assays in pregnancy due to urinary methenamine and/or formaldehyde, and warns not to coadminister sulfonamides because some may form insoluble precipitates with formaldehyde in urine, while contemporary systematic analyses discussing methenamine's mechanism reaffirm that its bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect relies on urinary release of formaldehyde, collectively confirming that urinary formaldehyde is generated in vivo during treatment [^113F4y36] [^1133YdKb] [^113jJpAM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which moiety does what; methenamine is the formaldehyde-releasing prodrug and its conversion to formaldehyde is essential for antimicrobial activity, whereas hippuric acid does not release formaldehyde but aids urine acidification and has modest independent antibacterial activity, so the causal link to formaldehyde stems specifically from methenamine and is fundamental rather than incidental [^111xqJVd].

> Next, I should review clinically important dependencies and safety so I don't miss practical constraints; efficacy hinges on maintaining acidic urine, so restricting alkalinizing foods/medications and instituting supplemental acidification if needed is recommended, and therapy should be monitored with urine cultures, while large methenamine doses have been associated with bladder irritation and hematuria, consistent with formaldehyde's local irritant potential, and coadministration with sulfonamides should be avoided due to precipitation risk in the formaldehyde-containing urinary environment [^115gsEMv] [^111xqJVd] [^111eA1Xe] [^1133YdKb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm renal precautions because labels differ; the Hiprex labeling lists renal insufficiency as a contraindication, which would argue for avoiding use with significant renal impairment, yet some SPL monographs suggest use without dose adjustment at eGFR 20–50 and even 10–20 mL/min/1.73 m² and during CRRT, while advising against use in intermittent hemodialysis, so when in doubt I would reconcile by prioritizing the product label contraindication and local formulary guidance and ensuring careful patient selection and monitoring if any off-label use in reduced GFR is contemplated [^1133YdKb] [^1124EgwR] [^113kMAvb] [^112QEfQ5] [^113Po8Hz].

> I will now examine whether this mechanism-based formaldehyde release aligns with clinical effectiveness data and guidelines to ensure the mechanistic relevance translates to outcomes; high-quality guidance from EAU and AUA/CUA/SUFU recommends offering methenamine hippurate to reduce recurrent cystitis episodes in appropriate women, and randomized evidence including the ALTAR trial shows non-inferiority to antibiotic prophylaxis, with meta-analyses finding similar symptomatic UTI rates versus antibiotics yet higher asymptomatic bacteriuria with methenamine, a pattern plausibly explained by its localized formaldehyde-driven urinary antisepsis rather than systemic sterilization, which reinforces the mechanistic link to formaldehyde while informing expectations for culture results in practice [^115r3sm4] [^117EbA4b] [^116u8kr5] [^113jJpAM].

> But wait, what if I'm overstating generalizability; I should double-check counseling points so clinical application stays precise, including the adult dose of 1 g twice daily, the need for urine acidification measures, avoidance with sulfonamides, and pregnancy-specific lab assay interference due to urinary methenamine/formaldehyde, all of which practically flow from the drug's role as a formaldehyde-releasing urinary antiseptic [^115gsEMv] [^1133YdKb] [^113F4y36].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is both accurate and clinically actionable; yes, Hiprex is directly and causally related to formaldehyde because methenamine must hydrolyze in acidic urine to generate formaldehyde, the primary bactericidal agent, with the presence of urinary formaldehyde documented by labeling statements, interaction warnings, and mechanistic reviews, and this relationship dictates key clinical practices around urine pH management, drug interactions, and safety monitoring when using methenamine hippurate for UTI prophylaxis [^111xqJVd] [^113F4y36] [^1133YdKb] [^113jJpAM].

Yes, Hiprex (methenamine hippurate) is directly related to formaldehyde because its antibacterial effect depends on **urinary formaldehyde release** [^111xqJVd] when urine pH is ≤ 5.5 [^114AyQWc]. This formaldehyde is the **active bactericidal agent** [^111xqJVd] in the urine, not in systemic circulation. Patients with formaldehyde allergy or sensitivity should avoid Hiprex due to potential reactions, and it is contraindicated with sulfonamides [^1133YdKb] because formaldehyde can precipitate with them in urine.

---

## Chemical relationship between hiprex and formaldehyde

- **Methenamine component**: Methenamine is a heterocyclic compound that hydrolyzes in acidic urine [^114AyQWc] to release formaldehyde and ammonia [^111xqJVd], providing the antibacterial effect of Hiprex.

- **Hippuric acid component**: Hippuric acid helps maintain acidic urine [^111xqJVd], promoting formaldehyde release from methenamine.

- **Formaldehyde release**: In urine pH ≤ 5.5 [^114AyQWc], methenamine hydrolyzes to formaldehyde, which exerts bactericidal activity [^111xqJVd].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of action

Antibacterial activity is mediated by **formaldehyde**, which denatures bacterial proteins and nucleic acids [^113scvFe], thereby killing or inhibiting bacteria in the urinary tract [^111xqJVd]. This effect is **urine pH-dependent**, requiring acidic urine (pH ≤ 5.5) [^114AyQWc]; alkalinization reduces efficacy [^111xqJVd] [^113wdidF].

---

## Clinical implications of formaldehyde release

- **Therapeutic efficacy**: Formaldehyde release is essential for preventing recurrent UTIs [^111xqJVd], with efficacy comparable to antibiotics in some studies [^111uX36B] [^116u8kr5] [^114pcSzZ].

- **Safety considerations**: Formaldehyde is a known irritant and sensitizer [^115tHPnr]; patients with formaldehyde allergy or sensitivity should avoid Hiprex.

- **Contraindications**: Hiprex is contraindicated with sulfonamides [^1133YdKb] because formaldehyde can form insoluble precipitates in urine.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guideline support comes from **AUA/CUA/SUFU 2025** [^117EbA4b], **EAU 2025** [^115r3sm4], and **AAFP 2024** [^116E419A], which recommend **methenamine hippurate** for recurrent UTI prophylaxis in appropriate patients. Patient selection favors individuals without urinary tract abnormalities and with **adequate renal function** [^111xqJVd] to achieve effective urinary formaldehyde concentrations.

## References

### Hiprex [^111xqJVd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Microbiology**: Hiprex (methenamine hippurate tablets USP) exhibits antibacterial activity because the methenamine component is hydrolyzed to formaldehyde in acidic urine. Hippuric acid, the other component, also possesses some antibacterial activity and helps maintain urine acidity. The drug is generally effective against E. coli, enterococci, and staphylococci, while Enterobacter aerogenes is generally resistant. It is crucial to maintain acidic urine to inhibit urea-splitting organisms such as Proteus and Pseudomonas.

- **Human pharmacology**: Within half an hour after ingestion of a single 1-gram dose of Hiprex, antibacterial activity becomes apparent in the urine. Continuous antibacterial activity is observed in the urine when Hiprex is administered according to the recommended dosage of 1 gram twice daily. Over 90% of the methenamine moiety is excreted in the urine within 24 hours after administration of a single 1-gram dose. Similarly, the hippurate moiety is rapidly absorbed and excreted, reaching the urine through both tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. This action may hold particular importance for older patients or those with some degree of renal impairment.

### Methenamine mandelate [^114AyQWc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Methenamine mandelate, USP, is readily absorbed but remains essentially inactive until it is excreted by the kidney and concentrated in the urine. An acidic urine is essential for antibacterial action, with maximum efficacy occurring at a pH of 5.5 or less. In such acidic conditions, mandelic acid exerts its antibacterial action and also contributes to the acidification of the urine. Mandelic acid is excreted both by glomerular filtration and tubular excretion. In acidic urine, the methenamine component is hydrolyzed to ammonia and the bactericidal agent formaldehyde.

There is equally effective antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, as the antibacterial action of mandelic acid and formaldehyde is nonspecific. However, there are reports that methenamine mandelate, USP, is ineffective in some infections with Proteus vulgaris and urea-splitting strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and A. aerogenes. Since urea-splitting strains may raise the pH of the urine, particular attention to supplementary acidification is required. The results in any single case will depend to a large extent on the underlying pathology and overall management.

### Hiprex [^1133YdKb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Hiprex (methenamine hippurate tablets USP) is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency, or severe dehydration. Methenamine preparations should not be given to patients taking sulfonamides because some sulfonamides may form an insoluble precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine.

### 'Real-world' compensatory behaviour with low nicotine concentration e-liquid: Subjective effects and nicotine, acrolein and formaldehyde exposure [^112vaVuf]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. Although participants were not aware of the study aims, they were not blinded to the nicotine e-liquid concentration, which may have influenced their puffing patterns and subjective reporting. In terms of compliance, reports of using non-study devices were reported occasionally, and days of non-use occurred (e.g. during a flight or hospital admission). Although these days were removed from the puffing analysis, this could have influenced the biomarker analysis. Occasional smoking (including marijuana or hookah use) may also have occurred. Although CO levels were all below 10 p.p.m., several were between 6 and 9 p.p.m., and we did not have the resources to confirm the lack of marijuana use biochemically. However, cross-referencing these higher CO values against nicotine, 3-HPMA, and formate results did not reveal higher levels compared with the rest of the sample. Our participants were all experienced e-cigarette users, having vaped on average for 2 years, and 40% were daily sub-ohmers. The puffing patterns and behavior of these users may not, therefore, reflect the typical vaper or smokers who have recently transitioned to vaping. Finally, vapers are unlikely to transition directly from a very high (18 mg/ml) to a very low (6 mg/ml) nicotine concentration and, in practice, may move through an intermediate stage (12 mg/ml). Whether smaller changes in nicotine concentrations are associated with changes to puffing topography and subjective effects is unknown.

In conclusion, the use of a lower nicotine concentration e-liquid is associated with compensatory puffing.

### Methenamine mandelate [^113wdidF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The average adult dose is 4 grams daily, administered as 1 gram after each meal and at bedtime. Children aged 6 to 12 should receive half the adult dose, while children under 6 years should receive 250 mg per 30 lb body weight, four times daily. Since acidic urine is essential for antibacterial activity, with maximum efficacy at pH 5.5 or below, it is desirable to restrict alkalinizing foods and medication. If urine pH testing reveals the need, supplemental acidification should be given.

### Ten-year trends in contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers [^115tHPnr]. Contact Dermatitis (2018). Low credibility.

Preservatives such as formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers are common causes of contact allergy.

- **Objectives**: To examine trends in contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers in patch-tested patients in Denmark over a 10-year period (2007–2016) and to investigate relevant sources of formaldehyde among the patients.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional registry study on patch test data from patients tested with formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers (N = 8463) was performed. The presence of released formaldehyde in products from formaldehyde-allergic patients was identified with chemical analyses (chromotropic acid or acetylacetone test).

- **Results**: The prevalence of contact allergy to formaldehyde 1% was 1.5%, ranging between 0.97% and 2.3%, with a decreasing trend over this 10-year period. Contact allergy to formaldehyde 2% was found in 2.4%, with no significant trend observed. Quaternium-15 was the formaldehyde-releaser most often positive (0.86%). Patients allergic to formaldehyde often had simultaneous positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde-releasers (36%). Almost 63% of the patients with formaldehyde allergy used products that released formaldehyde; cosmetics were the most common sources.

- **Conclusions**: Although contact allergy to formaldehyde 1% decreased in this 10-year period, contact allergies to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers overall remain frequent in patients. In most cases, formaldehyde-allergic patients are exposed to one or more products containing formaldehyde. Improved regulation on permitted amounts of free formaldehyde is necessary.

### Formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics in the United States and in Europe [^1126AhPS]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Frequencies of sensitization to formaldehyde among US patients patch tested for suspected contact dermatitis are higher than in Europe. Cosmetics are an important source of contact with formaldehyde.

- **Objectives**: To acquire data on the frequency of use of formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics sold in the United States and Europe and their use concentrations, and to assess whether any observed differences may contribute to the discrepancies in sensitization rates.

- **Methods**: Enquiries with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Cosmetics Association, and the Dutch Cosmetics Association were conducted, alongside reading the labels of skin care cosmetics in a local drugstore.

- **Results**: The FDA provided data on the presence of formaldehyde and releasers. Nearly one-fifth of all cosmetics contain a releaser. In 25% of 496 examined skin care products, releasers were present. In comparable FDA data categories, the percentage was 24. No data were found on use concentrations of the releasers in cosmetics in either the United States or Europe.

- **Conclusions**: The percentages of stay-on skin care products containing a formaldehyde-releaser are virtually identical in the United States (FDA data) and our local drugstore sample. However, this does not necessarily imply that cosmetics play no part in the differences in formaldehyde sensitization rates.

### Efficacy of methenamine with methylthioninium in the treatment of dysuria: A randomized clinical study [^117Kvxvw]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). High credibility.

Dysuria is a symptomatic manifestation of various urological and gynecological diseases, characterized by sensations of pain, burning, or stinging during urination. Approximately 3% of adults over the age of 40 experience dysuria, which causes significant distress, with a higher prevalence potentially observed depending on the underlying condition. The most common cause of acute dysuria is urinary tract infections (UTIs), affecting about 12% of adult women annually, especially those under 30. UTIs account for nearly 40% of cases in emergency departments in Brazil and more than 1 million visits to emergency departments annually in the United States. Other causes of dysuria include inflammation or irritation of the urethra or bladder, such as urethritis, sexually transmitted diseases, stones, tumors, certain foods, medications, and menopause.

Management of dysuria depends on its cause, although relief of discomfort may necessitate additional symptomatic treatment. Phenazopyridine, once considered an antiseptic, is an analgesic that is widely used for urinary tract symptoms. However, the limited evidence regarding its efficacy and safety concerns have led to a demand for other treatment options. Methenamine hippurate and methylthioninium chloride possess antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties and have been used as prophylaxis for UTIs with a low risk of drug resistance. Prior to this study, a comparison with phenazopyridine and an assessment of dysuria not limited to UTIs had not been conducted.

In this study, we hypothesized that the combination of methenamine 250 mg and methylthioninium chloride 20 mg is superior to phenazopyridine in the treatment of dysuria.

### Methenamine hippurate for preventing urinary tract infections [^111zDG7f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Methenamine salts are often used as an alternative to antibiotics for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTI).

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTIs.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1980), reference lists of articles, and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restriction. Manufacturers of methenamine salts were contacted for unpublished studies, and contact was made with known investigators. Date of the last search: September 2006.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs of methenamine hippurate used for the prevention of UTIs in all population groups were eligible. A comparison with a control/no treatment group was a prerequisite for selection.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model, and the results were expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). An exploration of heterogeneity and a detailed description of results, grouped by population, was undertaken.

- **Main results**: Thirteen studies (2032 participants) were included. Six studies (654 patients) reported symptomatic UTI, and eight studies (796 patients) reported bacteriuria. Overall, study quality was mixed. The overall pooled estimates for the major outcome measures were not interpretable because of underlying heterogeneity.

### A three enzyme system to generate the Strychnos alkaloid scaffold from a central biosynthetic intermediate [^114shKZ8]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde release detection assay:

The release of formaldehyde as a result of the rearrangement catalyzed by GO (CYP71D1V1) was monitored using a fluorescence-based Nash assay. The Nash reagent was prepared by adding 0.3 mL of acetic acid and 0.2 mL of acetylacetone to 100 mL of 2 M ammonium acetate.

Enzyme assays were conducted in a total volume of 200 µl, using 300 μM strictosidine aglycone substrate, 5 μM GS1, 5 mM NADPH, and various quantities of GO (CYP71D1V1) microsomes ranging from 5 to 100 µl in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). After 20 minutes, the enzyme assays were centrifuged at 3130× g for 5 minutes. Subsequently, 100 µl of the enzyme assay was quenched with two volumes of Nash reagent and incubated at 60 ˚C for 10 minutes to convert formaldehyde to diacetyldihydrolutidine. This was detected by fluorescence using a BMG Labtech CLARIOstar microplate reader at λ ex = 412 nm and λ em = 505 nm. A calibration curve using formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) from 0–50 µM was made for quantification. Peak areas were calculated using the BMG Labtech CLARIOstar software and normalized.

Aliquots of the reaction mixtures (10 μl) were quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 100% MeOH following centrifugation. Samples were further diluted 1:5 in mobile phase (H2O + 0.1% formic acid) and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4000× g before UPLC-MS injection (1 µl). The enzyme activity was measured by UPLC-MS as described above, and peak areas were calculated using the Waters MassLynx software and normalized.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: An updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114pcSzZ]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

When comparing the symptomatic clinical UTI episodes after both clinical interventions, methenamine or antibiotics, no differences were seen between groups (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.96, 1.38; p = 0.41; I² = 0%). The trial sequential analysis (TSA) was only performed for the primary outcome since the other outcomes had an insufficient sample size. For this outcome, four studies were included, accounting for a total of 421 patients.

- **Rate of symptomatic UTI**: Fig. 2 illustrates the comparison between methenamine and antibiotic groups.
- **Trial sequential analysis of primary outcome**: Fig. 3 presents the TSA of the primary outcome of interest.

Regarding the secondary outcomes, no notable distinctions were observed in the positive urine culture rate (RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.91, 1.57; p = 0.25; I² = 28%). The rate of adverse effects between both approaches was also not significant (RR 1.91; 95% CI 1.29, 2.81; p = 0.0001; I² = 0%). Unfortunately, only three studies could be assessed for these outcomes, with the positive urine culture counting 335 participants, while the rate of adverse effects involved 318 participants.

- **Rate of positive urine culture**: Fig. 4 compares methenamine and antibiotic groups.
- **Rate of adverse effects**: Fig. 5 regards methenamine and antibiotic groups.

At the same time, a higher rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria was associated with methenamine hippurate compared to the antibiotic group (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.86, 1.12; p = 0.35; I² = 9%). Here, four studies included a total of 366 patients' data assessed.

- **Rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria**: Fig. 6 compares methenamine and antibiotic groups.

None of the outcomes assessed presented an I² higher or equal to a significant level, allowing for comprehensive analysis.

### Patch testing with formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers: Multicentre study in Spain (2005–2009) [^112VwdDE]. Contact Dermatitis (2011). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers are common causes of allergic contact dermatitis. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of sensitization to formaldehyde and seven formaldehyde-releasers, and to establish and characterize groups of patients according to the results of patch testing.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a 5-year retrospective study in six Spanish hospitals with patients who had positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde or any of seven formaldehyde-releasers.

- **Results**: The most frequent allergens were formaldehyde (1.72%), imidazolidinyl urea (1.05%), quaternium-15 (0.88%), and diazolidinyl urea (0.79%). Patients sensitized only to formaldehyde exhibited a higher frequency of occupational dermatitis (25%) compared to those sensitized solely to formaldehyde-releasers (9.5%). The most common sites of dermatitis were the hands (31.7%) in patients sensitized only to formaldehyde, and the face and legs (31.3% and 24.6%) in patients sensitized only to formaldehyde-releasers. A subgroup of 25 patients was identified who were sensitized to both imidazolidinyl urea and diazolidinyl urea; however, only 6 of these (24%) were also sensitized to formaldehyde.

- **Conclusions**: The inclusion of imidazolidinyl urea and diazolidinyl urea in the baseline series of the Spanish Contact Dermatitis and Skin Allergy Research Group (GEIDAC) should enable better classification of patients allergic to formaldehyde and could aid in their management.

### Occupational contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers [^1158p5Mk]. Contact Dermatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde allergy is common and usually derives from formaldehyde-releasing biocides in cosmetic and other products.

- **Objectives**: To analyze patterns of patch test reactions to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing compounds and the sources of sensitization.

- **Patients/methods**: At the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, we screened the patch test files for allergic reactions to formaldehyde and 12 formaldehyde-releasing compounds. All patients with contact allergy to any of the substances were included, and their records were reviewed.

- **Results**: Between January 2001 and May 2007, we had patch tested 81 patients with formaldehyde allergy and 18 with independent allergy to some formaldehyde releaser. Of the formaldehyde allergies, 60 were new sensitizations, 25 of which were considered to be occupational. The most common source of occupational sensitization was metalworking fluids, followed by creams and related products. Exposure to formaldehyde-releasing preservatives in liquid soaps and other rinse-off products was common in both occupational and non-occupational cases. Reactions to formaldehyde-releasing compounds were seen in 79% of the formaldehyde-allergic patients.

- **Conclusions**: Occupational formaldehyde allergy was common and occurred in metalworkers, hairdressers, masseurs, and workers using protective creams, detergents, and liquid soaps. When compared with studies on general dermatological patients, contact allergy to formaldehyde releasers without formaldehyde allergy was rare.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111MdFtY]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Our findings suggest that methenamine hippurate offers comparable efficacy to antibiotics in preventing symptomatic UTIs and reducing positive urine cultures, with a potentially favorable safety profile. However, the higher ABU rates in the methenamine group warrant further investigation to elucidate their clinical significance. The evidence supports methenamine hippurate as a viable non-antibiotic prophylactic option, particularly for patients aiming to minimize antibiotic exposure.

Future research should address the methodological shortcomings identified in this review, including the need for standardized UTI definitions, comprehensive reporting of adverse events, and evaluations of microbial resistance. Such studies are essential to refining clinical guidelines and optimizing the role of methenamine hippurate in UTI prevention. By expanding the evidence base, clinicians can better tailor prophylactic strategies to individual patient needs, balancing efficacy, safety, and the growing imperative to mitigate antibiotic resistance.

### Human and preclinical studies of the host-gut microbiome co-metabolite hippurate as a marker and mediator of metabolic health [^116ZNTPB]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Human obesity is an epidemic that raises the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Gut microbiome dysbiosis is now recognized as a key feature of these disorders. The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem, harboring thousands of microbial species and strains. It is a dynamic system described as a continuum between core and rare participants, with an overall ecosystem structure alternately described in terms of gradients or enterotypes across populations. The microbiome collectively encodes up to 10 million different microbial genes. Microbial gene richness has been proposed as a marker of ecological diversity mirroring improvements in metabolic health. Many factors affect the gut microbiota, including diet, age, lifestyle, dietary supplements such as sweeteners, and drugs. Although the microbiota directly impacts various biological processes of the host through the production or degradation of a multitude of compounds, the vast majority of molecules involved in this chemical crosstalk remain elusive.

Hippurate is one of the most abundant microbial–host co-metabolites, produced by conjugation from glycine and microbial benzoate in the liver and kidney through phase 2 detoxification. Hippurate has been shown to be associated positively with microbial diversity but negatively with blood pressure, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, visceral fat mass, and Crohn's disease. This suggests the potential role of hippurate in metabolic health.

Despite recent progress, there is a critical need for an in-depth characterization of the complex nutrition–microbiome–host interactions.

### Determination of formaldehyde in formaldehyde-releaser patch test preparations [^113EiKQ5]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde-releasers in patients who co-react to formaldehyde are often ascribed to formaldehyde allergy. However, the formaldehyde content of patch test materials has not been thoroughly investigated.

- **Objectives**: To demonstrate and quantify free formaldehyde in commercial patch test materials and in prepared aqueous solutions of formaldehyde releasers.

- **Materials**: Free formaldehyde was measured by \(^{13}\)C NMR spectroscopy in:
	(i) all formaldehyde-releasers in water available from Chemotechnique and Brial,
	(ii) 5 releasers in petrolatum,
	(iii) 12 prepared aqueous solutions of formaldehyde-releasers, and
	(iv) water that had been in contact with petrolatum test samples.

- **Results**: In none of the five petrolatum test substances was free formaldehyde found. In all nine commercial aqueous patch test substances and 9 of the 12 prepared solutions, free formaldehyde was demonstrated with concentrations ranging from 0.019% to 0.37% (detection limit 0.01%). Contact of the petrolatum test samples with water resulted in the release of formaldehyde.

- **Conclusions**: Most aqueous solutions of formaldehyde-releasers contain free formaldehyde. Petrolatum-based patch test materials with formaldehyde-releasers do not contain free formaldehyde but probably start releasing it upon contact with water. Therefore, in future studies, determination of free and releasable formaldehyde may be preferable.

### Formaldehyde in cosmetics in patch tested dermatitis patients with and without contact allergy to formaldehyde [^113vFk7C]. Contact Dermatitis (2016). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde is a well-known contact sensitizer, and formaldehyde releasers are widely used as preservatives in cosmetics.

- **Objectives**: To survey the release of formaldehyde in cosmetics brought by patients investigated for suspected allergic contact dermatitis. This study compared these findings with information provided by manufacturers on the packaging and aimed to investigate whether formaldehyde-allergic patients are potentially exposed to more formaldehyde-releasing cosmetics than dermatitis patients without a contact allergy to formaldehyde.

- **Patients/methods**: Cosmetics from 10 formaldehyde-allergic patients and 30 non-allergic patients (controls), matched for age and sex, were investigated using the chromotropic acid spot test. This semiquantitative method measures the release of formaldehyde.

- **Results**: Formaldehyde was found in 58 of 245 (23.7%) products. Twenty-six of 126 (20.6%) leave-on products released formaldehyde, with 17 of 26 (65.4%) not declared to contain formaldehyde or formaldehyde releasers. Among rinse-off products, 32 of 119 (26.8%) released formaldehyde, with nine of 32 (28.0%) not labeled as containing formaldehyde or formaldehyde releasers. Notably, five of 10 formaldehyde-allergic patients brought leave-on products with ≥ 40 ppm formaldehyde, compared to 4 of 30 in the control group (p = 0.029).

- **Conclusions**: Cosmetic products used by formaldehyde-allergic patients that are not declared to contain formaldehyde or formaldehyde-releasing preservatives should be analyzed.

### Efficacy of methenamine with methylthioninium in the treatment of dysuria: A randomized clinical study [^116rsVv4]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). High credibility.

The evaluation of excellent clinical response obtained at 12 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 72 h showed that the test drug was superior in pain, burning, and burning on urination from 36 to 48 h. At 72 h, the difference between groups was no longer statistically significant.

- **Evaluation of excellent clinical response**:
	- At 12 h, 26 h, 48 h, and 72 h, the time to achieve symptom resolution showed 52.41% of group 1 achieved complete resolution of pain within 72 h, with 47.59% censored. In group 2, 49.28% were without pain and 50.71% censored.
	- The mean time for complete resolution of pain was 59.42 h (95% CI 56.32 h, 62.52 h) in group 1 and 64.63 h (95% CI 62.52 h, 66.74 h) in group 2, log-rank p value = 0.2858.

- **Burning sensation**:
	- 55.17% of group 1 had complete resolution within 72 h, with 44.83% censored. In group 2, 55% had complete resolution, and 45% censored.
	- The mean time for complete healing of burning was 60.08 h (95% CI 57.22 h, 62.94 h) in group 1 and 64.29 h (62.30 h, 66.27 h) in group 2, log-rank p value = 0.5232.

- **Burning on urination**:
	- 57.93% of group 1 had complete resolution within 72 h, with 42.07% censored. In group 2, 57.14% achieved resolution, and 42.86% were censored.
	- The mean time for complete healing of burning on urination was 58.01 h (95% CI 54.96 h, 61.07 h) in group 1 and 63.51 h (95% CI 61.28 h, 65.75 h) for group 2, log-rank p value = 0.3235.

### Formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics: Relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy. Part 1. Characterization, frequency and relevance of sensitization, and frequency of use in cosmetics [^111F9WkZ]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

In this part of a series of review articles on formaldehyde-releasers and their relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy, formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics are discussed. Key data presented in this first part of the article include the frequency of sensitization and their use in cosmetics. In Europe, low frequencies of sensitization have been observed for all releasers: 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol (0.4–1.2%), diazolidinyl urea (0.5–1.4%), imidazolidinyl urea (0.3–1.4%), and quaternium-15 (0.6–1.9%). For DMDM hydantoin, no recent data are available. All releasers show higher prevalences in the United States, and possible explanations for this are discussed. The relevance of positive patch test reactions has been insufficiently investigated. In the United States, approximately 20% of cosmetics and personal care products — 17% of stay-on products and 27% of rinse-off products — contain a formaldehyde-releaser. The use of quaternium-15 is decreasing. For Europe, there are no comparable recent data available. In the second part of the article, the patch test relationship of the releasers in cosmetics to formaldehyde contact allergy will be reviewed, and it will be assessed whether products preserved with formaldehyde-releasers may contain enough free formaldehyde to pose a threat to individuals who have contact allergy to formaldehyde.

### Ex vivo anti-microbial efficacy of various formaldehyde releasers against antibiotic resistant and antibiotic sensitive microorganisms involved in infectious keratitis [^115v4XNt]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

PACK-CXL has been shown to have equal or improved bactericidal efficacy against antibiotic-resistant strains of Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus. An overwhelming number of reports have shown that CXL is effective as an adjunct to standard antibiotic agents for bacterial keratitis. CXL has also been used successfully as a primary therapy for infectious keratitis due to bacterial causes. It is important to note that CXL is contraindicated for the treatment of herpetic keratitis and can cause reactivation of latent herpes. Additionally, CXL appears to be less effective against fungal infections, where the PACK-CXL clinical literature is less convincing. Other drawbacks to CXL include potential UVA exposure risks and issues surrounding corneal epithelial debridement. For these reasons, we are investigating the use of topical therapeutic cross-linking solutions to provide a new cross-linking option for patients.

Formaldehyde releasers (FARs) are a group of over 60 chemicals widely used in the textile and cosmetics industries. They differ from one another in terms of toxicity, water solubility, molecular weight, hydrophobicity, mutagenicity, and bioavailability. We are developing them for clinical ophthalmic use in the form of a cross-linking solution. This could provide a new option for corneal tissue stabilization in keratoconus and post-LASIK ectasias. Initial studies had focused on nitroalcohols, a subgroup of FARs. The aim of the present study was to assess the antimicrobial efficacy and identify differences between these chemicals.

### Microbial phenotypic heterogeneity in response to a metabolic toxin: Continuous, dynamically shifting distribution of formaldehyde tolerance in Methylobacterium extorquens populations [^114tfo9V]. PLoS Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

Tolerant subpopulation behavior is observable at the single-cell level. As a final step in confirming single-cell phenotypic heterogeneity in formaldehyde tolerance, we observed growth of single cells directly using high-resolution time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy of cultures embedded in agar pads. This method allowed us to observe the division times and potential morphological aberrations of individual cells and their progeny in microcolonies over the first 9 hours of growth. Because the cells tolerant to 4 mM formaldehyde are only present at a frequency of approximately 10⁻⁴ in the initial population, we conducted formaldehyde exposure at a lower concentration, 2.5 mM formaldehyde, at which plating experiments suggested that ~1–4% of cells would be able to grow.

Indeed, we found that 11 out of 546 cells (1.97%) were able to grow at that formaldehyde concentration, compared to 100% of the 256 cells observed in the no-formaldehyde condition (Fig 6). In addition, all of the cells that grew in the presence of formaldehyde did so normally: we found no significant effect of formaldehyde on cell division time (median doubling time at 0 mM: 2.58 hours; at 2.5 mM: 2.58 hours; p = 0.262 by Mann-Whitney U-test). We did observe that cells in formaldehyde took slightly longer to complete the first division (median lag time was 1.25 hours later in formaldehyde; p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U); this may indicate minor cell damage or a modest inhibitory effect of formaldehyde in the medium, or it may have resulted from slight differences in the preparation of the cells.

### Methenamine hippurate for preventing urinary tract infections [^111ZLxTm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Methenamine salts are often used as an alternative to antibiotics for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs). This review was first published in Issue 1, 2002, and updated in Issue 4, 2007.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTI.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1980), reference lists of articles, and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restrictions. Manufacturers of methenamine salts were contacted for unpublished studies, and contact was made with known investigators. Date of last search: June 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of methenamine hippurate used for the prevention of UTIs in all population groups were eligible. A comparison with a control/no treatment group was a prerequisite for selection.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model, and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). An exploration of heterogeneity and a detailed description of results, grouped by population, was undertaken.

- **Main results**: Thirteen studies (2,032 participants) were included. Six studies (654 patients) reported symptomatic UTI and eight studies (796 patients) reported bacteriuria. Overall, study quality was mixed. The overall pooled estimates for the major outcome.

### Hiprex [^1175TKBM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Hiprex is indicated for the prophylactic or suppressive treatment of frequently recurring urinary tract infections when long-term therapy is considered necessary. This drug should only be used after eradication of the infection by other appropriate antimicrobial agents.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Hiprex and other antibacterial drugs, Hiprex should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Formaldehyde-releasers: Relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy. Contact allergy to formaldehyde and inventory of formaldehyde-releasers [^116jgYeq]. Contact Dermatitis (2009). Low credibility.

This article is part of a series of reviews on formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers, including its presence in cosmetics, clothes, metalworking fluids, and miscellaneous products. Thirty-five chemicals have been identified as formaldehyde-releasers. An additional seven are cited in the literature, but data regarding them remain inconclusive. Several nomenclature errors and outdated information are discussed.

- **Formaldehyde and formaldehyde allergy**: The review examines various aspects such as applications, exposure scenarios, legislation, issues in patch testing, frequency of sensitization, relevance of positive patch test reactions, clinical patterns of allergic contact dermatitis from formaldehyde, prognosis, threshold for elicitation, analytical tests to detect formaldehyde in products, and exposure frequency to formaldehyde and its releasers.

The frequency of contact allergy to formaldehyde is consistently higher in the United States (8–9%) compared to Europe (2–3%). Patch testing with formaldehyde poses challenges; the currently used 1% solution can lead to false-positive and false-negative (up to 40%) reactions. Determining the relevance of patch test reactions is often challenging. The safe concentration of formaldehyde for sensitive patients remains undefined. Levels of 200–300 p.p.m. free formaldehyde in cosmetic products have been shown to induce dermatitis after short-term use on normal skin.

### Formaldehyde exposure and patterns of concomitant contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers [^111hhLV4]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers are widely used in consumer products and may often cause contact allergy.

- **Objective**: To investigate the prevalence of concomitant contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers in dermatitis patients, and to determine the sources of formaldehyde exposure based on personal and occupational products obtained from dermatitis patients.

- **Methods**: Patch test data from referred dermatitis patients with a positive patch test reaction to formaldehyde or formaldehyde-releasers were analysed. For the period 2000–2008, the formaldehyde content in products obtained from formaldehyde-allergic patients was analysed by chromotropic acid test and/or acetylacetone test.

- **Results**: Patients allergic to a formaldehyde-releaser often had simultaneous contact allergy to formaldehyde. Other combinations were also prevalent. In patients who reacted to more than two formaldehyde-releasers, nearly all reacted simultaneously to formaldehyde. Seventy-five percent of the formaldehyde-allergic patients used a product that contained formaldehyde. The main source of formaldehyde exposure was cosmetics (78%).

- **Conclusions**: Concomitant contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releaser remains common. Furthermore, contact allergy to a formaldehyde-releaser was nearly always concomitant with another formaldehyde-releaser. Formaldehyde was commonly found in personal products used by formaldehyde-allergic patients.

### Job-related formaldehyde exposure and ALS mortality in the United States [^111kksQ4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Animal models and in vitro experiments suggest neurotoxic effects of formaldehyde that may be relevant for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Formaldehyde induces neuronal τ protein misfolding and aggregation, leading to neuronal apoptosis. Formaldehyde also increases mitochondrial membrane permeability and causes oxidative damage partly by reducing superoxide dismutase activity, mechanisms implicated in ALS.

Studies have had mixed findings regarding formaldehyde exposure and ALS mortality. A large prospective study found an elevated risk that did not quite reach statistical significance, but it did find a strong dose–response relationship with total years of exposure. Two studies found no significant association, although one suggested an elevated risk among the very highly exposed. We examine here the association of ALS mortality with job-related formaldehyde exposure in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS), a US-representative cohort with occupation data collected prospectively.

### Use of methenamine for urinary tract infection prophylaxis: Systematic review of recent evidence [^111uX36B]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). High credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use, and growing rates of resistance are an urgent issue. Methenamine is a non-antibiotic alternative used for urinary tract infection (UTI) prophylaxis. The objective of this review is to evaluate recently published literature regarding the efficacy and safety of methenamine for UTI prophylaxis.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases were queried in March 2023 using the following search terms: urinary tract infection, cystitis, bacteriuria, or dysuria, and methenamine. Studies prior to 2012 were excluded from this review to focus on appraisal of the most recent evidence. Prospective and controlled retrospective trials were included for review.

- **Results**: A total of seven studies (three prospective and four retrospective) met the inclusion criteria for review. Two of the three prospective studies demonstrated non-inferior differences in clinical efficacy to prevent recurrent UTIs between methenamine and antibiotic prophylaxis. The third study showed decreased rates of UTI with methenamine use in patients with short-term indwelling catheters compared with cranberry alone. The retrospective studies consistently supported the efficacy and safety of methenamine for UTI prophylaxis in a variety of populations and clinical settings. Adverse effects reported with methenamine were similar to comparators and included nausea, abdominal pain, and headache.

- **Conclusions**: The use of methenamine for UTI prophylaxis was shown to be effective in a variety of settings without an increased risk of adverse effects.

### Patterns of positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health from 2007 to 2020 [^113xpHK9]. Contact Dermatitis (2021). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde is an important contact sensitizer. Formaldehyde-releasing substances induce positive reactions in formaldehyde-allergic patients, but there are also reactions independent of formaldehyde allergy. In an earlier study, stronger formaldehyde reactions led to more positive reactions to quaternium-15.

- **Objectives**: To analyze patterns of positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde and different formaldehyde releasers.

- **Methods**: Patch test files of 1,497 patients investigated during the period November 2007 to August 2020 were retrospectively reviewed for positive reactions to formaldehyde and its releasers. During the study period, almost all (≥ 99.3%) patients were tested with a formaldehyde dilution series and six formaldehyde releasers.

- **Results**: Ninety-three patients tested positive to formaldehyde; 80% of these had positive reactions to at least one formaldehyde releaser, most often benzylhemiformal. There were only nine independent contact allergies to formaldehyde releasers. There were only two reactions to 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol, and they occurred in formaldehyde-negative patients. In patients with extreme (+++) reactions to formaldehyde, concomitant positive reactions to any of the other 11 investigated formaldehyde releasers were more common than in patients with milder formaldehyde reactions.

- **Conclusions**: Strong formaldehyde reactions were associated with positive reactions to formaldehyde releasers.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113jJpAM]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review, meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis evaluated the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) compared to antibiotics. Our findings indicate no significant differences in the incidence of symptomatic UTI episodes between the methenamine hippurate and antibiotic groups. Similarly, both interventions demonstrated equivalent efficacy in reducing positive urine cultures. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) was notably higher in the methenamine hippurate group (RR 1.91; 95% CI 1.29, 2.81; p = 0.0001; I² = 0%).

The increased ABU in the methenamine hippurate group may be attributed to its mechanism of action, which relies on the urinary environment to release formaldehyde for bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects. While this mechanism effectively reduces symptomatic episodes, it may not eliminate bacteria as systemically or thoroughly as antibiotics. Antibiotics, with their broader and more systemic antimicrobial activity, likely contribute to the lower rates of ABU observed in this analysis. This finding emphasizes the need for further studies investigating the relationship between ABU and long-term outcomes in patients using methenamine hippurate.

Regarding adverse effects, the analysis revealed fewer adverse events in the antibiotic group, contrary to expectations given the well-documented side effects of antibiotics, including gastrointestinal disturbances and allergic reactions. This unexpected result may stem from the limited reporting of adverse effects in the included studies.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117JSgfm]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common global health issue, particularly affecting women, with approximately 7 million women seeking outpatient care annually for uncomplicated UTIs. These infections, caused by bacterial invasion of the urinary tract, include conditions such as cystitis and pyelonephritis. Due to anatomical factors, women are more susceptible to UTIs, and recurrence is a significant concern, with up to 27% of women experiencing a repeat infection within six months. This recurrence contributes to both clinical and economic burdens.

Antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin, are commonly prescribed for acute UTI treatment but come with side effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances and allergic reactions. More critically, widespread antibiotic use is fueling the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which complicates treatment. Long-term antibiotic use in treating UTIs leads to high overall resistance to commonly used antibiotics, such as ampicillin (39.6%), trimethoprim (23.8%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (22.4%). Despite the approach to managing UTIs predominantly involving antibiotics, there are ongoing concerns about overuse, antibiotic resistance, and potential aftereffects.

Guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) focus on optimizing UTI management, but challenges remain in antibiotic selection, treatment duration, and the management of reinfections. Recent studies, including a meta-analysis, highlight these concerns.

### Preservatives in cosmetics: Reactivity of allergenic formaldehyde-releasers towards amino acids through breakdown products other than formaldehyde [^114iHCM7]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Compounds slowly releasing formaldehyde, the so-called formaldehyde-releasers, are commonly employed as preservatives in cosmetics instead of free formaldehyde, which is a strong skin sensitizer. It has long been accepted that formaldehyde-releaser sensitization is attributable to released formaldehyde. However, clinical studies show the existence of patients allergic to formaldehyde-releasers but not to formaldehyde itself.

- **Objectives**: To prove that, for certain formaldehyde-releasers, reactive intermediates other than formaldehyde could be involved in the formation of the hapten-protein antigenic complex, a key step in the sensitization process, thus explaining their sensitizing potential.

- **Materials/methods**: DMDM hydantoin, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol, and methenamine were synthesized, (13)C-labelled at the position(s) precursor of formaldehyde. Their reactivity towards amino acids was followed by one-dimensional and two-dimensional (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance.

- **Results**: Many adducts formed by reacting formaldehyde-releasers with amino acids resulted from a direct interaction of the releaser or from the reaction of a breakdown product, not from a reaction involving simply released formaldehyde. DMDM hydantoin was reactive per se, while 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol and methenamine decomposed in water, producing bromoethanol and diaminomethane, respectively, which were reactive towards some of the amino acids tested.

- **Conclusion**: The reactivity of distinctive formaldehyde-releasers towards amino acids is not limited to formaldehyde release.

### Trends in formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releaser contact allergies as compared with market exposure in Thailand [^115RXFic]. Contact Dermatitis (2023). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers (FRs) are common preservatives in cosmetics and household products. Their contact allergy trends are decreasing in Europe and America, but trend data for Asia are limited.

- **Objectives**: The first objective was to determine the prevalences of and trends in contact allergies to formaldehyde and FRs. The second objective was to establish how often formaldehyde and FRs were mentioned on the labels of products sold in the Thai market.

- **Methods**: Twenty years of data on patch test results for formaldehyde and FRs were reviewed. Their frequency of mention on the labels of 5,855 products was analyzed.

- **Results**: The trends in contact allergy to formaldehyde and FRs were decreasing. The overall prevalence of formaldehyde contact allergy was 2.5%. The most common FR to cause contact allergy was quaternium-15. Formaldehyde and FRs were identified as ingredients in 10.2% of the products surveyed. Dimethylol dimethyl hydantoin was the most common FR (5.2%). The highest use of formaldehyde and FRs (15.5%) was in hair care products.

- **Conclusion**: Although contact allergy trends in Thailand were decreasing, the proportion of products with FRs remained high. Comprehensive and universal legislation is needed to control the presence of formaldehyde and FRs.

### Histology without formalin [^117UVwSL]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Because formalin is toxic, carcinogenic, and a poor preserver of nucleic acids, there have been numerous attempts over more than 20 years to find a substitute, with many different alternative fixatives proposed, none completely successful. Formaldehyde, though fast in penetration, is a slow and reversible fixative that takes 24 to 48 hours to completely bind to tissue. Therefore, any surgical specimen arriving at the laboratory between 8 AM and 4 PM and processed conventionally for the slides to be ready the following day will be only between 30% and 66% bound. It will be even less fixed when dehydration starts, resulting in an additional incomplete alcoholic fixation. This can cause infiltration problems and affect subsequent tests, especially immunohistochemistry.

Formaldehyde fixation is independent of tissue thickness between 16 micrometers and 4 millimeters but is faster at above room temperature. Thus, the fixation of specimens with less than 24 hours in formalin can be improved if the fixing stations in conventional tissue processors are set at 40 degrees Celsius. If safety measures are improved to offer a work environment with a time-weighted average level of 0.4 ppm, and if contact with formalin is minimized by discouraging neutralization and limiting recycling practices to filtering methods, formalin could remain as the routine fixative. Modified methacarn might be preferred for specimens requiring nucleic acid studies. This approach is preferable to having to validate all standard and special procedures, including those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, if formalin is replaced.

### Host-microbe co-metabolism via MCAD generates circulating metabolites including hippuric acid [^117JeN7P]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The human gut microbiome produces numerous drug-like small molecules that impact various aspects of human biology. These molecules are produced in the gut via the metabolism of diet- and host-derived molecules such as glycans, proteins, and amino acids. Microbiota-dependent metabolites impact physiology locally in the gut, where their concentrations are the highest. However, a subset is absorbed across the intestinal wall and circulates throughout the body, where they may influence host physiology at organs distal to the gut. Despite extensive recent literature documenting the impact of microbial metabolites on the host, significant gaps exist in our knowledge about these molecules. Chief among these are the lack of clarity on how microbiota-generated metabolites intersect with host metabolism, and the identity and fate of the major products. Such insight is essential to understand how host genetics influence the spectrum of microbial metabolites within an individual and will identify novel biomarkers for microbial functions in the gut.

Gut microbial metabolites enter host circulation, where they are metabolized by enzymes involved in phase I (modification via oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis) and phase II metabolism (conjugation with glutathione, sulfate, glucuronic acid, or amino acids — typically glycine or glutamine), classically known for their roles in drug metabolism. Products of phase I and phase II metabolism of microbial metabolites include indoxyl sulfate, a host-microbe co-metabolite of tryptophan whose plasma levels rise as the kidneys fail.

### Formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics: Relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy. Part 2. Patch test relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy, experimental provocation tests, amount of formaldehyde released, and assessment of risk to consumers allergic to formaldehyde [^114PcebH]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

This is the second part of an article on formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics. The patch test relationship between the releasers in cosmetics and formaldehyde contact allergy is reviewed. It is assessed whether products preserved with formaldehyde-releasers may contain enough free formaldehyde to pose a threat to individuals with contact allergy to formaldehyde. There is a clear relationship between positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde-releasers and formaldehyde contact allergy: 15% of all reactions to 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol and 40–60% of the reactions to the other releasers are caused by a reaction to the formaldehyde in the test material.

There is only fragmented data on the amount of free formaldehyde in cosmetics preserved with formaldehyde donors. However, all releasers (with the exception of 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol, for which adequate data are lacking) can, in the right circumstances of concentration and product composition, release more than 200 p.p.m. formaldehyde, which may result in allergic contact dermatitis. Whether this is actually the case in any particular product cannot be determined from the ingredient labeling.

Therefore, we recommend advising patients allergic to formaldehyde to avoid leave-on cosmetics preserved with quaternium-15, diazolidinyl urea, DMDM hydantoin, or imidazolidinyl urea, acknowledging that many would tolerate some products.

### Methenamine hippurate for preventing urinary tract infections [^116x9SpR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Methenamine salts are often used for the prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI). This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTIs.

- **Search strategy**: Published and unpublished randomized controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, contents, and reference lists of review articles and retrieved trials. The manufacturers of methenamine salts were contacted for unpublished studies, and contact was made with known investigators in the area.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of methenamine hippurate used for the prevention of UTIs in all population groups were eligible for inclusion. A comparison with a control (no treatment) group was a prerequisite for selection.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers performed independent assessments and data extraction using a standardized format. Discrepancies, methodological, and interpretative issues were discussed with senior reviewers. An exploration of heterogeneity as well as a detailed description of results grouped by population was conducted.

- **Main results**: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. All trials were included in a descriptive analysis. Seven trials were included in meta-analyses. Four trials (199 patients) studied symptomatic bacteriuria, and six trials (341 patients) studied bacteriuria as an outcome measure. Overall, trial quality was poor. The direction of six of the pooled trials was towards a favorable treatment effect from methenamine hippurate.

### Hidden formaldehyde in cosmetic products [^113U7D6U]. Contact Dermatitis (2024). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde is a common cause of contact allergy. Hidden formaldehyde, which refers to formaldehyde in products without formaldehyde releasers, has previously been detected in cosmetic products.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this study was to investigate the content and causes of hidden formaldehyde in leave-on cosmetic products.

- **Methods**: The formaldehyde release from 142 cosmetic products, primarily creams, was analyzed using the chromotropic acid (CA) method. The study included 130 products with no formaldehyde releasers on the ingredient list and 12 products with formaldehyde releasers. Products without formaldehyde releasers that tested positive to CA, indicating formaldehyde levels of ≥ 2.5ppm, were additionally analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The formaldehyde release from selected raw materials and packaging was also investigated.

- **Results**: Hidden formaldehyde was found in 23 of the 130 products (18%) without formaldehyde releasers on the ingredient list. The average formaldehyde content was 105ppm (range: 0.5–507ppm) in products with hidden formaldehyde and 355ppm (range: 75–637ppm) in eight products with formaldehyde releasers, selected for HPLC analysis. Impurities of formaldehyde in dihydroxyacetone may be a cause of hidden formaldehyde in self-tanners. No clear pattern was found for the other products with hidden formaldehyde.

- **Conclusions**: Changes in regulation are needed to prevent allergic contact dermatitis from hidden formaldehyde in cosmetic products.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111GqZrm]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed and reported in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement guidelines. We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL, along with Google Scholar, for additional internet sources from their inception until March 2024, focusing on randomized controlled trials of methenamine hippurate versus antibiotic/placebo trials in women with recurrent urinary tract infections. Please refer to the appendix for our search strategy. A highly sensitive search strategy was used to better identify randomized trials in these databases. The references from all included studies and previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses were also searched manually for any additional studies. The prospective meta-analysis protocol was registered on PROSPERO under protocol CRD42024512556.

- **Eligibility criteria for study selection**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed adult women (aged ≥ 18 years) with a history of recurrent or confirmed urinary tract infections (UTIs). Studies were eligible if they compared the efficacy of methenamine hippurate with placebo/no treatment or any antibiotic and reported at least one of the clinical outcomes of interest. We excluded non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs), studies without a methenamine arm or without a comparison to placebo/antibiotics, and studies involving women with catheters or patients with anatomical issues.

### Hiprex [^113ridBz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Hiprex, should only be used to treat bacterial infections, as they do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When Hiprex is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Hiprex or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Microbial phenotypic heterogeneity in response to a metabolic toxin: Continuous, dynamically shifting distribution of formaldehyde tolerance in Methylobacterium extorquens populations [^115ipLY9]. PLoS Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

Given our evidence against genetic mutants, a fourth hypothesis was that the observed growth was due to a small subpopulation of cells that were phenotypically (but not genetically) highly tolerant to formaldehyde. Stress-tolerant individuals may arise in microbial populations stochastically, or they may do so in response to an environmental signal. To investigate whether the hypothesized formaldehyde-tolerant cells were present in the original population or were induced during the course of formaldehyde exposure, we monitored the abundance of formaldehyde-tolerant CFU over time.

Specifically, we repeated the 4 mM formaldehyde exposure experiment and plated the cells harvested at each timepoint on selective agar culture medium (4 mM formaldehyde, allowing the growth of only tolerant cells) and permissive medium (without formaldehyde, to enumerate all cells). We found that at the beginning of the experiment, the M. extorquens population already contained a detectable subpopulation of cells that were able to form colonies in the presence of 4 mM formaldehyde. This subpopulation comprised only a small portion of the total number of cells (a frequency of ~10^−4 in the total population of ~2x10^6 cells) (Fig 2, orange diamond symbols and lines). While the total abundance of cells decreased at an exponential rate between 0 and 20 hours, the formaldehyde-tolerant subpopulation increased at a constant rate for nearly the entire course of the experiment, such that after 20 hours…

### Formaldehyde-releasers: Relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy. Part 2: Metalworking fluids and remainder [^111tAhbQ]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

We have reviewed formaldehyde-releasers used in metalworking fluids (MWFs) in this and a previous part of a two-part article. These biocides do not appear to be frequent or important sensitizers. Even in highly selected patient groups of metalworkers, mean prevalence rates of sensitivity are low: 0.2% for tris(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane, 1.6% for tris(N-hydroxyethyl)hexahydrotriazine, 1.9% for Bioban P-1487 and Bioban CS-1246, and 2.8% for Bioban CS-1135. In the case of the Biobans, many reactions may have been irritant. Only N, N'-methylenebis(5-methyloxazolidine) has a fairly high mean score of 4.0% in metalworkers.

With the exception of Bioban P-1487, there is a clear relationship between positive patch test reactions to the releasers and formaldehyde sensitivity: 40–70% of reactions to releasers occur in patients sensitive to formaldehyde and may therefore be caused by formaldehyde allergy. There is a lack of reliable data on the clinical relevance of contact allergy to the formaldehyde releasers in MWF. In most studies, no data on relevance were provided, and in those that did, relevance was often found for a very small minority of the reactions only.

Also discussed here are the formaldehyde-releasers MDM hydantoin, methenamine, N-methylolchloracetamide, paraformaldehyde, and Preventol D2.

### 'Real-world' compensatory behaviour with low nicotine concentration e-liquid: Subjective effects and nicotine, acrolein and formaldehyde exposure [^113UuVcs]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

The published protocol describes the procedure and measures in detail. Participants were eligible to participate if they were aged 18 or older; experienced and exclusive daily e-cigarette users (defined as daily use for more than three months); currently using a second- or third-generation e-cigarette; using a nicotine concentration e-liquid of 12 mg/ml or higher (to ensure participants were familiar with higher levels of nicotine) or sub-ohming (any nicotine level); and non-smokers, as confirmed by carbon monoxide (CO) levels in expired breath of 10 parts per million (p.p.m.) or less. We excluded pregnant or lactating females, smokers or users of marijuana or other illicit drugs, and those with a serious medical condition (self-reported).

Participants met with the researcher on five separate occasions (at baseline and at the end of each of the four experimental conditions). At baseline, participants provided written informed consent, demographic characteristics, and smoking/vaping history, then sampled four e-liquids (tobacco, fruit, bakery, and menthol), selecting one to be used for the next four weeks. Participants were provided with an eVic Supreme™ by Joytech fitted with a 'Nautilus Aspire' tank housing a BVC atomizer (1.6 Ohm) and seven 10-ml bottles of e-liquid for the week (6 or 18 mg/ml according to the condition).

For each puff, the eVic records: time of the puff, puff length (in seconds), atomizer resistance, voltage, and wattage. To ensure device familiarity before changes were permitted, the first two weeks were always fixed at 4.0 V (10 W) with the widest air-flow setting on the tank. Changes to voltage and a

### Hiprex [^115gsEMv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

**Dosage and administration**: 1 tablet (1.0 g) twice daily (morning and night) for adults and pediatric patients over 12 years of age. For pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age, 1/2 to 1 tablet (0.5 to 1.0 g) twice daily (morning and night) is recommended. Since the antibacterial activity of Hiprex is greater in acidic urine, restriction of alkalinizing foods and medications is desirable. If necessary, as indicated by urinary pH and clinical response, supplemental acidification of the urine should be instituted. The efficacy of therapy should be monitored by repeated urine cultures.

### The resurgence of methenamine hippurate in the prevention of recurrent UTIs in women- a systematic review [^114rYxfR]. Current Opinion in Urology (2023). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women are prevalent and difficult to manage. The rise of antimicrobial resistance makes it prudent to reinvestigate the role of non-antimicrobial agents in the prevention of rUTIs. We aimed to evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that employed methenamine hippurate as a therapy or prophylactic treatment in adult women with rUTIs.

Relevant databases were searched for RCTs using Cochrane methodology and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist, comparing the efficacy of methenamine hippurate to either an antibiotic or a placebo for the prophylaxis of rUTI in women. Six trials involving 322 patients taking methenamine and 419 patients receiving antibiotics were evaluated. The duration of the trials ranged from 12 to 24 months. Studies reported that methenamine was effective in extending the mean period between symptomatic episodes of urinary tract infections (UTIs), keeping the patient symptom- and infection-free, and reducing the number of UTI episodes. The newer studies reported that methenamine reduced the incidence rates of rUTIs and was not inferior to the antibiotic in this regard.

The outcomes of methenamine hippurate were found to be on par with antibiotic prophylaxis. It might serve as a suitable alternative non-antibiotic prophylaxis for females with rUTIs.

### Hiprex [^113F4y36]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Prescribing HIPREX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Precautions**:
	1. Care should be taken to maintain an acid pH of the urine, especially when treating infections due to urea-splitting organisms such as Proteus and strains of Pseudomonas.
	2. In a few instances in one study, the serum transaminase levels were slightly elevated during treatment but returned to normal while the patients were still taking HIPREX. Because of this report, it is recommended that liver function studies be performed periodically on patients taking the drug, especially those with liver dysfunction.
	3. **Use in pregnancy**: In early pregnancy, the safe use of HIPREX is not established. In the last trimester, safety is suggested, but not definitely proved. No adverse effects on the fetus were seen in studies in pregnant rats and rabbits. HIPREX taken during pregnancy can interfere with laboratory tests of urine estriol (resulting in unmeasurably low values) when acid hydrolysis is used in the laboratory procedure. This interference is due to the presence in the urine of methenamine and/or formaldehyde. Enzymatic hydrolysis, in place of acid hydrolysis, will circumvent this problem.
	4. This product contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine), which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible individuals. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity is low, it should be considered in the management of patients who are hypersensitive to this dye.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^116u8kr5]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

In the ALTAR trial, we have demonstrated high levels of efficacy from methenamine hippurate in terms of UTI prevention and have shown that this efficacy is comparable to the guideline-recommended prophylaxis (that is, long course, low-dose antibiotic treatment). The increased rates of antimicrobial resistance development associated with the antibiotic arm, as shown in the primary uropathogen E. coli, might encourage patients and clinicians to consider methenamine hippurate as a first-line treatment for UTI prevention in women.

### Genetically encoded formaldehyde sensors inspired by a protein intra-helical crosslinking reaction [^113scvFe]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

In addition to its broad presence in the environment, various cellular processes, such as one-carbon metabolism and oxidative demethylation on proteins and nucleic acids, produce formaldehyde (FA). As the simplest reactive carbonyl species (RCS), the cytotoxicity of FA has been well documented due to its high reactivity with various biological nucleophiles. Meanwhile, the high physiological abundance of FA (e.g. ~0.1 mM in blood, and 2–4 times higher in the liver and nasal mucosa) indicates potential physiological effects that have been increasingly appreciated. For example, a low concentration of FA is reported to increase human melanoma cell proliferation and MAPK pathway activation. Additionally, FA is found to support the survival of one-carbon-cycle-defective cells. In methylotrophic bacteria, FA even serves as a sole carbon source, being assimilated via the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway.

A major challenge in deciphering the biological roles of FA is the real-time measurement of its concentration, duration, and location in living cells and tissues. Although FA is an abundant molecule in vivo, stringent protection mechanisms have evolved to scavenge this highly reactive RCS, with little knowledge about its intracellular distribution. Fluorescent sensors represent a powerful noninvasive tool for the real-time monitoring of endogenous FA organization in space and time, and small molecule-based FA sensors have been elegantly developed in recent years. Alternatively, genetically encoded, fluorescent protein (FP)-based sensors are advantageous.
