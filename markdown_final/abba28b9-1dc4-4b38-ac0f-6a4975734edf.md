## Question

long term risks of taking vitamin e if using for fatty liver disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the long-term risks of taking vitamin E for fatty liver disease, specifically NAFLD/NASH, and how to weigh those risks in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the specific patient populations in whom vitamin E has evidence of benefit. Then, I should verify the exact dosing used in trials and guidelines. Next, I will examine the major long-term safety signals reported in the literature, including mortality, hemorrhagic stroke, prostate cancer, and bleeding risk. After that, I need to check guideline positions and contraindications, including diabetes, cirrhosis, and pediatrics. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit framework and outline practical monitoring and counseling points, making sure I double-check areas where evidence is conflicting or uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the target population. Vitamin E has the strongest evidence in adults with biopsy-proven NASH who do not have type 2 diabetes, with the pivotal PIVENS trial showing histologic improvement at 800 IU/day over 96 weeks, and this is reflected in AASLD guidance recommending consideration of vitamin E in selected nondiabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH, while emphasizing that it is not recommended for NAFLD without biopsy, NASH with diabetes, or cirrhosis, and that long-term safety remains a concern [^11172oef] [^115vkSAR] [^113f6YEo].

> Wait, let me verify the dose and formulation used in trials and guidance. The effective regimen studied is natural (rrr-alpha) tocopherol 800 IU daily, typically for 96 weeks in adults, with pediatric data from TONIC using the same dose and duration, and this 800 IU/day dose is the one repeatedly linked to both efficacy and safety discussions in guidelines and reviews [^11172oef] [^112uXQ4Z] [^116xVknZ].

> I will now examine the signal for increased all-cause mortality with high-dose vitamin E. Some meta-analytic summaries have suggested a dose-dependent increase in mortality beginning around 400 IU/day, with an estimate of about 39 additional deaths per 10,000 at 400 IU/day, which would imply greater concern at 800 IU/day. However, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because other large meta-analyses and the USPSTF found no significant effect of vitamin E on all-cause mortality in broader populations, and the mortality signal appears inconsistent and influenced by trial selection and dose ranges, so the certainty is low and the applicability to NASH-specific cohorts is uncertain [^111Y7PDh] [^112K72Z8] [^116TDzWb].

> Next, I should review hemorrhagic stroke risk. Several summaries report a roughly 20% relative increase in hemorrhagic stroke with high-dose vitamin E, translating to about 1 additional hemorrhagic stroke per 1,250 patients treated, and this mechanistically aligns with vitamin E's antiplatelet effects. I need to ensure we flag patients with bleeding disorders, on anticoagulants, or at high fall risk, and counsel accordingly [^111Y7PDh] [^112K72Z8] [^11172oef].

> I will now examine prostate cancer risk. A large RCT in older men (SELECT) reported a modest increase in prostate cancer incidence with vitamin E, with an absolute increase of about 1.6 per 1,000 person-years in one analysis, and this risk is consistently highlighted in hepatology guidelines as a key discussion point for men considering long-term high-dose vitamin E, particularly those over 50 years old [^113f6YEo] [^11172oef].

> Let me consider bleeding risk more broadly. High-dose vitamin E can impair platelet aggregation and increase bleeding tendency, which is especially relevant in patients on warfarin, antiplatelet agents, or with thrombocytopenia. I should confirm concomitant medications and counsel on peri-procedural management if surgery or invasive procedures are planned [^11172oef] [^111Y7PDh].

> Hold on, I should verify other potential harms. Observational and trial syntheses have also flagged possible associations with heart failure exacerbation and, in some contexts, liver enzyme elevations, though the latter is not a consistent signal in NASH trials; given the lack of antifibrotic benefit and the absence of FDA approval, these additional concerns reinforce a conservative stance outside the narrow, evidence-based population [^115p8BYA] [^112wpYi7].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. AASLD recommends vitamin E may be considered in selected nondiabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH, but not in diabetes, not in NAFLD without biopsy, not in NASH cirrhosis, and not in cryptogenic cirrhosis, and it explicitly notes insufficient evidence in cirrhosis. AACE/AASLD similarly advises against vitamin E in T2DM and in advanced fibrosis, and EASL concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin E as a MASH-targeted therapy broadly, reflecting ongoing uncertainty and the need to individualize decisions [^115vkSAR] [^115nXuuo] [^113f6YEo].

> But wait, what about pediatrics. I should double-check pediatric guidance. In children, TONIC showed histologic benefit in a post hoc NASH subgroup, yet primary ALT endpoints were not met and AASLD pediatric guidance remains cautious, stating vitamin E may be considered with risks and benefits discussed, while noting long-term safety is unknown; more recent pediatric statements emphasize that routine use is not established and that evidence is mixed, reinforcing shared decision-making and lifestyle-first strategies [^114LfrR4] [^1168ns4f] [^117AqAc7].

> I need to ensure the risk–benefit synthesis is precise. Benefits are largely confined to histologic improvement in nondiabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH at 800 IU/day, with no proven antifibrotic effect and no established reduction in hard clinical outcomes in randomized trials, whereas risks include a possible increase in all-cause mortality in some meta-analyses, a small but real increase in hemorrhagic stroke, a modest increase in prostate cancer in older men, and increased bleeding risk. Taken together, guidelines frame vitamin E as a conditional, second-line option after lifestyle failure and only in the narrow, evidence-based population, with explicit avoidance in diabetes and cirrhosis [^11172oef] [^115vkSAR] [^113f6YEo].

> Let me outline practical counseling and monitoring, and I should confirm each element against guidance. Before prescribing, I should document biopsy-proven NASH, exclude diabetes, and discuss prostate cancer risk in men, bleeding risk, and drug interactions; during therapy, I would reassess at 6–12 months with liver enzymes and clinical status, and if there is no biochemical or clinical improvement, discontinue; I would avoid use beyond 2 years given the absence of long-term safety data and the lack of antifibrotic benefit, and I would coordinate with the patient's primary care and cardiology teams for overall risk management [^11172oef] [^115vkSAR] [^116GAMwZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that vitamin E improves fibrosis; I should correct that. PIVENS and subsequent guidance consistently show no significant antifibrotic effect, so expectations should be set around NASH resolution and enzyme improvement rather than fibrosis regression, which is a critical distinction for long-term prognosis discussions [^11172oef] [^112uXQ4Z].

> In summary, the main long-term risks of high-dose vitamin E at 800 IU/day in fatty liver disease are a possible increase in all-cause mortality in some meta-analyses, a small increase in hemorrhagic stroke, a modest increase in prostate cancer in older men, and increased bleeding risk. These risks must be weighed against histologic benefits limited to nondiabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH, with no proven antifibrotic or hard-outcome benefit, leading guidelines to recommend selective, time-limited use only in that narrow group after shared decision-making and close monitoring [^11172oef] [^115vkSAR] [^111suZ4b].

Vitamin E at 800 IU/day for NAFLD/NASH carries **long-term risks** including increased hemorrhagic stroke [^11172oef], higher prostate cancer incidence in men [^113f6YEo], and possible all-cause mortality at high doses [^111Y7PDh]. It is **not recommended for patients with diabetes, cirrhosis, or advanced fibrosis** [^115nXuuo] [^111suZ4b], and long-term safety beyond 2 years is uncertain [^116yivu7]. Use should be limited to non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH [^113f6YEo] after discussing risks and benefits, with regular monitoring for adverse effects.

## Long-term risks of vitamin E supplementation in NAFLD

### Hemorrhagic stroke

Evidence from large randomized trials and meta-analyses shows a **modest increase in hemorrhagic stroke risk** with high-dose vitamin E (≥ 400 IU/day) [^11172oef] [^111Y7PDh]. The mechanism is likely related to vitamin E's antiplatelet effects, which increase bleeding risk [^notfound].

---

### Prostate cancer

The SELECT trial found a **significant increase in prostate cancer incidence** with vitamin E supplementation (400 IU/day) in men [^113f6YEo]. This risk is particularly relevant for older men considering long-term vitamin E therapy for NAFLD [^111Y7PDh].

---

### All-cause mortality

Meta-analyses suggest a **possible increase in all-cause mortality** with high-dose vitamin E supplementation (≥ 400 IU/day), although findings are inconsistent and debated [^111Y7PDh] [^112K72Z8]. The risk appears dose-dependent, with higher doses associated with greater mortality risk [^111Y7PDh].

---

### Other potential risks

- **Drug interactions**: Vitamin E may interact with anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications, increasing bleeding risk [^notfound].

- **Liver injury**: Although rare, high-dose vitamin E supplementation has been associated with liver enzyme elevations and hepatotoxicity in some cases [^notfound].

- **Long-term safety uncertainty**: The longest randomized trials of vitamin E in NAFLD have been limited to 2 years, and the long-term safety beyond this duration remains uncertain [^115NMDL6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines provide **specific recommendations** regarding vitamin E supplementation in NAFLD:

- **AASLD guidelines**: Vitamin E (800 IU/day) may be considered for non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH [^113f6YEo]. It is not recommended for patients with diabetes, cirrhosis, or advanced fibrosis [^113f6YEo].

- **AACE guidelines**: Vitamin E can be considered for NASH in patients without type 2 diabetes, but not for those with diabetes or advanced fibrosis [^115nXuuo].

- **EASL guidelines**: Insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin E as a targeted therapy for MASLD/MASH [^111suZ4b].

---

## Summary of long-term risks

| **Risk** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Hemorrhagic stroke | High | Modest increase with high-dose vitamin E |
| Prostate cancer | High | Significant increase in men |
| All-cause mortality | Moderate | Possible increase with high-dose vitamin E |
| Drug interactions | High | Increased bleeding risk with anticoagulants |
| Liver injury | Low | Rare hepatotoxicity reported |
| Long-term safety | High | Uncertainty beyond 2 years |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Patient selection**: Vitamin E supplementation should be limited to non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH, after careful consideration of risks and benefits [^113f6YEo].

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of liver enzymes, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men, and bleeding parameters is recommended during long-term vitamin E therapy [^notfound].

- **Alternative therapies**: Lifestyle modifications, weight loss, and other pharmacological agents (e.g. pioglitazone, GLP-1 receptor agonists) should be considered as alternatives or adjuncts to vitamin E therapy [^114PgkHw].

- **Duration of therapy**: Long-term use beyond 2 years is not well-studied, and caution is advised regarding prolonged supplementation [^11172oef] [^115NMDL6].

Therapies with no clear benefit

Several well recognized pharmacotherapies have been investigated in NASH; currently, they are not recommended for its treatment.

Metformin

Although metformin initially seemed promising in animal models of NASH, no histological improvement in steatohepatitis has been shown in RCTs in adult and paediatric NASH. Low-dose metformin could not mitigate the weight gain associated with rosiglitazone in a recent RCT, although its effect seems likely to be through weight loss in the small number of treated patients. As it has no effect on histology, metformin is not currently recommended as a targeted treatment for NAFLD.

Statins

Statins are well recognized in the treatment of dyslipidaemia, but their use as a specific treatment for NAFLD is not well evidenced. Data from the Greek Atorvastatin and Coronary Heart Disease Evaluation study did, however, demonstrate a fall in ALT levels with atorvastatin and the St Francis Heart Study showed a reduction in steatosis radiologically with 20 mg daily of atorvastatin combined with vitamins C and E. There are, however, no histological data currently available to support the use of atorvastatin for NAFLD. Although histological data exist for simvastatin, in a trial of 10 patients with biopsy-proven NASH, there was no statistically significant improvement in serum liver enzymes, hepatic steatosis, necroinflammatory activity or stage of fibrosis within or between treatment and placebo. However, its use to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with NAFLD is clear and there is no evidence to suggest that patients with NAFLD are at increased risk of statin-related liver injury.

Ursodeoxycholic acid

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), by preventing apoptosis and downregulating inflammatory pathways, is an example of a potential cytoprotective agent investigated in NASH. The largest study to date comparing UDCA and placebo showed an unanticipated improvement in the placebo arm, making the effect of the drug hard to interpret. A Cochrane review of four randomized trials using UDCA showed no significant improvement in liver function tests and histological data were lacking. Until there is evidence of clear histological benefit, UDCA cannot be currently recommended for NASH.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids

Despite preliminary data from small studies suggesting that ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reduces liver fat content, a large trial testing two doses of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid did not show any histological efficacy.

### How would you manage this patient with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115HtRtX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common diagnosis in the United States and other developed countries, has been increasing in prevalence. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recently published updated practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing NAFLD, including the following recommendations: Routine screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups is not advised because of uncertainties surrounding test and treatment options, along with a lack of knowledge about cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits. Noninvasive studies, including biomarkers from laboratory tests and liver stiffness measured through elastography, are clinically useful tools for identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with NAFLD who are at increased risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or advanced fibrosis. Weight loss of at least 3% to 5% generally reduces NASH, but greater weight loss (7% to 10%) is needed to improve most histopathologic features, including fibrosis. Pharmacologic therapies (such as pioglitazone and vitamin E) should be considered only in patients with biopsy-proven NASH. Patients with NAFLD should not consume heavy amounts of alcohol, although insufficient data exist to provide advice about other levels of alcohol use. Here, 2 clinicians with expertise in this area debate whether to screen for NAFLD in primary care, how to monitor patients with NAFLD, and what interventions should be used to manage this condition.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: new treatments [^111Y7PDh]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The results of these studies with vitamin E need to be balanced against the emerging body of data that vitamin E may increase all-cause mortality: an additional 39 deaths per 10 000 people for those on high-dose (400 IU/day) vitamin E in a dose-dependent manner starting at 150 IU/day, much less than the doses trialled in NASH. Furthermore, vitamin E therapy may be associated with an increase in prostate cancer in men above 50 years old according to a large study of 35 000 patients, and a 20% increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke. In light of these risks, the current American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines recommend that use of vitamin E may be considered in nondiabetic adults with NASH, but not diabetic patients or children.

Vitamin E — therapeutic effects, key trials, and safety in NASH/NAFLD: The text summarizes that "(1) the use of vitamin E is associated with a decrease in aminotransferases in subjects with NASH, (2) studies in which histological endpoints were evaluated indicate that vitamin E results in improvement in steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning and resolution of SH in a proportion of nondiabetic adults with NASH, and (3) vitamin E did not have an effect on HF". In PIVENS, the pure form of rr-?-tocopherol "800 IU/day" was used "for 96 weeks", and the primary endpoint was more frequent with vitamin E than placebo "(42% vs. 19%; P < 0.001, number needed to treat = 4.4)". In TONIC (children), vitamin E "(800 IU/day)" versus metformin "(500 mg twice-daily)" and placebo showed that "resolution of NASH was significantly greater" with vitamin E "(58% vs. 28%; P = 0.006)". Safety concerns include that "doses of > 800 IU/day were associated with increased all-cause mortality", while critiques and subsequent analyses indicated exclusions and that "the differences were driven by imbalance in males in the trials in question".

Description of the intervention and how it might work

As oxidative stress is reported to be causative in NAFLD initiation and progression, antioxidant supplements may potentially protect cellular structures against damage from oxygen‐free radicals and reactive products of lipid peroxidation. A number of antioxidants such as vitamin E, silymarin, betaine, and N‐acetylcysteine are also being studied. A 2011 Cochrane review also reported that antioxidant supplements might increase liver enzyme activity.

Vitamin E (α‐tocopherol), a fat‐soluble antioxidant, is the major type of lipid‐soluble, chain‐breaking antioxidant found in the human body. It occurs naturally in foods such as nuts, seeds, and leafy green vegetables. Vitamin E was first described in 1922 as a dietary factor essential to prevent foetal reabsorption in rats, and soon after it was identified as an antioxidant of polyunsaturated lipids. It was considered a cytoprotective factor with suggested roles in preventing inflammatory and degenerative processes of the liver during exposure to a range of xenobiotics, environmental pollutants, and dietary factors.

Recently, convincing evidence from animal studies found a preventive role of vitamin E in metabolic and inflammatory abnormalities associated with NAFLD, which was confirmed in clinical trials. Since the 2000s, vitamin E has been studied in monotherapy or with other agents in many clinical trials to treat NAFLD, and Sanyal and colleagues showed that vitamin E, but not pioglitazone, improved the histological features of NASH. Results from these studies showed that vitamin E relieved NASH‐associated injury and inflammation, decreased intrahepatic triglycerides, and improved lipid metabolism. However, a 2021 Cochrane network meta‐analysis conducted by Komolafe and colleagues reported no effects of vitamin E on all clinical outcomes for people with NAFLD when compared to no additional intervention; the authors also reported that data were sparse.

The dosages of vitamin E used in studies range from 39 IU per day to 1000 IU per day; duration of administration ranged from one month to 96 weeks. However, high‐dose vitamin E (400 IU per day or greater) might increase the risk of all‐cause mortality, bleeding, and prostate cancer.

### Effects of liraglutide on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11746gMr]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common public health problem worldwide, with an estimated 415 million confirmed cases in 2015. It is expected that the number of confirmed cases of T2DM will reach 642 million by 2040. Studies have revealed a strong relationship between T2DM and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with reports suggesting that about 70–90% of patients with T2DM are likely to suffer from NAFLD. In turn, NAFLD may become a crucial contributor to liver-related mortality. Liver transplantation during the next 5 years is also expected to increase at an alarming rate in patients with T2DM.

The histologic spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. It is important to note that patients with NAFLD who progress to NASH are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to liver and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent and treat NAFLD in order to manage T2DM. Unfortunately, there are currently no approved therapies with beneficial effects for the management of NAFLD in patients with T2DM. Lifestyle modifications, including dietary modifications and weight loss, still play a vital role in the management of NAFLD. Although many studies have explored the role of several pharmacological agents, such as statins, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E, and pioglitazone, in the treatment of NAFLD, few have reported beneficial results. In addition, the concerns regarding the side effects and long-term safety profiles of these agents, such as pioglitazone and vitamin E, have limited their use for treatment. Bariatric and metabolic sugery (BMS) is one of the most efficient and scientifically successful methods for treating patients with excessive amount of adipose tissue, and it has also shown to be a promising strategy for the treatment of obesity, T2DM and co-morbidities. However, owing to safety issues, BMS is still not recommended by American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases to specifically treat NAFLD and NASH.

4.5 Treatment of the NASH itself

In many instances, the treatment of the root cause is associated with de‐fatting of the liver, normalization of liver enzymes and a decrease in liver stiffness measured by fibroscan. Given the variability of fibroscan readings over time, it is our approach to use 2D MRE to follow those who have been initiated on drug treatment. In selected individuals, with stage‐3 fibrosis or higher, we use vitamin E (400‐800 IU/d of rrr alpha tocopherol). This has been shown to reduce disease activity and in those with a two point or greater decrease in the NAFLD activity score, fibrosis also tends to improve. 35, 129 The potential risks of vitamin E use have been largely debunked, and its use must also take in to consideration the potential risk of leaving NASH untreated vs the risks of the drug. Further, vitamin E primarily benefits those with a haptoglobin 2 genotype, and we use this to also determine who to treat. 130 This is not however routinely available in clinics, and this represents something that is currently available at our centre on a research‐basis only.

There are also several studies demonstrating the benefit of pioglitazone a PPAR‐γ agonist. It improves steatohepatitis, disease activity scores and also may improve fibrosis. 10 Its use is limited by weight gain and is therefore often used as a second‐line treatment.

4.6 Summary

The optimal pharmacological treatment of NASH must be considered in the context of the disease stage and the comorbidity profile and status of key extrahepatic end‐organs. The treatment of the root cause of the disease, that is, excess adiposity without losing muscle mass is a central theme for the management of these patients. Several recently approved agents demonstrate not only weight loss but improve all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in high‐risk overweight/obese individuals and can be considered if the patient has excess adiposity. Specific anti‐NASH agents can be used to complement these approaches. As new drugs are approved for NASH, their use will need to be integrated in to the overall care of this multisystem disorder.

### Vitamin E improves transplant-free survival and hepatic decompensation among patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis And advanced fibrosis [^111465Bt]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin E improves liver histology in adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) but not diabetes, but its impact on long-term patient outcomes is unknown. We evaluated whether vitamin E treatment improves clinical outcomes of NASH patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. Two hundred and thirty-six patients with biopsy-proven NASH and bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis seen at Indiana University Medical Center between October 2004 and January 2016 were included. Ninety of them took 800 international units/day of vitamin E for ≥ 2 years (vitamin E users) and were propensity-matched to 90 adults who did not take vitamin E (controls) after adjusting for fibrosis severity, age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities and their treatment, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, liver biochemistries, and length of follow-up on vitamin E. Covariate-adjusted Cox and competing risk regression models were assessed to evaluate the association between vitamin E treatment and patient outcomes. The median follow-up was 5.62 (interquartile range [IQR], 4.3–7.5) and 5.6 (IQR, 4–6.9) years for vitamin E users and controls, respectively. Vitamin E users had higher adjusted transplant-free survival (78% versus 49%, P < 0.01) and lower rates of hepatic decompensation (37% versus 62%, P = 0.04) than controls. After controlling for severity of fibrosis, calendar year of patient enrollment, and other potential confounders, vitamin E treatment decreased the risk of death or transplant (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12–0.74; P < 0.01) and hepatic decompensation (adjusted sub-HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.28–0.96; P = 0.036). These benefits were evident in both those with diabetes and those without diabetes. Adjusted 10-year cumulative probabilities of hepatocellular carcinoma, vascular events, and nonhepatic cancers were not different between vitamin E-exposed patients and controls. Conclusion: Vitamin E use was associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with NASH and bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis.

### Current concepts in pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114aANwH]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of disease. Its increasing prevalence is a direct result of historically high rates of obesity. Hepatocyte lipid accumulation is the first step in a cascade of metabolic and inflammatory events thought to precipitate NAFLD. Histologic findings provide insight into these events. Lifestyle modification remains the primary therapy in children. Current recommendations include vitamin E treatment in those with biopsy-proven NASH. Trials of novel drugs are ongoing in adults. As efficacy/safety are established, these therapies may be tenable for use in children. At the current time, biopsy-driven histology endpoints are necessary to establish whether future therapies can improve pediatric or adult-type NASH in children.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: new treatments [^116jjvS6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose of review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of liver dysfunction in the western world because of its close association with obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a particular health concern due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with progressive disease. At present, without specific targeted pharmacological therapies, the mainstay of therapy remains weight loss through dietary modification and lifestyle change; thus, the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent evidence for current and emerging therapies in NASH.

Recent findings

Some existing medications, including pioglitazones and angiotensin receptor antagonists, may be repurposed to help treat this condition. Vitamin E may improve histology in NASH, but safety issues limit its use. Recently, a number of novel agents specifically targeting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease pathogenesis have entered clinical trials, including the farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid, which has shown significant histological improvements in steatohepatitis and fibrosis.

Summary

Diet/lifestyle modification remains the mainstay of treatment. For patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis, current liver-directed pharmacotherapy with vitamin E and pioglitazone offer some benefits; obeticholic acid appears promising and is currently being tested. Comorbidities must be diagnosed and treated; cardiovascular disease remains a primary cause of death in these patients.

Background

Description of the condition

Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an overarching term that includes all disease grades and stages, and refers to a population in which ≥ 5% of hepatocytes display macrovesicular steatosis in the absence of a readily identified alternative cause of steatosis (e.g. medications, starvation, monogenic disorders) in people without excessive alcohol intake (defined as less than 20 g/day for women and less than 30 g/day for men). The spectrum of disease includes non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), characterised by macrovesicular hepatic steatosis that may be accompanied by mild inflammation, and non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is additionally characterised by the presence of inflammation and cellular injury (ballooning), with or without fibrosis. NASH may progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer.

Since June 2023, NAFLD has been replaced by the term 'metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease' (MASLD). The diagnosis of the disease is no longer made by exclusion; the positive diagnostic criteria are in the presence of hepatic steatosis, with one or more of the five cardiometabolic risk factors:

body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m² (≥ 23 kg/m² for Asians) or waist circumference > 94 cm for males and > 80 cm for females or ethnicity adjusted;
fasting serum glucose ≥ 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or two‐hour post‐load glucose levels ≥ 7.8 mmol/L (≥ 140 mg/dL) or glycated haemoglobin ≥ 5.7% (39 mmol/L) or type 2 diabetes or treatment for type 2 diabetes;
blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg or specific antihypertensive drug treatment;
plasma triglycerides ≥ 1.70 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) or lipid‐lowering treatment; and
plasma high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ≤ 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) for males and ≤ 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) for females or lipid‐lowering treatment.

### Therapeutic approaches for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^111KtWp7]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Combinations of SGLT-2 inhibitors with GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide and dapagliflozin) have been shown to improve markers of steatosis and fibrosis in T2D patients, but effects on histological endpoints are still unknown.

Vitamin E improved liver histology in non-diabetic NASH patients without cirrhosis, so its use can be recommended in this specific patient category, dosed at 800 IU/day according to the PIVENS trial data. Indeed, vitamin E was ineffective in treating NASH in patients with T2D, while the combination of vitamin E and pioglitazone was significantly better than placebo. Although a recent large meta-analysis did not confirm earlier safety issues, the risk of prostate cancer in males is an issue of concern.

Drugs in development

There is currently no pharmacological treatment that has NASH in its label. There is, however, a large pipeline of drugs being tested, some of them already in phase III.

Indeed, numerous drugs are currently being tested for the treatment of NASH. The development is complex, as different endpoints can be defined and a variety of targets proposed. Efficacy must be present on the following clinical endpoints: development of cirrhosis, cirrhosis-related complications and all-cause mortality. Due to the long duration of these phase III–IV trials, drugs can be applied for conditional approval based on histological benefit, which is considered a reasonable surrogate for later clinical outcomes. Histological benefit is defined as resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis, or improvement in at least one stage of fibrosis without worsening of NASH.

An important consequence of these considerations is the necessity of histological proof of efficacy and serial biopsies. In the following paragraphs we will briefly discuss the most important drug classes currently under investigation. An extensive review of all potential targets is beyond the scope of this review, so we will focus on the major classes. The most important phase II and III trials are summarized in Table 4.

### Analogy between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hypertension: a stepwise patient-tailored approach for NASH treatment [^115jA3js]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Several controlled trials have shown some benefits in patients with NASH. The PIVENS trial showed that vitamin E was superior to placebo for the treatment of NASH in adults without diabetes; in the Flint trial, obeticholic acid improved the histological features of NASH; the LEAN trial showed liraglutide to be safe and associated with histological resolution of several parameters of NASH; in the Golden trial, GFT505, a dual agonist of the PPARα and PPARδ isoforms, showed some benefits in subsets of patients.

The potential risks of using some of these drugs may prohibit their long-term use in large populations of patients with NAFLD: pioglitazone is associated with weight gain; obeticholic acid may lead to hyperlipidemia in a significant proportion of patients; and vitamin E is associated with potential long-term risks.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: pharmacologic and surgical options [^1151RdKA]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen many studies examining the prevalence and natural history of NAFLD in the United States and it is clear that this disease is likely to be an important cause of liver-related morbidity in the future. Several pharmacologic therapies have shown some promise; currently, vitamin E and insulin-sensitizing agents such as pioglitazone can be considered in appropriate cases. Conservative measures to promote weight loss still have a role to play, but the obesity epidemic in the Western World has reached such proportions that bariatric surgery is proving to be an attractive option for patients with a BMI greater than 35 to 40 kg/m². Well-designed prospective studies are required to ensure that all of these therapies are safe and effective in the long term. Newer agents will likely be investigated as the pathogenesis of NAFLD and fibrosis progression in NASH are further elucidated.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: new treatments [^111BAarK]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of liver dysfunction in the western world because of its close association with obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a particular health concern due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with progressive disease. At present, without specific targeted pharmacological therapies, the mainstay of therapy remains weight loss through dietary modification and lifestyle change; thus, the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent evidence for current and emerging therapies in NASH.

Recent Findings

Some existing medications, including pioglitazones and angiotensin receptor antagonists, may be repurposed to help treat this condition. Vitamin E may improve histology in NASH, but safety issues limit its use. Recently, a number of novel agents specifically targeting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease pathogenesis have entered clinical trials, including the farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid, which has shown significant histological improvements in steatohepatitis and fibrosis.

Summary

Diet/lifestyle modification remains the mainstay of treatment. For patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis, current liver-directed pharmacotherapy with vitamin E and pioglitazone offer some benefits; obeticholic acid appears promising and is currently being tested. Comorbidities must be diagnosed and treated; cardiovascular disease remains a primary cause of death in these patients.

### Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in overweight and obese children seeking ambulatory healthcare in nairobi, Kenya [^1124HfXZ]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a progressive disease that ranges from simple hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). When left untreated, it evolves into hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.NAFLD is associated with cardiovascular morbidity in children and teenagersand is now considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome which comprises obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and insulin resistance. Early detection and initiation of management which is primarily targeted at weight reduction through a healthy dietary intake and increased physical activity with supplementation of vitamin E and administration of metformin in select cases has been shown to reverse the disease process.

According to the WHO, being overweight or obese is ranked as the fifth-leading risk factor for global mortality. This is a rising public health concern for school-going children in low/middle-income countries due to an increase in sedentary lifestyle. In Kenya, this has been seen mainly in children from urban areas and of high socioeconomic status.

The clinical onset of NAFLD is insidious, and often asymptomatic. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is an invasive procedure with attendant risks. Liver ultrasonography is a non-invasive screening tool and has a predictive value of 87%–94% for fat load of the liver above 30%.

Establishing the prevalence of NAFLD in our population will inform needed public health messages in preventing the disease process, serve as a benchmark for long-term follow-up, and aid in decreasing associated morbidity and mortality. Identifying at-risk children and detecting cases using non-invasive screening methods is an important strategy against NAFLD.

Until further data supporting its effectiveness become available, vitamin E is not recommended to treat NASH in diabetic patients, NAFLD without liver biopsy, NASH cirrhosis, or cryptogenic cirrhosis (Strength − 1, Quality − C).

Vitamin E in adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) — evidence overview: Vitamin E is an anti-oxidant and has been investigated to treat NASH, and the page summarizes that vitamin E use is associated with a decrease in aminotransferases, causes improvement in steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning with resolution of steatohepatitis in adults with NASH, and has no effect on hepatic fibrosis, although two meta-analyses failed to observe significant histological benefits before PIVENS and TONIC. In the largest clinical trial (PIVENS), the pure form of rr α-tocopherol was administered at 800 IU/day for 96 weeks, and the primary endpoint was achieved more often with vitamin E than placebo (42% vs. 19%, P < 0.001, number needed to treat = 4.4). The page also notes a concern about the controversial issue of whether vitamin E increases all-cause mortality.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes mellitus: pathogenesis and treatment [^116JCh6B]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently coexist as they share the pathogenic abnormalities of excess adiposity and insulin resistance. Although type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is due to a relative lack of insulin, an increased prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance in this population means that NAFLD also commonly coexists with this condition. Both T2DM and NAFLD are associated with adverse outcomes of the other; T2DM is a risk factor for progressive liver disease and liver-related death in patients with NAFLD, whereas NAFLD may be a marker of cardiovascular risk and mortality in individuals with T2DM. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-a histological subtype of NAFLD characterized by hepatocyte injury and inflammation-is present in approximately 10% of patients with T2DM and is associated with an increased risk for the development of cirrhosis and liver-related death. Current treatment strategies aim to improve insulin resistance via weight loss and exercise, improve insulin sensitivity by the use of insulin-sensitizing agents (for example, pioglitazone) and reduce oxidative stress by the use of antioxidants, such as vitamin E. Pioglitazone and vitamin E supplementation show the most promise in improving hepatic steatosis and inflammation but have not yet been demonstrated to improve fibrosis, and concern remains regarding the toxicity of long-term use of both of these agents.

### An endocrine perspective of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [^1172Ya3y]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Endocrinologists are encountering patients with obesity-related complications such as metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on a daily basis. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver condition characterized by insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and frequently T2DM. This is now the most common chronic liver condition in adults and is present in the majority of obese subjects. Liver fat accumulation may range from simple steatosis to severe steatohepatitis with hepatocyte necroinflammation (or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]). Although the natural history is incompletely understood, NAFLD may lead to serious medical consequences ranging from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma to earlier onset of T2DM and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The diagnosis of NAFLD may be challenging because signs and symptoms are frequently absent or nonspecific, and thus easily missed. Liver aminotransferases may be helpful if elevated, but most times are normal in the presence of the disease. Liver imaging may assist in the diagnosis (ultrasound or MRI and spectroscopy) but a definitive diagnosis of NASH still requires a liver biopsy. This may change in the near future as novel biomarkers become available. Treatment of NAFLD includes aggressive management of associated cardiovascular risk factors and many times control of T2DM. Pioglitazone and vitamin E appear promising for patients with NASH, although long-term studies are unavailable. In summary, this review hopes to address the common clinical dilemmas that endocrinologists face in the diagnosis and management of NAFLD and increase awareness of a potentially serious medical condition.

### Treatment options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^111Bd6nZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease comprises a range of disorders from steatosis and steatohepatitis through to cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis can progress to cirrhosis and liver-related death. Therefore, managing this common disorder is becoming an important public health issue. Lifestyle measures are commonly suggested but robust data are lacking. Trials with antioxidants (vitamin E, betaine) as well as cytoprotectants (ursodeoxycholic acid) have been disappointing. While data for insulin sensitizers such as metformin are less conclusive, thiazolidinediones appear promising. However, not all patients respond to thiazolidinediones. Moreover, issues related to weight gain, cardiovascular risk need to be addressed. The use of endocannabinoid antagonists and insulin secretagogues are novel strategies to combat this disorder.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pharmacotherapy — There are currently no US Food and Drug Administration–approved pharmacologic agents for treating NASH specifically; among non–Food and Drug Administration–approved options, vitamin E (800 IU/d) improved steatohepatitis in patients with biopsy-proven NASH without T2D in a large randomized trial. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) available as a daily injection for T2D and obesity, showed reversal of steatohepatitis and amelioration of fibrosis progression after 12 months in 52 subjects with biopsy-proven NASH, and a daily formulation of semaglutide improved liver histology in 320 patients with biopsy-proven NASH; the primary outcome was NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis, with the highest dose of semaglutide (0.4 mg/d) compared with 17% in the placebo group, and dose-dependent gastrointestinal adverse effects including nausea, constipation, and vomiting occurred more frequently with semaglutide (0.4 mg) than placebo.

Patients must adhere to a low-fat diet (< 20% fat) and take supplemental vitamin E and essential fatty acids during lomitapide treatment, and regulators required oversight as the FDA mandated a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy and the EMA developed a risk management plan. In the pivotal Phase 3 study, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were common: GI AEs were experienced by 93% and 74% of patients during the efficacy and safety phases, respectively, and three of 29 patients discontinued due to GI-related AEs and stopped by week 12. Hepatic enzyme elevations occurred, with 34.5% having alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) on 1 or more occasions and 4 patients experiencing levels > 5× ULN.

As inflammation and oxidative stress are thought to be important causes of liver cancer and liver disease, antioxidants might have a beneficial effect. Several previous observational studies have indicated that higher serum levels of serum α -tocopherol, β -carotene, and retinol are associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer or disease. Other studies, including trials, have reported beneficial effects of vitamin E supplementation on these outcomes including recent data on non-diabetic persons with NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) in the PIVENS (Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis) trial that has served as the basis of recent AASLD clinical recommendations. Concordant results were recently found for the use of vitamin E supplements and liver cancer in an observational cohort in Shanghai, China. However, the long-term effect of vitamin E supplementation on liver disease is unclear.

Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in primary care and endocrinology settings — conclusions state that screening should involve calculation of the individual's liver fibrosis risk (FIB-4), followed by additional plasma biomarkers and/or liver imaging based on fibrosis risk stratification into low, indeterminate, or high risk of developing future cirrhosis, with referral to a liver specialist for those in the higher-risk groups. Treatment must include consideration of weight-loss medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) given proven benefit for steatohepatitis and bariatric surgery, and some diabetes medications, such as pioglitazone and GLP-1 RAs, should be preferred for those with T2D and NASH, particularly when at indeterminate or high risk of developing future cirrhosis. Management should also include careful control of CV risk factors, such as hypertension and atherogenic dyslipidemia. In the meantime, clinicians should become more familiar with the utilization of diabetes agents, such as pioglitazone or the GLP-1 RAs, although these agents are not FDA approved for the treatment of NASH; vitamin E has also shown benefit in people with NASH without diabetes. Pediatric NAFLD is also becoming a growing concern, but there is limited awareness among health care professionals about the problem.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: common questions and answers on diagnosis and management [^116HUNgv]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease in the United States, affecting up to 30% of adults. There are two forms of NAFLD: nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), defined as 5% or greater hepatic steatosis without hepatocellular injury or fibrosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined as 5% or greater hepatic steatosis plus hepatocellular injury and inflammation, with or without fibrosis. Individuals with obesity are at highest risk of NAFLD. Other established risk factors include metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although NAFLD is common and typically asymptomatic, screening is not currently recommended, even in high-risk patients. NAFLD should be suspected in patients with elevated liver enzymes or hepatic steatosis on abdominal imaging that are found incidentally. Once other causes, such as excessive alcohol use and hepatotoxic medications, are excluded in these patients, risk scores or elastography tests can be used to identify those who are likely to have fibrosis that will progress to cirrhosis. Liver biopsy should be considered for patients at increased risk of fibrosis and when other liver disorders cannot be excluded with noninvasive tests. Weight loss through diet and exercise is the primary treatment for NAFLD. Other treatments, such as bariatric surgery, vitamin E supplements, and pharmacologic therapy with thiazolidinediones or glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues, have shown potential benefit; however, data are limited, and these therapies are not considered routine treatments. NAFL typically follows an indolent course, whereas patients with NASH are at higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and end-stage liver disease.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112wpYi7]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

NAFLD — Off-label pharmacologic management addresses comorbidities and clarifies what is and is not appropriate for NASH. There are no FDA-approved medications for NAFLD, but drugs for comorbidities with potential benefit may be considered. Semaglutide can be considered for its approved indications in NASH because it confers cardiovascular benefit and improves NASH; pioglitazone improves NASH and can be considered for NASH in T2DM; vitamin E can be considered in select individuals without diabetes as it improves NASH. Available data on semaglutide, pioglitazone, and vitamin E do not show an antifibrotic benefit and these compounds have not been carefully studied in cirrhosis. Metformin, UDCA, DPP-4, statins, and silymarin should not be used to treat NASH due to lack of meaningful histological benefit. Statins are safe and recommended for cardiovascular risk reduction across NAFLD, including compensated cirrhosis; in decompensated cirrhosis, data are limited but use could be considered in high cardiovascular risk with careful monitoring. Hypertriglyceridemia management includes lifestyle changes and omega-3 fatty acids, icosapent ethyl, or fibrates.

Pioglitazone trials in nondiabetic NASH — In an RCT of 74 patients with NASH, pioglitazone 30 mg/day for 12 months did not significantly improve steatosis versus placebo but significantly ameliorated hepatocellular injury and fibrosis. In the PIVENS trial of 247 nondiabetic patients randomized to pioglitazone (30 mg/day), vitamin E (800 IU/day), or placebo for 24 months, the primary endpoint — an improvement in NAS by ≥ 2 points with specified component improvements and no increase in fibrosis — was achieved in 34% with pioglitazone versus 19% with placebo (P = 0.04 vs. placebo) and 43% with vitamin E (P = 0.001 vs. placebo); because two primary comparisons were prespecified, a P value of 0.025 was considered significant a priori, and the study concluded that pioglitazone did not meet the primary endpoint.

### The efficacy of vitamin E in reducing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression [^113CJcBt]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background:

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects up to 30% of the population. Clinical trials have questioned the role of vitamin E in the treatment of NAFLD with or without other interventions, with still no firm conclusion reached. This study aims to examine the efficiency of vitamin E alone or combined in the management of NAFLD.

Methods:

We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid, EBSCO host, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the role of vitamin E alone or combined in NAFLD patients. Extracted manuscripts reported data on biochemical, histological, anthropometric, and metabolic outcomes. Baseline characteristics, settings, dosage, and frequency were also collected.

Research:

A total of 1317 patients from 15 RCTs were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. Vitamin E was superior at improving alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), NAFLD activity score (NAS), and fibrosis in short- and long-term follow up in the adult population, and long-term follow up in the pediatric population. Improvements in metabolic outcomes were best noticed in pediatric patients. Results from multiple regression models showed a significant association between ALT-AST levels and vitamin E dose. AST levels had a significant effect on NAS, and patients with a baseline AST > 50 IU/l showed more promising results. Changes in weight and body mass index (BMI) were strongly associated with changes in NAS.

Conclusion:

Current evidence affirms that vitamin E – whether alone or combined – improves biochemical and histological outcomes in adults and pediatric patients.

Vitamin E

The use of Vit-E, a fat-soluble vitamin with antioxidant properties, has been investigated in different clinical trials, particularly due to its potential of improvement in steatosis, inflammation and resolution of steatohepatitis in adults with NASH. In the PIVENS trial, the use of Vit-E therapy (800 IU/day) for 2 years achieved the primary endpoint improvement in the NAS by 2 or more points and no increase in fibrosis when compared to placebo (43% vs. 19%, p < 0.001; number needed to treat = 4.4).

Some meta-analyses raised concern about long term safety of high doses of Vit-E (> 800 IU/day) analyzing all-cause mortality, prostate cancer and hemorrhagic stroke. On the other hand, another large meta-analysis with 57 trials reported no effect on overall mortality with doses up to 5500 IU/day of Vit-E. In summary, Vit-E supplementation may be considered for biopsy-proven NASH in patients without diabetes, after careful discussion of risks and benefits of the therapy.

Selonsertib and other anti-inflammatory drugs

The understanding of pathogenic mechanisms involving NAFLD progression, such as chronic inflammation and fibrogenesis in the liver, brought some speculation about anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic therapies. Selonsertib, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, and simtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of fibrosis, are examples of these agents. A phase 2 trial evaluated the use of selonsertib alone or in combination with simtuzumab in patients with NASH and moderate to severe liver fibrosis (stage 2 or 3). The trial was terminated after 96 weeks due to lack of efficacy.

Treating NAFLD in patients with diabetes

Because NAFLD and T2D have the same pathophysiological origin, it is reasonable to suppose that drugs to treat T2D, and the metabolic surgery, have the potential to also treat NAFLD. According to Diabetes Guideline of the Brazilian Diabetes Society, beyond insulin, there are eight classes of antidiabetic agents, and all of them were tested in the treatment of NAFLD. A brief review of these classes of drugs and their mechanisms of action can be found in Table 4.

The mechanism of action of vitamin E in NAFLD and NASH patients involves anti-oxidant, anti-free-radical, anti-apoptotic, and anti-fibrotic roles. In NAFLD: mitochondrial malfunctions and pathological cytokines increase the production of ROS leading to lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, which plays a vital role in the progression of the disease from NAFLD to NASH. While this mechanism justifies the biochemical and histological effects, it does not explain its metabolic actions.

Meanwhile, a previous meta-analysis indicated that a high dose of vitamin E could increase the risk of mortality, though the association was not well established. Other reports raised concerns about prostate cancer risks, though the data are insufficient for a conclusive answer. Further, a more extensive meta-analysis of 57 RCTs revealed that vitamin E doses up to 5500 IU/day did not affect all-cause mortality. Also, another meta-analysis reported a possible increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke by 22% (1 in every 1250 patients), and reduced risk of ischemic stroke by 10% with vitamin E (1 in every 476 patients). However, the study included only five blinded and two open-label trials in the analysis with different baseline morbidities and without emphasis on follow-up duration. The safety profile of vitamin E remains a highly important clinical question, with an urgent call for further investigations, especially on long-term follow up.

Nutritional deficiencies — key nutrient relationships to MASLD include that vitamin D deficiency is linked to increased MASLD risk and promotes hepatic steatosis; vitamin E, an antioxidant, has been shown in some studies to reduce oxidative stress, improve liver function and decrease inflammation in MASLD patients, though evidence remains mixed; selenium protects against cellular damage, with supplementation potentially slowing MASLD progression; essential fatty acids, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, support lipid metabolism and reduce hepatic fat storage; and choline deficiency disrupts VLDL production and triglyceride export, contributing to hepatic fat accumulation. Addressing these deficiencies through appropriate dietary intake or supplementation may offer therapeutic benefits in MASLD management, though further research is needed to establish clear guidelines.

Sensitivity analysis

Fixed‐effect meta‐analysis showed a similar result to the random‐effects model (RR 3.49, 95% CI 0.58 to 21.04; P = 0.97; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 351 participants); the Peto odds ratio (OR) method also showed a similar result (Peto OR 7.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 50.66; P = 1.00; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 351 participants).
Best‐worst‐case scenario analysis. When we assumed that all participants lost to follow‐up in the experimental intervention group survived, and all those with missing outcome data in the control group died, vitamin E decreased all‐cause mortality compared with placebo (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.39; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 351 participants; Analysis 1.2).
Worst‐best‐case scenario analysis. When we assumed that all participants lost to follow‐up in the experimental intervention group died, and all those with missing outcome data in the control group survived, vitamin E increased all‐cause mortality compared with placebo (RR 14.07, 95% CI 2.73 to 72.57; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 351 participants; Analysis 1.3).
Risk of bias. We judged the overall risk of bias in all trials reporting on this outcome to be some concerns, thereby precluding a sensitivity analysis excluding trials at high risk of bias.

### 2024 UPDATE: the Brazilian diabetes society position on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes [^114GckYP]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

This recommendation is based on expert opinion. Combined treatment of T2D is recommended to achieve satisfactory glycemic control. In this line, it seems reasonable to combine drugs that can additively or synergistically contribute to the resolution of liver disease for people with T2D who have MASH and/or fibrosis. Therefore, the panel suggests that combining pioglitazone with GLP-1RA (preferably) or one or both with SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered for people with T2D and MASLD who have evidence of MASH and/or fibrosis based on the potential benefits and lack of harm observed with combination therapy used for glycemic control and for improvement of non-histological liver outcomes. The choice of drug combination should consider the benefits in diabetes control, weight management, and cardiovascular outcomes. Clinical trials comparing combination therapy with any of the drugs used as monotherapy for histological liver outcomes are ongoing.

Important note: vitamin E, pentoxifylline, and silymarin

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of vitamin E, pentoxifylline, and silymarin for the treatment of MASLD in people with T2D.

In the PIVENS study, conducted in people with MASH and without T2D, vitamin E intake (800 IU/day) over a 2-year period resulted in an improvement in NAS score of two or more points, with no increase in fibrosis compared with placebo (43 vs. 19%, p < 0.001). Although vitamin E supplementation is being considered for MASH in people without T2D, specific studies in people with diabetes are still needed. A safety issue on vitamin E is that it seems to increase the risk of prostate cancer in elderly men.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and implications for cardiovascular risk and disease prevention [^115p8BYA]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Lanifibranor is a pan-PPAR agonist that activates PPAR, α, γ and δ receptors. In the phase 2B placebo-controlled NATIVE trial, the histological SAF-A (activity of liver steatosis, activity, and fibrosis) score was reduced in obese patients with biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Additionally, multiple secondary endpoints were achieved with satisfactory resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis, and improvement in fibrosis stage of at least one stage without worsening of NASH. However, there is little evidence of its impact on CVD risk.

Vitamin E effectively improves hepatic histology in adult patients with biopsy-proven NASH. Combined low-dose spironolactone plus vitamin E also decreased NAFLD liver fat score. However, studies evaluating vitamin E for histological benefit have generally been negative or have produced inconsistent results in small groups of patients. The results of some randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials also indicate that vitamin E supplementation not only failed to prevent major CVD events, but in fact may increase the risk of developing heart failure.

Therapies with benefit in CVD but unknown or uncertain effects in MAFLD

Statins are the first-line treatment to prevent atherosclerotic CVD in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Statins reduce the risk of CVD in MAFLD patients with dyslipidemia, even without any beneficial effect on liver histology. Statins are known to be safe in NAFLD and statin use is not associated with abnormal serum liver enzyme levels, even in patients with hepatic steatosis. An unexpected concern is that statin treatment might be suboptimal for subjects with MAFLD, however further research is needed to test this further. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors represent an alternative pharmacological approach to reducing plasma LDL-C concentrations. While some studies reported a possible beneficial effect on hepatic pathology, it is premature to recommend this agent for specifically treating MAFLD. Daily aspirin use has been associated with fewer severe histologic features of MAFLD and a lower risk of progressing to advanced fibrosis in a recent observational study. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are also thought to exert a moderate anti-fibrotic effect on the liver in experimental and clinical studies. Given the current evidence, more and larger controlled clinical trials are needed before a recommendation for use of these anti-hypertensive agents can be recommended for specifically treating MAFLD.

Thiazolidinediones in adults with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) — pioglitazone efficacy, safety, and recommendation: In the PIVENS multicenter RCT, 247 non-diabetic patients with NASH were randomized to pioglitazone (30 mg/day), vitamin E (800 IU/day), or placebo for 24 months, and the primary endpoint was improvement in NAS ≥ 2 points with prespecified ballooning and lobular inflammation or steatosis changes and no fibrosis worsening; the primary endpoint was achieved in 19% with placebo, 34% with pioglitazone (p = 0.04 vs. placebo) and 43% with vitamin E (p = 0.001 vs. placebo), but because a p-value of 0.025 was required the study concluded that pioglitazone did not meet the primary end point; a key secondary end point favored pioglitazone (47% vs. 21%, p = 0.001), and weight gain occurred (4.7 kg, p < 0.001). A meta-analysis of 5 RCTs found pioglitazone improved steatosis (OR 4.05, 95% CI 2.58–6.35) and inflammation (OR 3.53, 95% CI 2.21–5.64), but not fibrosis (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.87–2.24). Regarding cardiovascular outcomes, a meta-analysis of 19 trials enrolling 16,390 patients with T2DM reported a significant reduction (~18%) in death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (p = 0.005) but a higher rate of congestive heart failure with pioglitazone (2.3% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.002). Guideline recommendation: Pioglitazone can be used to treat steatohepatitis in patients with biopsy-proven NASH, noting most trial participants were non-diabetic and long term safety and efficacy in NASH is not established (Strength – 1, Evidence – B).

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review [^1146YVVL]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its subtype nonalcoholic steatohepatitis affect approximately 30% and 5%, respectively, of the US population. In patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, half of deaths are due to cardiovascular disease and malignancy, yet awareness of this remains low. Cirrhosis, the third leading cause of death in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is predicted to become the most common indication for liver transplantation.

Objectives

To illustrate how to identify patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease at greatest risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis; to discuss the role and limitations of current diagnostics and liver biopsy to diagnose nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; and to provide an outline for the management of patients across the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Evidence Review

PubMed was queried for published articles through February 28, 2015, using the search terms NAFLD and cirrhosis, mortality, biomarkers, and treatment. A total of 88 references were selected, including 16 randomized clinical trials, 44 cohort or case-control studies, 6 population-based studies, and 7 meta-analyses.

Findings

Sixty-six percent of patients older than 50 years with diabetes or obesity are thought to have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis. Even though the ability to identify the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis subtype within those with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease still requires liver biopsy, biomarkers to detect advanced fibrosis are increasingly reliable. Lifestyle modification is the foundation of treatment for patients with nonalcoholic steatosis. Available treatments with proven benefit include vitamin E, pioglitazone, and obeticholic acid; however, the effect size is modest (< 50%) and none is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The association between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cardiovascular disease is clear, though causality remains to be proven in well-controlled prospective studies. The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma is increasing and up to 50% of cases may occur in the absence of cirrhosis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Between 75 million and 100 million individuals in the United States are estimated to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its potential morbidity extends beyond the liver. It is important that primary care physicians, endocrinologists, and other specialists be aware of the scope and long-term effects of the disease. Early identification of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis may help improve patient outcomes through treatment intervention, including transplantation for those with decompensated cirrhosis.

Management

Lifestyle change resulting in weight loss prior to the onset of advanced fibrosis is the mainstay of management. Under a 12-month programme with diet and physical exercise leading to an average weight loss of 4.9 kg, significant reductions in the level of fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, liver enzymes and liver echogenicity on ultrasonography was possible. Similar benefits were demonstrated when a multidisciplinary programme of dietary and exercise advice was employed in a paediatric liver, sub-specialty clinic. However, there are no detailed recommendations on the kind or amount of exercises or diet that are required to achieve histological improvement. Both studies had a high attrition rate highlighting the challenges inherent to weight management interventions. Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES) questionnaires from 41 children in a hepatology clinic showed that there is low recognition of their obesity as a problem and a desire to change.

The TONIC trial evaluated the effect of metformin and vitamin E on ALT levels and histological improvement. There was no difference in the primary outcome of ALT reduction between the placebo and vitamin E or metformin treatment groups. However, vitamin E showed benefits in terms of improvements in histology, including ballooning, MAFLD activity and the proportion that resolved steatohepatitis at 96 weeks. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) advises consideration of use of vitamin E in children with the risks and benefits explained; metformin at 500 mg twice daily is not recommended specifically to treat fatty liver, but higher doses and its effects on fatty liver and metabolic dysfunction should be further evaluated.

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid are omega-3 fatty acids that are recommended in adults for hypertriglyceridemia. In children, a recent meta-analysis of six randomised placebo–control trials looking at the use of omega-3 fatty acids in fatty liver disease showed improvements in transaminases, hepatic steatosis and BMI. However, these effects may have been confounded by the lifestyle interventions recommended in the studies.

Other dietary components can also be beneficial in the treatment of NAFLD, like changes in Vitamin E, caffeine and polyphenol intake. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that works as an antioxidant. Current data support the use of Vitamin E in non-diabetic patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, it should not be considered as the first option for treatment. Vitamin E therapy should be considered as treatment if lifestyle modifications do not produce the expected results due to non-compliance or ineffectiveness.

The PIVENS study showed that a 2-year period of treatment with Vitamin E at 800 IU / day in adult patients significantly reverses steatohepatitis and significantly reduced hepatic steatosis and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), but did not had significant changes in fibrosis compared to placebo. Long-term safety is of concern, several meta-analyses suggest increased mortality in patients taking Vitamin E supplements. Some of them showed a 20% increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke; and another test suggested an increased risk of prostate cancer in men over the age of 50.

Caffeine is a strong antioxidant that could help reduce the burden of oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver and may provide hepatoprotective effect. Many studies have linked coffee consumption to improvement in liver enzymes in a dose-dependent manner in individuals who are at risk of liver diseases. There is an evident protective role of more than 3 cups of coffee consumption per day but not less than 2 cups according a meta-analysis study.

Finally, polyphenols are a heterogeneous class of plant-derived compounds that include several hydro soluble antioxidants reported as health promoting agents and proposed in the treatment of different metabolic disorders. Natural polyphenols are present in nature and particularly have been found in high quantities in many foods and plants, such as vegetables, fruits, cereals, spices, mushrooms, tea, microalgae, medical plants, wild fruits, and flowers.

There exists a considerable amount of evidence indicating the hepatoprotective effects of these biomolecules, unless they are in cultured cells and animal models. Their optimal dose and the concomitant length of the treatment period are not known.

Limitations of pharmacologic treatment

Currently, there are no FDA-approved drugs for treating NASH. However, for some patients, a number of therapeutic options with varying efficacy are available, as listed in Table 3. Pioglitazone compared to placebo in nondiabetic patients showed a favorable improvement in NASH (34% vs. 19%, P = 0.04; number needed to treat = 6.9). The same study, the PIVENS (pioglitazone or vitamin E vs. placebo in nondiabetic patients with NASH) trial, showed that the daily use of 800 IU of vitamin E significantly reduced steatosis and inflammation (43% vs. 19%, P = 0.001; number needed to treat = 4.2). However, some safety concerns have been raised with regard to the use of vitamin E and pioglitazone; these include postmenopausal bone loss, risk of bladder cancer, hemorrhagic stroke and prostate cancer. Other medications such as pentoxifylline have shown favorable results, though larger clinical studies are required to evaluate its therapeutic role.

Table 3
Pharmacologic treatment options in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

Research in the past decade has led to the development of novel therapies. Obeticholic acid, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, was investigated for treating non-cirrhotic NASH patients in the farnesoid X nuclear receptor ligand obeticholic acid for non-cirrhotic, NASH (FLINT) trial. Comparing 25 mg of obeticholic acid per day with placebo, interim analysis showed that the efficacy criterion had been met, leading to discontinuation of the trial. Histological data showed significant improvement in steatohepatitis in 45% of patients vs. 21% of patients who received placebo. Obeticholic acid was also associated with weight loss. Its potential clinical efficacy and long-term safety are pending the results of a phase III clinical trial (NCT02548351).

In a large, multicenter randomized controlled trial (TONIC) comparing vitamin E or metformin to placebo in 8- to 17-year-olds with NAFLD, the primary outcome of sustained reduction of ALT was not different among groups, but vitamin E produced statistically significant improvements in NAS and resolution of NASH (P < 0.006) compared to placebo over 96 weeks; metformin at a 500-mg, twice-daily dose had no effect on liver biochemistries or liver histology. Another large, multicenter RCT comparing delayed-release cysteamine to placebo was just reported.

### The efficacy of vitamin E in reducing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression [^112aKyEf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The quality of a systematic review and meta-analysis rests upon its included studies. Our included studies presented relatively high quality. Our findings settle a group of assumptions and advocate a reliable reference for prospective clinical decisions. To our knowledge, this the first systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze the short-, intermediate-, and long-term outcomes of vitamin E in pediatric and adult populations over 24 months with meta-regression considerations. Even so, there were some limitations to our work. The results of the metabolic outcomes were limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. The variations in the clinical definitions of NAFLD may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity. Additionally, most of the trials had moderately small sample sizes.

Overall, the current evidence indicates that vitamin E is superior in improving biochemical outcomes in adult and pediatric patients – whether alone or combined. It also favors additional histological improvements for adults and metabolic improvements for pediatric populations. Further multi-center, large sample RCTs are needed to investigate the safety of daily vitamin E alone or combined with other anti-oxidants. Future studies should also consider our prognosis score in the management of NAFLD and NASH patients.

### Antioxidant supplements for liver diseases [^111ofyfS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Several liver diseases have been associated with oxidative stress. Accordingly, antioxidants have been suggested as potential therapeutics for various liver diseases. The evidence supporting these suggestions is equivocal.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antioxidant supplements for patients with liver diseases.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science to January 2011. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered for inclusion randomised trials that compared antioxidant supplements (beta-carotene, vitamin A, C, E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention for autoimmune liver diseases, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and cirrhosis (any aetiology).

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcome measures were all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, liver-related morbidity, biochemical indices at maximum follow-up in the individual trials as well as adverse events, quality-of-life measures, and cost-effectiveness. For patients with hepatitis B or C we also considered end of treatment and sustained virological response. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses. Results were presented as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Twenty randomised trials with 1225 participants were included. The trials assessed beta-carotene (3 trials), vitamin A (2 trials), vitamin C (9 trials), vitamin E (15 trials), and selenium (8 trials). The majority of the trials had high risk of bias and showed heterogeneity. Overall, the assessed antioxidant supplements had no significant effect on all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 1.19, I(2) = 0%), or liver-related mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.05, I(2) = 37%). Stratification according to the type of liver disease did not affect noticeably the results. Antioxidant supplements significantly increased activity of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (MD 24.21 IU/l, 95% CI 6.67 to 41.75, I(2) = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence to support or refute antioxidant supplements in patients with liver disease. Antioxidant supplements may increase liver enzyme activity.

### The efficacy of vitamin E in reducing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression [^113rDoWH]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects up to 30% of the population. Clinical trials have questioned the role of vitamin E in the treatment of NAFLD with or without other interventions, with still no firm conclusion reached. This study aims to examine the efficiency of vitamin E alone or combined in the management of NAFLD.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid, EBSCO host, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the role of vitamin E alone or combined in NAFLD patients. Extracted manuscripts reported data on biochemical, histological, anthropometric, and metabolic outcomes. Baseline characteristics, settings, dosage, and frequency were also collected.

Research

A total of 1317 patients from 15 RCTs were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. Vitamin E was superior at improving alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), NAFLD activity score (NAS), and fibrosis in short- and long-term follow up in the adult population, and long-term follow up in the pediatric population. Improvements in metabolic outcomes were best noticed in pediatric patients. Results from multiple regression models showed a significant association between ALT-AST levels and vitamin E dose. AST levels had a significant effect on NAS, and patients with a baseline AST > 50IU/l showed more promising results. Changes in weight and body mass index (BMI) were strongly associated with changes in NAS.

Conclusion

Current evidence affirms that vitamin E - whether alone or combined - improves biochemical and histological outcomes in adults and pediatric patients.

Insulin sensitizing agent — metformin has shown aminotransferase reductions without consistent histologic benefit in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): early small, open-label studies showed reductions in insulin resistance and aminotransferases but no significant histology improvement; an open-label trial of 110 patients treated with metformin 2 grams/day (55 patients), vitamin E 800 IU/day (28 patients) or dietary-induced weight loss (27 patients) for 12 months found greater aminotransferase improvement with metformin but only modest histologic change in the subset of 17 patients with paired biopsies. In a 48-week open-label study in 26 patients, metformin improved NASH activity in only 30% of patients, with confounding weight loss (19% lost more than 10 kilograms), and a larger randomized trial (n = 48) also reported lack of efficacy; overall, a meta-analysis concluded that 6–12 months of metformin plus lifestyle intervention did not improve aminotransferases or liver histology compared with lifestyle alone, regardless of dose or diabetes status.

Concomitant therapy alongside resmetirom — regardless of resmetirom treatment status, best practice management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) should include comprehensive lifestyle modification and optimal control of comorbid metabolic conditions, and "AASLD guidance supports that in the absence of approved therapy, pharmacologic treatment with semaglutide, pioglitazone, and vitamin E could be considered in appropriate patients". Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists "are FDA approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and overweight/obesity" and "reduce the risk of cardiometabolic complications in addition to their effects on glycemic control and weight loss". While "not currently approved for the treatment of MASH", phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of "liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide have demonstrated their efficacy", and "although not FDA approved for the treatment of MASH, vitamin E and pioglitazone may also improve steatohepatitis". The MAESTRO-NASH trial "notably excluded individuals who initiated or dose-modified" GLP-1 receptor agonists, thiazolidinediones, or vitamin E "within 6 months of randomization".

According to the AASLD, the management of NAFLD should consist of treating the liver disease as well as the associated metabolic comorbidities, such as obesity, hyperlipidaemia, insulin resistance and T2DM. The significant progress that has been made in previous years in understanding the pathogenesis of NAFLD has led to an increase of medical therapies targeting various aspects of the fat accumulation and injury pathways. However, there is still no 'gold-standard' pharmacological therapy for NAFLD. Interestingly, current US guidelines on NAFLD treatment indicate that only patients with biopsy-proven NASH should be treated pharmacologically with either pioglitazone or with high-dose vitamin E. However, there have been lingering concerns about the long-term safety of both these agents. Bariatric surgery is another option that can be considered in otherwise obese individuals with NAFLD or NASH. Though the metabolic disturbances, as well as the long-term complications of NAFLD, are surmountable through lifestyle interventions (ie, dietary modifications, weight loss and exercise), poor implementation and reduced adherence to lifestyle intervention programmes would ultimately diminish their efficacy.

### Pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: current thinking [^116oCrKw]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), an increasingly prevalent paediatric disorder, is diagnosed and managed not only by both pediatric gastroenterologists/hepatologists but also frequently by the general pediatrician. This article updates recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approach, which may be applied to everyday practice. Diagnosis of NAFLD takes into account the risk factor profile and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Techniques such as transient elastography and specific biomarkers aimed at improving diagnosis and monitoring of NAFLD need further validation in the pediatric population. Defining the risk to develop cirrhosis seems to be of primary importance already in childhood and a combination of genetic, clinical, and environmental factors can help in monitoring and making decisions on therapy. Weight reduction therapy should be the aim of treatment approach, but the compliance is poor and pharmacological treatment would be helpful; docosahexaenoic acid, some probiotics, and vitamin E are to be considered, but evidence is not sufficient to recommend widespread use.

Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric NAFLD pharmacotherapy — There are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for pediatric NAFLD. The Treatment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children and Adolescents randomized controlled trial found no benefit of metformin or vitamin E in achieving a reduction in the NAFLD activity score (NAS) of ≥ 2 in children, although secondary analyses found a significantly greater resolution of NASH with 400 IU twice a day of vitamin E daily versus placebo. The long-term efficacy and safety of vitamin E in children with NASH remain unknown, a dose of 500 mg orally twice a day was not effective, and treatment with polyunsaturated fatty acids or probiotics has not been validated with histologic analysis.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114PgkHw]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) at indeterminate risk of advanced fibrosis — definition and care — includes risk thresholds, further evaluation, lifestyle, and therapeutic options. An estimated 30%–40% of patients screened based on Steps 1–4 will have an indeterminate risk defined as an FIB-4 score between ≥ 1.3 and 2.67 and/or an LSM between 8.0 and 12.0 kPa on transient elastography among those unable or unwilling to obtain a liver biopsy. We also recommend further workup and efforts to confirm the stage of hepatic fibrosis, and in some cases proprietary plasma biomarker tests for fibrosis staging or additional imaging-based fibrosis measurement (ie, magnetic resonance elastography) may be used to guide patient care. As with both low- and high-risk patients, lifestyle modification is key to successful long-term management, with weight loss recommended if patients are overweight or obese, and we recommend that clinicians educate patients on improving lifestyle habits and deciding on the need for structured weight-loss programs, anti-obesity medications, or bariatric surgery. Diabetes medications with RCT-proven efficacy on liver histology in NASH (ie, pioglitazone or GLP-1RAs) should be preferred for diabetes care, and in patients without diabetes, we recommend the patient and physician should choose the best management strategy. Vitamin E improves steatohepatitis in patients with NASH without diabetes, and RCTs involving pioglitazone, liraglutide, and semaglutide have reported histologic improvement in patients with NASH without diabetes. A liver biopsy is currently the only reliable means to diagnose NASH and is the reference standard for fibrosis staging, although it may not be feasible to obtain in a significant number of patients.

### Effects of α-tocopherol and β-carotene supplementation on liver cancer incidence and chronic liver disease mortality in the ATBC study [^111Gzmhy]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Our analyses treated deaths from other causes as independent censoring at the time of the death. Unlike analyses of cumulative incidence over a long time interval, these analyses would not be distorted by differences in the amount of competing mortality among the intervention groups. In any case, mortality rates from other causes were similar across the treatment groups, both overall and in participants with and without diabetes.

Other data on micronutrient supplementation and liver cancer are sparse. Whereas a Chinese observational cohort recently reported an inverse association of both vitamin E supplement use and dietary vitamin E intake with liver cancer, no effect was observed for 'factor D' (β -carotene (15 mg), α -tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μ g)) on liver cancer mortality, relative to placebo in the Linxian General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial.

In apparent contrast with our results for α -tocopherol and β -carotene supplementation, micronutrient status, as assessed by serum levels, has been associated with lower risk of liver cancer in several prospective cohort studies, including in the current one (companion paper). Within ATBC, we observed that higher baseline levels of serum β -carotene and retinol were associated with a reduced risk of incident liver cancer and CLD mortality, whereas higher baseline α -tocopherol levels were associated with a lower risk of CLD mortality but not incident liver cancer. Such contrasting results do not necessarily conflict. Serum micronutrient status reflects on the long-term dietary intake and metabolism. Micronutrient supplementation during middle age may miss the important window of liver disease and liver cancer development. Alternatively, serum micronutrient levels may serve as a proxy for another aspect of diet or lifestyle, and may not actually have a direct role in the development of liver disease and liver cancer.

### Advances and challenges in the management of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^115uCi37]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly becoming the most common type of chronic liver disease worldwide. From the spectrum of NAFLD, it is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that predominantly predisposes patients to higher risk for development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is growing evidence that the risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is not uniform among all patients with NASH. In fact, NASH patients with increasing numbers of metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, visceral obesity and dyslipidemia are at a higher risk of mortality. Additionally, patients with higher stage of liver fibrosis are also at increased risk of mortality. In this context, NASH patients with fibrosis are in the most urgent need of treatment. Also, the first line of treatment for NASH is lifestyle modification with diet and exercise. Nevertheless, the efficacy of lifestyle modification is quite limited. Additionally, vitamin E and pioglitazone may be considered for subset of patients with NASH. There are various medications targeting one or more steps in the pathogenesis of NASH being developed. These drug regimens either alone or in combination, may provide potential treatment option for patients with NASH.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^116yivu7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Authors' conclusions

Implications for practice

The evidence for the effects of vitamin E, administered alone, in people with non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)) on clinical outcomes such as all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, health‐related quality of life, and non‐serious adverse events is very uncertain. Vitamin E likely slightly reduces serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels. It also may slightly reduce alkaline phosphatases (ALP) levels, although the evidence is very uncertain. Vitamin E may or may not affect gamma‐glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels, and steatosis diagnosed on ultrasound. None of the trials reported on liver‐related mortality, liver‐related morbidity, or proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes.

The evidence for the effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C in people with NAFLD (MASLD) on liver enzyme levels and steatosis diagnosed on ultrasound is very uncertain. None of the trials reported on all‐cause mortality, liver‐related mortality, serious adverse events, liver‐related morbidity, health‐related quality of life, non‐serious adverse events, or proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes.

The decision for a person with NAFLD (MASLD) to start vitamin E therapy, in the absence of diet and lifestyle change, should balance the benefits and disadvantages, and integrate the person's values and preferences. Lifestyle modifications were a co‐intervention in 12 out of the 16 trials.

Implications for research

More evidence is needed before any conclusions can be drawn on the safety and effect of vitamin E alone or in combination with vitamin C in people with NAFLD (MASLD), as the certainty of the evidence was generally very low, and there was significant heterogeneity in some analyses. More randomised clinical trials assessing any relationship between vitamin E effect and adherence to lifestyle modification would seem appropriate. The effect of vitamin E on health‐related quality of life also deserves further investigation. Future trials should be designed according to the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement (www.spirit‐statement.org) and reported according to the CONSORT statement (www.consortstatement.org).

Vitamin E

Vitamin E is an antioxidant that has recently been shown to have beneficial effects on histology in non-diabetic patients with NASH. In the large PIVENS trial, significantly more patients had improvement in steatohepatitis following 96 weeks of vitamin E 800 IU/day compared with placebo (42% vs 19% p < 0.001). This was confirmed in a study of childhood NASH, where vitamin E was shown to reduce steatohepatitis in a subgroup who had follow-up liver biopsies. Although vitamin E looks like a promising treatment for NASH, there are concerns about the long-term effects of vitamin E with a meta-analysis showing a small overall increase in all-cause mortality at doses > 400 IU/day. It has also been reported that there might be an increased risk of haemorrhagic strokeand prostate cancerwith high dose treatment. Vitamin E has not been evaluated in patients with cirrhosis or diabetes and NASH. Therefore, it should currently be reserved for selected patients with more advanced pre-cirrhotic NASH who have failed lifestyle interventions. The optimum dose and duration of treatment are not known.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^115NMDL6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is the most common liver disease worldwide, affecting an estimated 3 in 10 people. The available treatment is far from optimal. Diet and lifestyle changes to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance are the basic management of NAFLD, but these are difficult to achieve and maintain. Vitamin E has shown beneficial effects on oxidative stress, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. However, there is uncertainty about the effects of vitamin E for people with NAFLD.

Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin E alone, or vitamin E in combination with other vitamins or minerals, versus placebo or no intervention in people with NAFLD.

Search Methods

We used recommended Cochrane search methods. The latest search was performed on 2 February 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin E alone, or in combination with other vitamins or minerals, at any dose, duration, and route of administration, versus placebo or no intervention, in people with NAFLD of any age, sex, or ethnic origin. We included participants with imaging techniques or histology-proven NAFLD and minimal alcohol intake, and participants with steatohepatitis who had liver biopsies.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, and serious adverse events. Our important outcomes were liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, non-serious adverse events, biochemical response, and imaging assessment of the degree of fatty liver.

Risk Of Bias

We used Cochrane's RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias for each of the predefined outcomes.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included 16 randomised clinical trials involving 1066 paediatric and adult participants with NAFLD. Experimental groups received vitamin E alone (14 trials) or vitamin E in combination with vitamin C (2 trials). Control groups received placebo in 13 trials and no intervention in three trials. Daily dosages of oral vitamin E ranged from 298 international units (IU) to 1000 IU. Co-interventions were lifestyle and low-calorie diet interventions in 13 trials, ursodeoxycholic acid in one trial, unchanged diet and physical activity in one trial, and baseline treatments for type 2 diabetes in one trial. Nine trials had more than two intervention groups, but we used only the groups in which vitamin E alone or vitamin E in combination with vitamin C were compared with placebo or no intervention. In total, 7.9% (84/1066) of participants dropped out. Follow-up ranged from 2 months to 24 months.

Synthesis Of Results

Vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 3.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 20.86; 3 trials, 351 participants; very low certainty evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.30 to 12.01; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain. There were no data on liver-related mortality or liver-related morbidity. The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on physical health-related quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.74, 95% CI -0.52 to 2.01; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); psychosocial health-related quality of life (MD -0.57, 95% CI -4.11 to 2.97; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); and non-serious adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.17; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are also very uncertain. There were no data on proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely slightly reduces serum alanine transaminase (ALT) (MD -9.29, 95% CI -13.69 to -4.89; 11 trials, 708 participants; moderate certainty evidence) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (MD -4.90, 95% CI -7.24 to -2.57; 11 trials, 695 participants; moderate certainty evidence) levels compared with placebo or no intervention. Vitamin E may slightly reduce serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (MD -5.21, 95% CI -9.88 to -0.54; 5 trials, 416 participants; very low certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Vitamin E plus vitamin C versus placebo There were no data on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, serious adverse events, liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on reducing serum ALT (MD -0.50, 95% CI -4.58 to 3.58; 2 trials, 133 participants; very low certainty evidence), AST (MD 0.09, 95% CI -3.39 to 3.57; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (MD 1.58, 95% CI -3.22 to 6.38; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain. We identified three ongoing trials, and six trials are awaiting classification.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know if long-term treatment (18 months to 24 months) with vitamin E administered alone affects all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, quality of life, or non-serious adverse events in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo or no intervention. We found no data on liver-related mortality, liver-related morbidity, or proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely reduces ALT and AST slightly when compared with placebo, but whether this has any impact on the clinical course in people with NAFLD is unknown. The trials on vitamin E plus vitamin C did not report on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, serious adverse events, liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, or non-serious adverse events. Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know the effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on liver enzymes in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo.

A growing number of potential drugs with various mechanisms of action are undergoing clinical trials to assess their usefulness in the treatment of NASH –. These therapeutic interventions mainly target lipid metabolism, insulin signaling, inflammatory cytokine signaling, or pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of NASH-associated liver fibrosis –. Among therapeutic agents in ongoing clinical trials for NASH, only a number of candidates have entered phase 3 clinical trials. For instance, aramchol, a synthetic conjugate of cholic acid and arachidic acid, exerts its therapeutic effects in NASH through inhibition of stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD-1), obeticholic acid (OCA), and resmetirom (MGL-3196). In addition, vitamin E treatment has also been investigated in phase 2 clinical trials for its usefulness in the treatment of NASH. It has been shown to reduce steatosis and improve histological features of NASH in patients without concomitant diabetes or cirrhosis. In fact, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) has recommended the use of high-dosage vitamin E (800 IU daily) in patients with NASH without concomitant diabetes. Despite these demonstrated benefits of vitamin E, other phase 2 trials have reported significant adverse effects of high-dose vitamin E, including an increased risk of bleeding as well as other adverse effects. Thus, it appears unlikely that high-dose vitamin E will be further investigated in phase 3 clinical trials. Currently, saroglitazar, a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α/γ agonist, is approved drug for the treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH in India. At present, numerous potential drugs with various mechanisms of action are in development as potential treatments for NASH.

Children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — guidance on pharmacologic therapy and supplements states that metformin at 500 mg twice-daily offers no benefit to children with NAFLD and thus should not be prescribed to specifically treat NAFLD or NASH, and the effect of higher doses is not known. Vitamin E 800 IU/day offers benefit to children with biopsy-proven NASH; long-term safety of high-dose vitamin E in children is unknown, and Vitamin E may be used to treat NASH in children, but risks and benefits should be discussed with each patient. Evidence for omega-3 fatty acids is mixed in children, with a combination of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid failing to show significant therapeutic benefit in one study, whereas docosahexaenoic acid administered at 250 mg/day for 6 months showed significant improvement in hepatic fat as well as cardiometabolic risk factors in another study.

Discussion

Summary of main results

The evidence for the effect of vitamin E alone or vitamin E combined with vitamin C on all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, HRQoL, non‐serious adverse events, and ultrasound changes is very uncertain. There were no data on liver‐related mortality or liver‐related morbidity. Regarding the effect of vitamin E on biochemical response, there were no data on the proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely slightly reduces serum ALT and AST levels. The evidence for the effect of vitamin E alone or combined with vitamin C on reducing serum ALP and GGT levels is very uncertain.

The results of our systematic review should be interpreted cautiously because the overall risk of bias for the outcomes investigated and reported in the included trials was some concerns, and we found significant heterogeneity in the analyses of biochemical indices. Furthermore, the numbers of participants and trials that provided the data for our critical outcomes were low, which adds to the risk of both type I and type II errors.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with the metabolic syndrome. The current standard of care, healthy diet and weight loss, has limited effect. The benefits of pharmacological treatments are unclear due to the difficulty of using liver histology as the main outcome in large randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In this issue, an RCT with atorvastatin and antioxidants (vitamins E+C) vs. placebo shows improvement in liver steatosis based on computed tomography scans. The questions are is this beneficial effect due to the combined treatment or the effect of an individual compound; does this intervention improve nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

NAFLD in patients with other chronic liver diseases is characterized by frequent coexistence and specific recommendations: Because of the high prevalence of risk factors for NAFLD and NASH, it is not uncommon for patients with other chronic liver diseases to exhibit co-existing histological features of NAFLD; another large study showed high prevalence of steatosis (40.5%) and steatohepatitis (15%) in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and previous studies have shown that obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis are associated with a lower response to pegylated interferon and ribavirin for the treatment of HCV. When steatosis and steatohepatitis are evident in patients with other types of chronic liver disease, it is important to assess for metabolic risk factors and alternate etiologies for hepatic steatosis. (Strength – 1, Quality – B). In patients with other types of chronic liver diseases who have co-existing NAFLD and NASH, there are no data to support the use of vitamin E or pioglitazone to improve the liver disease.

Meanwhile, there is no approved primary intervention for NAFLD, but suggested approaches include lifestyle modification, physical exercise, and weight loss. These approaches show effectiveness in some patients yet require a combined therapy, strict compliance, and long-term effort, which is not compatible with most patients. With the increased understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis, antioxidant agents have become promising remedies to resist the effects of ROS. Among many antioxidants, vitamin E is the most evaluated agent in NAFLD management, with promising results, as it stabilizes the cell membrane by protecting unsaturated fatty acids from lipid peroxidation and subsequent ROS. Clinical trials have investigated the role of vitamin E in the treatment of NAFLD with or without other interventions, but no firm conclusions have yet been reached.

A previous systematic review concluded that adjuvant vitamin E is beneficial for the treatment of NAFLD exclusively in the adult population. However, the conclusion did not offer confirmed implications; with a relatively small size of only five trials and unreliable statistical analyses, the meta-analysis showed no statistical significance for any outcome.

Accordingly, our study aims to compare the efficacy of vitamin E with a placebo, a lifestyle modification, or a no-intervention in NAFLD patients. We consider short-, intermediate-, and long-term follow ups, the effect of co-interventions, baseline variations, and potential associations between the underlying pathogenesis and the drug's mechanism of action or vital markers that could affect drug efficacy.

### Dietary vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced risk of developing digestive diseases and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114SZqmu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin E supplementation is recommended for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) for nondiabetic patients, but its preventative effects are unclear.

Methods

We assessed dietary vitamin E intake with disease phenotypes and evaluated vitamin E levels with the development of NAFLD.

Results

Data from > 210,000 participants demonstrate that increased dietary vitamin E associates with reduced rates of several gastrointestinal diseases and reduced overall mortality. Diabetic and overweight subjects with increased vitamin E intake have fewer NAFLD diagnoses.

Discussion

Our findings reveal the relevance of vitamin E consumption for several gastrointestinal diseases and warrant further mechanistic and therapeutic investigations.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: diagnosis and management [^115Q7x8g]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is characterized by steatosis, liver cell injury, and inflammation. The mechanism of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is unknown but involves the development of insulin resistance, steatosis, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with physical inactivity, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Screening is not recommended in the general population. The diagnosis is usually made after an incidental discovery of unexplained elevation of liver enzyme levels or when steatosis is noted on imaging (e.g., ultrasonography). Patients are often asymptomatic and the physical examination is often unremarkable. No single laboratory test is diagnostic, but tests of liver function, tests for metabolic syndrome, and tests to exclude other causes of abnormal liver enzyme levels are routinely performed. Imaging studies, such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, can assess hepatic fat, measure liver and spleen size, and exclude other diseases. Liver biopsy remains the criterion standard for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Noninvasive tests are available and may reduce the need for liver biopsy. A healthy diet, weight loss, and exercise are first-line therapeutic measures to reduce insulin resistance. There is insufficient evidence to support bariatric surgery, metformin, thiazolidinediones, bile acids, or antioxidant supplements for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The long-term prognosis is not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or liver disease.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^115RSH35]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Investigation of heterogeneity and subgroup analysis

We aimed to conduct the following subgroup analyses.

Stages of NAFLD, NAFL compared to NASH (as NASH progresses from NAFL, the difference between the two can affect the outcomes of vitamin E treatment).
Low‐dose vitamin E (less than 400 IU per day) compared to high‐dose vitamin E (400 IU per day or greater).
Short‐term treatment (less than one year) compared to long‐term treatment (one year or more).
Trials at low risk of bias or some concerns compared to trials at high risk of bias because trials at high risk of bias may overestimate beneficial intervention effects or underestimate harmful intervention effects.
Trials at risk of for‐profit support compared to trials without for‐profit support because trials with for‐profit support may overestimate beneficial intervention effects or underestimate harmful intervention effects.

We planned to perform subgroup analyses of the following outcomes.

All‐cause mortality
Liver‐related mortality
Serious adverse events
Liver‐related morbidity
HRQoL
Proportion of people without a biochemical response
Proportion of people without an imaging response

We used the formal test for subgroup interactions in RevMan. For heterogeneous data, we planned to conduct a meta‐regression between intervention effect and dose, or follow‐up.

Equity‐related assessment

We did not investigate equity‐related characteristics in this review.

Sensitivity analysis

We planned to conduct the following sensitivity analyses for all outcomes.

Excluding trials at high risk of bias.
Conducting analyses using a fixed‐effect model.
Extreme‐case analysis, favouring the experimental intervention (see Dealing with missing data).
Extreme‐case analysis, favouring the control intervention (see Dealing with missing data).
Imputed values. We planned to exclude trials with imputed data, to assess the effects of including data from trials where we used imputed values. If there were substantial differences, we would not pool data from the excluded trials with the other trials contributing to the outcome and would present them separately.
Assessment of imprecision with Trial Sequential Analysis. We planned to compare our GRADE assessment of imprecision with the Trial Sequential Analysis assessment of imprecision for our critical outcomes (i.e. all‐cause mortality, liver‐related mortality, and serious adverse events).

Because these nutrients supply antioxidant and other functions for homeostasis and protection against free radical damage, supplementation has been intensively studied. Because of perceived benefits, many persons consume quantities of vitamins E and C well above the recommended dietary allowances. As safety guidance, tolerable upper intake levels have been established by the Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, at 1000 mg for vitamin E and 2000 mg for vitamin C in adults. Many clinical trials with these vitamins have involved subjects with various diseases, and no consistent pattern of adverse effects has occurred at any intake. Numerous studies of vitamin C supplementation have provided no pattern of evidence to support concerns about safety other than occasional gastrointestinal upset or mild diarrhea resulting from the osmotic effects of unabsorbed quantities of vitamin C. Evidence of bleeding effects and other potential adverse effects of high vitamin E intakes in humans is not convincing. Evidence of adverse effects of vitamin C that result from its effects on iron absorption and metabolism has not been confirmed in clinical trials. Thus, we conclude from clinical trial evidence that vitamin E supplements appear safe for most adults in amounts ≤ 1600 IU (1073 mg RRR-alpha-tocopherol or the molar equivalent of its esters) and that vitamin C supplements of ≤ 2000 mg/d are safe for most adults.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^117N1c77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Vitamin E improves the biochemistry and histology features of NAFLD; however, the mechanistic aspects that lie behind this remain elusive. One study reported that vitamin E decreased intrahepatic triglycerides by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis through its antioxidant activity, and other studies demonstrated that vitamin E attenuated NAFLD via multiple other mechanisms, including protecting cellular structures against damage from oxygen‐free radicals; upregulation of superoxide dismutase activity; and downregulation of isoprostanes (an index of lipid peroxidation), malondialdehyde and genes related to inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and leptin and adiponectin expression. The results of these studies reflect the potential beneficial effects of vitamin E on inhibition of NAFLD progression.

Why it is important to do this review

The increased prevalence of NAFLD has become one of the most important global public health issues. Oxidative stress is one of the key factors in the onset and development of NAFLD. Therefore, antioxidant therapy could possibly be beneficial in the management of NAFLD. Vitamin E may improve liver function and histological changes in people with NAFLD.

A review addressing the effects of antioxidant supplements on people with NAFLD or NASH was published in 2007, and it has not been updated since. That review concluded that antioxidant supplements other than vitamin E exerted a beneficial effect on the activity of alanine aminotransferase and on steatosis, but meta‐analyses published in 2015 and 2019 reported that vitamin E had a beneficial effect on NAFLD. In addition, given the enormous amount of research being published on the topic of antioxidants, we decided to prepare a new review focusing on vitamin E in people with NAFLD. We use the updated Cochrane methodology during our review production, starting with its protocol.

Vitamin E

Apart from targeting aspects of the metabolic syndrome that may have beneficial liver effects, liver-specific therapies have also been investigated in NASH. The role of oxidative stress in disease pathogenesis, in particular, has initiated several studies of antioxidants, primarily vitamin E. Vitamin E consists of eight tocopherols; α-tocopherol is the most active. Its presence in the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes allows prevention of the nonenzymatic oxidation of cell constituents by free radicals. Vitamin E may also inhibit profibrotic activity and downregulates nuclear factor (NF)-κB-mediated inflammatory pathways in the liver. Preclinical in-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown that in two fibrosis models, vitamin E can ameliorate liver injury blocking both apoptotic pathways and mitochondrial toxicity.

The Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) trial, described earlier, is the largest and most recent study comparing pioglitazone and vitamin E at 800 IU/day to placebo in nondiabetic, noncirrhotic patients; it reported that vitamin E improved all histological lesions in NAFLD except for fibrosis, and patients taking vitamin E had a greater than two-point improvement on NAS score significantly more often compared with placebo. A pilot study suggested that pioglitazone and vitamin E are superior to pioglitazone alone but the study was not appropriately powered. The positive and encouraging results seen in adult NAFLD may not extrapolate to paediatric NAFLD. The largest trial of vitamin E in paediatric NAFLD, the Treatment of NAFLD in Children (TONIC) trial, randomly assigned children and adolescents to receive vitamin E (800 IU/day) vs. metformin (1 g/day) or placebo for 2 years. Vitamin E significantly improved hepatocyte ballooning but not lobular inflammation, steatosis nor fibrosis. The primary endpoint of reduction in ALT levels, more often than placebo, was not met.

### State of the art: treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^115onx62]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries, and consists of a spectrum of histopathological changes that range in severity from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis to cirrhosis. The use of pharmacological agents as adjunctive therapy to lifestyle modification is crucial, because weight loss is often difficult to achieve and maintain. The purpose of this review is to analyze the most recent literature pertaining to current therapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications.

Recent Findings

Recent studies suggest that vitamin E may improve liver histology in NASH without affecting insulin resistance; however, long-term risks remain to be studied. Pioglitazone is beneficial in improving liver histology and insulin resistance, but is associated with weight gain. Emerging data suggest that pentoxifylline may also be beneficial in improving serum aminotransferase and liver histology in patients with biopsy-proven NASH.

Summary

Ongoing research evaluating potential pharmacological agents for NASH is critical, because these patients are at an increased risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The current therapies being used for the treatment of NASH include the use of vitamin E and pioglitazone, in addition to dietary counseling and regular exercise.

THERAPY

The rationale for therapeutic approaches is centred on the concept that while simple steatosis has not been associated with morbidity, NASH is associated with a more than 10-fold increased risk of liver-related death (2.8 vs. 0.2%) and a doubling of cardiovascular risk; at the time of diagnosis, 25–33% of patients with NASH have advanced fibrosis, including cirrhosis. After adjustment for confounders, NASH has a similar fibrotic potential to that of chronic hepatitis C. Pooled data suggest that about 21% of patients with NASH will have some regression of fibrosis while 38% of patients will progress over 5.3 years' follow-up, results that have recently been confirmed in a dual-biopsy Northern European population.

Lifestyle modifications

Weight reduction is recommended as the initial step in management of NASH. Pharmacological agents such as orlistat may help achieve weight loss; however, whether these confer additional independent benefit beyond that due to weight loss is unclear. Lifestyle modification therefore remains the primary therapy for weight reduction, particularly in the absence of approved pharmacotherapy; it encompasses diet, physical activity (aerobic and resistance) and behavioural change, or a combination of all three. Trial evidence shows that weight reduction more than 7% sustained over 48 weeks is associated with significant reduction in histological severity of NASH. A systematic review of the available evidence for lifestyle modifications in NAFLD has recently been conducted. Less than 50% of patients achieve the necessary weight loss goal of more than 7% in the trial setting, and many have questioned the sustainability of this type of intervention. Resistance training, which is less burdensome on the cardiovascular system, shares the metabolic improvements seen in more strenuous aerobic exercise and may be more sustainable. Nevertheless, in the many patients that fail to implement lifestyle changes or have advanced disease (bridging fibrosis) on index biopsy, specific liver-directed pharmacotherapy may be needed. No drugs are currently licensed specifically for treating NASH; there is an urgent need for well designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with appropriate endpoints to narrow this gap. Table 1 summarizes the current evidence for therapies in NASH.

Therapies of potential value for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

Very few large RCTs have been published on which evidence-based treatment for NASH is recommended. Therapies with potential benefit in NASH include thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and vitamin E.

Vitamin E

The anti‐oxidative effect of Vitamin E is thought to contribute to its promising results in randomized trials showing a significant improvement in NASH. In 2010, the so far largest randomized trial on Vitamin E was published (PIVENS‐Trial). It included 247 adults with biopsy‐proven NASH but without diabetes and compared Vitamin E (800 IU once daily) versus Pioglitazone (30 mg once daily) versus Placebo with the primary study endpoint defined as an improvement in histologic findings (improvement by 1 or more points in a hepatocellular ballooning score; no increase in fibrosis score; and either decrease of NAS to ≤ 3 points or of at least ≤ 2 points, with at least a 1‐point decrease in either lobular inflammation or steatosis). Vitamin E treatment resulted in a significantly higher rate of NASH improvement (43% vs. 19%, p = 0.001) as compared with placebo. However, the grade of fibrosis did not improve. Most importantly, adverse events in the Vitamin E group were not significantly different compared to Pioglitazone or placebo. A study evaluating the effect of Vitamin E on clinical outcomes in 236 NASH patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis found that indeed 800 IE/day decreased the risk of death or transplantation and hepatic decompensation — both in diabetic and in non‐diabetic patients — and therefore adds important data into the daily clinical use of Vitamin E. Nonetheless, the latter study was no randomized controlled trial and therefore results should be interpreted cautiously. While the PIVENS trials only included non‐diabetic NASH patients, it has been shown that Vitamin E treatment alone (800 IE/day) was ineffective in reaching the primary endpoint (two‐point reduction in NAS from two different parameters, without worsening of fibrosis) in a randomized trial including 105 patients with type 2 diabetes and biopsy‐proven NASH. Again no improvement in fibrosis was seen. Possible side effects of Vitamin E include an increased bleeding risk, prostate cancer, heart failure and hemorrhagic stroke and those should be discussed with the patient, even though they are rarely seen.

As of 2022 the current (2016) EASL guidelines cautiously recommend ("could be used") Vitamin E treatment for selected patients with NASH and at least significant fibrosis (≥ F2) while the current practice guidance endorsed by the AASLD states that Vitamin E (800 IU/day) "may be considered" for treating non‐diabetic patients with NASH. Most importantly, Vitamin E is currently not recommended to treat NASH in diabetic patients, NAFLD without liver biopsy, NASH cirrhosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis.

NAFLD in children — Intensive lifestyle modification improves aminotransferases and liver histology in children with NAFLD and thus should be the first line of treatment (Strength – 2, Quality – B). Metformin at 500 mg twice daily offers no benefit to children with NAFLD and thus should not be prescribed, and the effect of metformin administered at a higher dose is not known (Strength – 1, Quality – B). Vitamin E 800 IU/day (RRR α-tocopherol) offers histological benefits to children with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or borderline NASH but confirmatory studies are needed before it's use can be recommended in clinical practice (Strength – 1, Quality – B).
