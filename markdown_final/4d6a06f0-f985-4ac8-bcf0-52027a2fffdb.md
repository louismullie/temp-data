doze of pip/tazo for pneumonia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about piperacillin-tazobactam dosing for pneumonia, including how to choose the dose by pneumonia type, infusion strategy, renal function, obesity, and special populations, and how to integrate PK/PD targets and therapeutic drug monitoring into practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pneumonia phenotype and whether it is community-acquired, hospital-acquired, or ventilator-associated. Then, I should verify the standard FDA-labeled dosing by indication and infusion duration. Next, I will examine PK/PD principles and the evidence for extended or continuous infusions. After that, I need to check renal impairment adjustments, including hemodialysis and CRRT. I will then consider obesity, augmented renal clearance, and pediatric dosing. Finally, I should review safety, drug interactions, and how to operationalize TDM and de-escalation, before summarizing practical recommendations with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context by pneumonia type, because the dose hinges on this distinction. For community-acquired pneumonia, standard dosing is typically 3.375 g IV every 6 hours over 30 minutes when Pseudomonas coverage is not indicated, whereas for hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia, the labeled dose is 4.5 g IV every 6 hours over 30 minutes, often with antipseudomonal combination therapy in HAP/VAP, and with duration commonly 7–14 days depending on response and pathogen clearance [^111xhTyB] [^113JtxY5] [^115LHC8x] [^114qpcQ7] [^115Jyc8b].

> Wait, let me verify the exact FDA wording for nosocomial pneumonia, because I need to ensure I'm not overstating combination therapy. The FDA labeling recommends 4.5 g every 6 hours plus an aminoglycoside for initial presumptive treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, and to continue the aminoglycoside if Pseudomonas is isolated, which aligns with guideline-based empiric regimens for HAP/VAP that often pair an antipseudomonal β-lactam with a second agent in high-risk settings [^114qpcQ7] [^115Jyc8b] [^115aJDVG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about infusion strategy; I should review PK/PD targets and the evidence base. β-lactams exhibit time-dependent killing, and the key PK/PD target is the percent of time that free drug remains above the MIC, with many experts aiming for 100% fT > MIC or even 100% fT > 4×MIC in severe infections or for less susceptible pathogens, which is why extended or continuous infusions are favored to maximize fT > MIC and stabilize exposure in critically ill patients [^114fxxZd] [^1148ZSq2] [^113WcJDo].

> I will now examine the infusion-duration evidence. Prolonged or continuous infusions consistently improve pharmacodynamic target attainment in simulations and observational cohorts, and some meta-analyses suggest improved mortality with extended or continuous β-lactam infusions, particularly in pneumonia subgroups, although randomized data are mixed and not uniformly positive, so I should be cautious in overgeneralizing beyond ICU populations with high illness severity or resistant pathogens [^117RFnyk] [^114PhnFh] [^117VKcBK] [^112PESiN].

> Let me think about practical extended-infusion regimens. A commonly used approach is 4.5 g every 8 hours infused over 4 hours after a 4.5 g loading dose, which improves PTA at MICs around 16 mg/L compared with 30-minute infusions; continuous infusion of 12–16 g piperacillin per 24 hours after a 4.5 g loading dose is another strategy, particularly when targeting higher unbound concentrations for P. aeruginosa or in CRRT, with TDM to titrate to 16–64 mg/L depending on the MIC and clinical context [^113uBnDX] [^111aVarw] [^112BYito] [^113uFuCA] [^117Mxsfg].

> But wait, what if the MIC is high or the pathogen is borderline susceptible; I should double-check breakpoint-linked dosing. The 2022 CLSI breakpoints for Enterobacterales categorize many isolates at MIC 16/4 mg/L as susceptible dose-dependent, and achieving ≥ 90% PTA at this MIC generally requires 4.5 g every 6 hours as a 3-hour infusion or 4.5 g every 8 hours as a 4-hour infusion, whereas standard 30-minute infusions are insufficient at MIC 16 mg/L, reinforcing the role of extended infusion when SDD applies or when treating less susceptible organisms [^113L9Jv2] [^115wwDiV] [^115JWcr8].

> Next, I should review renal impairment, because under- or overdosing is common here. For CrCl > 40 mL/min, standard dosing applies; for CrCl 20–40 mL/min, reduce to 2.25 g every 6 hours; for CrCl < 20 mL/min, use 2.25 g every 8 hours; for intermittent hemodialysis, 2.25 g every 12 hours with an additional 0.75 g after each dialysis session is recommended, with higher frequencies sometimes used for nosocomial pneumonia in select contexts, and for CRRT, total daily doses around 12 g with extended or continuous infusion are commonly supported by PK modeling to hit PK/PD targets for Pseudomonas [^114mVJyR] [^113fhWyH] [^112SCeEe] [^111M56pc] [^111Zod8V].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought continuous infusion might universally outperform extended infusion in CRRT, but I should verify that assumption. Recent nomograms show that both extended and continuous infusions improve target attainment versus short infusions, with continuous infusion particularly advantageous when higher unbound targets are desired, yet in some CRRT settings a 4-hour extended infusion may yield similar PTA to short infusions depending on modality and intensity, so modality-specific dosing and TDM remain essential rather than assuming CI is always superior [^112N69gZ] [^116hGddx] [^113Cngj5].

> I need to ensure I address augmented renal clearance, because underexposure is frequent when CrCl is ≥ 130 mL/min. Standard intermittent dosing often fails to achieve PK/PD targets in ARC, and strategies include increasing to 4.5 g every 6 hours, using extended or continuous infusions, and incorporating TDM to titrate to 16–64 mg/L unbound piperacillin depending on the MIC and severity, with observational data suggesting improved outcomes when ARC is recognized and dosing is escalated [^116Aex1E] [^113snNGb] [^117V8mMH].

> Let me consider obesity, since volume of distribution and clearance can be altered. Evidence-based recommendations suggest using extended-infusion regimens such as 4.5 g every 8 hours over 4 hours in obese patients to improve PTA, with some data indicating that higher total daily doses may be needed at higher MICs; I should confirm that these are PK/PD-based suggestions rather than outcome-proven dose changes, which is accurate [^114o31JT] [^112cXuwg].

> I should confirm pediatric dosing separately to avoid extrapolation errors. For children ≥ 2 months and ≤ 40 kg, weight-based dosing is used, while those > 40 kg with normal renal function receive adult dosing; importantly, pediatric dosing for renal impairment is not fully established, so careful renal function assessment and clinical judgment are required when kidney function is reduced [^116Ttogx] [^1162dGJh].

> Next, I should review safety and drug–drug interactions that influence regimen choice. Combination with vancomycin increases nephrotoxicity risk, so if dual therapy is necessary, monitor renal function closely and consider alternatives or staggered therapy; piperacillin–tazobactam is generally well tolerated, but neurotoxicity can occur at high exposures, particularly in renal failure, so vigilance for seizures and neuromuscular excitability is warranted when using aggressive dosing or in accumulation states [^1178MT7z] [^113fhWyH].

> Hold on, I should verify how to operationalize TDM in practice. Many ICU programs target unbound piperacillin concentrations of 16–64 mg/L depending on whether the goal is 100% fT > MIC or 100% fT > 4×MIC and on the pathogen MIC, with sampling after 3–4 doses at steady state and dose adjustments guided by Bayesian software or linear scaling; randomized and prospective data show TDM-based strategies improve target attainment, though clinical outcome benefits are not uniformly demonstrated and require further study [^1148ZSq2] [^114uPgRj] [^112Xumfv] [^117Mxsfg] [^113HnPjo].

> I will now examine de-escalation and duration, because overtreatment is common. IDSA/ATS guidance supports narrowing therapy based on cultures and clinical response, with typical durations of 7–8 days for HAP/VAP when the patient is clinically improving, and shorter validated courses for CAP, which aligns with antimicrobial stewardship principles and reduces adverse events without compromising outcomes when applied thoughtfully [^115Jyc8b].

> Let me reconsider the overall practical recommendation to ensure internal consistency. For most adults with HAP/VAP and normal renal function, 4.5 g every 6 hours is the labeled starting point; in critically ill patients or when treating less susceptible pathogens, favor extended infusions such as 4.5 g every 8 hours over 4 hours after a 4.5 g loading dose, or continuous infusion of 12–16 g/day, with TDM to titrate to 16–64 mg/L unbound piperacillin depending on MIC and severity; for CAP without Pseudomonas risk, 3.375 g every 6 hours is appropriate; adjust for renal function as above and escalate dosing in ARC or obesity to preserve PK/PD target attainment [^114qpcQ7] [^113uBnDX] [^117Mxsfg] [^111xhTyB].

> Finally, I should double-check key uncertainties so we do not overstate the evidence. While PK/PD advantages of extended or continuous infusion are consistent, randomized outcome data are mixed and often underpowered; TDM improves target attainment but has not consistently translated into hard outcomes in all settings; and optimal CRRT dosing is modality dependent, reinforcing the need for local protocols, TDM where available, and reassessment of renal function and clinical response at least every 48–72 hours to guide dose adjustments and de-escalation [^117VKcBK] [^112Xumfv] [^112N69gZ].

The standard adult dose of piperacillin/tazobactam for pneumonia is **4.5 g IV every 6 hours** [^115Jyc8b] (infused over 30 minutes) [^114qpcQ7] for 7–14 days, with dose adjustments for renal impairment [^113deAbK] and consideration of **extended or continuous infusion** [^112PESiN] in critically ill patients to optimize pharmacodynamic targets [^114HPsPo]. For CAP without Pseudomonas risk, use **3.375 g IV every 6 hours** [^111xhTyB] for 7–10 days [^114qpcQ7]. Adjust dose for renal function: for CrCl 20–40 mL/min, 2.25–3.375 g every 6 hours; for CrCl < 20 mL/min, 2.25 g every 8 hours; and for hemodialysis, 2.25 g every 12 hours plus 0.75 g after each dialysis session [^113deAbK] [^111M56pc]. In obesity, use **actual body weight** and consider extended infusions to improve exposure [^114o31JT] [^112cXuwg].

## Standard dosing recommendations

Standard dosing recommendations are summarized below [^114mVJyR]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Standard dose** | **Infusion duration** | **Duration of therapy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nosocomial pneumonia (HAP/VAP) | 4.5 g every 6 hours | 30 minutes | 7–14 days [^114qpcQ7] |
| Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without Pseudomonas risk | 3.375 g every 6 hours | 30 minutes | 7–10 days [^111xhTyB] |
| Severe infections or critical illness | 4.5 g every 6 hours | 30 minutes | 7–14 days [^notfound] |

---

## Dose adjustments based on renal function

Piperacillin/tazobactam is primarily renally cleared; therefore, **dose adjustments are required** in renal impairment [^113HRPao]:

| **Creatinine clearance (crcl)** | **Recommended dose** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| > 40 mL/min | 4.5 g (standard dose) | Every 6 hours |
| 20–40 mL/min | 2.25–3.375 g | Every 6 hours |
| < 20 mL/min | 2.25 g | Every 8 hours |
| Hemodialysis | 2.25 g + 0.75 g post-dialysis | Every 12 hours |

---

## Special considerations

### Obesity

In obesity, **actual body weight** should be used to calculate dosing [^notfound], and extended or continuous infusions are recommended to optimize pharmacodynamic exposure [^112cXuwg].

---

### Critical illness and augmented renal clearance (ARC)

In critical illness and augmented renal clearance (ARC), **extended (3–4 hours) or continuous infusions** are recommended to achieve pharmacodynamic targets [^114HPsPo] [^112PESiN], and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may be beneficial in critically ill patients [^1148ZSq2] [^113uFuCA].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing strategies

- **Standard dosing**: 4.5 g every 6 hours is supported by FDA labeling and IDSA/ATS guidelines for nosocomial pneumonia [^114qpcQ7] [^115Jyc8b].
- **Extended infusion**: Associated with improved pharmacodynamic target attainment and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients [^112PESiN] [^117RFnyk] [^114PhnFh].
- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustments are supported by pharmacokinetic studies and FDA labeling [^113HRPao] [^113deAbK].

---

## Summary of dosing recommendations

- **Standard dose**: 4.5 g IV every 6 hours for nosocomial pneumonia [^114qpcQ7].
- **CAP**: 3.375 g IV every 6 hours for CAP without Pseudomonas risk [^111xhTyB].
- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dose based on creatinine clearance [^113deAbK].
- **Critical illness**: Consider extended or continuous infusion [^114HPsPo] [^112PESiN].

### Evaluating outcomes associated with alternative dosing strategies for piperacillin / tazobactam: a qualitative systematic review [^112PESiN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To perform a qualitative systematic review of the evidence comparing traditional strategies against prolonged intermittent or continuous infusion strategies for piperacillin/tazobactam, based on clinical and pharmacodynamic outcomes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1950-September 2011), EMBASE (1980-September 2011), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2011) were searched, using the terms piperacillin, tazobactam, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, dosing, and infusion. Reference lists from relevant publications were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles evaluating the administration of piperacillin/tazobactam to adults and comparing at least 2 dosing regimens (1 of which included the traditional, manufacturer-recommended 30-minute infusion; the other, a prolonged or continuous infusion strategy) were included. Prespecified clinical outcomes of interest included mortality, clinical cures, and adverse events. The pharmacodynamic endpoint of interest was percent time of unbound drug concentration remaining above the minimum inhibitory concentration.

Data Synthesis

Twelve studies were included in this review, 7 of which assessed clinical outcomes and 5 that assessed pharmacodynamic endpoints using Monte Carlo simulations. Prolonged or continuous infusions of piperacillin/tazobactam consistently achieved higher pharmacodynamic endpoints than did traditional infusions. The association of prolonged or continuous infusions with improved clinical outcomes, however, is unclear. Two retrospective studies found improved mortality rates with prolonged infusions (1 in a subgroup of patients with higher APACHE II [Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II] scores), while another retrospective study found improved clinical cure rates with continuous infusions in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. These clinical benefits have not been substantiated in prospective randomized trials. No study has provided evidence of reduced adverse effects with prolonged or continuous infusions.

Conclusions

The limited evidence available does not firmly support widespread adoption of administering piperacillin/tazobactam as prolonged intermittent or continuous infusions to improve clinical outcomes despite the achievement of higher pharmacodynamic targets in simulated studies. Retrospective studies indicate that critical care patients are the subgroup most likely to benefit from these dosing strategies. Well-designed prospective clinical trials are required to confirm potential benefits observed in retrospective studies.

### Piperacillin and tazobactam [^114qpcQ7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosage in Adult Patients With Indications Other Than Nosocomial Pneumonia

The usual total daily dosage of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection for adult patients with indications other than nosocomial pneumonia is 3.375 g every six hours [totaling 13.5 g (12.0 g piperacillin and 1.5 g tazobactam)], to be administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The usual duration of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection treatment is from 7 to 10 days.

2.2 Dosage in Adult Patients With Nosocomial Pneumonia

Initial presumptive treatment of adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia should start with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection at a dosage of 4.5 g every six hours plus an aminoglycoside, [totaling 18.0 g (16.0 g piperacillin and 2.0 g tazobactam)], administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The recommended duration of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection treatment for nosocomial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days. Treatment with the aminoglycoside should be continued in patients from whom P. aeruginosa is isolated.

2.3 Dosage in Adult Patients With Renal Impairment

In adult patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min) and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be reduced based on the degree of renal impairment. The recommended daily dosage of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection for patients with renal impairment administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes is described in Table 1.

For patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dose is 2.25 g every twelve hours for all indications other than nosocomial pneumonia and 2.25 g every eight hours for nosocomial pneumonia. Since hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of the administered dose, an additional dose of 0.75 g piperacillin and tazobactam for injection (0.67 g piperacillin and 0.08 g tazobactam) should be administered following each dialysis period on hemodialysis days. No additional dosage of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection is necessary for CAPD patients.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)–optimized dosing in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) — the panel carefully weighed potential advantages of PK/PD-optimized dosing (decreased mortality, decreased ICU length of stay, and increased clinical cure rate) against downsides and, on this basis, decided that patients with HAP/VAP should have PK/PD-optimized dosing of their antimicrobial regimens, rather than simply following the dosing described in the manufacturer's prescribing information. PK/PD-optimized dosing is probably more burdensome and costly than conventional dosing, with the most accurate approach requiring measurement of the blood concentration of the antibiotic and incorporation of the result into a dosing software package, and costs and burdens including education, blood sampling, performing the drug assay, and acquiring and updating the software; alternative interventions such as routine extended infusions of β-lactams or weight-based dosing of aminoglycosides are probably less burdensome and costly than management using the blood concentration of antibiotics, but still more burdensome than conventional dosing. No published studies describing the PK/PD of piperacillin-tazobactam or polymyxins (colistin or polymyxin B) in patients with HAP/VAP are available at this time and so these drugs were not included in this recommendation. The document contrasts this stance with an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report that concluded the evidence does not favor the routine use of PK/PD and suggests methodological differences including consolidation into a singular PICO question and use of meta-analytic methodology as reasons for differing conclusions.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113bGebD]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Administering PIP-TAZ as a prolonged infusion — that is, either administering the antibiotic over half the dosing interval (e.g. over 3 h if given QID), or administering the total daily dose as a continuous infusion over 24 h after an initial loading dose — may help overcome subtherapeutic PIP concentrations in the critically ill. There are now observational studies as well as randomized controlled trial (RCT) data that show increased likelihood of PIP concentrations being maintained above the MIC of pathogens using the prolonged infusion strategy. Furthermore, there were higher rates of clinical cure associated with PIP-TAZ administered as a continuous infusion in the RCTs. Both of the RCTs included patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, and so, coupled with the results from the study by Zander et al. showing PK/PD target attainment being problematic in these groups of patients via intermittent bolus dosing, the use of prolonged infusions may be a simple strategy that ICUs can employ. Notably, however, prolonged infusions may still not achieve therapeutic targets in certain groups of patients, such as those displaying ARC. In these circumstances, dose up-titration may also be advisable, but can only be comfortably performed with use of TDM.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113vaxgM]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Zander and colleagues have provided new information on target attainment of PIP concentrations in a heterogeneous group of critically ill patients. Among patients without severe renal dysfunction, there are concerns of not reaching PK/PD targets using traditional TID dosing of PIP-TAZ. There also is high inter- and intra-patient variability in PIP concentrations. Alternative dosing strategies that optimize PIP-TAZ therapy are needed and may include the use of prolonged infusions. Importantly, there is strong rationale for the use of regular TDM to be the cornerstone for individualizing PIP-TAZ therapy and maximize efficacy.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

If a dose of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection is required that does not equal 2.25 g, 3.375 g, or 4.5 g, this product is not recommended for use and an alternative formulation of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be considered.

2.2 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients With Indications Other Than Nosocomial Pneumonia

The usual total daily dosage of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection for adult patients with indications other than nosocomial pneumonia is 3.375 g every 6 (six) hours, to be administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The usual duration of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection treatment is from 7 to 10 days.

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients With Nosocomial Pneumonia

Initial presumptive treatment of adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia should start with Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection at a dosage of 4.5 g every 6 (six) hours plus an aminoglycoside, administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The recommended duration of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection treatment for nosocomial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days. Treatment with the aminoglycoside should be continued in patients from whom P. aeruginosa is isolated.

2.4 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients With Renal Impairment

In adult patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min) and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection should be reduced based on the degree of renal impairment. The recommended daily dosage of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection for patients with renal impairment administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes is described in Table 1.

For patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dose is 2.25 g every 12 hours for all indications other than nosocomial pneumonia and 2.25 g every 8 hours for nosocomial pneumonia. Since hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of the administered dose, an additional dose of 0.75 g piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be administered following each dialysis period on hemodialysis days. No additional dosage of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection is necessary for CAPD patients.

### Comparative pharmacodynamics of intermittent and prolonged infusions of piperacillin / tazobactam using monte carlo simulation and steady-state pharmacokinetic data from hospitalized patients [^113CiDae]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

With increasing antibiotic resistance in gram-negative pathogens, dosing strategies that optimize pharmacodynamic parameters of currently available antibiotics play an important role in treatment. The likelihood of success with piperacillin/tazobactam, a widely used broad-spectrum antibiotic, can be manipulated by increasing the amount of time that unbound drug concentrations remain above the pathogen's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). However, this success depends greatly on knowing the MIC value as well as accurately estimating the individual's pharmacokinetic parameters. Clinicians should carefully factor these variables into their decision-making process when considering prolonged infusion strategies with piperacillin/tazobactam.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113HnPjo]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

To this end, a major challenge in determining optimal PIP-TAZ dosing for individual critically ill patients is the high inter-patient variability in serum PIP trough concentrations. Zander and investigators noted a 123-fold to > 1785-fold range of PIP trough concentrations among their study patients, which was more pronounced in patients with higher creatinine clearances than those with severely impaired renal function. Other investigators have also shown high inter-patient variability with PIP-TAZ dosing, albeit in studies with smaller sample sizes of more homogeneous groups of critically ill patients. From these PK data, as well as due to pathogen-related factors such as decreasing antibiotic susceptibilities, as reflected by higher MICs, it is becoming evident that an individualized dosing approach needs to be adopted in order to maximize PIP-TAZ efficacy. Given this, there is significant scope for TDM of PIP-TAZ as well as other beta-lactam antibiotics in the ICU. Monitoring of trough concentrations at a steady state (usually after 3 to 4 doses) is generally recommended to see whether PK/PD targets are being met. Earlier measurement should be preferred where dosing can be optimized using Bayesian dosing software. Additionally, measurement of the 'free' or unbound PIP concentrations, rather than 'total' concentrations as described by Zander et al. is advised. Although PIP is not highly protein bound (typically 30%), differences in protein binding among patients, particularly those in hypoalbuminemic states, as well as alterations in protein binding during assay preparation, means there is much guess work determining PK/PD targets when using 'total' rather than 'unbound' antibiotic concentrations.

Early administration of appropriate empiric antibiotics is essential for achieving the best possible outcomes in sepsis. Yet the choice of antibiotic therapy has become more challenging due to recent reports of nephrotoxicity with the combination of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, the "workhorse" regimen at many institutions. In this article we assess the evidence for nephrotoxicity and its possible mechanisms, provide recommendations for risk mitigation, address the advantages and disadvantages of alternative antibiotic choices, and suggest areas for future research.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of piperacillin / tazobactam when administered by continuous infusion and intermittent dosing [^114fxxZd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although intermittent bolus dosing is currently the standard of practice for many antimicrobial agents, beta-lactams exhibit time-dependent bacterial killing. Maximizing the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for a pathogen is the best pharmacodynamic predictor of efficacy. Use of a continuous infusion has been advocated for maximizing the time above the MIC compared with intermittent bolus dosing.

Objective

This study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of piperacillin/tazobactam when administered as an intermittent bolus versus a continuous infusion against clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Methods

Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive piperacillin 3 g/ tazobactam 0.375 g q6h for 24 hours, piperacillin 6 g/tazobactam 0.75 g continuous infusion over 24 hours, and piperacillin 12 g/tazobactam 1.5 g continuous infusion over 24 hours. Five clinical isolates each of P aeruginosa and K pneumoniae were used for pharmacodynamic analyses.

Results

Eleven healthy subjects (7 men, 4 women; mean ± SD age, 28 ± 4.7 years) were enrolled. Mean steady-state serum concentrations of piperacillin were 16.0 ± 5.0 and 37.2 ± 6.8 microg/mL with piperacillin 6 and 12 g, respectively. Piperacillin/tazobactam 13.5 g continuous infusion (piperacillin 12 g/tazobactam 1.5 g) was significantly more likely to produce a serum inhibitory titer ≥ 1:2 against P aeruginosa at 24 hours than either the 6.75 g continuous infusion (piperacillin 6 g/tazobactam 0.75 g) or 3.375 g q6h (piperacillin 3 g/ tazobactam 0.375 g). There were no statistical differences against K pneumoniae between regimens. The median area under the inhibitory activity-time curve (AUIC) for the 13.5 g continuous infusion was higher than that for 3.375 g q6h and the 6.75 g continuous infusion against both P aeruginosa and Kpneumoniae (P ≤ 0.007, 13.5 g continuous infusion and 3.375 g q6h vs 6.75 g continuous infusion against K pneumoniae). The percentage of subjects with an AUIC ≥ 125 was higher with both 3.375 g q6h and the 13.5 g continuous infusion than with the 6.75 g continuous infusion against P aeruginosa and K pneumoniae (both, P < 0.001 vs 6.75 g continuous infusion against K pneumoniae).

Conclusions

Piperacillin 12 g/tazobactam 1.5 g continuous infusion consistently resulted in serum concentrations above the breakpoint for Enterobacteriaceae and many of the susceptible strains of P aeruginosa in this study in 11 healthy subjects. Randomized controlled clinical trials are warranted to determine the appropriate dose of piperacillin/tazobactam.

From these results, a dosing nomogram was developed for each drug, considering (1) a standard trough/average steady-state concentration target of ≥ 2 mg/L for meropenem and ≥ 16 mg/L for piperacillin/tazobactam (global 100% fT > MIC and 4 × MIC for Enterobacterales) and (2) a higher target of ≥ 4–8 mg/L for meropenem and ≥ 32–64 mg/L for piperacillin/tazobactam (empirical treatment and 4 × MIC for P. aeruginosa). The recommended dosing regimens provided the highest likelihood of achieving effective and non-toxic concentrations during the first 24 h and at steady state.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^113L9Jv2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Piperacillin–tazobactam dosing ratios and susceptibility breakpoints — In a 4.5 g dose of piperacillin-tazobactam there is an 8:1 ratio of piperacillin to tazobactam (ie, 4 grams of piperacillin and 0.5 grams of tazobactam), whereas in a 3 g dose of cefotolozane there is a 2:1 ratio of cefotolozane to tazobactam. The piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoint for Enterobacterales has been based on PK/PD considerations and a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL of tazobactam in testing wells. In 2022, the CLSI lowered the piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints for Enterobacterales: MICs of ≤ 8/4 μg/mL are considered susceptible and a MIC of 16 μg/mL is considered susceptible, dose-dependent; in the clinical trial mentioned in Question 1.3, 94% of isolates would have been considered susceptible or susceptible dose-dependent under the revised breakpoints, indicating that in the presence of ESBL production, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam may not correlate with clinical success.

### Are standard doses of piperacillin sufficient for critically ill patients with augmented creatinine clearance? [^116Aex1E]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that an empiric intermittent infusion of 4.5 g of piperacillin-tazobactam is unlikely to achieve optimal piperacillin exposure in a significant proportion of critically ill patients with sepsis, particularly when targeting less susceptible pathogens. This appears to be driven primarily by an increase in drug CL in some patients, and our data reinforce the value of CL CR in predicting whether optimal exposures are likely. As such, clinicians should be wary of the adequacy of conventional dosing in patients manifesting ARC, and research should now be focused on the use of novel administration strategies in such patients, in addition to correlating changes in antibacterial PK with clinical outcomes.

### Efficacy and tolerability of piperacillin / tazobactam versus ceftazidime in association with amikacin for treating nosocomial pneumonia in intensive care patients: a prospective randomized multicenter trial [^116rvxfG]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare clinical and bacteriological efficacy as well as tolerability of two regimens of broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftazidime versus piperacillin/tazobactam) combined with amikacin in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in intensive care patients.

Design

Open label, prospective, multicenter, and randomized phase III clinical trial.

Setting

Medical or surgical intensive care units (ICUs) of nine acute-care teaching hospitals in Spain.

Patients and Participants

One hundred and twenty-four ICU patients with nosocomial pneumonia and requiring mechanical ventilation were included. They were randomized to receive amikacin (15 mg/day divided into two doses) combined with either piperacillin (4 g every 6 h) and tazobactam (0.5 g every 6 h) (n = 88) or ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h) (n = 36).

Measurements and Results

The causative pathogen was determined in 60.2% of patients in the group of amikacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam and in 76.9% in the group of amikacin plus ceftazidime. A total of 94 bacterial organisms were isolated among which gram-negative bacilli predominated, Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most frequent. Clinical response at the end of antibiotic therapy was considered satisfactory (cure and/or improvement) in 63.9% of patients in the amikacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam group and in 61.5% in the amikacin plus ceftazidime (odds ratio 1.1; 95% confidence interval 0.44–2.75). Eradication or presumptive eradication rates for each pathogen and for either gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria were similar in both antibiotic combinations (odds ratio 1.2; 95% confidence interval 0.39–3.66). A total of 21 adverse effects (23.9%) occurred in the amikacin plus piperacillin and tazobactam group and six (16.7%) in the amikacin plus ceftazidime group, thrombocytosis, renal dysfunction, and hepatic cytolysis being the most common. The efficacy and tolerability of the two therapeutic regimens were similar not only in the whole study population, but also in the subset of P. aeruginosa-related pneumonia (odds ratio 1; 95% confidence interval 0.08–13.37).

Conclusions

Amikacin associated with either ceftazidime or piperacillin and tazobactam has shown comparable efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of ICU patients with nosocomial pneumonia.

### Antibiotic therapy of pneumonia in the obese patient: dosing and delivery [^112cXuwg]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Piperacillin and tazobactam

There is little information regarding penicillin dosing in the obese population with pneumonia. The pharmacokinetic properties of piperacillin and tazobactam have been described in obese patients with infections other than pneumonia. In a 33-year-old morbidly obese patient (BMI = 55 kg/m 2) with a surgical site infection following a transfemoral left leg amputation receiving piperacillin and tazobactam at 4.5 g every 6 h as a 30-min infusion, the percentage free drug T > 4 × MIC and percentage free drug T > MIC were 25 and 60% of the dosing interval, respectively. A study of 14 hospitalized obese patients (weight > 120 kg, BMI = 52.3 ± 10.8 kg/m 2) receiving piperacillin and tazobactam 4.5 g every 8 h or 6.75 g every 8 h infused over 4 h found the pharmacokinetics were different compared with nonobese patients. For piperacillin, the probability of target attainment for at least 50% of free drug T > MIC was at least 91% for doses of at least 4.5 g every 8 h at MICs of 16 μg/ml or less. For tazobactam, the probability of target attainment was 57, 84, and 94% for doses of 4.5, 6.75, and 9.0 g every 8 h, respectively. On the basis of the available data, higher doses of piperacillin and tazobactam and longer infusion time of up to 4 h may be required in obese patients.

Cephalosoprins

Analysis of serial serum cefepime concentrations after dosing in 10 morbidly obese patients (BMI > 40 kg/m 2; estimated GFR = 108.4 ± 34.6 ml/min) found that an increased dose of 2 g every 8 h was necessary to maintain an adequate free drug T > MIC throughout the dosing interval. Therefore, the use of the upper limit of normal doses of cephalosporins is recommended in obese patients.

### Alveolar concentrations of piperacillin / tazobactam administered in continuous infusion to patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia [^113uFuCA]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the steady-state serum and alveolar concentrations of piperacillin/tazobactam administered in continuous infusion to critically ill patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and various degrees of renal failure.

Design

Prospective comparative study.

Setting

An intensive care unit and research ward in a university hospital.

Patients

Forty patients with microbiologically documented ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive piperacillin/tazobactam daily continuous infusions of 12/1.5 g or 16/2 g after a loading dose of 4/0.5 g. The serum and alveolar piperacillin/tazobactam concentrations were determined at steady-state with high performance liquid chromatography.

Measurements and Main Results

The median (interquartile) serum and alveolar piperacillin concentrations were respectively 25.3 mg/L (23.1–32.6) and 12.7 mg/L (6.7–18.0) for 12/1.5 g/day, and 38.9 mg/L (32.9–59.6) and 19.1 mg/L (14.0–21.5), respectively, for 16/2 g/day in patients with no/mild renal failure. In patients with moderate/advance renal failure, the median (interquartile) serum and alveolar piperacillin concentrations were 102.4 mg/L (97.4–112.6) and 44.1 mg/L (33.4–48.3), respectively, for 12/1.5 g/day, and 135.3 mg/L (119.5–146.2) and 54.9 mg/L (45.2–110.3), respectively, for 16/2 g/day. Our results show great variability in piperacillin/tazobactam concentrations, with an alveolar percentage penetration of 40–50% for piperacillin and 65–85% for tazobactam and a negative association between serum or alveolar concentrations and creatinine clearance.

Conclusions

A target piperacillin serum concentration of at least 35–40 mg/L is probably required to provide alveolar concentrations exceeding the susceptibility breakpoint for gram-negative bacteria (16 mg/L) during ventilator-associated pneumonia. In patients with no/mild renal failure, a continuous daily dose of piperacillin/tazobactam 16/2 g allows reaching this target concentration, which might be not observed with 12/1.5 g/day. In patients with moderate/advanced renal failure, both dosages achieve serum concentrations far above the 35–40 mg/L threshold, suggesting that in that case, therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed in order to adjust the daily dose.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113ofxxR]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Interestingly, although Zander and colleagues found intra-patient variability to be less than inter-patient variability in their study cohort, the coefficient of variations (CV) for intra-patient PIP concentration variability was still wide, ranging from 6.4 to 129% (median of 30%). The heterogeneity of the study population most likely contributed to this wide intra-patient variability; however, the median CV for intra-patient variability is comparable to the median CV of 40% reported by Carlier et al. and reflects the key message that consistent dosing of PIP-TAZ does not necessarily result in consistent PIP concentrations throughout the period of therapy. This suggests that the use of merely 'once-off' TDM may be inadequate in determining if PK/PD targets are being attained consistently throughout therapy duration. We believe this study and previous work make the case for more frequent, perhaps even daily, use of TDM to ensure ongoing efficacy of PIP-TAZ in the critically ill patient.

The findings from this study suggest that an even more sophisticated method of optimization may be necessary in selected patients - patient-tailored antibiotic therapy - which is the adaptation of antibiotic therapy to the need of the individual patient in order to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity through therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adaptation. Unfortunately, TDM of β-lactam antibiotics is currently challenging with long turnaround times, expensive equipment, logistical problems related to the instability of the antibiotics in the samples and the need for well-trained personnel. Efforts to overcome these limitations, and clinical studies to assess utility in the clinical setting are urgently needed.

### Variation in target attainment of beta-lactam antibiotic dosing between international pediatric formularies [^114hHz2t]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this review demonstrate that the high variability of dosing recommendations in national and international formularies impacts PKPD target attainment. While to some this may seem unsurprising, since beta‐lactams are generally thought to be drugs with a large therapeutic window, commonly used dosing schemes could routinely be set so high that variability does not in fact impact target attainment. However, a combination of increasing resistance and therefore MICs, and the often lack of regulatory licensing studies to set pediatric dosing, increasingly mean that choosing which guideline to follow is important, and should be informed by local sensitivity patterns and disease severity in the individual or population to be treated.

Pneumonia treatments show adequate target attainment in common gram‐positive infections. Here, co‐amoxiclav showed the best coverage across all extracted recommendations. Common regimens for cephalosporins in the treatment of sepsis and meningitis cover sensitive Enterobacterales infections reasonably well, and although more than 75% of the pediatric population is adequately covered in some instances, this leaves a small but significant proportion who are not. For intermediate‐to‐resistant MICs, Enterobacterales infections are covered in just over half of the population when using cephalosporins, with even lower target attainment for the penicillins and meropenem. Given that piperacillin‐tazobactam and meropenem are less likely to cause neurotoxicity than the cephalosporins, this suggests the need for reviewing current dosing recommendations in settings where MICs are typically in the intermediate range. The data presented here suggest that a "one‐size‐fits‐all" dosing recommendation may not be optimal in future and local dosing guidelines of AWaRe antibiotics may indeed be warranted to reflect variation in AMR patterns globally.

### Investigation algorithms [^1142jNwP]. Pathway Editors (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "Piperacillin/Tazobactam Dosage Calculator (non-pulmonary indications)" for acute appendicitis.

The Piperacillin/Tazobactam Dose Calculator for Non-Pulmonary Indications is a clinical tool used to determine the appropriate dosage of the antibiotic combination piperacillin/tazobactam for patients with various non-pulmonary infections. This calculator is specifically designed for use in adult patients who are not suffering from pulmonary conditions but require treatment with this antibiotic for other types of infections. The clinical utility of this calculator lies in its ability to provide accurate and individualized dosing recommendations based on a patient's specific clinical parameters, such as body weight and renal function. This helps to optimize the effectiveness of the antibiotic therapy while minimizing potential side effects. The calculator should not be used in patients with pulmonary infections, as the dosing requirements may differ. It is also not suitable for use in pediatric patients or in patients with severe renal impairment, as the dosing calculations may not be accurate in these populations.

The Piperacillin/tazobactam dose calculator is designed to provide dosage recommendations for non-pulmonary indications based on the patient's renal function. By assessing the level of kidney function, the calculator can tailor the medication dosage to ensure efficacy and safety in treatment.

The key inputs to this calculator are grouped into the following categories of renal function:

- Hemodialysis
- Creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than 40 mL/min
- CrCl between 20–40 mL/min
- CrCl less than 20 mL/min

Based on the selected renal function category, the dosing recommendation is determined as follows:

1. For patients on Hemodialysis, the suggestion is to administer Piperacillin/tazobactam at a dose of 2.25 g intravenously every 12 hours. Additionally, on hemodialysis days, following each dialysis session, an extra dose of 0.75 g should be given.

2. If the patient's creatinine clearance is greater than 40 mL/min, the recommended dose is 3.375 g intravenously every 6 hours.

3. For creatinine clearance ranging from 20 to 40 mL/min, the dosage is set at 2.25 g intravenously every 6 hours.

4. When the creatinine clearance is less than 20 mL/min, the dosing schedule is adjusted to 2.25 g intravenously every 8 hours.

This strategic adjustment of dosage according to renal function is crucial for providing personalized medical care, ensuring that medications are both safe and effective while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical Trials in Adult Patients

During the initial clinical investigations, 2621 patients worldwide were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in phase 3 trials. In the key North American monotherapy clinical trials (n = 830 patients), 90% of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. However, in 3.2% of the patients treated worldwide, piperacillin and tazobactam was discontinued because of adverse events primarily involving the skin (1.3%), including rash and pruritus; the gastrointestinal system (0.9%), including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; and allergic reactions (0.5%).

Nosocomial Pneumonia Trials

Two trials of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections were conducted. In one study, 222 patients were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam in a dosing regimen of 4.5 g every 6 hours in combination with an aminoglycoside and 215 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg/500 mg every 6 hours) in combination with an aminoglycoside. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 402 patients, 204 (91.9%) in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 198 (92.1%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Twenty-five (11.0%) patients in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 14 (6.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group (p > 0.05) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

Objective

To determine the steady-state plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations of piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) administered to critically ill patients with severe bacterial pneumonia.

Design

Prospective, open-label study.

Setting

An intensive care unit and research ward in a university hospital.

Patients

Ten adult patients with severe nosocomial bacterial pneumonia on mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

All subjects received a 30-min intravenous infusion of P/T 4 g/0.5 g every 8 h. The steady-state plasma and ELF concentrations of P/T were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Measurements and Main Results

The mean ± SD steady-state plasma trough, peak, and intermediate concentrations were 8.5 ± 4.6 microg/ml, 55.9 ± 21.6 microg/ml, and 24.0 ± 13.8 microg/ml for piperacillin, and 2.1 ± 1.0 microg/ml, 4.8 ± 2.1 microg/ml, and 2.4 ± 1.2 microg/ml for tazobactam, respectively. The mean ± SD steady-state intermediate ELF concentrations were 13.6 ± 9.4 microg/ml for piperacillin and 2.1 ± 1.1 microg/ml for tazobactam, respectively, showing a mean percentage penetration of piperacillin and tazobactam into ELF of 56.8% and 91.3%, respectively, with a P/T ratio of 6.5:1.

Conclusion

Our results show that during the treatment of severe nosocomial pneumonia, a regimen of P/T 4 g/0.5 g every 8 h might provide insufficient concentrations into lung tissue to exceed the MIC of many causative pathogens. This suggests that higher doses of P/T should be administered in order to maximize the antibiotic concentration at the site of infection, or that a second antimicrobial agent should be used in association.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric therapy — MSSA-directed regimens in low MRSA prevalence ICUs: We suggest including an agent active against MSSA (and not MRSA) for the empiric treatment of suspected VAP in patients without risk factors for antimicrobial resistance, who are being treated in ICUs where < 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When empiric treatment that includes coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred agents for treatment of proven MSSA, but are not necessary for the empiric treatment of VAP if one of the above agents is used.

MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage and HCAP category — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the inpatient setting: we recommend abandoning use of the prior categorization of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to guide selection of extended antibiotic coverage in adults with CAP (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and we recommend clinicians only cover empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in adults with CAP if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence); empiric treatment options for MRSA include vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 h, adjust based on levels) or linezolid (600 mg every 12 h), and for P. aeruginosa include piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h), cefepime (2 g every 8 h), ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h), aztreonam (2 g every 8 h), meropenem (1 g every 8 h), or imipenem (500 mg every 6 h); if clinicians are currently covering empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa on the basis of published risk factors but do not have local etiologic data, we recommend continuing empiric coverage while obtaining culture data to justify continued treatment after the first few days of empiric treatment (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium (Zosyn) [^114mVJyR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

If a dose of ZOSYN is required that does not equal 2.25 g, 3.375 g, or 4.5 g, ZOSYN injection in GALAXY Containers is not recommended for use and an alternative formulation of ZOSYN should be considered.

2.2 Dosage in Adult Patients With Indications Other Than Nosocomial Pneumonia

The usual total daily dosage of ZOSYN for adult patients with indications other than nosocomial pneumonia is 3.375 g every six hours [totaling 13.5 g (12.0 g piperacillin and 1.5 g tazobactam)], to be administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The usual duration of ZOSYN treatment is from 7 to 10 days.

2.3 Dosage in Adult Patients With Nosocomial Pneumonia

Initial presumptive treatment of adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia should start with ZOSYN at a dosage of 4.5 g every six hours plus an aminoglycoside, [totaling 18.0 g (16.0 g piperacillin and 2.0 g tazobactam)], administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The recommended duration of ZOSYN treatment for nosocomial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days. Treatment with the aminoglycoside should be continued in patients from whom P. aeruginosa is isolated.

2.4 Dosage in Adult Patients With Renal Impairment

In adult patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min) and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of ZOSYN should be reduced based on the degree of renal impairment. The recommended daily dosage of ZOSYN for patients with renal impairment administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes is described in Table 1.

For patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dose is 2.25 g every twelve hours for all indications other than nosocomial pneumonia and 2.25 g every eight hours for nosocomial pneumonia. Since hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of the administered dose, an additional dose of 0.75 g ZOSYN (0.67 g piperacillin and 0.08 g tazobactam) should be administered following each dialysis period on hemodialysis days. No additional dosage of ZOSYN is necessary for CAPD patients.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam dose optimization in the setting of piperacillin / tazobactam-susceptible, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa: time to reconsider susceptible dose dependent [^113Qig9b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study evaluates the in vitro potency of piperacillin/tazobactam among a global collection of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CR-PA) and assesses the adequacy of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) P aeruginosa breakpoint dose in the setting of CR-PA using Monte Carlo simulation.

Methods

Isolates were collected during the Enhancing Rational Antimicrobials Against Carbapenem-Resistant P aeruginosa (ERACE-PA) Global Surveillance Program. Piperacillin/tazobactam MICs were determined using broth microdilution per CLSI standards. A 5000-patient Monte Carlo simulation was performed using various piperacillin/tazobactam dosing regimens to determine the probability of target attainment (PTA) for 50% free time above the MIC. The MIC distribution of piperacillin/tazobactam-susceptible CR-PA was used to calculate cumulative fraction of response (CFR). Optimal PTA and CFR were defined as 90% target achievement.

Findings

A total of 28% of tested CR-PA were piperacillin/tazobactam susceptible. Of these, 71% had MICs of 8 to 16/4 mg/L. Doses of 3.375 g q6h as 0.5-hour infusion (current breakpoint dose) had adequate PTA at MIC of 8/4 mg/L (CFR, 81%); however, extended infusion of 3 or 4 hours improved PTA at 16/4 mg/L (CFR, > 90%). Doses of 4.5 g q8h as a 4-hour infusion and 4.5 g q6h as a 3-hour infusion both provide > 90% PTA at an MIC of 16 mg/L (CFRs, 97 and 100%, respectively), favoring susceptible dose dependent interpretive criteria with these regimens.

Implications

Although susceptible, piperacillin/ tazobactam has reduced potency in CR-PA. If piperacillin/tazobactam is used for susceptible CR-PA, high-doses (4.5 g q6h) and extended infusion (3 hours or continuous infusion) are needed to optimize exposure.

### Breaking down the breakpoints: rationale for the 2022 clinical and laboratory standards institute revised piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints against enterobacterales [^115wwDiV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) is one of the most common antibiotics administered to hospitalized patients. Its broad activity against gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic pathogens; efficacy in clinical trials across diverse infection types and patient populations; and generally favorable toxicity profile make it a particularly appealing antibiotic agent. PTZ susceptibility interpretive criteria (ie, breakpoints) for the Enterobacterales were initially established in 1992, as the drug was undergoing approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the ensuing 30 years, changes in the molecular epidemiology of the Enterobacterales and its impact on PTZ susceptibility testing, mounting pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data generated from sophisticated techniques such as population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation, and disturbing safety signals in a large clinical trial prompted the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) to review available evidence to determine the need for revision of the PTZ breakpoints for Enterobacterales. After an extensive literature review and formal voting process, the susceptibility criteria were revised in the 2022 CLSI M100 document to the following: ≤ 8/4 µg/mL (susceptible), 16/4 µg/mL (susceptible dose-dependent), and ≥ 32/4 µg/mL (resistant). Herein, we provide a brief overview of the CLSI process of antibiotic breakpoint revisions and elaborate on the available data that ultimately led to the decision to revise the PTZ breakpoints.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection for intra-abdominal infections, and nosocomial pneumonia have been established in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older.

Use of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections including appendicitis and/or peritonitis is supported by evidence from well-controlled studies and pharmacokinetic studies in adults and in pediatric patients. This includes a prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label clinical trial with 542 pediatric patients 2 to 12 years of age with intra-abdominal infections (including appendicitis (complicated by rupture or abscess) and/or peritonitis), in which 273 pediatric patients received piperacillin and tazobactam [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Use of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older with nosocomial pneumonia is supported by evidence from well-controlled studies in adults with nosocomial pneumonia, a simulation study performed with a population pharmacokinetic model, and a retrospective, cohort study of pediatric patients with nosocomial pneumonia in which 140 pediatric patients were treated with Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and 267 patients treated with comparators (which included ticarcillinclavulanate, carbapenems, ceftazidime, cefepime, or ciprofloxacin) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Because of the limitations of the available strengths and administration requirements (i.e., administration of fractional doses is not recommended) of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection, and to avoid unintentional overdose, this product is not recommended for use if a dose of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection, that does not equal 2.25 g, 3.375 g, or 4.5 g is required, and an alternative formulation of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

The safety and effectiveness of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection have not been established in pediatric patients less than 2 months of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) and Dosage and Administration (2)].

Dosage of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection in pediatric patients with renal impairment has not been determined.

### Variation in target attainment of beta-lactam antibiotic dosing between international pediatric formularies [^117VyC2h]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

As antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens decreases, ensuring optimal dosing may preserve the use of older antibiotics in order to limit the spread of resistance to newer agents. Beta-lactams represent the most widely prescribed antibiotic class, yet most were licensed prior to legislation changes mandating their study in children. As a result, significant heterogeneity persists in the pediatric doses used globally, along with quality of evidence used to inform dosing. This review summarizes dosing recommendations from the major pediatric reference sources and tries to answer the questions: Does beta-lactam dose heterogeneity matter? Does it impact pharmacodynamic target attainment? For three important severe clinical infections-pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis-pharmacokinetic models were identified for common for beta-lactam antibiotics. Real-world demographics were derived from three multicenter point prevalence surveys. Simulation results were compared with minimum inhibitory concentration distributions to inform appropriateness of recommended doses in targeted and empiric treatment. While cephalosporin dosing regimens are largely adequate for target attainment, they also pose the most risk of neurotoxicity. Our review highlights aminopenicillin, piperacillin, and meropenem doses as potentially requiring review/optimization in order to preserve the use of these agents in future.

### Piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium (piperacillin and tazobactam) [^113pDj7E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolism

Piperacillin is metabolized to a minor microbiologically active desethyl metabolite. Tazobactam is metabolized to a single metabolite that lacks pharmacological and antibacterial activities.

Excretion

Following single or multiple piperacillin and tazobactam doses to healthy subjects, the plasma half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 hours and was unaffected by dose or duration of infusion.

Both piperacillin and tazobactam are eliminated via the kidney by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Piperacillin is excreted rapidly as unchanged drug with 68% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. Tazobactam and its metabolite are eliminated primarily by renal excretion with 80% of the administered dose excreted as unchanged drug and the remainder as the single metabolite. Piperacillin, tazobactam and desethyl piperacillin are also secreted into the bile.

Specific Populations

Renal Impairment

After the administration of single doses of piperacillin and tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for piperacillin and tazobactam are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. See Dosage and Administration (2) for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal-­impairment.

### Probability of pharmacodynamic target attainment with standard and prolonged-infusion antibiotic regimens for empiric therapy in adults with hospital-acquired pneumonia [^113ktQng]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The pharmacodynamic characteristics of antibiotics should be considered when choosing empiric dosage regimens for the treatment of pneumonia.

Objective

This study compared the probabilities of achieving requisite pharmacodynamic exposure (ie, f T > MIC, AUC/MIC) for antibiotics given for the empiric treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) as recommended by the 2005 guidelines of the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Methods

In a 5000-patient Monte Carlo simulation, pharmacodynamic analyses were performed for standard doses of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, ertapenem, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Prolonged 3-hour infusion regimens were also evaluated for anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams. MIC data were incorporated from the 2007 Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection, a national surveillance study. The weighted cumulative fraction of response (wCFR) against common pneumonia pathogens was determined for each regimen. A second scenario was conducted by altering the pathogen prevalence to assess wCFR for late-onset pneumonia (ie, HAP in patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation). Optimal wCFR was defined a priori as ≥ 90%.

Results

Among the 0.5-hour infusions, cefepime, ceftazidime, and meropenem had the highest wCFRs (≥ 90%) against pathogens that cause HAP (cefepime, 1 g q8h, 92.8%; 2 g q8h, 97.2%; 2 g q12h, 94.3%; ceftazidime, 2 g q8h, 93.2%; meropenem, 1 g q8h, 90.9%; 2 g q8h, 93.9%). Imipenem (500 mg q6h, 85.5%; 1 g q8h, 88.1%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (4.5 g q6h, 80.5%) as 0.5-hour infusions were nearly optimal, whereas ceftriaxone, ertapenem, and the fluoroquinolones had the lowest wCFR values. All regimens showed lower wCFRs for late-onset pneumonia than for HAP. Optimal wCFRs were found only with prolonged (3-hour) infusions of 2 g q8h for ceftazidime (94.5%) and meropenem (90.1%), whereas cefepime 2 g q8h achieved optimal wCFR with both a 0.5-hour infusion (93.1%) and a 3-hour infusion (95.3%).

Conclusions

Results of this model suggest that standard doses of most antipseudomonal beta-lactams (cefepime, ceftazidime, and meropenem) had high probabilities of achieving optimal pharmacodynamic exposure as empiric therapy for HAP, whereas the low probabilities predicted from ceftriaxone, ertapenem, and the fluoroquinolones suggest that these agents would be inappropriate as monotherapy. For late-onset HAP, prolonged infusions of cefepime, ceftazidime, and meropenem offered the highest probabilities of achieving bactericidal exposure.

Studies evaluating the outcomes of an extended-infusion (EI) piperacillin-tazobactam dosing strategy in specific cohorts of critically ill patients are lacking. A retrospective, pre-implementation and post-implementation study of 148 critically ill patients was conducted to compare EI and traditional infusion piperacillin-tazobactam. In this retrospective study, the EI piperacillin-tazobactam dosing strategy was associated with improved 30-day mortality. EI piperacillin-tazobactam may be an effective alternative to TI of piperacillin-tazobactam among critically ill patients treated for suspected gram-negative infections.

β-Lactams

A study that evaluated critically ill patients (49 obese and 59 nonobese patients; 49% with lung infection) who had received broad-spectrum β-lactams (cefepime, piperacillin and tazobactam, or meropenem) at standard dosing regimens found considerable variability in β-lactam serum concentrations (coefficient of variation of 50–92% for all drugs) in obese and nonobese patients. The standard dosing regimens resulted in insufficient plasma concentrations in 32% of patients and overdosed concentrations in 25%. For meropenem, more obese patients had concentrations that did not reach therapeutic targets than nonobese patients (35 versus 0%; P = 0.02), but no differences were observed for cefepime and piperacillin and tazobactam. In the same study, patients on continuous renal replacement therapy were more likely to have supertherapeutic β-lactam serum concentrations and less likely to have insufficient β-lactam serum concentrations.

### Clinical outcomes with extended or continuous versus short-term intravenous infusion of carbapenems and piperacillin / tazobactam: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117RFnyk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

We sought to study whether the better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam, when the duration of infusion is longer, were associated with lower mortality. PubMed and Scopus were searched for studies reporting on patients treated with extended (≥ 3 hours) or continuous (24 hours) versus short-term duration (20–60 minutes) infusions of carbapenems or piperacillin/tazobactam. Fourteen studies were included (1229 patients). Mortality was lower among patients receiving extended or continuous infusion of carbapenems or piperacillin/tazobactam compared to those receiving short-term (risk ratio [RR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval, .41-.83). Patients with pneumonia who received extended or continuous infusion had lower mortality than those receiving short-term infusion (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26–0.96). Data for other specific infections were not available. The available evidence from mainly nonrandomized studies suggests that extended or continuous infusion of carbapenems or piperacillin/tazobactam was associated with lower mortality. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings before such approaches become widely used.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — S. aureus coverage and MRSA/MSSA selection is as follows: For patients being treated empirically for HAP, we recommend prescribing an antibiotic with activity against S. aureus (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have either a risk factor for MRSA infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known, or who are at high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MRSA (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. For patients with HAP who require empiric coverage for MRSA, we recommend vancomycin or linezolid rather than an alternative antibiotic (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MSSA, and when empiric treatment that includes coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem.

Piperacillin/tazobactam dosing nomogram for a unbound average concentration target of ≥ 16mg/L (global 100% fT > MIC and 4 × MIC for Enterobacterales) and a higher target of ≥ 32–64 mg/L (empirical treatment and 4 × MIC for P. aeruginosa), considering a toxicity threshold of 160 mg/L and stratified by RRT modality, intensity, and urine output

RRT renal replacement therapy, SLED sustained low-efficiency dialysis, CI continuous infusion

a Based on simulations data, the higher recommended dose will increase the likelihood of attaining the steady-state concentration of ≥ 64 mg/L but can also increment the risk of surpassing the toxicity threshold chosen for piperacillin (> 160 mg/L)

### Therapeutic drug monitoring-based dose optimisation of piperacillin and meropenem: a randomised controlled trial [^1148ZSq2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

There is variability in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antibiotics (AB) in critically ill patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) could overcome this variability and increase PK target attainment. The objective of this study was to analyse the effect of a dose-adaption strategy based on daily TDM on target attainment.

Methods

This was a prospective, partially blinded, and randomised controlled trial in patients with normal kidney function treated with meropenem (MEM) or piperacillin/tazobactam (PTZ). The intervention group underwent daily TDM, with dose adjustment when necessary. The predefined PK/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target was 100% fT > 4MIC [percentage of time during a dosing interval that the free (f) drug concentration exceeded 4 times the MIC]. The control group received conventional treatment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients that reached 100% fT > 4MIC and 100% fT > MIC at 72 h.

Results

Forty-one patients (median age 56 years) were included in the study. Pneumonia was the primary infectious diagnosis. At baseline, 100% fT > 4MIC was achieved in 21% of the PTZ patients and in none of the MEM patients; 100% fT > MIC was achieved in 71% of the PTZ patients and 46% of the MEM patients. Of the patients in the intervention group, 76% needed dose adaptation, and five required an additional increase. At 72 h, target attainment rates for 100% fT > 4MIC and 100% fT > MIC were higher in the intervention group: 58 vs. 16%, p = 0.007 and 95 vs. 68%, p = 0.045, respectively.

Conclusions

Among critically ill patients with normal kidney function, a strategy of dose adaptation based on daily TDM led to an increase in PK/PD target attainment compared to conventional dosing.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^113u4pih]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) versus methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) coverage is guided by on-admission risk factors and mortality risk. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have either a risk factor for MRSA infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known), or who are at high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MRSA (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. For patients with HAP who require empiric coverage for MRSA, we recommend vancomycin or linezolid rather than an alternative antibiotic (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MSSA; when empiric coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem, and oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred for the treatment of proven MSSA, but are not necessary for empiric coverage of HAP if one of the above agents is used (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). The 20% threshold for deciding whether or not to target MRSA or MSSA was chosen in an effort to balance the need for effective initial antibiotic therapy against the risks of excessive antibiotic use; when implementing these recommendations, individual units may elect to modify this threshold.

Acinetobacter species HAP/VAP — evidence summary indicates study counts and key comparative findings: "Our systematic review identified 6 randomized trials [155, 259, 331–334] and 6 observational studies [256, 257, 261, 335–337]" assessing antibiotic choices, with comparisons where "piperacillin-tazobactam was compared with imipenem [335], intravenous colistin [332], or high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam [333], or when imipenem was compared to intravenous colistin [337]". A trial found "tigecycline decreased clinical cure rates compared with imipenem", and an observational study showed "tigecycline-based therapy was associated with higher mortality than colistin-based therapy, although the latter was associated with more nephrotoxicity". Evidence also notes that "Evidence on polymyxin B for the treatment of HAP/VAP is growing, but also limited by low-quality evidence", and adjunctive data where "the combination of aerosolized colistin plus intravenous colistin was associated with a higher clinical response than intravenous colistin alone, although no significant difference in mortality was observed".

### Research agenda for antibiotic stewardship within the veterans' health administration, 2024–2028 [^114oKkZ8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute-care settings

The acute-care setting was an early target of VA antibiotic stewardship activities, and studies of several inpatient stewardship interventions have demonstrated tangible improvements in the selection, spectrum, duration, and proper dosing of antibiotic therapy.- Meta-analyses and systemic reviews, including one from the VA Evidence Synthesis Program (ESP), have demonstrated that inpatient stewardship activities can safely improve antibiotic-prescribing and reduce antibiotic resistance. - However, limited evidence is available to inform the staffing and information technology resources essential for the success of hospital-based antibiotic stewardship programs, including how these resources should vary by facility size and complexity. Contributing to this knowledge gap is a lack of detail on resources needed to implement successful interventions that have been described in the literature. Future implementation studies should quantify not only outcomes but also resources needed for implementation in an objective manner, including time, expertise and informatic resources [Question 10].

In hospitals that lack on-site infectious disease (ID) physicians and ID pharmacists, telehealth is a promising tool for stewardship, and the VA has specific expertise in how to use telehealth for this purpose. Strategies to advance the implementation and sustainment of telehealth-supported stewardship activities in resource-limited, acute-care settings are needed [Question 9].

Future studies, preferably randomized-controlled clinical trials, could further inform several targets for acute-care stewardship activities. First, while oral antibiotic therapy is gaining greater acceptance for infections traditionally treated with parenteral therapy (eg, osteomyelitis), there is room to better define the optimal selection and dosing of oral agents [Question 3]. Second, more data on the comparative safety profiles of commonly prescribed antibiotic regimens would be valuable. A recent pragmatic trial comparing cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam may serve as a viable model for future investigations. The VA Cooperative Studies Program research infrastructure and clinical trials networks have demonstrated success in the conduct of point-of-care and pragmatic clinical trials. - Thus, the VA is an ideal setting for pursuing similar pragmatic trials designed to compare different standard-of-care antibiotic options. Third, large clinical trials could help identify specific situations where it is safe to decrease the length of recommended antibiotic therapy for common uncomplicated infections [Question 4]. For example, in cases of pneumonia, tools such as multiple polymerase chain reaction panels could improve identification of viral pneumonia and, in turn, identify patients in whom early discontinuation or avoidance of antibiotics is feasible.

### Empiric antibiotic regimens in adults with non-ventilator-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116N5oUE]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal empiric antibiotic regimen for non-ventilator-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is uncertain.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of alternative empiric antibiotic regimens in HAP using a network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL from database inception to July 06, 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

RCTs.

Participants

Adults with clinical suspicion of HAP.

Interventions

Any empiric antibiotic regimen vs. another, placebo, or no treatment.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Paired reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using a modified Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Paired reviewers independently extracted data on trial and patient characteristics, antibiotic regimens, and outcomes of interest. We conducted frequentist random-effects network meta-analyses for treatment failure and all-cause mortality and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

Thirty-nine RCTs proved eligible. Thirty RCTs involving 4807 participants found low certainty evidence that piperacillin-tazobactam (RR compared to all cephalosporins: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.42, 1.01) and carbapenems (RR compared to all cephalosporins: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.11) might be among the most effective in reducing treatment failure. The findings were robust to the secondary analysis comparing piperacillin-tazobactam vs. antipseudomonal cephalosporins or antipseudomonal carbapenems vs. antipseudomonal cephalosporins. Eleven RCTs involving 2531 participants found low certainty evidence that ceftazidime and linezolid combination may not be convincingly different from cephalosporin alone in reducing all-cause mortality. Evidence on other antibiotic regimens is very uncertain. Data on other patient-important outcomes including adverse events was sparse, and we did not perform network or pairwise meta-analysis.

Conclusions

For empiric antibiotic therapy of adults with HAP, piperacillin-tazobactam might be among the most effective in reducing treatment failure. Empiric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus coverage may not exert additional benefit in reducing mortality.

Registration

### Effect of therapeutic drug monitoring-based dose optimization of piperacillin / tazobactam on sepsis-related organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis: a randomized controlled trial [^112Xumfv]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, no dosage algorithm or dosing software was used to support consistent dosing adjustments in patients with TDM-guided therapy. With such tools, there might have been further optimization for target attainment. Second, the caregivers were not blinded to the study groups, which in turn might have influenced the treatment of patients in the control group, e.g. escalation of antibiotic therapy more often. However, we did not observe a significant difference in the duration of therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam in either study group; therefore, this might constitute a rather small bias. Third, as the methodology can vary according to the laboratory, as well as because of biological variability, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of MIC values, which can range between 1 and 2 dilutions. Fourth, only serum piperacillin concentrations were obtained, and these concentrations do not always reflect concentrations at the site of infection. Furthermore, the study was performed in a single country with a low prevalence of resistant gram-negative bacteria, which limits the generalizability of our results. Finally, antibiotic combination therapy was allowed at any time, which might have biased the study results. However, excluding patients with concomitant fluoroquinolone therapy did not show any difference in outcome between patients with TDM and fixed doses (data not shown).

Empiric antibiotic coverage for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) — In patients with suspected VAP, we recommend including coverage for S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacilli in all empiric regimens (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest including an agent active against MRSA only when there is a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance, when units have > 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates methicillin resistant, or when MRSA prevalence is not known (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). We suggest including an agent active against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and not MRSA when patients lack risk factors for antimicrobial resistance and are treated in ICUs where < 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). If empiric coverage for MRSA is indicated, we recommend either vancomycin or linezolid (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). When empiric treatment should include MSSA coverage, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), noting that oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred for proven MSSA but are not necessary for empiric VAP if one of the above agents is used.

### Pulmonary penetration of piperacillin and tazobactam in critically ill patients [^113C7WkV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary infections in critically ill patients are common and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Piperacillin-tazobactam is a frequently used therapy in critically ill patients with pulmonary infection. Antibiotic concentrations in the lung reflect target-site antibiotic concentrations in patients with pneumonia. The aim of this study was to assess the plasma and intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of piperacillin-tazobactam in critically ill patients administered standard piperacillin-tazobactam regimens. A population PK model was developed to describe plasma and intrapulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentrations. The probability of piperacillin exposures reaching pharmacodynamic end points and the impact of pulmonary permeability on piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration was explored. The median piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration ratios were 49.3 and 121.2%, respectively. Pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentrations were unpredictable and negatively correlated with pulmonary permeability. Current piperacillin-tazobactam regimens may be insufficient to treat pneumonia caused by piperacillin-tazobactam-susceptible organisms in some critically ill patients.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113snNGb]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Zander et al. have recently conducted a prospective observational study to describe the variability of piperacillin (PIP) concentrations and target attainment in a heterogeneous cohort of 60 critically ill patients. An intermittent bolus dosing regimen of piperacillin-tazobactam (PIP-TAZ) was used 4.5 g three times daily (TID) or twice daily (BID), depending on renal function.

As PIP-TAZ is largely renally excreted, it was unsurprising that the investigators found that no patient within the highest quartile of creatinine clearance (CrCl) attained specified pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets (trough concentrations ≥ 22.5 mg/L) on days 1 or 4. These results are consistent with previous data showing that 'augmented renal clearance' (ARC), defined as a CrCl ≥ 130 mL/min, is frequently being associated with subtherapeutic PIP concentrations, even when dosing PIP-TAZ four times daily (QID). Of more interest, however, was that the investigators found that 0% and 55% of patients with a CrCl > 65 mL/min and 30–65 mL/min, respectively, attained the target PIP trough concentrations. This is a very important finding as it highlights that initiating TID PIP-TAZ dosing as a blanket strategy in critically ill patients with 'normal' renal function or even mild to moderate renal impairment will not reliably attain PK/PD targets. In line with these findings, and perhaps reflective of the ongoing challenges with dose optimization in this group of patients, previous work has shown QID dosing of PIP-TAZ to be insufficient in achieving free PIP concentrations that are four times the target minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 50% of the dosing interval (50% f T > 4xMIC), even in patients not displaying ARC. Solutions for target non-attainment of PIP-TAZ in intensive care unit (ICU) patients include use of prolonged infusions and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).

Piperacillin-tazobactam for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: Piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of invasive infections caused by Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant inducible AmpC production. Tazobactam is less effective at protecting β-lactams from AmpC hydrolysis than newer β-lactamase inhibitors such as avibactam, relebactam, and vaborbactam, and the role of piperacillin-tazobactam in treating Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production remains uncertain. A 2019 meta-analysis of observational studies did not identify a difference in mortality between patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for bacteremia caused by Enterobacter spp. Citrobacter spp., or Serratia spp., though significant heterogeneity and confounding by indication likely existed. A pilot unblinded clinical trial randomized 72 patients with bloodstream infections to piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 grams IV every 6 hours as a standard infusion) or meropenem (1 gram IV every 8 hours as a standard infusion) and found no significant differences in the primary composite outcome, with notable and seemingly conflicting findings among individual components.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of ZOSYN for intra-abdominal infections, and nosocomial pneumonia have been established in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older.

Use of ZOSYN in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections including appendicitis and/or peritonitis is supported by evidence from well-controlled studies and pharmacokinetic studies in adults and in pediatric patients. This includes a prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label clinical trial with 542 pediatric patients 2 to 12 years of age with intra-abdominal infections (including appendicitis and/or peritonitis), in which 273 pediatric patients received piperacillin and tazobactam [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Use of ZOSYN in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older with nosocomial pneumonia is supported by evidence from well-controlled studies in adults with nosocomial pneumonia, a simulation study performed with a population pharmacokinetic model, and a retrospective, cohort study of pediatric patients with nosocomial pneumonia in which 140 pediatric patients were treated with ZOSYN and 267 patients treated with comparators (which included ticarcillin‑clavulanate, carbapenems, ceftazidime, cefepime, or ciprofloxacin) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Because of the limitations of the available strengths and administration requirements (i.e., administration of fractional doses is not recommended) of ZOSYN Injection supplied in GALAXY Containers, and to avoid unintentional overdose, this product is not recommended for use if a dose of ZOSYN Injection in GALAXY Containers that does not equal 2.25 g, 3.375 g, or 4.5 g is required and an alternative formulation of ZOSYN should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5, and 2.6)].

The safety and effectiveness of ZOSYN have not been established in pediatric patients less than 2 months of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) and Dosage and Administration (2)].

Dosage of ZOSYN in pediatric patients with renal impairment has not been determined.

### Increased β-lactams dosing regimens improve clinical outcome in critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance treated for a first episode of hospital or ventilator-acquired pneumonia: a before and after study [^117V8mMH]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

A prompt recognition of ARC is thus of paramount importance for optimizing empirical antibiotic dosing regimens. However, commonly used formulas frequently misclassify ARC and may underestimate the risk of β-lactam underdosing. Although several screening tools have shown adequate predictive abilities for identifying patients with ARC, 24-h measured CL CR must remain the reference and should be monitored daily in at-risk patients. On the other hand, dose adaptations solely based on CL CR are probably not sufficient to achieve target therapeutic concentrations. The relationship between CL CR and drug concentrations is probably far more complex and dose-adaptions are probably best guided by a validated Population PK model and not by CL CR alone. Moreover, a special attention should be granted to detect dose-dependent neurotoxicity, especially when using higher than licensed doses of β-lactams. Intra-patient variability of CL CR and drug concentrations over time must require subsequent dose adjustment guided by CL CR values, pathogen susceptibility, and therapeutic drug monitoring. However, the safety of increased dosing regimens in ARC patients has been reported in previous studies, all the reported concentrations being significantly under the supposed toxic cutoff. Currently, therapeutic drug monitoring is required to adjust daily regimens in critically ill patients.

Several limitations should be considered. First, the main limitation relied on the retrospective before–after design that could lead to selection and interpretation bias. Even if there were no known significant changes to our local procedures, our results may be driven by the preferential use of increased dosing regimens of piperacillin-tazobactam. However, the propensity score matching allowed reducing the effects of confounding covariates directly influencing the choice of probabilistic or documented antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, we aimed to focus on HAP-VAP as they meet widely used criteria for diagnostic and management, where therapeutic failure is not related to inadequate surgical source control. Second, the rate of antibiotic side effects is very limited, although probably related to an underreporting in the medical records. Finally, the study design did not allow adequate MIC determination and therapeutic drug monitoring. Only pharmacological dosing could confirm the association between higher rates of PK/PD target attainment and lower rates of therapeutic failure in critically ARC patients treated by increased β-lactam dosing regimens.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Patients over 65 years are not at an increased risk of developing adverse effects solely because of age. However, dosage should be adjusted in the presence of renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection contains 54 mg (2.35 mEq) of sodium per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. At the usual recommended doses, patients would receive between 648 and 864 mg/day (28.2 and 37.6 mEq) of sodium. The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading. This may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal Impairment

In patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be reduced to the degree of renal function impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Dosage adjustment of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection is not warranted in patients with hepatic cirrhosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Patients with Cystic Fibrosis

As with other semisynthetic penicillins, piperacillin therapy has been associated with an increased incidence of fever and rash in cystic fibrosis patients.

### International conference for the development of consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^114z8it3]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important health problem that still generates great controversy. A consensus conference attended by 12 researchers from Europe and Latin America was held to discuss strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of VAP. Commonly asked questions concerning VAP management were selected for discussion by the participating researchers. Possible answers to the questions were presented to the researchers, who then recorded their preferences anonymously. This was followed by open discussion when the results were known. In general, peers thought that early microbiological examinations are warranted and contribute to improving the use of antibiotherapy. Nevertheless, no consensus was reached regarding choices of antimicrobial agents or the optimal duration of therapy. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the preferred choice for empiric therapy, followed by a cephalosporin with antipseudomonal activity and a carbapenem. All the peers agreed that the pathogens causing VAP and multiresistance patterns in their ICUs were substantially different from those reported in studies in the United States. Pathogens and multiresistance patterns also varied from researcher to researcher inside the group. Consensus was reached on the importance of local epidemiology surveillance programs and on the need for customized empiric antimicrobial choices to respond to local patterns of pathogens and susceptibilities.

### Clinical approach to the patient with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia [^1162xQTP]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Management of ventilator-associated pneumonia needs to balance the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic overuse with the provision of adequate initial empiric therapy. A clinical diagnosis based on new pulmonary opacity and purulent respiratory secretions plus other signs of inflammation is valuable in screening for patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. A rational strategy starts with immediate initiation of adequate antibiotics and collection of respiratory secretions to evaluate the causative organism. As a minimum, an endotracheal aspirate with direct staining and quantitative cultures should be obtained. Overall, the need to choose adequate antibiotics correctly and expeditiously calls for the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the choice should be narrowed quickly in the light of microbiologic information. However, some patients (those who develop an infection within 5 days of hospitalization, those without recent antibiotic exposure, and those without hospitalization in the past 3 months) are at low risk of infection by resistant organisms. In that subset, adequate initial selection could be a non-pseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin, since antibiotics should target usual community-acquired organisms in addition to some Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. Coverage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus should be limited only to intensive care units with concomitant index cases and to patients under antibiotic exposure. Patients at risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (e.g., 1 week of prior hospitalization or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) require initial use of a combination of piperacilin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin, or amikacin plus imipenem, meropenem, or an antipseudomonal cephalosporin. If risk of Acinetobacter baumannii exists, one of these agents should be a carbapenem. After 48 hours of therapy, each patient should be re-evaluated based mainly on resolution of hypoxemia and fever plus the initial microbiologic information. Whereas broad-spectrum therapy is initially warranted in many patients, this treatment may be narrowed considerably as culture results identify the causative organism and its sensitivity. Recent data suggest that reducing overall treatment duration to a maximum of 1 week is safe, effective and is less likely to promote the growth of resistant organisms in patients who are clinically improving. Optimal management should be based on a strategy combining early high doses of an effective agent for a short period of time, which is then simplified in the light of microbiologic information.

### Comparative pharmacodynamics of intermittent and prolonged infusions of piperacillin / tazobactam using monte carlo simulations and steady-state pharmacokinetic data from hospitalized patients [^1129LWjA]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonging the infusion of a beta-lactam antibiotic enhances the time in which unbound drug concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (fT > MIC).

Objective

To compare the pharmacodynamics of several dosing regimens of piperacillin/tazobactam administered by intermittent and prolonged infusion using pharmacokinetic data from hospitalized patients.

Methods

Steady-state pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 13 patients who received piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 8 hours, infused over 4 hours. Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 pts.) were performed to calculate pharmacodynamic exposures at 50% fT > MIC for 4 intermittent-infusion regimens (3.375 g every 4 and 6 h, 4.5 g every 6 and 8 h) and 4 prolonged-infusion regimens (2.25 g, 3.375 g, 4.5 g, and 6.75 g every 8 h [4-h infusion]) of piperacillin/tazobactam using pharmacokinetic data for piperacillin. Cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was calculated using MIC data for 6 gram-negative pathogens (Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection, 2004–2007), and probability of target attainment (PTA) was calculated at MICs ranging from 1 microg/mL to 64 microg/mL.

Results

The CFR for 3.375 g every 4 hours (intermittent infusion) and 3.375–4.5 g every 8 hours (prolonged infusion) greater than or equal to 90.3% for Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Citrobacter spp. Increasing the prolonged-infusion dose to 6.75 g improved the CFR to greater than 90% for Enterobacter spp. For every regimen evaluated, the CFR was less than 90% for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At an MIC of 16 microg/mL, PTA was greater than 90% for one intermittent-infusion regimen (3.375 g every 4 h) and 3 prolonged-infusion regimens (≥ 3.375 g every 8 h), but no regimen achieved a PTA greater than 90% at an MIC of 64 microg/mL.

Conclusions

At doses greater than or equal to 3.375 g every 8 hours, 4-hour infusions of piperacillin/tazobactam achieved excellent target attainment with lower daily doses compared with standard regimens at MICs less than or equal to 16 microg/mL.

Piperacillin/tazobactam

Piperacillin/tazobactam was most often administered as an extended infusion (EI) (42%) followed by II (36%) and CI (14%) (see Fig. 1). The use of prolonged infusions was comparable between academic and general hospitals (see Additional file 1: Table S6). A LD was preferred by respondents administering an EI (62%) or CI (84%). Regardless of infusion duration, the median LD and MD per 24 h was 4.5 g and 18.5 g, respectively. TDM was performed by 43% of respondents (see Fig. 1) with most measuring a trough concentration at steady state. TDM was performed most often in Sub-Saharan Africa (71%), and Europe and Central Asia (60%), with only 7% usage in North America (see Additional file 1: Table S5). Respondents from academic hospitals were more likely to perform TDM than those from general hospitals (50% vs. 34%, p = 0.001), (see Additional file 1: Table S6). The most common PK/PD target was 100% time where the unbound concentration remained above the MIC as a percentage of the dosing interval (100% f T > MIC) (36%), followed by 100% f T > 4xMIC (23%). When assessing EI and CI only, the most common PK/PD target remained 100% f T > MIC.

† 50% fT > MIC or 50% fT > MICx4 denotes at least 50% of time during each day of one week of antibiotic therapy that the free plasma piperacillin concentration was greater than the target minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or four time of the target MIC of 16 mg/L (susceptibility breakpoint MIC for P. aeruginosa)

£ This indicates the percentage of 5000 simulated patients that were at or above the suggested piperacillin safety threshold (i.e. free plasma concentration ≥ 157 mg/L) at the end of each day during 1 week of therapy

€ EARLY PIKRT is where the initial piperacillin/tazobactam dose is infused at the beginning of 9-hour PIKRT and late PIKRT where the initial piperacillin/tazobactam dose is given 15 h prior to 9-hour PIKRT

Interestingly, a 4-hour extended infusion strategy, commonly utilized in clinical practice, did not appreciably enhance PTA compared to 0.5-hour intermittent infusion, and did not alter the selection of optimal cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam doses in our analyses (supplementary materials)

Discussion

We present the results of the largest prospective multi-centre study of meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam PK in critically ill patients with AKI receiving the most prescribed RRT modalities in the ICU. Our main findings are that meropenem, piperacillin, and tazobactam PK are highly variable and dependent on RRT intensity, urine output, and, in the case of SLED, duration of therapy, with the same factors determining dosing requirements for optimised concentrations. In most clinical scenarios, extended/continuous infusions provided a better attainment of optimal antibiotic trough/average steady-state unbound concentrations (100% fT > MIC) compared to the equivalent doses administered as a short 30-min infusion; continuous infusion appeared particularly advantageous when higher concentrations are required (4 × MIC for P. aeruginosa or for empirical treatment), especially for those patients with clinical characteristics associated with higher drug CL. Our dosing nomograms provide dosing recommendations that maximise the attainment of effective meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam concentrations (either standard or higher target as required) and also minimise the risk of toxic concentrations.

Optimising beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients receiving RRT is a major challenge in daily practise. The diversity in RRT modalities, techniques, and settings may have a major effect on the PK of water-soluble drugs like beta-lactams, leading to different antibiotic requirements depending on each infection, patient, and RRT treatment. However, existing dosing recommendations are still generic and not robust. Multiple well-designed PK studies have tried to address this clinical question for meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam, but patient heterogeneity and small sample sizes in single-centre settings have provided insufficient data to generate optimised dosing recommendations. In this context, the large sample size of our multi-centre study has identified RRT intensity and duration and urine output as the primary factors influencing drug CL, allowing our dosing nomogram to be highly accurate across a wide range of scenarios.

Intervention

Experimental therapy arm

After randomization, a continuous infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam, corresponding to a total daily dose of 13.5 g [9 g in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 20 mL/min], was started immediately after administration of a loading dose of 4.5 g piperacillin/tazobactam. Beginning on day 1 after randomization (optional on day 0, if steady state of piperacillin concentration was already reached), dosing of piperacillin/tazobactam was guided by daily TDM of piperacillin. The target plasma concentration of free piperacillin was defined as four times (range ± 20%) the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen causative of sepsis. For empiric therapy, the epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) published by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 mg/L) was used (eTable 2a electronic supplementary material). This cutoff value represents a worst-case scenario for empirical dosing. Piperacillin doses not in target were adjusted linearly with taking account for other clinical parameters, e.g. recovering renal function. The maximum duration of the intervention was 10 days.

Control arm

After randomization continuous infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam was administered precisely as in the intervention group but without use of TDM. During piperacillin/tazobactam therapy, daily dose adjustments were performed according to current renal function, assessed by eGFR, according to the recommendations of the Summary of Product Characteristics or use of renal replacement therapy (eTable 2b electronic supplementary material).

Sample analysis

Blood samples for measurement of piperacillin concentration were obtained daily in both study groups. Analysis, reporting of the results and adjustments of doses were performed on the same day only in the TDM group. In the control group, analysis was performed on the same day or later with samples stored at − 80 °C until analysis. On-site measurements of the total piperacillin concentration were performed in study centers with either high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) following the guidelines of the Bioanalytical Method Validation of the European Medicines Agency. An external interlaboratory proficiency testing program was performed regularly with participating laboratories.

Specific Populations

Renal Impairment

After the administration of single doses of piperacillin and tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for piperacillin and tazobactam for injection are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. See Dosage and Administration (2) for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal‑impairment.

Hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of a piperacillin and tazobactam dose with an additional 5% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. Peritoneal dialysis removes approximately 6% and 21% of the piperacillin and tazobactam doses, respectively, with up to 16% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. For dosage recommendations for patients undergoing hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Hepatic Impairment

The half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases by approximately 25% and 18%, respectively, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis compared to healthy subjects. However, this difference does not warrant dosage adjustment of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection due to hepatic cirrhosis.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we did not observe a significant benefit for TDM-guided therapy in patients with sepsis and continuous infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam with regard to the primary endpoint, namely, the mean total SOFA score. Studies with a higher number of patients are necessary to confirm the observed benefit in 28-day mortality, as well as clinical and microbiological cures, for which the current study was not powered. In addition, further studies are necessary to identify patients who might benefit most from TDM-guided therapy with β-lactam antibiotics, such as patients with an augmented renal clearance or patients with bacterial infections that demonstrate higher MICs.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia additional directives and caveats from Table 4 are as follows: If MRSA coverage is not going to be used, include coverage for MSSA. Options include: Piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem. Oxacillin, nafcillin, and cefazolin are preferred for the treatment of proven MSSA, but would ordinarily not be used in an empiric regimen for HAP. If patient has severe penicillin allergy and aztreonam is going to be used instead of any β-lactam–based antibiotic, include coverage for MSSA. If patient has factors increasing the likelihood of gram-negative infection, 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended, and if patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended. In the absence of other options, it is acceptable to use aztreonam as an adjunctive agent with another β-lactam–based agent because it has different targets within the bacterial cell wall.

### Meropenem and piperacillin / tazobactam optimised dosing regimens for critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy [^112N69gZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our simulations consistently show that meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam dosing requirements are strongly dependent on RRT intensity, urine output, and, in the case of SLED, RRT duration. For all the scenarios, extended/continuous infusions (after a full initial loading dose if therapy with meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam is being initiated) are more likely to achieve effective unbound concentrations for empirically treating Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa compared to equivalents dose given as a short 30-min infusion. This is especially important for patients with higher CL, i.e. those receiving RRT with higher intensities, longer SLED sessions, and/or with urine outputs ≥ 100–500 mL/24 h. Where higher unbound concentrations are targeted (4 × MIC), continuous infusion provides the highest likelihood of effective and safe dosing. Conversely, for treating bacteria with lower MICs, short 30-min infusions had similar target attainment to extended/continuous infusions.

Tables 2 and 3 provide the dosing nomograms for meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam for standard and high targets stratified by modality, intensity, and urine output. The recommended doses are the ones that optimise effective concentrations and minimise the risk of toxic concentrations. Figure 1 schematises the dosing decision-making algorithm.

Antibiotic therapy, follow-up, and outcomes assessment

Initial empirical antibiotic therapy was administered in the emergency department in accordance with participating hospitals' guidelines, which recommend the administration of a β-lactam agent with or without a macrolide or fluoroquinolone. Initial empirical combination antimicrobial therapy was recommended for patients with severe CAP and/or those without any positive microbiological test. Levofloxacin monotherapy was indicated for Legionella pneumonia and for selected patients such as those with β-lactam allergy. Carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam and cefipime were considered broad-spectrum antibiotics. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics were generally considered when penicillin or ceftriaxone was used. All decisions regarding empirical and definitive antibiotic therapy, de-escalation, switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy, and duration of treatment were made by the attending clinicians. The investigators were not involved in any decisions regarding antibiotic treatment.

All participants were seen daily during their hospital stay by their attending physicians and by at least one of the study investigators. The investigators recorded all outcome measures. DOTs were calculated as the days elapsed from the initial dose of antimicrobial until the last dose of antimicrobial therapy for the CAP episode. The DOT for a given patient on multiple antibiotics was the sum of DOT for each antibiotic that the patient received. All antibiotics administered to patients for an episode of CAP and its related complications were included in the primary endpoint calculation. A new treatment for CAP was considered if there was an interruption in antibiotic therapy lasting more than 48 h. Antimicrobial de-escalation was considered when a broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment regimen was replaced with narrower-spectrum antimicrobials or when one or more initial combination empiric antimicrobials were discontinued. Participants attended an outpatient visit 30 days after hospital discharge. The investigators recorded readmissions for any reason or death from any cause in the 30 days after randomisation. The information was obtained from specific searches of hospital databases and was checked by asking patients at the outpatient visit 30 days after hospital discharge. For patients who did not attend this outpatient visit, a structured telephone interview was used to assess outcomes. Adverse events were recorded in all patients who received at least one dose of antibiotic therapy. All adverse events were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The study was monitored by the IDIBELL Clinical Research and Clinical Trials Unit. All data were recorded on a secure web application for building and managing databases (REDCap). The study endpoints were assessed by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which was blinded to study group and patient identity.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in anuric acute kidney injury patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^111Zod8V]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To determine appropriate dosing of piperacillin-tazobactam in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Methods

The databases of PubMed, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched. We used the Medical Subject Headings of "piperacillin-tazobactam", "CRRT", and "pharmacokinetics" or related terms or synonym to identify the studies for reviews. A one-compartment pharmacokinetic model was conducted to predict piperacillin levels for the initial 48h of therapy. The pharmacodynamic target was 50% of free drug level above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and 4 times of the MIC. The dose that achieved at least 90% of the probability of target attainment was defined as an optimal dose.

Results

Our simulation study reveals that the dosing regimen of piperacillin-tazobactam 12g/day is appropriate for treating Pseudomonal infection with KDIGO recommended effluent rate of 25–35mL/kg/h. The MIC values of each setting were an important factor to design piperacillin-tazobactam dosing regimens.

Conclusion

The Monte Carlo simulation can be a useful tool to evaluate drug dosing in critically ill acute kidney injury patients receiving CRRT when limited pharmacokinetic data are a concern. Clinical validation of these results is needed.

### A survey on infection management practices in Italian ICUs [^113CCijU]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

In most units (132/148–89%), daily doses of piperacillin-tazobactam ranged from 13.5 to 18 g, and more than half the units (59%) infused the drugs over an interval longer than 3 to 4 hours. Compared with intravenous bolus delivery, extended infusion of this drug combination was recently shown to reduce mortality and shorten hospital stays in ICU patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Around 60% of the reporting units gave meropenem as a continuous or extended infusion. In critically ill patients at high risk for infections caused by resistant strains of gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter), these approaches are more likely to achieve the optimal pharmacodynamic (PD) target.

Several studies have emphasized the value of area under the curve (AUC)/MIC ratios for predicting the efficacy of glycopeptide-based regimens. The most commonly used daily doses of teicoplanin were 6 mg/kg and 12 mg/kg (corresponding to total daily doses of 400 and 800 mg, respectively) and almost all units (96%) administered a loading dose of this drug, which is important in ICU patients to ensure rapid achievement of therapeutically effective concentrations. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is strongly recommended during vancomycin therapy to optimize drug exposure and prevent toxicity. Two-thirds of the ICUs monitored blood levels of vancomycin, which was usually administered as a continuous infusion (86%) (Table 3). However, three-quarters of the units used standard daily dosages (2 grams) that are probably too low for critically ill patients. A recent PK/PD analysis of data for 191 ICU patients found that with standard vancomycin dosages the recommended AUC 0 to 24/MIC breakpoint for S. aureus is rarely achieved unless the patient has renal failure or is over 65 years of age. Otherwise, the daily dose needs to exceed 3 grams. This study also emphasized the need to consider agents other than vancomycin when methicillin-resistant or glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus strains are involved.

Subgroup analysis

Examining effects by types of antibiotics (Figure 6), only studies involving piperacillin/tazobactam (or piperacillin alone) clearly demonstrated a survival advantage for the intervention group (five studies, n = 683; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.85; P = 0.003; I² = 0%), although only one of five studies in this subgroup was an RCT. Studies involving carbapenems almost demonstrated a survival advantage for the intervention group (four trials; n = 388; RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.00; P = 0.051; I² = 0%), with two of four studies being RCTs. With respect to type of intervention, extended infusions, all of which were cohort studies, improved survival (eight studies; n = 1,580; RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96; P = 0.03; I² = 42%). Improved survival in the studies using continuous infusions did not achieve statistical significance (nine RCTs and two cohort studies, n = 874; RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.25; P = 0.84; I² = 0) (Figure 7).

Focusing more specifically on P. aeruginosa, several studies reported concordant trends suggesting that prolonged or continuous beta-lactam administration may be beneficial for the treatment of P. aeruginosa- related infections in ICU patients. Indeed, in Fan et al. study 14-day mortality for the subgroup of patients infected with P. aeruginosa was 10% for prolonged vs. 26% for intermittent piperacillin/tazobactam infusions, respectively (p = 0.17). In the BLISS study, Abdul-Aziz et al. found a better clinical cure rate of P. aeruginosa -related infections treated with continuous beta-lactam administration [52% vs. 25% for 30-min intermittent administration (p = 0.052)]. Finally, the same trend was noted in the study performed by Lodise et al. with a mortality rate of 8.8% in patients treated with prolonged administration vs. 15.2% in patients treated with intermittent boluses (p = 0.17), this difference becoming significant in the most severe patients with an APACHE II score ≥ 17 (12.2% vs. 31.6%, p = 0.04).

R3.6. We suggest administering an intravenous loading dose before starting the continuous or prolonged infusion at the onset of treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics, in order to achieve a concentration within the PK-PD targets as quickly as possible.

Optional recommendation — strong agreement

Simulations of kinetic profiles using population pharmacokinetic models according to different administration regimens demonstrate the interest of the administration of a beta-lactam loading dose before the initiation of a continuous infusion, in order to reach both an expected steady-state concentration and a "pharmacologically effective" concentration as quickly as possible (cf. Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Simulated plasma concentrations obtained for a 12 g piperacillin daily dose delivered as intermittent administrations (IA, right) or continuous infusion without (CI, left) or with a loading dose (Bolus+CI, middle). The continuous infusion preceded by a loading dose is the regimen that achieves the greatest % f T ≥ MIC. The trough concentration before the next injection falls below the MIC in the discontinuous administration regimen, while the concentration may remain below the MIC for several hours after the beginning of the infusion in the case of continuous administration without a loading dose.

### Effect of piperacillin-tazobactam vs meropenem on 30-day mortality for patients with E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance: a randomized clinical trial [^112BoJV8]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases mediate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Significant infections caused by these strains are usually treated with carbapenems, potentially selecting for carbapenem resistance. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be an effective "carbapenem-sparing" option to treat extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers.

Objectives

To determine whether definitive therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam is noninferior to meropenem (a carbapenem) in patients with bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or K pneumoniae.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Noninferiority, parallel group, randomized clinical trial included hospitalized patients enrolled from 26 sites in 9 countries from February 2014 to July 2017. Adult patients were eligible if they had at least 1 positive blood culture with E coli or Klebsiella spp testing nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone but susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Of 1646 patients screened, 391 were included in the study.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, 4.5 g, every 6 hours (n = 188 participants) or meropenem, 1 g, every 8 hours (n = 191 participants) for a minimum of 4 days, up to a maximum of 14 days, with the total duration determined by the treating clinician.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days after randomization. A noninferiority margin of 5% was used.

Results

Among 379 patients (mean age, 66.5 years; 47.8% women) who were randomized appropriately, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and were included in the primary analysis population, 378 (99.7%) completed the trial and were assessed for the primary outcome. A total of 23 of 187 patients (12.3%) randomized to piperacillin-tazobactam met the primary outcome of mortality at 30 days compared with 7 of 191 (3.7%) randomized to meropenem (risk difference, 8.6% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 14.5%]; p = 0.90 for noninferiority). Effects were consistent in an analysis of the per-protocol population. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 5 of 188 patients (2.7%) in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 3 of 191 (1.6%) in the meropenem group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with E coli or K pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance, definitive treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam compared with meropenem did not result in a noninferior 30-day mortality. These findings do not support use of piperacillin-tazobactam in this setting.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints for enterobacterales-FDA… [^115WD9fe]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Piperacillin-tazobactam is a combination of piperacillin, a penicillin-class antibacterial and tazobactam, a β-lactamase inhibitor, indicated for the treatment of:

- Intra-abdominal infections in adult and pediatric patients 2 months of age and older
- Nosocomial pneumonia in adult and pediatric patients 2 months of age and older
- Skin and skin structure infections in adults
- Female pelvic infections in adults
- Community-acquired pneumonia in adults. For nosocomial pneumonia in adults, piperacillin-tazobactam is approved at 4. 5 g every 6 hours administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. For all other indications in adults, piperacillin-tazobactam is approved at 3. 375 g every 6 hours administered by intravenous infusion over 30 min.

Piperacillin-tazobactam is a combination of piperacillin, a penicillin-class antibacterial and tazobactam, a β-lactamase inhibitor, indicated for the treatment of:

- Intra-abdominal infections in adult and pediatric patients 2 months of age and older
- Nosocomial pneumonia in adult and pediatric patients 2 months of age and older
- Skin and skin structure infections in adults
- Female pelvic infections in adults
- Community-acquired pneumonia in adults. In adults with creatinine clearance greater than 40 mL/min, piperacillin-tazobactam is approved at 4. 5 g every 6 hours administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes for nosocomial pneumonia, and at
3. 375 g every 6 hours as a 30-minute infusion for all other indications. > MIC. The studies used various dosage regimens and infusion durations. Extended-infusion dosing over 3 to 4 hours of the 4. 5 g dose every 6 to 8 hours more reliably achieved ≥ 90% PTA at MICs ≤ 16/4 mcg/mL.

The CLSI notes that no dosage regimen demonstrated acceptable PTA at MICs ≥ 32/4 mcg/mL in patients with normal renal function regardless of study methodology or infusion duration. P. aeruginosa isolates with MICs of ≥ 32/4 mcg/mL treated with piperacillin-tazobactam. Second, PTA data demonstrating that the standard 0. 5-hour infusion of PTZ does not achieve ≥ 90% PTA at an MIC of 16/4 mcg/mL even when the highest approved dose of
4. 5 g every 6 hours is used. Considering the limitations of the provided PTA analyses, which are described below, FDA recommends using the maximum approved dose of 4. 5 g every 6 hours with an extended infusion over 3 hours to improve PTA at MIC of 16/4 mcg/mL by maximizing the fT C > piperacillin-tazobactam MIC/τ in support of the SDD breakpoint. a Susceptible-dose dependent breakpoints are based on a dosage regimen of 4. 5 grams every 6 hours as a 3-hour infusion in patients with creatinine clearance 41–120 mL/min.
