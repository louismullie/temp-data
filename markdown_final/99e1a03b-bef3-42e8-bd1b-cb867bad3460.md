## Question

First line management of hypertension

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line management of hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying severity. Then, I should evaluate patient characteristics and comorbidities that shift first-line choices. Next, I will lay out lifestyle interventions, decide between initial monotherapy versus combination therapy, and select specific drug classes. After that, I need to consider formulation and dosing strategies, implementation and monitoring, and finally special populations and a succinct algorithmic summary.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and severity classification, and wait, let me verify the threshold used across major guidelines because definitions can vary. Most contemporary international guidelines still define hypertension as office blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg, and measuring both arms at the first visit is essential since an inter-arm systolic difference > 10 mmHg may signal vascular disease and warrants further evaluation, so I need to ensure that is checked up front [^115xcWg5] [^116sN2BT] [^113Nu5K3]. In practice, grade 1 typically spans 140–159/90–99 mmHg and grade 2 is ≥ 160/100 mmHg; acknowledging global variability helps avoid premature assumptions when targets or thresholds differ across systems [^116nKqcH] [^116v5PnZ] [^115xcWg5].

> Next, I should review patient modifiers because they strongly influence the initial regimen, and hold on, I should verify age, frailty, race, and key comorbidities. In older or frail patients, I need to avoid aggressive initial combination therapy and watch for orthostatic symptoms; in patients ≥ 85 years or with moderate-to-severe frailty, monotherapy is a safer starting point with careful titration and orthostatic testing to mitigate falls and syncope risks [^116nKqcH] [^116v5PnZ] [^114nx8CL]. For Black patients, thiazide diuretics or dihydropyridine CCBs are preferred first-line and ACE inhibitors are less effective as monotherapy, whereas non-Black patients can start with ACEi, ARB, CCB, or thiazide based on individual factors; I should double-check this alignment with JNC 8 and Canadian guidance to avoid selection biases [^111DCbKx] [^114PEbtH] [^115hsw1Z]. With diabetes or CKD, I should favor an ACEi/ARB for renal protection and plan ongoing kidney monitoring; for pregnancy, I must pivot to labetalol, methyldopa, or long-acting nifedipine exclusively and avoid ACEi/ARB/most diuretics to ensure fetal safety [^1114ry3p] [^112MEzWw] [^111Xkjyp] [^117SuZKQ].

> Now, I will address lifestyle therapy, but wait, I should confirm the timing for diabetics because some societies recommend earlier pharmacotherapy. Lifestyle counsel remains universal, with attention to sodium restriction, weight loss, DASH-style diet, physical activity, alcohol moderation, and smoking cessation; in diabetes with confirmed office BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg, the ESC 2024 guidance recommends no more than about three months of lifestyle-only therapy before starting medications to reduce cardiovascular risk, so I need to set expectations about timely escalation rather than prolonged watchful waiting [^112MEzWw].

> I need to decide on initial monotherapy versus combination therapy, and hold on, let me verify the situations where initial combination is preferred versus when to step more cautiously. For most patients with confirmed hypertension (≥ 140/90), ESC 2024 recommends initiating combination therapy; however, I should avoid initial combination in patients aged ≥ 85, those with symptomatic orthostasis, or with moderate-to-severe frailty, and consider monotherapy in low-risk grade 1 hypertension or in high-normal BP with very high CV risk where a gentler start is prudent [^116nKqcH] [^116v5PnZ]. If BP is ≥ 160/100 mmHg or ≥ 20/10 mmHg above target, or if risk is high due to diabetes or CKD, initial two-drug therapy is favored to improve probability of timely control, and I should confirm this aligns with WHO and recent real-world analyses that emphasize quicker control with combinations [^112jqcKP] [^116K17V8].

> Let me now examine the evidence base for this strategic choice, and wait a minute, I should double-check findings from PATHWAY-1 because they are frequently cited for initial combination therapy. In PATHWAY-1, initial losartan/HCTZ combination lowered home systolic BP about 4.9 mmHg more across 32 weeks than sequential monotherapy without increasing adverse events, with early-phase superiority and a uniform response across renin tertiles that reduces the risk of "picking the wrong monotherapy" up front, supporting initial dual therapy when appropriate [^111N7KCo] [^113kvH6f]. The practical implication is that combination therapy enhances early BP control, and although the monotherapy arm largely "caught up" by 32 weeks, the early control advantage matters for near-term risk, so I should weigh this when the patient's short-term risk is nontrivial [^111N7KCo].

> With the strategy in mind, I should select drug classes, and I need to ensure I choose complementary mechanisms in line with ESC/ESH. For most patients starting combination therapy, pair a RAS blocker (ACEi or ARB) with either a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic; if monotherapy is chosen, reasonable first-line options include ACEi, ARB, long-acting dihydropyridine CCB, or thiazide, reserving β-blockers for specific indications such as CAD, arrhythmia control, or heart failure rather than as routine first-line in older adults [^116nKqcH] [^1112HVxd] [^111zxsTh]. I should confirm what to avoid initially: α-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension, β-blockers as first-line in patients ≥ 60 with isolated systolic hypertension, and ACEi as first-line in Black patients with uncomplicated hypertension, to prevent suboptimal BP responses or outcome profiles [^115hsw1Z] [^112mJUdy].

> I will now consider formulation and dosing, and hold on, I should verify the guidance on single-pill combinations and low-dose starts. When using two agents, fixed-dose single-pill combinations are preferred because they improve adherence and simplify titration; start at low doses to minimize adverse effects, then up-titrate or add a second mechanism if not already employed, with follow-up at roughly 2–4 weeks to assess response and tolerability, which aligns with WHO's operational guidance and national recommendations [^11475XTt] [^116wAucT] [^116K17V8] [^112jqcKP].

> Implementation and monitoring come next, and I should double-check the timing of initiation and key baseline tests. Initiating pharmacotherapy within the first month of diagnosis is associated with better 6-month and sustained control, so I should avoid unnecessary delays once the diagnosis is confirmed; at baseline, obtain serum creatinine, eGFR, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and perform a 12-lead ECG, then repeat kidney measures at least annually if CKD is present, and assess for orthostatic hypotension before starting or intensifying therapy to reduce fall risk [^114Dbs1z] [^111imJ56] [^1114ry3p] [^1134nmk5] [^114nx8CL]. If the initial regimen does not reach target, I need to verify adherence, reinforce lifestyle, up-titrate or add a complementary class, and schedule timely reassessment rather than letting inertia persist, as therapeutic inertia undermines control rates early and long term [^116K17V8] [^114Dbs1z].

> But wait, what if BP remains uncontrolled despite multiple agents; I should verify the criteria for resistant hypertension and next steps. Resistant hypertension is defined as BP above goal despite adherence to three first-line agents (including a diuretic) at maximal tolerated doses, or controlled BP requiring four or more drugs; in such cases, confirm accurate measurement and exclude white coat effects with out-of-office readings, evaluate for secondary causes such as primary aldosteronism, and optimize long-acting, once-daily agents before stepwise addition of further therapies [^117BqjS3]. In isolated systolic hypertension, I should avoid α-blockers and avoid β-blockers as first-line in patients aged ≥ 60, recalibrating toward thiazide-like diuretics and dihydropyridine CCBs which better address arterial stiffness physiology in this phenotype [^112mJUdy].

> Special populations deserve explicit confirmation, and I need to ensure pregnancy safety and renal protection. In pregnancy, use oral labetalol, methyldopa, or long-acting nifedipine and avoid ACEi/ARB due to fetotoxicity; in CKD or diabetes, prioritize ACEi/ARB for kidney and cardiovascular protection with monitoring of creatinine and potassium after initiation and periodically thereafter, accepting small creatinine rises while watching for significant declines in eGFR or hyperkalemia that would prompt adjustment [^111Xkjyp] [^117SuZKQ] [^1114ry3p] [^112MEzWw]. For older or frail adults, I should reconsider targets and intensification pace, screen for orthostasis regularly, and err toward monotherapy starts with cautious titration to avoid iatrogenic harm [^116nKqcH] [^114nx8CL].

> To summarize the decision flow, let me reconsider the sequence to ensure nothing is missed. Confirm office BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg with proper technique and both-arm measurement, classify severity, and assess risk, frailty, age, race, and comorbidities that shape agent selection; provide lifestyle counseling, but if BP is ≥ 160/100 mmHg, ≥ 20/10 mmHg above target, or risk is high due to diabetes/CKD, start a low-dose two-drug regimen as a single-pill combination pairing a RAS blocker with a dihydropyridine CCB or a thiazide, reserving monotherapy for low-risk grade 1 hypertension, very elderly, or frail patients and adjusting class choices for Black race and pregnancy; initiate within one month, reassess in 2–4 weeks, titrate or add complementary classes promptly, monitor renal function and orthostatic responses, and evaluate for resistant hypertension if control remains elusive despite optimized three-drug therapy including a diuretic [^116nKqcH] [^116v5PnZ] [^11475XTt] [^116K17V8] [^112jqcKP] [^1114ry3p] [^114nx8CL].

---

First-line management of hypertension starts with **lifestyle modifications** for all patients, including dietary sodium restriction, weight loss, increased physical activity, moderation of alcohol intake, and smoking cessation. Pharmacologic therapy is initiated based on blood pressure levels and cardiovascular risk: **initiate pharmacologic therapy** with a two-drug combination [^116nKqcH] (ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic) for most patients with BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg, preferably as a single-pill combination [^11475XTt]. Monotherapy is reserved for patients with **grade 1 hypertension** and low risk, frailty, or advanced age [^116v5PnZ]. Beta-blockers are not first-line unless there are specific indications such as heart failure or ischemic heart disease. Treatment is individualized based on comorbidities, age, and patient preferences, with regular monitoring and adjustment to achieve target blood pressure [^116K17V8].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications are recommended for **all patients with hypertension**, regardless of blood pressure or cardiovascular risk. These measures significantly reduce blood pressure and cardiovascular risk.

- **Dietary sodium restriction**: Reduce sodium intake to less than 2.3 grams per day.

- **Weight loss**: Aim for a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5–24.9 kg/m².

- **Physical activity**: Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week.

- **Alcohol moderation**: Limit alcohol intake to no more than two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women.

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended for all patients.

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacologic therapy is initiated based on blood pressure, **cardiovascular risk**, and **patient-specific factors** [^116K17V8]. The following drug classes are recommended as first-line therapy:

- **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)**: Particularly beneficial in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or heart failure [^1112HVxd].

- **Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: Alternative to ACE inhibitors, especially in patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors [^116nKqcH].

- **Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)**: Effective in elderly patients and those with isolated systolic hypertension.

- **Thiazide diuretics**: Particularly effective in black patients and elderly patients [^111DCbKx] [^114VRfqY].

---

## Combination therapy

Recent guidelines emphasize **initiating combination therapy in most patients with hypertension**, as it achieves blood pressure control more rapidly and effectively than monotherapy [^116nKqcH] [^111N7KCo]. Preferred combinations include an **ACE inhibitor or ARB** with a **calcium channel blocker** or **thiazide diuretic**, and **single-pill combinations** are recommended to improve adherence and simplify treatment regimens [^116nKqcH] [^11475XTt].

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require **specific considerations** when initiating antihypertensive therapy:

- **Elderly patients**: Monotherapy may be preferred in frail or elderly patients due to increased risk of adverse effects [^116v5PnZ].

- **Pregnant patients**: Methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are recommended as first-line agents [^111Xkjyp].

- **Patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred due to their renal protective effects [^1112HVxd].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to ensure effective **blood pressure control** and minimize **adverse effects** [^116K17V8]. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly, with medication regimens adjusted as needed to achieve target levels [^115NCHjR] [^114nx8CL].

---

First-line management of hypertension involves lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapy, with **combination therapy** recommended for most patients [^116nKqcH]. Treatment should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, and regular monitoring is essential for effective blood pressure control.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically concerning the choice of antihypertensives and initial therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend initiating combination blood pressure-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. It is preferable to combine a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker) with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or a diuretic. Combination treatment should be avoided in patients aged ≥ 85 years and in those with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or those with elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 120–139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.

The British Hypertension Society Research Network of academic investigators recruited participants from both primary and secondary care.

Patients aged 18 to 79 years with a diagnosis of essential hypertension, who had systolic BP > 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 95 mm Hg, and who were either never treated or had received one drug class in the previous year were eligible for inclusion in PATHWAY‐1. This was a parallel‐group, randomized, double‐blind, phase 4 trial conducted in 11 secondary and two primary care centers in the United Kingdom. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Table S1. Participants were enrolled between February 2010 to November 2013; the study ended (last patient completed the study) in December 2014. The study design and rationale have been previously published. A study schematic is shown in Figure 1 (a more detailed diagram is shown in Figure S1).

Figure 1: Schematic of the study showing drug administration in each of the three phases. HCTZ indicates hydrochlorothiazide; HSBP, home systolic blood pressure.

After a four-week, single-blind, placebo run-in during which any previous antihypertensive monotherapy was withdrawn, there were three sequential phases of active treatment during which investigators and participants were blinded to the initial random assignment. In the first phase (weeks 0–16), half of the participants started monotherapy with either losartan or HCTZ (hydrochlorothiazide), and half started a combination of losartan plus HCTZ. In the second phase (weeks 16–32), all participants received the…

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112M8ivC]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, a group of primary care practices in the United States developed an algorithm for identifying patients at risk of hypertension from their electronic records. The innovation was successful and has now been implemented in these practices. It is easy to see how this type of innovation could be used in calculating rescreening intervals for patients and also follow-up times after BP treatment intensification.

### Rationalizing the treatment of hypertension [^117CLCoV]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Management of hypertension in this country is confounded by continual changes in recommended target blood pressure (BP) goals and a nonhomogeneous patient population who have a variety of demographic and clinical characteristics that influence treatment. This paper focuses on three major elements in managing hypertension: BP and the importance of reducing it to acceptably low levels; concomitant risk factors or cardiovascular and renal target involvement; and drug therapy that may confer prognostic advantages beyond those predicted by BP effects.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^116iACn3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The 2017 guidelines from the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend considering the initiation or intensification of pharmacologic treatment to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 140 mmHg. This target aims to reduce the risk of stroke or cardiac events in patients aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Treatment goals should be based on periodic discussions between the patient and healthcare provider, weighing the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^113Nu5K3]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, specifically concerning office blood pressure (BP) measurement, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend measuring office BP in both arms at the first visit. A systolic blood pressure (SBP) difference of more than 10 mmHg between arms is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and may indicate arterial stenosis.

### Patient predictors of combination therapy as initial hypertension treatment: The AOURP (All of Us Research Program) registry [^112jqcKP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension control rates remain on the decline following years of improvement. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for first-line hypertension treatment recommend four classes of medications: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and thiazide diuretics. However, more than 70% of hypertensive individuals require at least two antihypertensive medications to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals.

There are numerous fixed-dose combination treatment pills available, such as those combining an ACEi with a CCB (e.g. Lotrel) or diuretics (e.g. Zestoretic). Recent studies demonstrate a greater reduction in BP with combination therapy versus monotherapy, with no increase in adverse events and improved adherence. As recommended by clinical guidelines, this benefit is significant for those with higher systolic blood pressure (> 160/100 mm Hg), or 20 mm Hg over the systolic blood pressure target, as well as those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. However, prescribing combination therapy as first-line treatment remains uncommon.

To our knowledge, no real-world study has sought to determine common patient demographic and clinical factors that contribute to the initial prescription of combination therapy, which may uncover potential systemic barriers. Here, we used electronic health records and survey data from the nationally sourced AOURP (All of Us Research Program) registry to explore patient characteristics associated with combination versus monotherapy as first-line treatment for hypertension.

### Initial antihypertensive regimens in newly treated patients: Real world evidence from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network [^116Cwfkc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Hypertension affects an estimated 120 million individuals in the United States and is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death. Nearly all of these individuals ultimately require antihypertensive therapy to achieve blood pressure control, and as a consequence, several antihypertensive drugs are among the most commonly used medications worldwide. Consensus US and international guidelines have long recommended certain antihypertensive classes as "first‐line" therapies — namely, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and, until relatively recently, β‐blockers. However, for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, guidelines generally do not prioritize any of these classes except in select circumstances, leaving prescribers to choose from some 30 to 40 antihypertensive drugs when initiating antihypertensive therapy.

Real‐world antihypertensive utilization patterns have been studied extensively, but in almost all cases, the focus of these studies has been on treatment patterns in prevalent hypertension cohorts. These studies provide useful insight into overall antihypertensive use in populations; however, they rarely have distinguished between patients who are early in their treatment course from those with long‐standing hypertension and who may have extensive treatment histories and multidrug regimens that have evolved over time. Thus, very little is known about contemporary patterns of early antihypertensive care.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^112FXV7A]. Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

The novelty and relevance of this study lie in demonstrating that the benefits of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy accrue rapidly in primary care and clinical trials. Better blood pressure (BP, mm Hg) control achieved during the first 3 to 6 months of treatment leads to fewer cardiovascular events occurring during this time interval. Standard hypertension control metrics typically exclude patients during the first 6 months following diagnosis, after which time they are included. Thus, for both clinical outcomes and care quality metrics, controlling hypertension within the first 6 months after diagnosis is important.

Prompt initiation of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy is key to realizing the time-sensitive benefits of BP reduction. Antihypertensive monotherapy is the norm for treatment initiation in clinical practice, despite evidence suggesting that monotherapy is insufficient to control hypertension in most patients. Furthermore, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association high BP guideline recommends treatment initiation with two different antihypertensive medications when BP is ≥ 20/ ≥ 10 mm Hg above target. Previous research indicates that not only are most adults with hypertension initiated on antihypertensive monotherapy, but also that most of them remain on monotherapy at 3 years. Moreover, half of adults with uncontrolled hypertension were on monotherapy after 8 years.

Given the evidence, our study was designed to determine if initiating treatment with antihypertensive monotherapy during the first month after the diagnosis of uncontrolled hypertension led to more prompt and better BP control.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: Update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111HrTHa]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary hypertension, specifically concerning PAH-specific therapy, the ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend continued monitoring in treatment-naive patients with PAH who exhibit WHO functional class I symptoms. This monitoring is crucial for detecting the development of symptoms that indicate disease progression and warrant the initiation of pharmacotherapy.

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^115vXdik]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are indispensable drugs in the treatment of hypertension, their role as first-line or even second-line drugs is a provoking debate. The European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) guidelines recommend that thiazide diuretics should be considered as suitable as β-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment.

Another European position, endorsed by the British Hypertension Society, is that diuretics and calcium channel blockers should be first-line drugs in hypertensive patients aged ≥ 55 years or black patients of any age. In contrast, ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers in the case of intolerance to ACE inhibitors) should be first-line drugs in hypertensive patients younger than 55 years of age.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC VII) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends that thiazide diuretics should be preferred drugs in "most" hypertensive patients, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes.

The present review does not intend to negate the important role of diuretics in certain groups of patients (blacks, salt-sensitive patients, concomitant heart failure) or to underestimate their role in multiple-drug combinations in patients with resistant hypertension. The main argument that will be discussed is the place of diuretics as first-line drugs or add-on drugs in the context of the available antihypertensive treatments.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: A global comparison [^116sN2BT]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the largest single contributor to the global burden of disease, affecting an estimated 1.39 billion people worldwide. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can aid in the effective management of this common condition; however, inconsistencies exist between CPGs, and the extent of this is unknown. Understanding the differences in CPG recommendations across income settings may provide an important means of understanding some of the global variations in clinical outcomes related to hypertension.

- **Aims**: This study aims to analyze the variation between hypertension CPGs globally. It further aims to assess the variation in three areas: diagnostic threshold and staging, treatment, and target blood pressure (BP) recommendations in hypertension.

- **Methods**: A search was conducted on the MEDLINE repository to identify national and international hypertension CPGs from 2010 to May 2020. An additional country-specific grey-literature search was conducted for all countries and territories of the world as identified by the World Bank. Data describing the diagnosis, staging, treatment, and target blood pressure were extracted from CPGs, and variations between CPGs for these domains were analyzed.

- **Results**: Forty-eight CPGs from across all World Bank income settings were selected for analysis. Ninety-six percent of guidelines defined hypertension as a clinic-based BP of ≥ 140/90 mmHg, and 87% of guidelines recommended a target BP of < 140/90 mmHg. In the pharmacological treatment of hypertension, eight different first-step, 17 different second-step, and six different third-step options were identified.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^112LqR2b]. Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Patients were required to have a visit between January 2019 and January 2023, where essential hypertension (International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code I10) was first recorded in the electronic medical record, with SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90. They also needed at least one visit at a participating program site before and after the diagnosis of hypertension. The requirement of at least one prior visit before receiving the diagnosis of hypertension was intended to increase the likelihood that the cohort comprised newly diagnosed patients. Follow-up visits for up to 42 months after the initial diagnosis were included.

Patients aged 85 years and older were excluded, which is consistent with the age range used in other quality metrics for controlling BP. Patients with prescriptions for antihypertensive medications before the initial diagnosis of hypertension were also excluded.

Body mass index (kg/m²) was calculated from height, measured intermittently, and weight, which was recorded in 85% of encounters. BP values were obtained from primary care practice sites of participating institutions. If more than one BP value was recorded for an encounter, the minimum SBP and the corresponding DBP were selected for analysis.

Hypertension was defined by an International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic code of I10. For this study, only patients with newly diagnosed and untreated hypertension were included. Untreated hypertension was defined as individuals with an initial visit BP of 140/90 mm Hg or greater.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure lead to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives were to assess, when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) of at least one-year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were ta…

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^117PJN7o]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Challenges in screening and diagnosis: PA is underdiagnosed and undertreated in clinical practice, where screening and diagnosis are the principal challenges that limit effective management. Although a traditional diagnosis and treatment workflow for PA is highlighted in Figures 1 and 2, there is no consensus on recommended screening for PA in hypertensive individuals within either primary or secondary care settings.

The Endocrine Society guidelines for the diagnosis and management of PA recommend screening up to 50% of "at risk" patients for PA. Screening, under these recommendations, should be conducted using the aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR), with particular attention paid to those with:

- **Severe hypertension**
- **Hypertension with spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia**
- **An adrenal mass**
- **Sleep apnea**
- **A family history of early-onset hypertension**
- **Stroke at a young age**
- **A first-degree relative who has PA**

The American Heart Association guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hypertension align with the Endocrine Society guidelines in terms of recognized risk factors that should trigger screening for PA. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidance does not emphasize the need to screen for PA except in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, which accounts for approximately 5% of all patients. Some national guidelines, such as those of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK, do not specifically reference screening for PA.

### First-line diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs for hypertension [^114VRfqY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Different first-line drug classes for patients with hypertension are often assumed to have similar effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity outcomes and lowering blood pressure. First-line low-dose thiazide diuretics have been previously shown to have the best mortality and morbidity evidence when compared with placebo or no treatment. Head-to-head comparisons of thiazides with other blood pressure-lowering drug classes would demonstrate whether there are important differences.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of first-line diuretic drugs with other individual first-line classes of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity, and withdrawals due to adverse effects in patients with hypertension. Secondary objectives included assessments of the need for added drugs, drug switching, and blood pressure-lowering.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registers up to March 2021. References were also checked, and study authors were contacted to identify additional studies. A top-up search of the Specialized Register was carried out in June 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized active comparator trials of at least one year's duration were included. Trials had a clearly defined intervention arm of a first-line diuretic (thiazide, thiazide-like, or loop diuretic) compared to another first-line drug class: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111N7KCo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Guidelines for hypertension vary in their preference for initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy, stratified by patient profile; therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of these approaches.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a 1-year, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 605 untreated patients aged 18 to 79 years with systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 95 mm Hg. In phase 1 (weeks 0–16), patients were randomly assigned to initial monotherapy (losartan 50–100 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg, crossing over at 8 weeks), or initial combination (losartan 50–100 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target.

- **Hierarchical primary outcomes**: These were the difference from baseline in home systolic, averaged over phases 1 and 2, and if significant, at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, and the difference in home systolic BP responses between tertiles of plasma renin.

- **Findings**: Home systolic BP after initial monotherapy fell 4.9 mm Hg (range: 3.7–6.0 mm Hg) less over 32 weeks (P < 0.001) than after initial combination but caught up at 32 weeks (difference 1.2 mm Hg [range: −0.4 to 2.8 mm Hg], P = 0.13). In phase 1, home systolic BP response to each monotherapy differed substantially between renin tertiles, whereas response to combination therapy was uniform and at least 5 mm Hg more than to monotherapy.

There were no significant differences in withdrawal rates or adverse events between the treatment groups.

Hypertension (2018). High credibility.

Hypertension can be associated with a variety of conditions and factors including insulin resistance, pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, primary aldosteronism, and dyslipidemia. It may also be linked to cardiac signs like a third heart sound, erectile dysfunction, and conditions such as AIS, the use of amphetamines, and premature ASCVD. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), transient ischemic attack (TIA), carotid artery stenosis, fourth heart sound, and hyperthyroidism are additional associations.

Moreover, hypertension is linked with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), prediabetes, Cushing's syndrome, coarctation of the aorta, increased systolic blood pressure (↑ SBP), hypertensive retinopathy, NSAIDs use, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), glaucoma, heart failure (HF), and renal artery stenosis. Other related factors include hypermetropia, hyperparathyroidism, alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiac arrhythmias, angiogenesis inhibitors, antidepressants, chronic kidney disease (CKD), decongestants, antipsychotics, and obesity.

Symptoms such as headache, obstructive sleep apnea, and the use of corticosteroids, hormonal contraceptives, and tobacco can contribute to or be associated with hypertension. An increased diastolic blood pressure (↑ DBP), atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and hypothyroidism are also noted associations.

### Evaluation and management of resistant hypertension: Core curriculum 2024 [^117BqjS3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above the goal despite confirmed adherence to three first-line antihypertensive agents or when blood pressure is controlled with four or more medications at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. In addition to meeting these criteria, identifying patients with true resistant hypertension requires both accurate in-office blood pressure measurement and excluding white coat effects through out-of-office blood pressure measurements. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events and are more likely to have a potentially treatable secondary cause contributing to their hypertension.

Effective treatment of resistant hypertension includes ongoing lifestyle modifications and collaboration with patients to detect and address barriers to optimal medication adherence. Pharmacologic treatment should prioritize optimizing first-line, once daily, longer-acting medications followed by the stepwise addition of second-, third-, and fourth-line agents as tolerated. Physicians should systematically evaluate and address any underlying secondary causes. A coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach including clinicians with experience in treating resistant hypertension is essential.

New treatment options, including both pharmacologic and device-based therapies, have recently been approved, and more are in the pipeline; their optimal role in the management of resistant hypertension is an area of ongoing research.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^114Dbs1z]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Treatment initiation (TI) with monotherapy for uncontrolled hypertension was evaluated during the first month after diagnosis and at 6-month intervals thereafter. TI occurred in approximately 44% of patients in the first month, 75% at 6 months, 82% at 1 year, and 90% at 2 years after diagnosis. The influence of TI with monotherapy during the first month after the diagnosis of hypertension versus later time points on blood pressure (BP) control to < 140/ < 90 mm Hg at 6-month intervals is also demonstrated. Patients with TI during the first month had a significantly higher BP control rate at 6 months post-diagnosis (57.4% versus 47.5%, P < 0.001), which was maintained until 30 months (66.8% versus 62.0%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, patients treated in the first month had only a 1.9 mm Hg greater baseline mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) than their untreated counterparts, although the difference was statistically significant (154.4 versus 152.5 mm Hg, P < 0.001).

- **Figure 2**: The cumulative rate of treatment initiation (TI) over time is shown. Patients with TI during the first month (solid purple line) had higher blood pressure control rates from 6 up to 30 months after the diagnosis of hypertension than those not initiated during the first month (solid blue line). Bottom: Count of patients by time period stratified by patients who were or were not initiated on antihypertensive therapy in the first month after the diagnosis of hypertension. TSD indicates time since diagnosis.

The rate of treatment intensification for those who did and did not begin monotherapy in the first month is shown.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. However, these recommendations are not based on evidence related to clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful, and the actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. No language restrictions were applied. Additional searches included clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line agents against monotherapy.

### Revised definition of pulmonary hypertension and approach to management: A clinical primer [^114mmev1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Newly diagnosed patients with idiopathic, hereditary, or drug‐induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) should be considered for vasoreactivity testing in the cardiac catheterization laboratory at an expert pulmonary hypertension center. In the absence of a high-risk clinical profile, patients who demonstrate a positive vasoreactivity response, defined by a decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline to ≤ 40 mm Hg without a decrease in cardiac output, should be initiated on calcium channel antagonist therapy. The dosage should be titrated to achieve an optimal clinical benefit/adverse effect balance.

For patients with PAH without evidence of vasoreactivity but with high-risk findings, consideration of up-front therapy with the prostacyclin analogue treprostinil administered by intravenous (i.v.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) route, plus the phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor tadalafil, and endothelin receptor antagonist ambrisentan is indicated. For patients with PAH without vasoreactivity or high-risk findings, initial combination therapy with tadalafil and ambrisentan or the alternate endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan should be considered. NT-proBNP indicates N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; pVO2, peak volume of oxygen consumption; PVR, pulmonary vascular resistance; WHO-FC, World Health Organization Functional Class; and WU, Wood units.

Therapeutic escalation should be pursued in patients who do not achieve low-risk status.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^111imJ56]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

The principal finding of our study is that patients with untreated, uncontrolled hypertension who are initiated on monotherapy during the first month following the diagnosis of hypertension achieved better BP control at 6 months than patients who were not treated in the first month. Hypertension control within the first 6 months of treatment reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events. Moreover, superior control was maintained through 30 months in the group with treatment initiation (TI) in the first month compared to later time points.

Treatment with initial monotherapy was the focus, as most adults with hypertension are started on a single antihypertensive medication drug class. While initial monotherapy predominates, initial combination therapy leads to better BP control, fewer cardiovascular events, and is recommended in the treatment guidelines.

In our study, the cumulative rate of treatment intensification (TI) increased as a function of time, whereas the rate of increase slowed over the course of 42 months. For patients initiated on monotherapy, subsequent treatment intensification is often required to attain BP control. However, patients initiated on monotherapy in the first month did not achieve 70% or higher control rates to < 140/ < 90. This finding is consistent with their low rates of subsequent therapeutic intensification for uncontrolled hypertension, which averaged approximately 16% at 6 months, 14% at 12 months, and roughly 10% thereafter. Our findings coincide with other reports that treatment intensification occurs in less than 1 in 6 encounters when BP is uncontrolled.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: A World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116K17V8]. Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, fewer than 14% of adults with hypertension have their BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP of < 140/90 mmHg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development.

Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted, and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling.

The guidelines recommend BP thresholds to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for the choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single-pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. The strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the trade-offs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations, and cost-effectiveness; health equity; and access.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^116zB41q]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Typically, low screening rates for PA are matched with less awareness of specific guidelines for its diagnosis and management, such as those of the Endocrine Society, and a greater reliance on more general hypertension guidelines, which are frequently more treat-to-target oriented. In addition, screening for PA in a primary care setting may be particularly challenging, for example, when there is restricted access to aldosterone and renin assays. Even where available, screening is often not routinely deployed. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial and include clinician and/or patient reluctance to consider withdrawal of potential confounding antihypertensive agents because of the fear of loss of BP control, coupled with a lack of familiarity with alternative noninterfering medications. These "roadblocks" were highlighted in a qualitative study that investigated the experience of 16 general practitioners in screening for PA, where knowledge gaps, practical limitations of performing the ARR, and errors in diagnostic reasoning were the main challenges associated with routine PA screening.

As a result of low screening and a lack of awareness of PA, patients are often hypertensive for many years (e.g. 5–20) before BP that is suboptimally controlled on multiple agents triggers the necessary investigations to permit the diagnosis. While PA is both a curable and treatable form of hypertension, the effectiveness of targeted intervention may be significantly attenuated by a late diagnosis.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^116hGNTt]. Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Adults with untreated and uncontrolled hypertension are more likely to achieve blood pressure control with timely interventions. However, 30% remained uncontrolled at 3 years, indicating a need for more frequent treatment intensification. Confirming an uncontrolled blood pressure during the visit was associated with a greater probability of treatment initiation. Importantly, achieving hypertension control during the first 6 months after diagnosis provides greater cardiovascular protection than delayed control.

### Early combination versus initial metformin monotherapy in the management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: An East Asian perspective [^112NVHRZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The general goals of diabetes management are to avoid acute metabolic decompensation, prevent or delay complications, decrease premature mortality, and preserve quality of life. Many East Asian countries have formulated their own national or regional guidelines, often adapted from international guidelines such as those of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE), and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), to suit local needs. Pharmacological treatment options for type 2 diabetes (T2D) are divided into the following:

- **Non-insulin therapies**: These include
	- **Insulin sensitizers**: metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZDs)
	- **Secretagogues**: sulphonylureas (SUs)
	- **Incretin-based therapies**: glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4-i)
	- **Insulin-sparing agents**: α-glucosidase inhibitors (AGis) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is)
- **Insulin therapies**

Until recently, stepwise and combination therapy have been the two recommendations for pharmacologic approaches in T2D. Because of a lack of sufficient evidence on the use of early combination therapy, stepwise treatment intensification has been the standard approach to achieve glycemic control, as recommended by ADA/EASD consensus on treatment algorithms. Countries such as China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan follow similar guidelines.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^1143bGFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients based on postulated advantages in reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite the widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remain unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months of follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently conducted the process.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^114U2RE3]. Pediatrics (2017). High credibility.

These pediatric hypertension guidelines are an update to the 2004 "Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents". Significant changes in these guidelines include:

- **Updated terminology**: The term "prehypertension" is replaced with "elevated blood pressure".
- **Normative tables**: New normative pediatric blood pressure (BP) tables are based on normal-weight children.
- **Screening simplification**: A simplified screening table is included for identifying BPs needing further evaluation.
- **Classification alignment**: BP classification in adolescents aged ≥ 13 aligns with the forthcoming American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology adult BP guidelines.
- **Screening recommendations**: BP measurements are recommended only during preventive care visits.
- **Evaluation and management**: Streamlined recommendations are provided on the initial evaluation and management of abnormal BPs.
- **Ambulatory monitoring**: An expanded role for ambulatory BP monitoring in the diagnosis and management of pediatric hypertension is emphasized.
- **Echocardiography guidelines**: Revised recommendations are provided on when to perform echocardiography for newly diagnosed hypertensive pediatric patients, typically only before medication initiation. The definition of left ventricular hypertrophy is also revised.

These guidelines include 30 Key Action Statements and 27 additional recommendations derived from a comprehensive review of nearly 15,000 published articles between January 2004 and July 2016. Each Key Action Statement includes a level of evidence, benefit-harm relationship, and strength of recommendation. This clinical practice guideline is endorsed by the American Heart Association.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112K2Bm6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

The objective of PATHWAY‐1 (Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension With Algorithm‐based Therapy ‐ Study 1) was to test the superiority of home systolic blood pressure (HSBP) control of initial combination therapy compared with the more conventional practice of initial monotherapy. Half of the patients received combination therapy from the start, and all participants received combination therapy after the first four months. This design allowed us to rigorously test the "never‐catch‐up" hypothesis. If this were true, we would find a difference in blood pressure at eight months despite both groups receiving the same therapy during the previous four months. We powered the study to detect a 4 mm Hg difference in HSBP, as we deemed this difference to be clinically important.

An important secondary objective of this design was to test the predictors (age, renin level) of response to treatment. This predicts the response to monotherapy but not, we hypothesized, to combination therapy. Although we expected the average blood pressure response to combination therapy to be superior to the average response to monotherapy, the crossover design of phase 1 enabled us to address the question of whether personalized monotherapy achieves a blood pressure response that is not only superior to average but also comparable to the effect of combination therapy.

### Combination therapy as initial treatment for newly diagnosed hypertension [^112T8RSk]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends that clinicians consider the use of multidrug therapy to increase the likelihood of achieving blood pressure goals. Little is known about recent patterns of combination antihypertensive therapy use in patients being initiated on hypertension treatment.

- **Methods**: We investigated combination antihypertensive therapy use in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients from the Cardiovascular Research Network Hypertension Registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between combination antihypertensive therapy and 12-month blood pressure control.

- **Results**: Between 2002 and 2007, a total of 161,585 patients met criteria for incident hypertension and were initiated on treatment. During the study period, an increasing proportion of patients were treated initially with combination rather than single-agent therapy (20.7% in 2002 compared with 35.8% in 2007, P < .001). This increase in combination therapy use was more pronounced in patients with stage 2 hypertension, whose combination therapy use increased from 21.6% in 2002 to 44.5% in 2007. Nearly 90% of initial combination therapy was accounted for by two combinations: a thiazide and a potassium-sparing diuretic (47.6%) and a thiazide and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (41.4%). After controlling for relevant clinical factors, including subsequent intensification of treatment and medication adherence, combination therapy was associated with increased blood pressure control.

### Recognition and management of resistant hypertension [^113RrpeN]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in hypertension awareness and treatment, 30%-60% of hypertensive patients do not achieve blood pressure (BP) targets and subsequently remain at risk for target organ damage. This therapeutic gap is particularly important to nephrologists, who frequently encounter treatment-resistant hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Data are limited on how best to treat patients with CKD and resistant hypertension, because patients with CKD have historically been excluded from hypertension treatment trials.

- **Definition of resistant hypertension**: First, we propose a consistent definition of resistant hypertension as BP levels confirmed by both in-office and out-of-office measurements that exceed appropriate targets while the patient is receiving treatment with at least three antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, at dosages optimized to provide maximum benefit in the absence of intolerable side effects.

- **Evaluation and management**: Second, we recommend that each patient undergo a standardized, stepwise evaluation to assess adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications to identify and reduce barriers, and discontinue use of substances that may exacerbate hypertension. Patients in whom there is high clinical suspicion should be evaluated for potential secondary causes of hypertension. Evidence-based management of resistant hypertension is discussed with special considerations of the differences in approach to patients with and without CKD, including the specific roles of diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and the place of emerging therapies, such as renal denervation and baroreceptor activation therapy.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113gqDFC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

We found a large average difference in home systolic blood pressure (HSBP) in favor of the initial use of combination therapy compared with initial monotherapy over the first eight months of the study (phases 1 and 2); there was no discernible subset of patients in whom this difference was not observed. This was largely due to the superiority of combination therapy in the first 16 weeks (phase 1), with margins of almost 8 and 10 mm Hg, respectively, for home and clinic systolic blood pressure. Although combination therapy is expected to show superior efficacy and is recommended for stage 2 hypertension by some guidelines, this has not yet become the norm in routine practice. Consequently, we incorporated a number of planned measurements in the study design that we believed, if positive, would help to change practice.

The first of the additional measurements was the co-primary endpoint of HSBP at 32 weeks, the prespecified time point for evaluating the never-catch-up hypothesis that initial less intense blood pressure (BP) control results in subsequently poorer BP control. This hypothesis was rejected. Never catching up in the ASCOT and VALUE trials, from which the hypothesis arose, may be more a consequence of suboptimal treatments being combined rather than optimal treatments being started sequentially.

In contrast, our other original comparisons provide strong support for the rationale of initial combination therapy. A unique feature of PATHWAY-1 is the "trial within a trial" of a randomized monotherapy crossover trial, the aims of which were to ensure that each participant's best therapy at maximal force-titrated dose was assessed.

### Thirty-five years of the European Society of Hypertension: From past to future [^114a4kHy]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Historically, essential hypertension represents one of the first clinical conditions for which diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines have been developed. The first official guideline paper dates back to 1977 when the Joint National Committee in the United States released the document, which was revised a few years later in a new paper jointly issued by an 'ad hoc' Committee of the WHO in conjunction with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH). During the last decade of the 20th century, updated versions of the guidelines document have been prepared by the previously mentioned organizations in collaboration with American scientific societies.

The first guideline document prepared by European Societies dates back to 2003, when the ESH, together with the European Society of Cardiology, jointly signed the European guidelines document. New guidelines followed in 2007, 2013, and 2018, the latter being, as previously mentioned, the most frequently cited paper in the worldwide medical literature. The new guidelines document, released during the 32nd European Meeting on Hypertension held in Milan in 2023 and published in the Journal of Hypertension, represents the most updated document on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.

Although an in-depth analysis of the guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, it should be mentioned that the 2023 guidelines document addresses a number of critical issues in the field of hypertension diagnosis and treatment, also offering readers elements of novelty.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: A global comparison [^115xcWg5]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the largest single contributor to the global burden of disease, affecting an estimated 1.39 billion people worldwide. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can aid in the effective management of this common condition; however, inconsistencies exist between CPGs, and the extent of this is unknown. Understanding the differences in CPG recommendations across income settings may provide an important means of understanding some of the global variations in clinical outcomes related to hypertension.

- **Aims**: This study aims to analyze the variation between hypertension CPGs globally. It seeks to assess the variation in three areas: diagnostic threshold and staging, treatment, and target blood pressure (BP) recommendations in hypertension.

- **Methods**: A search was conducted on the MEDLINE repository to identify national and international hypertension CPGs from 2010 to May 2020. An additional country-specific grey-literature search was conducted for all countries and territories of the world as identified by the World Bank. Data describing the diagnosis, staging, treatment, and target blood pressure were extracted from CPGs, and variations between CPGs for these domains were analysed.

- **Results**: Forty-eight CPGs from across all World Bank income settings were selected for analysis. Ninety-six per cent of guidelines defined hypertension as a clinic-based BP of ≥ 140/90mmHg, and 87% of guidelines recommended a target BP of < 140/90mmHg. In the pharmacological treatment of hypertension, eight different first-step, 17 different second-step, and six different third-step treatments were documented.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115xdVCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

- **Search methods**: For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets.

### Standardized treatment protocols for hypertension: Global availability, characteristics, and alignment with the hypertension guideline recommendations [^112YM6UM]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Hypertension control is suboptimal globally. Implementing evidence-based, simple, standardized treatment protocols (STPs) has been instrumental in effectively and efficiently improving treatment and control of hypertension. We aimed to identify, characterize, and critically appraise hypertension STPs.

- **Methods**: We defined STP as a series of steps for the pharmacological treatment of primary hypertension with information on the target population, BP threshold for treatment initiation, target BP, specific drugs/classes/doses, and follow-up frequency. STPs for adult patients were identified from the websites of relevant health organizations, Google search, and through expert consultations (until July 2023). STPs for secondary, gestational, or malignant hypertension or those that were templates/samples were excluded. Included STPs were critically appraised using the HEARTS in the Americas Checklist for hypertension management in primary care and compared with the 2021 WHO hypertension management guideline recommendations.

- **Results**: Fifty STPs were identified. All STPs had a stepwise treatment approach, involved guideline-recommended first-line drugs, and 98% consisted of at least four steps. The majority (54%) recommended monotherapy with calcium channel blockers as first-line treatment. Only 44% of STPs recommended treatment initiation with combination therapy, and 16% recommended single-pill combinations. Most (62%) had dose-intensification as the second step. Most (74%) STPs did not provide complete dosing information. Only one STP mentioned a target time for achieving BP control.

### How new developments in pharmacology receptor theory are changing (our understanding of) hypertension therapy [^114mSyp3]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Harmonized antihypertensive drugs

In 2022, Whelton et al. published the harmonization of the hypertension guidelines for multiple societies across the world. In this document, four major drug classes were recommended as first-line therapies. These include AT 1 receptor antagonists/blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel antagonists. Of these four major classes, only the AT 1 receptor is a GPCR.

We discuss the primary actions of some of these drugs and the potential "new" pharmacological action of these first-line drugs. This is followed by a discussion of second-line drugs used in the pharmacological treatment of hypertension, many of which target GPCRs. We consulted the publications of leaders in the field, including the drug classes listed below. We also consulted the FDA database (June 2023 accession dates) for lists of drugs in each class that are approved for use in the treatment of hypertension. We do not consider drugs that have been combined in a medication.

For first-line therapy, we will not discuss ACE inhibitors or diuretics since the targets of these drugs and proteins are outside the four recognized receptor subtypes. Nonetheless, a fairly comprehensive list of first and second-line drugs, with both generic and trade names, is included in an internal table not presented here.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as second-line therapy for primary hypertension [^1127jEBr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are one of the more commonly prescribed classes of antihypertensive drugs, both as first-line and second-line therapy.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate, and withdrawals due to adverse effects of beta-blocker therapy when given as a second-line drug in adult patients with primary hypertension.

- **Search strategy**: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966-Aug 2009), EMBASE (1988-Aug 2009), and bibliographic citations of articles and reviews were searched.

- **Selection criteria**: Double-blind, randomized controlled trials comparing a beta-blocker in combination with a drug from another class of antihypertensive drugs to that drug alone for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in patients with primary hypertension were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the trial quality of each included study.

- **Main results**: Twenty double-blind RCTs evaluated the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as a second-line drug in 3,744 hypertensive patients (baseline BP of 158/102 mmHg; mean duration of 7 weeks). The BP reduction from adding a beta-blocker as the second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. A reduction in BP was observed with the addition of a beta-blocker to thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers at doses as low as 0.25 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose. The BP lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as a second drug was 6/4 mmHg.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^113Aiigf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

One clinical trial, the International Verapamil-Trandolapril Study (INVEST), examined a CCB strategy versus a non-CCB strategy for lowering BP in people aged 60 and over with CVD. Both treatment strategies led to more than 70% of patients achieving BP under 140/90 mm Hg within a follow-up period of 24 months. Consequently, all patients were combined for a post-hoc analysis to determine optimal treatment targets. The patients were divided into three groups based on their SBP: Group 1, with SBP less than 140 mm Hg (57%); Group 2, with SBP between 140 and less than 150 mm Hg (21%); and Group 3, with SBP of 150 mm Hg or more (22%). These groups achieved a median SBP of 131, 144, and 158 mm Hg, respectively. A multiple propensity score-adjusted model was developed to account for baseline differences between the groups.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: A World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116oYz48]. Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

In 1978, the World Health Organization (WHO) published one of the earliest clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of arterial hypertension, which were later updated in 1999 and 2003. In 2007, the WHO published some recommendations for the management of hypertension in guidelines for the assessment and management of total cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, these are now outdated considering new evidence and practices. Guidance is particularly needed now on some controversial issues, such as the threshold level of blood pressure (BP) at which to start pharmacological treatment and whether laboratory testing and CVD risk assessment are needed before initiating antihypertensive pharmacological therapy.

In the past decade, the WHO included diagnosis and management of hypertension in a total CVD risk approach as part of the WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (WHO PEN) 2007, 2010, and 2013. However, this approach preceded recent advances in the pharmacological management of hypertension. More recently, the WHO has provided information about the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the Global HEARTS Initiative, including the HEARTS Technical Package and the HEARTS in the Americas Program. However, these too provide general practical information and not specific guidelines and recommendations.

The WHO Essential Medicines List includes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretics for management of hypertension. In June 2019, single-pill combination antihypertensive medications were introduced for more effective management.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management of pulmonary arterial hypertension in the contemporary era: A review [^112Uqy31]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by severe remodeling of the distal pulmonary arteries, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and right ventricular dysfunction that promotes heart failure. Once regarded as largely untreatable, evidence-based decision-making now guides clinical management of PAH and improves outcomes. However, misconceptions regarding the approach to PAH in the modern era are common and associated with substandard clinical care.

- **Observations**: The clinical profile of PAH has changed substantially since its original description. Patients are older at diagnosis than previously reported; disease severity appears greater in men compared to women; and patients with PAH in association with connective tissue disease are identified as a particularly high-risk subgroup. Risk stratification scales for PAH are now available at the point of care, which inform treatment goals, including a 6-minute walk distance of greater than 440 m, peak volume of oxygen consumption of greater than 15 mL/min/kg, right atrial area of less than 18 cm², cardiac index of greater than 2.5 L/min/m², and absent or low symptom burden with routine physical activity.

At present, 14 therapies targeting 6 PAH-specific molecular intermediaries are used clinically. Recent landmark trial data have demonstrated the critical importance of initial combination therapy in treatment-naive patients. These findings underscore a global shift in PAH that couples early disease detection with aggressive pharmacotherapy.

### Development of the European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension: Comparison of the helpfulness of ESH 2013, 2018, and 2023 guidelines [^11698otQ]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

The European Society of Hypertension (ESH) has published several guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension in recent years to aid physicians and patients in making informed decisions regarding specific disease conditions. The latest of these, the ESH 2023 guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension, was published in 2023.

The year 2023 marks the 20th anniversary of the hypertension guidelines of the ESH, first published in 2003. It is evident that guidelines, based on past collected knowledge, are crucial for diagnosis and treatment to prevent or delay the adverse effects of hypertension.

Several studies conducted over the past few decades have demonstrated that clinical practice guidelines for managing cardiovascular diseases include a small percentage, less than 15%, of recommendations supported by Level A evidence. This indicates a lack of multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses providing the highest level of evidence. Furthermore, these studies have shown a steady temporal trend or a slight increase in Level A evidence. Based on a recent study comparing 50 clinical practice guidelines from 2011 to 2022, 16% of the recommendations were supported by the highest quality of evidence, Level A. At the same time, there was a slight global increase in Level A recommendations in recent years.

There are no systematic methods to quantitatively measure the helpfulness or quality of guidelines, specifically how much assistance they provide to physicians. Moreover, previous assessments or methods also pose several questions regarding their effectiveness.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^116Q3AKK]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a common yet under-recognized cause of hypertension. Hypertension is the single greatest cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, affecting more than 1 billion adults worldwide and up to 30% of certain adult populations. While primary hypertension — where no clear cause is identified — accounts for the majority (70–85%) of cases, around 15% to 30% of patients have an identifiable endocrine or renal cause, termed secondary hypertension.

- **Significance and prevalence**: PA is the most common secondary cause of hypertension, with an estimated prevalence between 3.2% and 14% among primary care populations. This prevalence increases to 10% to 20% in the hospital outpatient setting. However, significant challenges exist in screening and diagnosing PA. As a result, estimates of prevalence may be modest in the overall context of the disease. Despite its commonality as a secondary cause of hypertension, PA has not been a key consideration in the design of over 40 randomized control trials investigating hypertension management over the past 30 years.

- **Current challenges**: Screening rates for PA remain low, and clinical recognition is poor. Hypertension guidelines do not emphasize the need to investigate PA in patients presenting with hypertension to their primary care physicians or general internists.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, specifically with respect to office blood pressure measurement, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend testing for orthostatic hypotension. This involves having the patient sit or lie down for five minutes, then measuring blood pressure one and/or three minutes after standing, before starting or intensifying blood pressure-lowering medication.
