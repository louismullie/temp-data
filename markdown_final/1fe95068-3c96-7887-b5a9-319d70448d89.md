## Question

A 7-month-old previously healthy infant is brought to the emergency department with a 2-day history of cough, nasal congestion, and increasing work of breathing. On examination, the infant is tachypneic with mild intercostal retractions, diffuse wheezing, and crackles on auscultation. Oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. A rapid antigen test for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is positive. The resident asks whether nebulized epinephrine should be administered to improve the infant's respiratory status.

Based on current American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, should nebulized epinephrine be used in this infant with RSV bronchiolitis? Justify your answer according to the guideline recommendation.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nebulized epinephrine should be administered to a 7-month-old with RSV bronchiolitis and mild respiratory distress, and how to justify that decision according to current AAP guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnosis and severity classification. Then, I should verify what the AAP guideline actually recommends regarding epinephrine. Next, I will review the highest-quality evidence that informed the guideline. After that, I should consider any exceptions or special scenarios, including combined therapy with steroids. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant plan and state the bottom line clearly with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. This 7-month-old with cough, nasal congestion, tachypnea, mild intercostal retractions, wheezing, crackles, and SpO2 94% on room air fits RSV bronchiolitis of mild-to-moderate severity; the oxygen saturation is above the usual 90% threshold for hypoxemia in infants, so supportive care is appropriate rather than escalation to ICU-level interventions, and routine pharmacologic therapy is not indicated here [^e22d2af6] [^aed4e6d4].

> Wait, let me verify the AAP position on nebulized epinephrine. The AAP bronchiolitis guideline advises against routine use of bronchodilators, including albuterol and epinephrine, because benefits are limited to short-term clinical scores without meaningful reductions in hospitalization or length of stay; this applies to both ED and inpatient settings, and the recommendation is reflected in contemporary summaries and Choosing Wisely materials as well [^a9d248bd] [^aed4e6d4] [^8dd53ab9].

> I should confirm the evidence base that led to this recommendation. High-quality randomized trials and systematic reviews show no consistent reduction in hospitalization or length of stay with epinephrine alone; for example, the NEJM multicenter trial found no advantage of racemic epinephrine over saline for length of stay or readiness for discharge, and a Cochrane review found only transient improvements in clinical scores without durable benefits, with no reduction in admission by day 7 in outpatients and no reduction in length of stay in inpatients [^c327d351] [^1fcf7b4c] [^756178f1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for exceptions. Combined therapy with dexamethasone plus epinephrine has shown a signal for reduced admission in ED settings in one large RCT, but that result lost significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons and is not sufficient to change routine practice; moreover, that trial tested combination therapy, not epinephrine monotherapy, and current guidelines still do not recommend routine epinephrine even as a trial in typical cases, so this does not justify epinephrine alone here [^1d198ce3] [^51877458] [^aed4e6d4].

> Let me consider the practical, guideline-concordant approach. For this infant, I should prioritize supportive care: ensure adequate hydration, gentle nasal suctioning for nasal congestion, and supplemental oxygen if SpO2 falls below about 90% or if there is significant respiratory distress; I should avoid routine bronchodilators, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline in the ED, antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy, and I should document a clear reassessment plan if any trial is considered exceptional circumstances [^aed4e6d4] [^b3a3a7d2] [^82cfd21e] [^8dd53ab9].

> But wait, what if the team is considering a single-dose trial of epinephrine to see if there is a clinical response? I should double-check that nuance. Even where some guidelines allow a one-time trial of a bronchodilator with discontinuation if no benefit is observed, this is not a routine recommendation and should not be conflated with evidence-based benefit; given the lack of sustained benefit and potential for transient tachycardia, a routine trial is not advised in typical RSV bronchiolitis without a compelling individualized rationale and close reassessment [^aed4e6d4] [^756178f1].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the conclusion clearly. No, nebulized epinephrine should not be administered routinely to this 7-month-old with RSV bronchiolitis and mild distress; current AAP guidance recommends supportive care only, as epinephrine does not improve meaningful outcomes like admission or length of stay, and any consideration of pharmacotherapy should be the exception, not the rule, with careful reassessment if tried at all [^a9d248bd] [^aed4e6d4] [^c327d351].

---

Routine nebulized epinephrine is **not recommended** for infants with RSV bronchiolitis, including this 7-month-old, because it does not reduce hospital admissions, length of stay, or time to resolution of symptoms [^c327d351] [^756178f1]. It may cause transient short-term improvement in clinical scores, but this does not translate into meaningful clinical outcomes [^1fcf7b4c]. Current AAP guidelines advise **supportive care only** — oxygen for SpO2 < 90%, hydration, and nasal suctioning — and explicitly discourage routine use of epinephrine or other bronchodilators [^aed4e6d4] [^a9d248bd]. Reserve epinephrine for severe distress refractory to supportive care, and only as a single trial with reassessment.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding nebulized epinephrine

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews have evaluated nebulized epinephrine in bronchiolitis, with **consistent findings**:

- **Short-term benefits**: Transient improvements in clinical scores (e.g. respiratory rate, retractions, wheezing) within 30–60 minutes are observed in some studies, but these effects are not sustained and do not translate into reduced hospital admissions or length of stay [^1fcf7b4c] [^c327d351].

- **Lack of sustained benefit**: No significant reduction in hospital admissions, length of stay, or time to resolution of symptoms has been demonstrated with routine use of nebulized epinephrine [^c327d351] [^756178f1].

- **Comparison with other bronchodilators**: Nebulized epinephrine has not shown superiority over albuterol or placebo in improving clinically meaningful outcomes [^8b1c8b5e] [^7e3df3d2].

---

## Current AAP guidelines and recommendations

The AAP provides **clear guidance** on the management of bronchiolitis, including the use of nebulized epinephrine:

- **Supportive care**: The cornerstone of management includes supportive care measures such as oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygen saturation (typically SpO2 ≥ 90%), hydration maintenance, and nasal suctioning to relieve nasal congestion [^aed4e6d4] [^b3a3a7d2].

- **Routine use discouraged**: The AAP explicitly discourages the routine use of nebulized epinephrine or other bronchodilators in infants with bronchiolitis, including RSV-positive cases, due to lack of proven benefit in clinical outcomes [^aed4e6d4] [^a9d248bd].

- **Exceptional circumstances**: In cases of severe respiratory distress refractory to supportive care, a single trial of nebulized epinephrine may be considered, but clinicians should reassess promptly and discontinue if no significant clinical improvement is observed [^bd66a1a0].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

While nebulized epinephrine is generally considered safe, **potential adverse effects** include:

- **Increased heart rate**: Tachycardia is a common side effect, particularly with repeated dosing [^756178f1].

- **Pallor and tremors**: These effects have been reported, particularly in outpatient settings [^ba80242d].

- **Lack of long-term benefit**: Repeated dosing does not confer sustained clinical improvement and may expose infants to unnecessary interventions and healthcare costs [^1fcf7b4c].

---

## Clinical scenarios where nebulized epinephrine may be considered

Although routine use is discouraged, nebulized epinephrine may be considered in **specific clinical scenarios**:

- **Severe respiratory distress**: Infants with severe bronchiolitis, marked retractions, significant wheezing, or respiratory failure refractory to supportive care may benefit from a single trial of nebulized epinephrine, with prompt reassessment of clinical status [^bd66a1a0].

- **Critical care settings**: In intensive care settings, combination therapy with systemic corticosteroids and nebulized epinephrine has been explored, but evidence remains limited and is not generalizable to routine outpatient or inpatient care [^fc3b20e3].

---

## Alternative evidence-based treatments

The primary management of RSV bronchiolitis remains **supportive care**. Alternative treatments, such as hypertonic saline, have shown mixed results and are not routinely recommended in the emergency department setting. Their use may be considered in hospitalized patients with prolonged stays, but evidence remains limited and inconsistent [^aed4e6d4] [^9615a279].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Routine use of nebulized epinephrine is **not recommended** for infants with RSV bronchiolitis, including the described 7-month-old infant. The evidence does not demonstrate sustained clinical benefit, and current AAP guidelines emphasize supportive care as the standard of care. Nebulized epinephrine may be considered as a single trial in cases of severe respiratory distress refractory to supportive measures, but clinicians should reassess promptly and discontinue if no significant improvement is observed.

### Improving evidence based bronchiolitis care [^f72218be]. Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is the number one cause of hospitalization in infants during the first year of life. Clinical guidelines recommend primarily supportive care and discourage use of pharmacotherapies and diagnostics. However, there continues to be widespread use of non-recommended therapies and variation in the use of therapeutic interventions among hospitals in the United States. Here we review evidence-based management of this common disease in order to optimize resource utilization, decrease healthcare costs, and decrease unnecessary hospitalization. Current evidence does not support the routine use of chest radiographs, viral testing or laboratory evaluation in children with bronchiolitis. In addition, routine administration of bronchodilators, including albuterol and nebulized epinephrine, corticosteroids and hypertonic saline are not recommended for infants and children with bronchiolitis. Intravenous or nasogastric hydration and nutritional support, supplemental oxygen, and respiratory support are recommended. Standardization of bronchiolitis care with evidence based institutional clinical pathways spanning ED to inpatient care can help optimize resource utilization while simultaneously improving care of bronchiolitis and reducing hospital length of stays and costs.

### A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis [^d164db35]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospital admission for respiratory disease among infants aged < 1 year. Clinical practice guidelines can benefit patients by reducing the performance of unnecessary tests, hospital admissions, and treatment with lack of a supportive evidence base. This review aimed to identify current clinical practice guidelines worldwide, appraise their methodological quality, and discuss variability across guidelines for the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis.

Methods

A systematic literature review of electronic databases EMBASE, Global Health, and Medline was performed. Manual searches of the gray literature, national pediatric society websites, and guideline-focused databases were performed, and select international experts were contacted to identify additional guidelines. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation assessment tool was used by 2 independent reviewers to appraise each guideline.

Results

Thirty-two clinical practice guidelines met the selection criteria. Quality assessment revealed significant shortcomings in a number of guidelines, including lack of systematic processes in formulating guidelines, failure to state conflicts of interest, and lack of consultation with families of affected children. There was widespread agreement about a number of aspects, such as avoidance of the use of unnecessary diagnostic tests, risk factors for severe disease, indicators for hospital admission, discharge criteria, and nosocomial infection control. However, there was variability, even within areas of consensus, over specific recommendations, such as variable thresholds for oxygen therapy. Guidelines showed significant variability in recommendations for the pharmacological management of bronchiolitis, with conflicting recommendations over whether use of nebulized epinephrine, hypertonic saline, or bronchodilators should be routinely trialled.

Conclusions

Future guidelines should aim to be compliant with international standards for clinical guidelines to improve their quality and clarity and to promote their adoption into practice. Variable recommendations between guidelines may reflect the evolving evidence base for bronchiolitis management, and platforms should be created to understand this variability and promote evidence-based recommendations.

### Treating acute bronchiolitis associated with RSV [^e36f8a69]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment for infants with bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) includes supplemental oxygen, nasal suctioning, fluids to prevent dehydration, and other supportive therapies. High-risk children who should be hospitalized include those younger than three months and those with a preterm birth, cardiopulmonary disease, immunodeficiency, respiratory distress, or inadequate oxygenation. Inhaled beta2-agonist bronchodilators, the anticholinergic agent ipratropium bromide, and nebulized epinephrine have not been shown to be effective for treating RSV bronchiolitis. However, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality states that nebulized epinephrine and nebulized ipratropium bromide are possibly effective. The appropriate use of corticosteroids remains controversial. They may provide some benefit but meta-analyses of clinical trial results are inconsistent. Prophylaxis with RSV intravenous immune globulin or palivizumab, a human monoclonal antibody, can reduce hospitalization rates in high-risk patients, although difficulties with administering the medications and high costs may preclude their widespread use. The use of common infection-control measures can reduce nosocomial transmission of RSV infections.

7 TREATMENT

Substantial knowledge gaps and controversies exist in the management of acute bronchiolitis. Most guidelines recommend primarily supportive treatment, that is, oxygen, nasal suctioning, mechanical ventilation, and hydration. 67 High flow oxygen therapy using nasal cannula has shown promising results. 68 There is conflicting information across clinical guidelines about the role of nebulized hypertonic saline in acute management of bronchiolitis. Only a few current guidelines recommend bronchodilators. 2 Overall, corticosteroids (see details below), nebulized epinephrine, or antibiotics are not recommended. 2 Because of the current frustration with the existing treatment modalities (high use of bronchodilators, antibiotics, and corticosteroids) and as the majority of the previous trials have not been based on virus‐specific data, is further research required in order to direct focus to more personalized management plans in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. 69

7.1 Treatment for RSV

Palivizumab: Immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the RSV F glycoprotein, decreases the risk of hospitalization due to severe RSV illness among preterm infants (72% reduction), those with chronic lung disease (65% reduction), and hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (53% reduction). 60 Interestingly, palivizumab has effectively reduced recurrent wheezing following hospitalization due to RSV, but not asthma. 70

Ribavirin: Convincing data supporting ribavirin treatment for severe RSV infection are lacking, and its toxicity remains a concern. Therefore, ribavirin is not recommended in the current U.S. guidelines. 71

New treatments: There are currently approximately 28 RSV vaccines and antibodies in preclinical development and another 17 in clinical development. 59, 60 Several new molecules have been identified for the treatment of RSV infection and are currently in (advanced) preclinical or clinical development. 72, 73

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^bd66a1a0]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric respiratory distress (bronchiolitis) — medication and IV guidance indicate that nebulized epinephrine 5 mg (5 mL of 1 mg/mL solution) should be administered to children in severe respiratory distress if other treatments fail to result in clinical improvement, with reassessment and escalation of airway management if no improvement; IVs should only be placed for dehydration concerns or IV medications and otherwise are not routinely needed; and steroids are not efficacious and should not be given.

### Glucocorticoids for acute viral bronchiolitis in infants and young children [^51877458]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are glucocorticoids, alone or combined with bronchodilators, associated with reduced admission rates, length of stay, or improvements in clinical severity scores without increased adverse effects in infants and young children with acute viral bronchiolitis?

Bottom Line

There is no consistent clinically relevant association of single therapy with systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids and improved outcomes in either outpatient or inpatient settings. Exploratory evidence suggests that combined glucocorticoids and nebulized epinephrine may be associated with lower hospitalization rates in outpatients, but these findings must be interpreted cautiously.

### Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis: rapid evidence review [^aed4e6d4]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in young children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of bronchiolitis. RSV is spread through respiratory droplets, and the number of cases varies with season. For most patients, standard precautions (e.g., hand hygiene, surface cleaning, avoiding contact with sick individuals) are recommended. However, prophylaxis with palivizumab may be considered for infants at high risk. Initial symptoms occur after an incubation period of four to six days and include rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing, and fever. Signs of lower respiratory tract involvement may follow and include cough, tachypnea, retractions, difficulty feeding, and accessory muscle use. Diagnosis is typically clinical; routine use of radiography or viral testing is not recommended. Treatment of RSV bronchiolitis is mainly supportive. Oxygen saturation should be maintained above 90%. Hydration and nutrition should be maintained by nasogastric or intravenous routes, if needed. Therapies such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, nebulized hypertonic saline, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy are not recommended. Although most episodes of RSV bronchiolitis are self-limited, some children have an increased risk of asthma later in life.

### Bronchiolitis: from practice guideline to clinical practice [^692f720c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics' clinical practice guideline in bronchiolitis was last updated in 2014 with recommendations to improve care for pediatric patients with bronchiolitis. As most treatments of bronchiolitis are supportive, the guideline minimizes the breadth of treatments previously used and cautions the use of tests and therapies that have a limited evidence base. Emergency physicians must be familiar with the guidelines in order to apply best practices appropriately.

---

### Current therapy for bronchiolitis [^d923f76f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is a common, self-limiting, seasonal viral respiratory tract infection in infancy accounting for the majority of hospital admissions in this age group. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment, concentrating on fluid replacement, gentle suctioning of nasal secretions, prone position (if in hospital), oxygen therapy and respiratory support if necessary. There is a long history of pharmacological agents offering no benefit in acute bronchiolitis. More recently, nebulised epinephrine has been demonstrated to offer short term benefits, while two stratagems have shown promise in decreasing risk of hospitalisation and length of hospital stay. The combination of oral dexamethasone with nebulised epinephrine potentially decreases the need for hospitalisation, while nebulised 3% hypertonic saline mixed with a bronchodilator decreases the length of hospitalisation. Although both stratagems appear safe and well tolerated, their role in clinical practice remains unclear.

### A randomized, controlled trial of the effectiveness of nebulized therapy with epinephrine compared with albuterol and saline in infants hospitalized for acute viral bronchiolitis [^8b1c8b5e]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

In previously well infants hospitalized with acute viral bronchiolitis, the effectiveness of repeated nebulized therapy with epinephrine (EPI) was compared with treatment with albuterol (ALB) or saline placebo (PLAC).

Study Design

In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial, infants received study nebulizations every 1 to 6 hours and were assessed twice daily by the research team. The primary outcome was length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes included the time from admission until the infant had normal hydration, oxygenation, and minimal respiratory distress.

Results

A total of 149 infants were randomized; 50 were allocated to receive racemic EPI, 51 were given ALB, and 48 received PLAC. Baseline characteristics and pre-enrollment symptoms, signs, and therapy were similar between groups. There were no group differences in the primary outcome measure, mean LOS (hours)(± SD): EPI = 59.8 (62), ALB = 61.4 (54), and PLAC = 63.3 (47); P = 0.95 by intent-to-treat analysis. Group differences were not statistically significant in any of the secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

There were no group differences in the effectiveness of therapy for infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Based on these results, we do not recommend routine use of either nebulized EPI or ALB in this patient group.

### Epinephrine and dexamethasone in children with bronchiolitis [^1d198ce3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although numerous studies have explored the benefit of using nebulized epinephrine or corticosteroids alone to treat infants with bronchiolitis, the effectiveness of combining these medications is not well established.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 800 infants (6 weeks to 12 months of age) with bronchiolitis who were seen in the pediatric emergency department were randomly assigned to one of four study groups. One group received two treatments of nebulized epinephrine (3 mL of epinephrine in a 1:1000 solution per treatment) and a total of six oral doses of dexamethasone (1.0 mg per kilogram of body weight in the emergency department and 0.6 mg per kilogram for an additional 5 days) (the epinephrine-dexamethasone group), the second group received nebulized epinephrine and oral placebo (the epinephrine group), the third received nebulized placebo and oral dexamethasone (the dexamethasone group), and the fourth received nebulized placebo and oral placebo (the placebo group). The primary outcome was hospital admission within 7 days after the day of enrollment (the initial visit to the emergency department).

Results

Baseline clinical characteristics were similar among the four groups. By the seventh day, 34 infants (17.1%) in the epinephrine-dexamethasone group, 47 (23.7%) in the epinephrine group, 51 (25.6%) in the dexamethasone group, and 53 (26.4%) in the placebo group had been admitted to the hospital. In the unadjusted analysis, only the infants in the epinephrine-dexamethasone group were significantly less likely than those in the placebo group to be admitted by day 7 (relative risk, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.95, P = 0.02). However, with adjustment for multiple comparisons, this result was rendered insignificant (P = 0.07). There were no serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Among infants with bronchiolitis treated in the emergency department, combined therapy with dexamethasone and epinephrine may significantly reduce hospital admissions. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN56745572.)

### Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in children [^1ada4984]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of this infection. RSV is transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets either directly from an infected person or self-inoculation by contaminated secretions on surfaces. Patients with RSV bronchiolitis usually present with two to four days of upper respiratory tract symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, and congestion, followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms such as increasing cough, wheezing, and increased respiratory effort. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated its clinical practice guideline for diagnosis and management of RSV bronchiolitis to minimize unnecessary diagnostic testing and interventions. Bronchiolitis remains a clinical diagnosis, and diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended. Treatment of RSV infection is mainly supportive, and modalities such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, and antibiotics are generally not useful. Evidence supports using supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation; however, continuous pulse oximetry is no longer required. The other mainstay of therapy is intravenous or nasogastric administration of fluids for infants who cannot maintain their hydration status with oral fluid intake. Educating parents on reducing the risk of infection is one of the most important things a physician can do to help prevent RSV infection, especially early in life. Children at risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection should receive immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in up to five monthly doses. Prophylaxis guidelines are restricted to infants born before 29 weeks' gestation, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and infants and children with hemodynamically significant heart disease.

### Acute bronchiolitis and croup [^579c2f5a]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Croup and acute bronchiolitis are common forms of virally induced respiratory disease in infancy and early childhood. There is good evidence that corticosteroids can ameliorate disease severity and alter the natural history of symptoms in patients who have croup and that temporary symptomatic benefit can be obtained from the use of nebulized adrenaline. The principle weakness when reviewing therapeutic interventions for acute bronchiolitis is the lack of a clear diagnostic test or definition. Current evidence suggests that oxygen is the only useful pharmacologic agent for correcting hypoxia.

### Bronchiolitis: evidence-based management in high-risk infants in the intensive care setting [^a857cb8e]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of various agents in the management of this condition. These include the use of corticosteroids, inhaled beta-agonists, epinephrine, hypertonic saline, in addition to others, however, at present there is no single definitive treatment available for bronchiolitis. In turn, various guidelines have been developed for the management of bronchiolitis in low-risk patients. – These serve as a guide for management; however, recommended treatments remain essentially supportive with emphasis placed on ensuring adequate hydration and oxygen supplementation as needed. Despite evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of bronchiolitis, wide variations in practice remain, including marked variability in the inpatient management of bronchiolitis across different sites.

The aim of the present study was to systematically identify and characterise the current body of evidence available on the management options for patients with severe bronchiolitis who required escalation of treatment to a PICU setting. The systematic search was conducted to identify any potential gaps in the current literature pertaining to the management of this patient population.

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of nebulized epinephrine in infants with acute bronchiolitis [^756178f1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

The treatment of infants with bronchiolitis is largely supportive. The role of bronchodilators is controversial. Most studies of the use of bronchodilators have enrolled small numbers of subjects and have examined only short-term outcomes, such as clinical scores.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing nebulized single-isomer epinephrine with placebo in 194 infants admitted to four hospitals in Queens-land, Australia, with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Three 4-ml doses of 1 percent nebulized epinephrine or three 4-ml doses of normal saline were administered at four-hour intervals after hospital admission. Observations were made at admission and just before, 30 minutes after, and 60 minutes after each dose. The primary outcome measures were the length of the hospital stay and the time until the infant was ready for discharge. The secondary outcome measures were the degree of change in the respiratory rate, the heart rate, and the respiratory-effort score and the time that supplemental oxygen was required.

Results

There were no significant overall differences between the groups in the length of the hospital stay (P = 0.16) or the time until the infant was ready for discharge (P = 0.86). Among infants who required supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids, the time until the infant was ready for discharge was significantly longer in the epinephrine group than in the placebo group (P = 0.02). The need for supplemental oxygen at admission had the greatest influence on the score for severity of illness and strongly predicted the length of the hospital stay and the time until the infant was ready for discharge (P < 0.001). There were no significant changes in the respiratory rate, blood pressure, or respiratory-effort scores from before each treatment to after each treatment. The heart rate was significantly increased after each treatment with epinephrine (P = 0.02 to P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The use of nebulized epinephrine did not significantly reduce the length of the hospital stay or the time until the infant was ready for discharge among infants admitted to the hospital with bronchiolitis.

### Efficacy of nebulized epinephrine versus salbutamol in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis [^77139957]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2001). Low credibility.

We enrolled 30 infants (median age 3 months, range 1–12 months), hospitalized for bronchiolitis in a randomized double-blind trial, to examine the efficacy and safety of nebulized epinephrine compared to salbutamol. Once admitted, patients were treated with either nebulized 0.5 mg of an 0.1% epinephrine solution (0.5 mL in 3.5 mL normal saline (NS)) or 2.5 mg nebulized salbutamol (0.5 mL in 3.5 mL NS). They were evaluated daily before and after nebulization until discharge. The outcome measures used were: baseline clinical score (based on respiratory rate, subcostal retraction, presence of wheezing, and O2 requirement), change in clinical O2 score after nebulization, duration of O2 therapy, and duration of hospitalization. A significant improvement in the clinical score was noted on the first day of hospitalization in subjects receiving epinephrine (P = 0.025); that change was not seen in those on salbutamol (P = 0.6). Nebulized epinephrine decreased the baseline clinical score faster than salbutamol (P = 0.02), though on the fourth study day there was no significant difference between the two scores. On the fourth and fifth days of study there were more patients hospitalized in the salbutamol group than in the epinephrine group (P = 0.03 vs. P = 0.025). No adverse effects were associated with nebulized therapy. We conclude that nebulized epinephrine is a more effective agent than salbutamol in the initial treatment of bronchiolitis and is equally safe.

### Principal findings of systematic reviews for the management of acute bronchiolitis in children [^99648d9e]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization among infants during the first 12 months of life, with high direct and indirect cost for health system and families. Different treatment approaches co-exist worldwide resulting in many drugs prescribed, without any proven benefit. Twenty systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials (SRCTs) on management of acute bronchiolitis in children were retrieved through 5 databases and their methodological quality was determined using an AMSTAR tool. Epinephrine showed impact only in short-term outcomes among outpatients (reduced admission at day 1 and improved the clinical score in the first 2 hours, compared to placebo) and inpatients (decreased length of stay (LOS) and improved saturation only in the first 2 hours, compared to nebulized salbutamol, but with high heterogeneity). Nebulized 3% saline among inpatients (but not in the emergency department setting) decreased hospital LOS. In small trials, exogenous surfactant among children may decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit LOS and had favorable effects on oxygenation and CO2 elimination at 24 hrs. Although several SRCTs are currently available, only few treatments show clinically important improvements. Therefore, it is still difficult to prepare a well-established and accepted guideline for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis.

### Outpatient medications deimplemented by the AAP bronchiolitis guidelines: an umbrella review of meta-analyses [^84c3b542]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2014 AAP Bronchiolitis Guidelines deimplemented or recommended against the routine therapeutic use of albuterol, hypertonic saline, and epinephrine for infants and children presenting in the outpatient setting. Our objective was to perform an umbrella review of all meta-analyses that included outpatient subanalyses or network meta-analyses with medication treatment comparisons to study the clinical benefits of these deimplemented medications in the outpatient (i.e., primary care, urgent care, and emergency department) setting.

Methods

Searches were performed in the databases PubMed and Scopus and the Web search engine Google Scholar on the following three topics: albuterol and bronchiolitis, epinephrine and bronchiolitis, and hypertonic saline and bronchiolitis. Article types were limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses with outpatient subanalyses, with English language and age restrictions. The search strategy was based on the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Studies (PICOS) framework. The studies were uploaded to Rayyan, a Web-based platform for managing articles of systematic reviews. Citation tracking and manual review of references were performed for the included studies. The meta-analyses and network meta-analyses were reviewed for outpatient subanalyses focused on clinical responses and risk of hospital admission.

Results

A total of 6 meta-analyses for albuterol, 4 meta-analyses for epinephrine, and 11 meta-analyses for hypertonic saline were included. Our review identified evidence from predominantly low and moderate evidence meta-analyses (assessed using GRADE and AMSTAR 2) indicating that all three deimplemented medications exhibit one or more therapeutic effects and benefits for infants with the bronchiolitis syndrome in the outpatient setting. Effect sizes ranged from medium to near medium. These clinical benefits include decreased hospital admissions and lower clinical severity scores.

Conclusions

Given the heterogeneity of patients under the umbrella term "acute bronchiolitis" and the potential for some patients to respond clinically to albuterol, hypertonic saline, and epinephrine, current evidence supports conducting therapeutic trials in infants with acute bronchiolitis in outpatient settings. However, further well-designed and adequately powered randomized controlled trials and high-quality meta-analyses are still needed.

### Steroids and bronchodilators for acute bronchiolitis in the first two years of life: systematic review and meta-analysis [^915245f6]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiolitis is the most common disease of the lower respiratory tract during the first year of life. Respiratory syncytial virus is the underlying cause of most bronchiolitis and this infection is associated with substantial morbidity in young children. Ongoing research in bronchiolitis reflects both the burden of disease in developed and developing countries and a lack of clear evidence for its therapeutic management. Previous studies have shown substantial variation in the management of acute bronchiolitis throughout the world, including the use of different bronchodilators (β 2 agonists, adrenaline (epinephrine), anticholinergics) and steroids. Some of this variation may be attributable to varying severity of disease or to different care settings and geographical location.

Several systematic reviews have assessed various treatments, including β 2 agonists and anticholinergics, adrenaline, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, antibiotics, surfactant, ribavirin, and chest physiotherapy. These reviews have failed to provide convincing evidence to support any of these treatments in the acute management of bronchiolitis, and their routine use is not recommended by current clinical practice guidelines. Despite implementation of these guidelines, bronchodilators especially are still frequently used.

### Allergic diseases and the effect of inhaled epinephrine in children with acute bronchiolitis: follow-up from the randomised, controlled, double-blind, bronchiolitis ALL trial [^24dc6cb5]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Although use of inhaled bronchodilators in infants with acute bronchiolitis is not supported by evidence-based guidelines, it is often justified by the belief in a subgroup effect in individuals developing atopic disease. We aimed to assess if inhaled epinephrine during acute bronchiolitis in infancy would benefit patients with later recurrent bronchial obstruction, atopic eczema, or allergic sensitisation.

Methods

In the randomised, double-blind, multicentre Bronchiolitis ALL trial, 404 infants with moderate-to-severe acute bronchiolitis were recruited from eight hospitals in Norway to receive either inhaled epinephrine or saline up to every second hour throughout the hospital stay. Randomisation was done centrally, and the two study medications (20 mg/mL racemic epinephrine or 0.9% saline) were prepared in identical bottles. The dose given depended on the infant's weight: 0.10 mL, less than 5 kg; 0.15 mL, 5–6.9 kg; 0.2 mL, 7–9.9 kg; and 0.25 mL, 10 kg or more; all dissolved in 2 mL of 0.9% saline before nebulisation. The primary outcome was the length of hospital stay. In this follow-up study, 294 children were reinvestigated at 2 years of age with an interview, a clinical examination, and a skin prick test for 17 allergens, determining bronchial obstruction, atopic eczema, and allergic sensitisation, on which subgroup analyses were done. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial has been completed and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00817466) and EUDRACT (number 2009-012667-34).

Findings

Length of stay did not differ between patients who received inhaled epinephrine versus saline in the subgroup of infants who developed recurrent bronchial obstruction by age 2 years (143 [48.6%] of 294 patients; p(interaction) = 0.40). However, the presence of atopic eczema or allergic sensitisation by the age of 2 years (n = 77) significantly interacted with the treatment effect of inhaled epinephrine (p(interaction) = 0.02); the length of stay (mean 80.3 h, 95% CI 72.8–87.9) was significantly shorter in patients receiving inhaled epinephrine versus saline in patients without allergic sensitisation or atopic eczema by 2 years (-19.9 h, -33.1 to -6.3; p = 0.003). No significant differences were found in length of hospital stay in response to epinephrine or saline in children with atopic eczema or allergic sensitisation by 2 years (+16.2 h, -11.0 to 43.3; p = 0.24).

Interpretation

Contrary to our hypothesis, hospital length of stay for bronchiolitis was not reduced by administration of inhaled epinephrine in infants who subsequently developed atopic eczema, allergic sensitisation, or recurrent bronchial obstruction. The present study does not support an individual trial of inhaled epinephrine in acute bronchiolitis in children with increased risk of allergic diseases.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^9693fcf3]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, treatment of bronchiolitis with aerosolised racemic epinephrine over the course of a child's hospital stay was associated with improvement in respiratory symptoms, but did not result in a statistically significant difference in hospital length of stay. Although previous reports have found that nebulized epinephrine results in short-term clinical improvement in bronchiolitis, its effect on duration of hospital stay or need for admission is less clear. Two of four randomised clinical trials in the emergency department setting using 1 to 3 doses of epinephrine have found a difference in admission rate and two have not. It is possible that small reductions in length of stay could be detected by larger trials than those conducted thus far. Our study is only the second in which nebulized racemic epinephrine was provided throughout the hospital admission. Other trials have administered one to three doses spaced on one day only. One might expect that short-term improvement could lead to the clinician's judgement that admission was not necessary. Two of four randomised trials have suggested that length of stay in hospital is abbreviated in children receiving epinephrine. The subgroup of children that might benefit from this therapy is not clear and larger trials will be necessary to identify if and when administrations of nebulized epinephrine during hospitalisation results in patient benefit. Our study supports the thesis that while airway edema may be improved following administration of racemic epinephrine it is not sustained and does not alter the natural history of bronchiolitis in infants. The inflammatory process initiated by RSV or other respiratory viruses is unaffected and mucous secretion and edema recurs after the effect of epinephrine has dissipated.

### Computerized acoustic assessment of treatment efficacy of nebulized epinephrine and albuterol in RSV bronchiolitis [^c085e725]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

In this study we evaluated the feasibility of using computerized quantification of wheezing and crackles and a clinical score in measuring the effect of a single dose of nebulized albuterol or nebulized epinephrine in infants with RSV bronchiolitis. Our hypothesis was that automated quantification of wheezing and crackles is equal or superior to the clinical score in assessing the infants' response to treatment.

### Computerized acoustic assessment of treatment efficacy of nebulized epinephrine and albuterol in RSV bronchiolitis [^2d82eba1]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization for respiratory infection in infants under one year of age. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common etiology of acute bronchiolitis in infants. About 1–2% of infants with bronchiolitis need to be hospitalized and approximately 8% of these children require intensive care. Of high risk patients, such as those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease, about 30% require intensive care.

Treatment for most infants with bronchiolitis is usually supportive, including oxygen, hydration and antipyretics. The use of bronchodilator therapy remains controversial, since the main tool used to measure response (clinical score) is subjective and inaccurate. Thus different studies showed different responses. The one study which used an objective measure (airway resistance) showed improvement in only 30% of infants treated with nebulized salbutamol. Similar variable results were reported when the effect of nebulized epinephrine in RSV Bronchiolitis was studied using clinical scores. Two studies which measured airway resistance were able to demonstrate a significant response to nebulized Epinephrine, which was not apparent by clinical criteria. Thus, objective physiological measurements may be more sensitive and accurate in detecting response to treatment than clinical assessments. The clinical score is a crude instrument for measuring a clinical effect, as it is observer-dependent and may therefore suffer from low objectivity. Pulmonary function tests in infants are objective, but require sedation, which is problematic in acutely ill infants. Wheeze and crackle quantification by lung sounds analysis methods is objective, non invasive and has been shown to correlate with clinical status in asthma and bronchiolitis. The recording procedure is simple, requiring only the attachment of 4 ECG-size sensors to the chest wall. A 30-second recording is often adequate, but recording time can be extended as necessary, to obtain good quality data, where wheezes and crackles are detected and counted with high degree of accuracy. The recording is, however, susceptible to outside noise interference, and requires a relatively quiet environment during the recording. In addition, the outside-noise elimination algorithm helps in eliminating outside noise from the recording. The instrument is currently expensive, but has the potential of both size and price reduction.

### Computerized acoustic assessment of treatment efficacy of nebulized epinephrine and albuterol in RSV bronchiolitis [^efad0b27]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Computerized lung sound analysis is feasible in young infants with RSV bronchiolitis and provides a non-invasive, quantitative measure of wheezing and crackles. In a pilot study using computerized lung sound analysis, we could not demonstrate any significant overall short-term effect of either nebulized epinephrine or albuterol, nor a difference between them.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^572edd56]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis accounts for up to 60% of all lower respiratory tract illness in the first year of life and up to 32% of hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract illness in this age group. The incidence of hospitalisation for bronchiolitis in infancy has increased in both the United States and Canada in the last two decades, and a 100% increase in first time hospitalisation for lower respiratory tract illness in children under two years has been noted in northern Europe.

Bronchiolitis is characterized by tachypnea and wheezing due to obstruction of small airways, and therefore treatment has often included use of beta and alpha agonists delivered by aerosol in addition to supportive care. A systematic review of randomised clinical trials of the efficacy of beta-agonist aerosols suggests they offer only modest short term improvement. Alpha agonist stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system would be expected to reduce capillary leakage by constricting precapillary arterioles, reducing hydrostatic pressure and consequently bronchial mucosal edema. Since Wohl and Chernick first suggested this intervention in 1978, multiple studies and systematic reviews have been published. While there is evidence that acute symptoms of bronchiolitis measured in the short term may improve with epinephrine, these reviews have called for more studies assessing longer-term outcomes such as duration of stay, and that are clinically relevant to parents, clinicians and the health care system.

We report a randomised controlled trial of aerosolised epinephrine compared to salbutamol throughout hospital stay in infants with bronchiolitis to assess daily clinical improvement (respiratory distress, feeding), length of hospital stay and adverse events, and outcomes by parental report one week after discharge to the community.

### The effect of nebulized epinephrine on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in bronchiolitis [^bf97b24e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Nebulized epinephrine has been advocated as a treatment for airway obstruction in infants with bronchiolitis; however, its effect on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange has been poorly documented to date. We performed a preinterventional and postinterventional study with primary outcome measures of mechanics (measured by single-breath occlusion passive deflation) and oxygenation and ventilation indices in order to measure the effects of nebulized epinephrine in infants requiring mechanical ventilation for RSV-positive bronchiolitis. A two-compartment model was used to describe respiratory mechanics in patients with nonlinear flow-volume curves. Nebulized epinephrine (0.5 mg/kg) was administered to 15 patients (median age, 0.19 yr; weight, 4.4 kg). Resistance decreased significantly in slow and fast compartments in 87 and 70% of patients, respectively. Median resistance in the slow compartment decreased from 0.427 to 0.198 cm H2O/ml/s (p = 0.0015) and in the fast compartment from 0.167 to 0.116 cm H2O/ ml/s (p = 0.018). Compliance, oxygenation index, and ventilation index were not significantly changed after administration of epinephrine. We conclude that nebulized epinephrine substantially improves respiratory system resistance but not oxygenation or ventilation indices. This may be because of the effects of epinephrine on oxygen consumption or ventilation-perfusion matching.

### Effectiveness of targeted interventions on treatment of infants with bronchiolitis: a randomized clinical trial [^891bae9b]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Primary Outcome

Compliance with the Australasian Bronchiolitis Guideline recommendations during the acute care period (first 24 hours of hospitalization) with no use of CR, albuterol, glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and epinephrine occurred in 1631 infants (85.1%; 95% CI, 82.6%-89.7%) in the intervention group and 1321 infants (73.0%; 95% CI, 65.3%-78.8%) in the control group (adjusted RD for baseline stratification factors, 14.1%; 95% CI, 6.5%-21.7%, P < .001; ICC, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06–0.19). Adjusting for risk factors for bronchiolitis admission, sensitivity analyses at cluster level, and excluding 2 hospitals without data on infants with an ED length of stay less than 3 hours made no statistical difference to results. Sensitivity analysis for missing data was not undertaken as the 10% threshold was not reached (Table 3).

### Bronchiolitis: recent evidence on diagnosis and management [^3617c678]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Viral bronchiolitis is a leading cause of acute illness and hospitalization of young children. Research into the variation in treatment and outcomes for bronchiolitis across different settings has led to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Ongoing investigation continues to expand this body of evidence. Authors of recent surveillance studies have defined the presence of coinfections with multiple viruses in some cases of bronchiolitis. Underlying comorbidities and young age remain the most important predictors for severe bronchiolitis. Pulse oximetry plays an important role in driving use of health care resources. Evidence-based reviews have suggested a limited role for diagnostic laboratory or radiographic tests in typical cases of bronchiolitis. Several large, recent trials have revealed a lack of efficacy for routine use of either bronchodilators or corticosteroids for treatment of bronchiolitis. Preliminary evidence suggests a potential future role for a combination of these therapies and other novel treatments such as nebulized hypertonic saline.

### Nebulized 5% or 3% hypertonic or 0.9% saline for treating acute bronchiolitis in infants [^4ee525dc]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of 5%, 3%, and 0.9% saline solution for treating acute bronchiolitis in the prehospital setting.

Study Design

This was a double-blind trial including consecutive infants aged < 18 months treated in an urban urgent care setting. A total of 165 patients were randomized to receive nebulized 5%, 3%, or 0.9% (normal) saline with epinephrine every 4 hours. The primary efficacy outcome was bronchiolitis severity score improvement at 48 hours (chi2 analysis). Scores and oxygen saturation immediately before and after each treatment were recorded to assess safety.

Results

A total of 187 previously healthy infants (median age, 3.1 months) diagnosed with bronchiolitis were enrolled. Positivity for respiratory syncytial virus was similar in the 3 treatment groups (mean, 56%). At 48 hours, the mean severity score for the 5% saline group was 3.69 ± 1.09, and that for the 0.9% saline group was 4.12 ± 1.11 (P = 0.04; difference, 0.43, 95% confidence interval for the difference, 0.02–0.88). The mean severity score for the 3% saline group was intermediate at 4.00 ± 1.22. Revisit rates after discharge were similar in the 3 treatment groups. No adverse reactions or other safety concerns were identified.

Conclusions

Nebulization with 5% hypertonic saline is safe, can be widely generalizable, and may be superior to current treatment for early outpatient treatment of bronchiolitis.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of albuterol and epinephrine at equipotent β-2 agonist doses in acute bronchiolitis [^7e3df3d2]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2005). Low credibility.

Our objective was to determine if nebulized racemic epinephrine is more efficacious than nebulized albuterol or saline placebo in the treatment of bronchiolitis in the outpatient setting when dosing is equivalent in terms of beta-2 agonist potency. Sixty-five patients between ages 6 weeks and 24 months with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, defined as first-time wheezing, upper respiratory symptoms and/or fever, and a Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument score of at least 4, were randomized to receive 5 mg nebulized albuterol, 5 mg nebulized racemic epinephrine, or an equivalent volume of placebo at 0, 30, and 60 min. The primary outcome measure was need for hospital admission or home oxygen. Secondary outcome measures were changes in clinical scores and oxygen saturations. There were no significant statistical differences between groups in terms of need for hospital admission or outpatient management with home oxygen therapy. There were no differences between groups in terms of changes in clinical scores or oxygen saturations. Racemic epinephrine and albuterol at equivalent doses had no effect on the need for hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in bronchiolitis in the outpatient setting compared to nebulized saline placebo, though this study may have missed less dramatic clinical effects due to small sample size.

### Computerized acoustic assessment of treatment efficacy of nebulized epinephrine and albuterol in RSV bronchiolitis [^9ba44155]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

This pilot study evaluated the use of computerized wheeze and crackle quantification in assessing the acute response to either nebulized albuterol or epinephrine in infants with RSV-positive bronchiolitis. Although RSV Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization for respiratory infection in infants, its therapy remains controversial. Therefore, objective measures for assessing response to treatment in RSV bronchiolitis are needed. Modern computerized acoustic lung sounds analysis technology now allow on-line quantification of wheezing and crackles, providing another objective tool for assessment of disease activity in infants with bronchiolitis. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of performing accurate objective acoustic measurements in assessing acute respiratory symptoms in young infants and the changes that occur with treatment. Further studies are needed to clarify its potential role as a clinical tool for assessing and following infants with acute respiratory illnesses.

The possible effectiveness of nebulized epinephrine for bronchiolitis, by reducing airway edema, was proposed 25 years ago by Wohl and Chernick. Since then, many studies have evaluated the effect of nebulized epinephrine vs. albuterol and/or placebo in infants with bronchiolitis. While some reported an improved effect of epinephrine, others showed no, or even deleterious, effect. Overall, it is difficult to compare the various studies, due to their different dose schedules, populations and outcome measures. The recent Cochrane Review on the use of bronchodilators in bronchiolitis concluded that there is no strong evidence for their benefit, either short or long term. Similar to these previous RSV studies, our study indicates that there is no significant overall difference in the short-term effect of nebulized epinephrine compared to albuterol in these infants, when assessed by both objective acoustic analysis of wheezing and crackles and a combined clinical score. However, minor differences in heart and respiratory rates in favour of epinephrine were found, the clinical significance of which is uncertain.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^d0e3ca36]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infancy, and hospital admission rates appear to be increasing in Canada and the United States. Inhaled beta agonists offer only modest short-term improvement. Trials of racemic epinephrine have shown conflicting results. We sought to determine if administration of racemic epinephrine during hospital stay for bronchiolitis improved respiratory distress, was safe, and shortened length of stay.

Methods

The study was a randomized, double-blind controlled trial of aerosolized racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol every one to 4 hours in previously well children aged 6 weeks to ≤ 2 years of age hospitalized with bronchiolitis. The primary outcome was symptom improvement as measured by the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI); secondary outcomes were length of stay in hospital, adverse events, and report of symptoms by structured parental telephone interview one week after discharge.

Results

62 children with a mean age of 6.4 months were enrolled; 80% of children had Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Racemic epinephrine resulted in significant improvement in wheezing and the total RDAI score on day 2 and over the entire stay (p < 0.05). The mean LOS in the epinephrine arm was 2.6 days (95% CI 2, 3.2) v. 3.4 days in those in the salbutamol group (95% CI 2.6, 4.2) (p > 0.05). Adverse events were not significantly different in the two arms. At one week post-discharge, over half of parents reported that their child still had a respiratory symptom and 40% had less than normal feeding.

Conclusion

Racemic epinephrine relieves respiratory distress in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis and is safe but does not abbreviate hospital stay. Morbidity associated with bronchiolitis as identified by parents persists for at least one week after hospital discharge in most infants.

### Pragmatic randomized trial of corticosteroids and inhaled epinephrine for bronchiolitis in children in intensive care [^fc3b20e3]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the combination of systemic corticosteroids and nebulized epinephrine, compared with standard care, reduces the duration of positive pressure support in children with bronchiolitis admitted to intensive care.

Study Design

We performed a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial between July 2013 and November 2019 in children younger than 18 months old with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. The intervention group received the equivalent of 13 mg/kg prednisolone over 3 days, then 1 mg/kg daily for 3 days, plus 0.05 mL/kg of nebulized 1% epinephrine made up to 6 mL with 0.9% saline via jet nebulizer and mask using oxygen at 12 l/min every 30 minutes for 5 doses, then 1–4 hourly for 3 days, then as required for 3 days. The primary outcome was clinician-managed duration of positive pressure support in intensive care defined as high-flow nasal-prong oxygen, nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure, or mechanical ventilation.

Results

In total, 210 children received positive pressure support. In the corticosteroid-epinephrine group, 107 children received positive pressure support for a geometric mean of 26 (95% CI, 22–32) hours compared with 40 (95% CI 34–47) hours in 103 controls, adjusted ratio 0.66 (95% CI 0.51–0.84), P = 0.001. In the intervention group, 41 (38%) children experienced at least 1 adverse event, compared with 39 (38%) in the control group.

Conclusions

In children with severe bronchiolitis, the duration of clinician-managed pressure support was reduced by regular treatment with systemic corticosteroids and inhaled epinephrine compared with standard care.

### New approaches to respiratory infections in children. bronchiolitis and croup [^81a0c7a2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Croup is a disease that is commonly seen in children younger than the age of 6 years. The cause is viral, with parainfluenza viruses and RSV being the two most common pathogens. Treatment consists primarily of supportive care, and parents usually have tried humidification and cool air exposure before the child presents to the ED. Children with moderate to severe croup are usually seen in the ED. The use of steroids in an oral preparation results in a clinical improvement of outpatients with mild to moderate croup and reduces the need for hospitalization. The dosage range for oral dexamethasone is 0.15 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg. Nebulized budesonide may also be used. Racemic or L-epinephrine, both of which are equally effective, can be used for symptomatic treatment in severe croup. After administration of racemic or L-epinephrine, hospitalization is not automatic and patients can be discharged safely from the ED after a 3-hour of observation period. There should be no respiratory distress, and the patient should have access to follow-up and emergency care if needed.

### Treatment for acute bronchiolitis before and after implementation of new national guidelines: a retrospective observational study from primary and secondary care in oslo, Norway [^e9306205]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

What is known about the subject?

Treatment guidelines for acute bronchiolitis no longer recommend the use of nebulised epinephrine.
Guidelines, often made by hospital specialists for hospital care, are often perceived not to fit the primary care population.

What this study adds?

The successful implementation of a new treatment guideline for acute bronchiolitis reduced the use of nebulised epinephrine both in primary and secondary care.
An inverse rise in the use of nebulised saline was seen in both settings, though not specifically recommended.
Use of antibiotics remained low.

### Comparative efficacy of bronchiolitis interventions in acute care: a network meta-analysis [^39a7dcaf]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Uncertainty exists as to which treatments are most effective for bronchiolitis, with considerable practice variation within and across health care sites.

Objective

A network meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of common treatments for bronchiolitis in children aged ≤ 2 years.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched from inception to September 1, 2019.

Study Selection

A total 150 randomized controlled trials comparing a placebo or active comparator with any bronchodilator, glucocorticoid steroid, hypertonic saline solution, antibiotic, helium-oxygen therapy, or high-flow oxygen therapy were included.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and independently verified. Primary outcomes were admission rate on day 1 and by day 7 and hospital length of stay. Strength of evidence was assessed by using Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis.

Results

Nebulized epinephrine (odds ratio: 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44 to 0.93, low confidence) and nebulized hypertonic saline plus salbutamol (odds ratio: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.84, low confidence) reduced the admission rate on day 1. No treatment significantly reduced the admission rate on day 7. Nebulized hypertonic saline (mean difference: -0.64 days, 95% CI: -1.01 to -0.26, low confidence) and nebulized hypertonic saline plus epinephrine (mean difference: -0.91 days, 95% CI: -1.14 to -0.40, low confidence) reduced hospital length of stay.

Limitations

Because we did not report adverse events in this analysis, we cannot make inferences about the safety of these treatments.

Conclusions

Although hypertonic saline alone, or combined with epinephrine, may reduce an infant's stay in the hospital, poor strength of evidence necessitates additional rigorous trials.

### Application of the 2023 Italian guidelines for respiratory support management in acute viral bronchiolitis: a retrospective study [^1a329806]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute viral bronchiolitis represents one of the most important health burdens in the paediatric population with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the primary causative agent. Estimates suggest that, worldwide, there are approximately 34 million new cases of lower respiratory tract infections due to RSV in children under 5 years of age, resulting in 3.4 million hospitalisations and around 199 000 deaths annually, predominantly in developing countries. The incidence of bronchiolitis is also high in developed countries. Indeed, bronchiolitis is the leading cause of respiratory failure in children under 12 months of age, accounting for up to 100 000 hospital admissions per year in the USA. Although hospitalisation rates have decreased, emergency department visits, mechanical ventilation usage and hospital expenditures have increased.

To date, there is no curative treatment. Indeed, published meta-analyses indicate that pharmacological therapies (corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, epinephrine and bronchodilators) are not associated with a reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Therefore, supportive therapy remains the cornerstone of management. Management outside the ICU includes monitoring vital signs, nasal saline washes with superficial suctioning, adequate hydration and low-flow oxygen therapy (LFO).

Recently, the administration of high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulas (high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC)) has gained interest. This method of oxygen delivery emerged approximately 20 years ago, initially in the neonatal ICU, and later in paediatric units and during interhospital transfer.HFNC delivers a heated and humidified gas mixture (air and oxygen), with variable flow intensity (generally 1–2 L/kg/min) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) to meet the patient's demand. HFNC has several physiological effects, including a decrease in airway resistance, the generation of a flow-dependent distending pressure and a washout of dead space. Based on a consistent international literature, together with its easy use and safety, HFNC has also expanded outside the ICU, becoming a common treatment in paediatric emergency departments and general paediatrics.

### Computerized acoustic assessment of treatment efficacy of nebulized epinephrine and albuterol in RSV bronchiolitis [^f1f0e216]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

We evaluated the use of computerized quantification of wheezing and crackles compared to a clinical score in assessing the effect of inhaled albuterol or inhaled epinephrine in infants with RSV bronchiolitis.

Methods

Computerized lung sounds analysis with quantification of wheezing and crackles and a clinical score were used during a double blind, randomized, controlled nebulized treatment pilot study. Infants were randomized to receive a single dose of 1 mgr nebulized l-epinephrine or 2.5 mgr nebulized albuterol. Computerized quantification of wheezing and crackles (PulmoTrack ®) and a clinical score were performed prior to, 10 minutes post and 30 minutes post treatment. Results were analyzed with Student's t-test for independent samples, Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test.

Results

15 children received albuterol, 12 received epinephrine. The groups were identical at baseline. Satisfactory lung sounds recording and analysis was achieved in all subjects. There was no significant change in objective quantification of wheezes and crackles or in the total clinical scores either within the groups or between the groups. There was also no difference in oxygen saturation and respiratory distress.

Conclusion

Computerized lung sound analysis is feasible in young infants with RSV bronchiolitis and provides a non-invasive, quantitative measure of wheezing and crackles in these infants.

Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00361452

### Computerized acoustic assessment of treatment efficacy of nebulized epinephrine and albuterol in RSV bronchiolitis [^1643d229]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

The study was approved by the Rambam Hospital Ethics Committee. Subjects were recruited from infants treated at the emergency department with proven RSV bronchiolitis over a four-month period. Eligible infants complied with the following: 1) Age 2–12 months; 2) First episode of respiratory distress; 3) RSV antigen detected in oropharyngeal secretions by ELISA; 4) Informed consent signed by parents. Infants younger than 2 months and those with chronic lung disease, cardiac disease or other chronic conditions were excluded.

Study design

Computerized lung sounds recording and analysis with algorithms for wheeze and crackles counts (see below) and a Clinical Score were performed during a double blind, randomized, comparative study, comparing nebulized salbutamol (2.5 mg diluted with 2.5 mL of 0.9% saline) to nebulized l-epinephrine (1 mg diluted with 2 mL of 0.9% saline). Solutions were driven by compressed oxygen of 5 l/min flow (giving a mean output of 0.4 ml/min), and nebulized using a Hudson Up-Draft II nebulizer (Hudson RCI, Temecula, CA, USA). Medication was randomized prior to commencement of the study by the hospital pharmacy independently of trial staff. Randomization was in blocks of 10 (5 salbutamol/5 epinephrine). The two solutions, provided in identical containers, were indistinguishable to the researchers.

Clinical Assessment

Clinical assessment was done prior to treatment, 10 minutes post and 30 minutes post treatment. At each point a total clinical score was given (Table 1). The total clinical score, modified from Wang et al. was comprised of the following parameters: wheezing, retractions, O 2 saturation, respiratory rate and heart rate. A score from 0 to 3 was given to each parameter (maximal total score – 15 – indicated severely ill infants). All clinical assessments and scores in all patients were performed by the same investigator for consistency.

### Treatment for acute bronchiolitis before and after implementation of new national guidelines: a retrospective observational study from primary and secondary care in oslo, Norway [^c471c84e]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiolitis is an acute viral lower respiratory tract infection affecting infants below 1 year of age. Multiple treatment options have been recommended and used throughout different regions and time periods, including nebulised beta-2-agonists, nebulised racemic epinephrine, systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics and nebulised hypertonic saline. Mecklin et al showed that all of these options were used in infants below 12 months of age with bronchiolitis between 2000 and 2015 in Tampere, Finland, with an increasing use of nebulised hypertonic saline. In 2013, nebulised racemic epinephrine was removed from the Norwegian national acute bronchiolitis treatment guidelinesas a consequence of the Bronchiolitis All-Study SE Norway that found no difference in patient outcomes in children given nebulised racemic epinephrine versus children given nebulised saline. In general, recently published guidelines from different regions recommend supportive care only and a minimal handling strategy in the treatment for acute bronchiolitis patients.

Adherence to clinical guidelines in general practice has room for improvements. One plausible explanation is that guidelines are often made by secondary care specialists for specific conditions that do not necessarily fit the primary care population. The Norwegian guidelines for acute bronchiolitis are made by paediatricians for secondary care, but parts of the guidelines have been used also in Norwegian primary care. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have compared how the same changes in a clinical guideline have been implemented in both primary and secondary care.

Aims

The primary aim of the study was to determine whether the new national treatment guidelines for acute bronchiolitis in Norway, published in 2013, were implemented in primary and secondary care. Secondary aims were to compare the difference in management of acute bronchiolitis patients in primary and secondary care between 2009 and 2017.

### Computerized acoustic assessment of treatment efficacy of nebulized epinephrine and albuterol in RSV bronchiolitis [^53b54bd6]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Crackles and wheezing are the cardinal auscultatory findings in bronchiolitis. In asthma, the degree of wheezing measured as Tw/Ttot has been shown to correlate with severity of airway obstruction. Tal et al. studied 16 infants with bronchiolitis and wheezing, of whom 7 responded to albuterol. However, his study population consisted of older infants (mean age 9.4 vs. 4.4 months), the majority of whom had either previous episodes of wheezing, family history of asthma or atopy or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. They were therefore at higher risk of wheezing with viral infections or other triggers. In bronchiolitis, due to distal airway edema and secretions, crackles are often produced. Young babies with RSV bronchiolitis characteristically have more crackles, explaining the difference in wheezing between the two patient populations. Reduction of edema and drying of secretions by epinephrine might be expected to result in reduced crackles. Modern computerized acoustic lung sounds analysis technology (mainly due to fast high-RAM computers) now allow rapid accurate quantification of wheezing and crackles, providing an objective tool for assessment of disease activity in infants with bronchiolitis. In our study to evaluate this tool, we found no overall short-term advantage of nebulized epinephrine compared to albuterol as assessed by computerized wheeze and crackle quantification and by total clinical score. However, it should be noted that the sample size in this pilot study was designed primarily to evaluate the acoustic method and therefore does have adequate power to detect clinical response. A larger study is necessary to assess the correlation between the computerized crackle and wheeze counts and the Clinical Score in response to treatment in RSV bronchiolitis.

### Nebulized hypertonic saline 3% for 1 versus 3 days in hospitalized bronchiolitis: a blinded non-inferiority randomized controlled trial [^8d2cf964]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is one of the most frequent diseases in children under 2 years of age, with about 30% of infants being affected each year, and is a major cause for admission to pediatric emergency departments (ED). Hospitalization rate is about 18 infants per 1000 per year in France. Very few treatments have shown to be effective in the management of this disorder. Treatment is based on supportive care, since previous studies have not shown clearbenefit from corticosteroids, nebulized epinephrine or bronchodilators.

In the past 10 years, nebulized hypertonic saline (HS) has emerged as a potentially effective treatment. Nebulized HS is supposed to improve mucociliary clearance, inducing an osmotic flow of water into the mucus layer and rehydrating the airway surface liquid. Among the severity scores used to monitor respiratory outcomes, the Wang Clinical Severity Score (CSS) is widely used and is based on respiratory rate, wheezing, signs of retraction and general condition.

Some recent meta-analyses of several clinical studies including the latest Cochrane publication have shown that nebulized HS may reduce length of stay and improve clinical severity scores. Despite these data, other meta-analyses suggest that heterogeneity of the studies may not reveal a significant effect on length of stay. However, the ideal duration and timing of administration have yet to be determined, and protocols vary greatly between studies. The most recent guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that nebulized HS should not be administered to infants with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis in the Emergency Department (ED) but only for patients hospitalized for bronchiolitis (Grade B recommendation). Two very recent studies also showed that there was no benefit from using 3% HS in the pediatric ED. A meta-analysis by Chen et al. suggests that the benefit on the clinical severity score exists as early as on the first day of treatment and that it is still significant on the third day.

Considering that the optimal duration of nebulized HS in infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis is still debated, we conducted a blinded non-inferiority randomized controlled trial aimed to compare nebulized 3% HS for 1 versus 3 days on severity score and clinical remission at 72 h.

### Epinephrine for bronchiolitis [^1fcf7b4c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchodilators are commonly used for acute bronchiolitis, despite uncertain effectiveness.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy and safety of epinephrine in children less than two with acute viral bronchiolitis.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (2010, Issue 3) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (1950 to September Week 2, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to September 2010), Scopus (1823 to September 2010), PubMed (March 2010), LILACS (1985 to September 2010) and Iran MedEx (1998 to September 2010).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials comparing epinephrine to placebo or another intervention involving children less than two years with acute viral bronchiolitis. Studies were included if the trials presented data for at least one quantitative outcome of interest. We selected primary outcomes a priori, based on clinical relevance: rate of admission by days one and seven of presentation for outpatients, and length of stay (LOS) for inpatients. Secondary outcomes included clinical severity scores, pulmonary function, symptoms, quality of life and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the searches, applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias and graded the evidence. We conducted separate analyses for different comparison groups (placebo, non-epinephrine bronchodilators, glucocorticoids) and for clinical setting (inpatient, outpatient).

Main Results

We included 19 studies (2256 participants). Epinephrine versus placebo among outpatients showed a significant reduction in admissions at Day 1 (risk ratio (RR) 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.89) but not at Day 7 post-emergency department visit. There was no difference in LOS for inpatients. Epinephrine versus salbutamol showed no differences among outpatients for admissions at Day 1 or 7. Inpatients receiving epinephrine had a significantly shorter LOS compared to salbutamol (mean difference -0.28; 95% CI -0.46 to -0.09). One large RCT showed a significantly shorter admission rate at Day 7 for epinephrine and steroid combined versus placebo (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.95). There were no important differences in adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

This review demonstrates the superiority of epinephrine compared to placebo for short-term outcomes for outpatients, particularly in the first 24 hours of care. Exploratory evidence from a single study suggests benefits of epinephrine and steroid combined for later time points. More research is required to confirm the benefits of combined epinephrine and steroids among outpatients. There is no evidence of effectiveness for repeated dose or prolonged use of epinephrine or epinephrine and dexamethasone combined among inpatients.

### Treatment of RSV bronchiolitis: drugs, antibiotics [^db9070d0]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

RSV bronchiolitis is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission and for visits to emergency departments for children, and at least half of affected infants will have subsequent episodes of respiratory illness. Despite this, there are wide variations in management. Initial assessment of respiratory status should include a measure of oxygenation and oxygen should be given when there is clinical evidence of respiratory distress even before full assessment is completed. Fluid and nutritional status should also be assessed early and decisions made about use of intravenous fluids, nasogastric feeding, or maintenance of frequent feeds orally. Given the lack of evidence on all drug therapies for bronchiolitis, clinicians should carefully evaluate treatments for their ability to reduce symptoms, decrease length of hospital stay and reduce sequelae. Furthermore, clinicians should monitor antibiotic use carefully and develop a strategy to change current physician practice.

### Comparison of nebulized epinephrine to albuterol in bronchiolitis [^58adf56d]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the effect of nebulized racemic epinephrine to nebulized racemic albuterol on successful discharge from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

Children up to their 18th month of life presenting to two teaching hospital EDs with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis who were ill enough to warrant treatment but did not need immediate intubation were eligible for this double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients received either three doses of racemic albuterol or one dose of racemic epinephrine plus two saline nebulizers. Disposition was decided 2 hours after the first nebulizer. Successful discharge was defined as not requiring additional bronchodilators in the ED after study drug administration and not subsequently admitted within 72 hours. Adjusted relative risks (aRR) were estimated using the modified Poisson regression with successful discharge as the dependent variable and study drug and severity of illness as exposures. Secondary analysis was performed for patients aged less than 12 months and first presentation.

Results

The authors analyzed 703 patients; 352 patients were given albuterol and 351 epinephrine. A total of 173 in the albuterol group and 160 in the epinephrine group were successfully discharged (crude RR = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.92 to 1.26). When adjusted for severity of illness, patients who received albuterol were significantly more likely than patients receiving epinephrine to be successfully discharged (aRR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.36). This was also true among those with first presentation and in those less than 12 months of age.

Conclusions

In children up to the 18th month of life, ED treatment of bronchiolitis with nebulized racemic albuterol led to more successful discharges than nebulized epinephrine.

### Epinephrine for bronchiolitis [^ba80242d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchodilators are commonly used in the management of bronchiolitis. A recent systematic review showed that bronchodilators produce modest short-term benefit among patients with mild or moderate bronchiolitis.

Objectives

To compare epinephrine versus placebo and other bronchodilators in infants less than 2 years of age with bronchiolitis.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches were conducted on the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2003), and EMBASE (January 1988 to May 2003). The reference lists of all selected articles were examined for relevant studies. Primary authors were contacted for information on additional trials.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they: 1) were RCTs comparing epinephrine with placebo or other bronchodilator; 2) involved children less than two years with bronchiolitis; 3) presented at least one quantitative outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Searches were screened and inclusion criteria applied independently by two reviewers. Quality was assessed by two reviewers using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment. Data were extracted by one reviewer using a structured form and checked by a second. Separate analyses were conducted for the two types of control groups (placebo, non-epinephrine bronchodilators) and for patient status (inpatient, outpatient).

Main Results

Fourteen studies were included. Quality ranged from one to five (Jadad scale) with a median of three (inter-quartile range: two to three). Allocation concealment was adequate in six trials and unclear in eight. Among inpatient studies comparing epinephrine and placebo (n = five), there was one significant outcome favouring epinephrine: change in clinical score at 60 minutes post-treatment (SMD -0.52; 95% CI -1.00,-0.03). For outpatient studies (n = three), change in clinical score at 60 minutes (SMD -0.81; -1.56,-0.07), change in oxygen saturation at 30 minutes (WMD 2.79;1.50,4.08), respiratory rate at 30 minutes (WMD -4.54;-8.89–0.19), and "improvement" (OR 25.06; 4.95,126.91) favoured epinephrine. Heart rate at 60 minutes post-treatment favoured placebo (WMD 11.80; 5.20,18.40). Admission rates and change in oxygen saturation at 60 minutes post-treatment were not significantly different. For inpatient studies comparing epinephrine and salbutamol (n = four), only one of the seven outcomes was statistically significant: respiratory rate at 30 minutes favoured epinephrine (WMD -5.12; -6.83;-3.41). Among outpatient studies (n = four), change in oxygen saturation at 60 minutes (WMD 1.91; 0.38,3.44), heart rate at 90 minutes (WMD -14.00; -22.95;-5.05), respiratory rate at 60 minutes (WMD -7.76; -11.35,-4.17) post-treatment and "improvement" (OR 4.51; 1.93,10.53) favoured epinephrine. Admission rates were not significantly different (OR 0.40; 0.12,1.33). Pallor at 30 minutes post-treatment was significantly higher in the epinephrine group (OR 6.00; 1.33,27.00).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of epinephrine for the treatment of bronchiolitis among inpatients. There is some evidence to suggest that epinephrine may be favourable to salbutamol and placebo among outpatients. A number of large, multi-centered trials are required to examine the effectiveness of epinephrine compared to placebo and salbutamol for infants presenting to outpatient settings. There is a need to develop a validated, reliable scoring system that is sensitive to important clinical changes in patients with bronchiolitis.

### Assessing the impact of national guidelines on the management of children hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis [^36ec6197]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchiolitis is a common illness accounting for $500 million annually in hospitalizations. Despite the frequency of bronchiolitis, its diagnosis and management is variable. To address this variability, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published an evidence-based practice management guideline for bronchiolitis in 2006.

Objective

Assess for changes in physician behavior in the management of bronchiolitis before and after publication of the 2006 AAP bronchiolitis guideline.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed at two academic medical centers of children < 24months of age admitted to the hospital with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Pre-guideline charts were gathered from 2004 to 2005 and post-guideline charts from 2007 to 2008. Evaluation and therapeutic interventions prior to and during hospitalization were analyzed. Data were analyzed using chi-squared analysis for categorical variables, Mann-Whitney testing for continuous variables.

Results

One thousand two hundred thirty-three patients met inclusion criteria. Diagnostic laboratory testing rates did not decline after guideline publication. The number of chest X-rays obtained decreased from 72.9% to 66.7% post-guidelines (P = 0.02). Fewer children received a trial of racemic epinephrine (17.8% vs. 12.2%, P = 0.006) or albuterol (81.6% vs. 72.6%, P < 0.0001) post-guidelines, and physicians more often discontinued albuterol when documented ineffective in the post-guidelines period (28.6% vs. 78.9%, P < 0.0001). Corticosteroid use in children without a history of RAD or asthma dropped post-guidelines (26.5% vs. 17.5%, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

A modest change in physician behavior in the inpatient management of bronchiolitis was seen post-guidelines. Additional health care provider training and education is warranted to reduce unnecessary interventions and healthcare resources use.

### Nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution treatment in hospitalized infants with viral bronchiolitis [^efcc9dda]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the utility of inhaled hypertonic saline solution to treat infants hospitalized with viral bronchiolitis.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Fifty-two hospitalized infants (mean ± SD age, 2.9 ± 2.1 months) with viral bronchiolitis received either inhalation of epinephrine, 1.5 mg, in 4 mL of 0.9% saline solution (group 1; n = 25) or inhalation of epinephrine, 1.5 mg, in 4 mL of 3% saline solution (group 2; n = 27). This therapy was repeated three times every hospitalization day until discharge.

Results

The percentage improvement in the clinical severity scores after inhalation therapy was not significant in group 1 on the first, second, and third days after hospital admission (3.5%, 2%, and 4%, respectively). In group 2, significant improvement was observed on these days (7.3%, 8.9%, and 10%, respectively; p < 0.001). Also, the improvement in clinical severity scores differed significantly on each of these days between the two groups. Using 3% saline solution decreased the hospitalization stay by 25%: from 4 ± 1.9 days in group 1 to 3 ± 1.2 days in group 2 (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

We conclude that in nonasthmatic, nonseverely ill infants hospitalized with viral bronchiolitis, aerosolized 3% saline solution/1.5 mg epinephrine decreases symptoms and length of hospitalization as compared to 0.9% saline solution/1.5 mg epinephrine.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^cbc82091]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

A nasopharyngeal aspirate for Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) antigen was routinely done in participating hospitals to determine appropriate placement for infection control purposes. At the discretion of the attending physician, some children had respiratory tract samples submitted for respiratory virus culture (RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus).

A secondary outcome measure was duration of hospital stay, measured using a method previously validated by the Pediatric Investigators Collaborative Network on Infections in Canada studies of hospitalized children with RSV infection. Each day the study nurse assessed which of four reasons accounted for ongoing hospitalization 1) patient receiving drug treatment for bronchiolitis 2) patient receiving oxygen supplementation or parenteral fluids because of bronchiolitis 3) patient hospitalized because of underlying (pre-existing) illness only or 4) awaiting transport home or uncertain home environment. Only those days on which the reason for hospitalization were one or more of receiving medication for bronchiolitis (1) or oxygen supplementation or parenteral fluids because of bronchiolitis (2), were recorded as valid hospital days. Discharge timing, counted as the time the decision was made to discharge home, was at the discretion of the attending physician. Study personnel had no involvement in discharge planning and did not impose any discharge criteria.

All parents/guardians were telephoned seven days after hospital discharge by a research assistant to collect data about the child's convalescence: respiratory symptoms (retractions, wheezing), feeding pattern (normal, less than normal, unable to feed), adverse events from medication (shakiness, tremors, pallor", other problems") and whether they had required a visit to a physician or to the emergency department or hospital. The interviewer read closed-ended questions from a standard script.

Adverse events were collected during the hospital stay and during the post-discharge telephone call. The event was described and categorized according to severity (mild, moderate, severe), outcome (recovered fully, recovered with sequelae, ongoing, death) and relationship to study drug (related, probably or possibly related, unrelated, unable to classify). Mild adverse events were defined as "awareness of signs and symptoms, easily tolerated and require no interventions", moderate as "discomfort sufficient enough to interfere with normal activities and/or result in some sort of intervention" and severe as " inability to perform normal activities, distressing and/or incapacitating and definitely require intervention and/or medical attention".

### Glucocorticoids for acute viral bronchiolitis in infants and young children [^32a3bc28]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Previous systematic reviews have not shown clear benefit of glucocorticoids for acute viral bronchiolitis, but their use remains considerable. Recent large trials add substantially to current evidence and suggest novel glucocorticoid-including treatment approaches.

Objectives

To review the efficacy and safety of systemic and inhaled glucocorticoids in children with acute viral bronchiolitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1950 to January week 2, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to January 2013), LILACS (1982 to January 2013), Scopus® (1823 to January 2013) and IRAN MedEx (1998 to November 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short-term systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids versus placebo or another intervention in children under 24 months with acute bronchiolitis (first episode with wheezing). Our primary outcomes were: admissions by days 1 and 7 for outpatient studies; and length of stay (LOS) for inpatient studies. Secondary outcomes included clinical severity parameters, healthcare use, pulmonary function, symptoms, quality of life and harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data on study and participant characteristics, interventions and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias and graded strength of evidence. We meta-analysed inpatient and outpatient results separately using random-effects models. We pre-specified subgroup analyses, including the combined use of bronchodilators used in a protocol.

Main Results

We included 17 trials (2596 participants); three had low overall risk of bias. Baseline severity, glucocorticoid schemes, comparators and outcomes were heterogeneous. Glucocorticoids did not significantly reduce outpatient admissions by days 1 and 7 when compared to placebo (pooled risk ratios (RRs) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.08 and 0.86; 95% CI 0.7 to 1.06, respectively). There was no benefit in LOS for inpatients (mean difference -0.18 days; 95% CI -0.39 to 0.04). Unadjusted results from a large factorial low risk of bias RCT found combined high-dose systemic dexamethasone and inhaled epinephrine reduced admissions by day 7 (baseline risk of admission 26%; RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.95; number needed to treat 11; 95% CI 7 to 76), with no differences in short-term adverse effects. No other comparisons showed relevant differences in primary outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support a clinically relevant effect of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids on admissions or length of hospitalisation. Combined dexamethasone and epinephrine may reduce outpatient admissions, but results are exploratory and safety data limited. Future research should further assess the efficacy, harms and applicability of combined therapy.

### Exploring the efficacy of using hypertonic saline for nebulizing treatment in children with bronchiolitis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^bec2f079]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is the most common lower-respiratory infection in infants, affecting 68.8% of infants and neonates aged < 12 months, and is a major cause of hospitalization in children during the first year of life. Bronchiolitis is primarily caused by viral infection which results in inflammation of the bronchioles in the lungs. The infection can last 2 ~ 3 weeks, and causes mucosal congestion and sputum secretion during the disease course. Common symptoms include excessive coughing with tachypnea, fever and wheezing.

In case of severe nasal congestion, a child might resort to open-mouth breathing and prone to dyspnea caused by tracheal obstruction, which may cause respiratory failure in severe cases. Infants may be prone to vomit due to frequent coughing at night that affect their sleeping quality, day time activities and mental status as well as recovery of the body's immune system.

Approximately 50–80% of bronchiolitis are caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), thereby, treatment by antibiotics is usually ineffective. According to the 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics Bronchiolitis guideline, the primary treatment method is supportive, such as rest, maintain nutrition intake and fluid supplementation. For symptoms such as cough and fever, the use of supportive medications such as antitussive syrup, antipyretics or nebulizer can help relieve the symptoms.

With the use of normal saline as the diluent in nebulizers and the oxygen as vaporizer, the water molecules or drugs can be breathed through the mouth or nose and spread to the respiratory tract and lungs by the airflow. After the alveolar capillaries absorb the molecules, the drugs can dilute the secretions in the respiratory tract, then induce expectoration and relieve symptoms of bronchospasm.

### The problematic 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines [^29796136]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines do not adequately serve the needs and clinical realities of front-line clinicians caring for undifferentiated wheezing infants and children. This article describes the clinical challenges of evaluating and managing a heterogeneous disease syndrome presenting as undifferentiated patients to the emergency department. Although the 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines and the multiple international guidelines that they closely mirror have made a good faith attempt to provide clinicians with the best evidence-based recommendations possible, they have all failed to address practical, front-line clinical challenges. The therapeutic nihilism of the guidelines and the dissonance between many of the recommendations and frontline realities have had wide-ranging consequences. Nevertheless, newer evidence of therapeutic options is emerging and forecasts hope for more therapeutically optimistic recommendations with the next revision of the guidelines.

### Cost-effectiveness of epinephrine and dexamethasone in children with bronchiolitis [^617471a2]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Using data from the Canadian Bronchiolitis Epinephrine Steroid Trial we assessed the cost-effectiveness of treatments with epinephrine and dexamethasone for infants between 6 weeks and 12 months of age with bronchiolitis.

Methods

An economic evaluation was conducted from both the societal and health care system perspectives including all costs during 22 days after enrollment. The effectiveness of therapy was measured by the duration of symptoms of feeding problems, sleeping problems, coughing, and noisy breathing. Comparators were nebulized epinephrine plus oral dexamethasone, nebulized epinephrine alone, oral dexamethasone alone, and no active treatment. Uncertainty around estimates was assessed through nonparametric bootstrapping.

Results

The combination of nebulized epinephrine plus oral dexamethasone was dominant over the other 3 comparators in that it was both the most effective and least costly. Average societal costs were $1115 (95% credible interval [CI]: 919–1325) for the combination therapy, $1210 (95% CI: 1004–1441) for no active treatment, $1322 (95% CI: 1093–1571) for epinephrine alone, and $1360 (95% CI: 1124–1624) for dexamethasone alone. The average time to curtailment of all symptoms was 12.1 days (95% CI: 11–13) for the combination therapy, 12.7 days (95% CI: 12–13) for no active treatment, 13.0 days (95% CI: 12–14) for epinephrine alone, and 12.6 days (95% CI: 12–13) for dexamethasone alone.

Conclusion

Treating infants with bronchiolitis with a combination of nebulized epinephrine plus oral dexamethasone is the most cost-effective treatment option, because it is the most effective in controlling symptoms and is associated with the least costs.

### Computerized acoustic assessment of treatment efficacy of nebulized epinephrine and albuterol in RSV bronchiolitis [^59b20df7]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Results

Over the study period 87 patients with bronchiolitis were seen in the emergency department. Excluded were: 21 patients younger than 8 weeks, 22 seen on off hours when investigators were unavailable, 12 with other significant concurrent illnesses and 5 whose parents refused. Twenty-seven infants whose parents signed an informed consent (mean age 4.4 ± 0.8 months) were recruited, 12 received epinephrine and 15 albuterol. The groups were well balanced in terms of demographic and clinical parameters (Table 2). Pre-study treatment with either inhaled bronchodilators or corticosteroids was not different in the two groups.

Table 2
Demographic and clinical data of the sudy's 27 infants with RSV bronchiolitis.

Poor feeding (not showing interest or eating significantly less (< 75%) than normal) and Dyspnea (breathing fast, with effort and/or retractions) are according to parental history.

Even though the crackle counter was not validated as part of this study, there was complete agreement between clinician and PulmoTrac results in all sound segments, in off-line auditory analysis of the data. No significant difference in wheezing and crackles by computerized lung sounds analysis was found between or within the groups prior to, 10 minutes post and 30 minutes post treatment. There was no significant change in objective quantification of wheezes and crackles between the groups or in the total clinical scores. Examples of acoustic wheeze detection in sonogram mode are shown in Figures 1, 2, 3. Figure 1 shows no response to albuterol, figure 2 demonstrates dramatic response to epinephrine with disappearance of wheezing, while figure 3 shows transient response with rebound wheezing at 30 minutes. Total clinical score and acoustic results for both treatment groups are summarized in Table 3.

### The pediatric emergency research network: a decade of global research cooperation in pediatric emergency care [^600bbeac]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Prospective observational studies further enhanced the collaborative relationships and research capacity within PERN. After the H1N1 study, members sought to address other key globally relevant questions in pediatric emergency care, including bronchiolitis and acute poisoning. Retrospectiveand prospectiveobservational studies as well as secondary analyses – revealed practice variations and substantial rates of nonindicated testing and inappropriate interventions in both these conditions. For infants with bronchiolitis, it was found that the use of evidence-based supportive care minimized unnecessary hospitalizations. An additional focus of PERN research has looked at professional skills and knowledge development: an online survey revealed a global knowledge gap among emergency care professionals in psychosocial care of injured children, and a cross-sectional survey across 6 networks revealed consensus in practice frequency and modality for critical pediatric procedures. –

Even as these observational studies were ongoing, research networks were joining together to fulfill PERN's long-term vision of conducting global RCTs. To date, at least 2 such efforts are underway. Pragmatic Pediatric Trial of Balanced Versus Normal Saline Fluid in Sepsis (PRoMPT BOLUS)is a multicenter randomized, open-label, pragmatic trial to test the comparative effectiveness and relative safety of 2 common fluid types in the treatment of septic shock in children. This study will recruit 8800 children from more than 44 hospitals across the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. One of the unique challenges of this trial is the coordination of several regulatory bodies and funding sources. Each of the 3 participating networks (PECARN, PERC, and PREDICT) has secured its own ethical oversight and national funding, as no single government agency has the budget to support such a large study. A second PERN RCT in process relates to the treatment of bronchiolitis with epinephrine and dexamethasone. Combination therapy will be compared with placebo in this double-blinded RCT, which aims to establish any impact of such treatment on hospitalizations over a 7-day period. This study, known as Bronchiolitis in Infants Placebo Versus Epinephrine and Dexamethasone (BIPED) will recruit 1616 infants from 12 hospitals across Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (PERC, PREDICT). The uniqueness of this trial is the coordination of manufacture of off-patent "old" pharmaceuticals (epinephrine and dexamethasone) across 3 regulatory bodies and the challenges of responding to concerns about the uncertainty of nebulization being considered an aerosol-generating procedure during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The achievement of global recruitment into definitive RCTs represents an important milestone in PERN's development and in global pediatric emergency care research. It is expected that the current focus on interventional studies will continue, as efforts are currently underway to generate a core outcome set in acute severe pediatric asthmathat will serve as the basis for future RCTs in this area.

### Diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis [^a9d248bd]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is a disorder most commonly caused in infants by viral lower respiratory tract infection. It is the most common lower respiratory infection in this age group. It is characterized by acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells lining small airways, increased mucus production, and bronchospasm. The American Academy of Pediatrics convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and specialists in the fields of pulmonology, infectious disease, emergency medicine, epidemiology, and medical informatics. The committee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the RTI International-University of North Carolina Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the evidence-based literature related to the diagnosis, management, and prevention of bronchiolitis. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate clinical practice guideline recommendations. This guideline addresses the diagnosis of bronchiolitis as well as various therapeutic interventions including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antiviral and antibacterial agents, hydration, chest physiotherapy, and oxygen. Recommendations are made for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection with palivizumab and the control of nosocomial spread of infection. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. The clinical practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before it was approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with bronchiolitis. Rather, it is intended to assist clinicians in decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for the care of all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of children with bronchiolitis.

### Nebulised hypertonic saline (3%) among children with mild to moderately severe bronchiolitis – a double blind randomized controlled trial [^fbfe3dd0]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Nebulised 3% hypertonic saline in combination with epinephrine was effective in reducing the Clinical Severity scores, meeting the eligibility criteria for OPD/ER discharge and reducing the need for hospital admission among ambulatory children with bronchiolitis. We believe this simple, inexpensive, safe, and effective treatment intervention could minimize the morbidity of Bronchiolitis by generalizing its use in centers caring for pediatric patients. Similar study could be done in multicentric settings with a larger sample size, involving more severely affected patients, and with a placebo control design in order to confirm and extend our results.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^6b40c46b]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

We choose salbutamol as a control for epinephrine because it was the local standard of care at the time our trial was designed and it was considered unethical to withhold a potentially beneficial therapy, even though that benefit was likely minimal. Other randomized trials of epinephrine in hospitalized children have used as the control normal saline, salbutamol or both.

Interestingly we noted a risk to unblinding of treatment allocation early in our trial, by the oxidation of the sulphite preservatives, which turn mucous red or brown in recipients of racemic epinephrine. We implemented measures to avoid unblinding, but could find no mention of this event in previous studies of epinephrine in bronchiolitis. If future trials of racemic epinephrine are conducted, study design should carefully address this possibility and consider using another formulation of epinephrine. Patel et al questioned study personnel and ward staff after completion of their trial and found no difference in the proportion of correct guesses as to allocation by treatment group.

Hospital admission for bronchiolitis occurs when the infant has significant respiratory distress or is unable to feed because of the work of breathing. By this point in the evolution of bronchiolitis, lower respiratory tract inflammation is well established and may be difficult to alter. Perhaps for this reason, trials of steroid therapy in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis have shown no benefit. Length of hospital stay or avoidance of hospital admission is a salient outcome measure for intervention trials of epinephrine because institutional care represents the largest component of direct expenditures (over 60%) for bronchiolitis. Morbidity associated with bronchiolitis persisted for at least one week after hospital discharge in our population. Reducing costs and morbidity due to bronchiolitis may require more than one intervention, each at specific times during the illness. For example Schuh et al demonstrated a reduction in hospitalization in infants with bronchiolitis treated with dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) in the emergency department. Bisgaard et al demonstrated a reduction in post-RSV symptomatology, principally cough, in infants treated with montelukast within the first week of illness. All of these treatments, if their efficacy were borne out in larger trials, would reduce health care costs associated with this ubiquitous infection. Such studies will need to be large to capture clinically significant outcomes.

### How do we treat wheezing infants? Evidence or anecdote [^57081d0d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Consultant paediatricians were questioned about their management of wheezing disorders in infants. Salbutamol was the preferred bronchodilator for recurrent wheeze, whereas ipratropium was preferred in viral bronchiolitis. Doses of both medications varied widely. Both inhaled and oral corticosteroids were considered by most respondents. Practice does not clearly follow guidelines or evidence and presumably continues to be based on anecdote.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: effectiveness of pharmacologic airway clearance therapies in hospitalized patients [^b8d4fda8]. Respiratory Care (2015). Medium credibility.

AARC clinical practice guideline — impact of national bronchiolitis guidelines on medication use: After national guidelines were implemented at 2 academic medical centers, fewer hospitalized children received racemic epinephrine (17.8% vs 12.2%, P = 0.006) or albuterol sulfate (81.6% vs 72.6%, P < .001), albuterol sulfate discontinuation increased (28.6% vs 78.9%, P < .001), and corticosteroid use without a history of asthma decreased (26.5% vs 17.5%, P < .001). The use of such tools improves the cost effectiveness and care coordination by targeting therapeutic interventions to the patients who would benefit the most.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^06ed491b]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The sample size was calculated to detect a difference in the RDAI score between day one and day three. The estimated sample size for a two-sample comparison of proportions of each group that achieved the four-unit difference was with a probability of type one error of 0.05 and type 2 error of 0.8 was 33 infants per group. The standard deviations were based on previously reported changes in RDAI in bronchiolitis.

Analysis

All randomized children were considered in the analysis. All analyses were performed using SAS 8.02 software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, USA). Proportions and exact binomial intervals were calculated for discrete variables and comparisons between treatment groups were made using the Fisher's exact test. Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) were calculated for continuous variables and comparisons were made between treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Comparisons of trend across time were made using repeated measures analysis of variances. The RDAI was treated as a continuous measure. P-values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

### Treatment for acute bronchiolitis before and after implementation of new national guidelines: a retrospective observational study from primary and secondary care in oslo, Norway [^4dc6815b]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Background

Acute bronchiolitis treatment guidelines changed in Norway in 2013, no longer recommending the use of nebulised epinephrine. We aimed to assess whether these changes were successfully implemented in both primary and secondary care. Secondary aims were to compare the difference in management of acute bronchiolitis patients in primary and secondary care between 2009 and 2017.

Methods

We retrospectively registered data on demographics, clinical features and management from electronic medical records of all infants (< 12 months of age) diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis at a primary care centre (Oslo Accident and Emergency Outpatient Clinic) and a secondary care centre (Oslo University Hospital) in Norway in 2009, 2014 and 2017. All patient records were individually reviewed to ensure data accuracy.

Results

We included 680 (36.3%) patients from primary care and 1195 (63.7%) from secondary care. There was a reduction in the use of nebulised epinephrine from 2009 to 2017 from 66.9% to 16.1% of cases (p < 0.001) in primary care and from 59.1% to 4.9% (p < 0.001) in secondary care. In parallel, there was an increase in the use of nebulised saline treatment, from 0.8% to 53.8% (p < 0.001) in primary care and from 39.3% to 65.3% (p < 0.001) in secondary care. The decrease in the use of nebulised racemic epinephrine occurred earlier in secondary care than in primary care; 13.4% vs 56.1%, respectively, in 2014.

Conclusions

Implementation of the new guidelines on the treatment of acute bronchiolitis was successfully implemented in both primary and secondary care.

### Nebulised hypertonic saline (3%) among children with mild to moderately severe bronchiolitis – a double blind randomized controlled trial [^46d90436]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is a common, occasionally severe viral infection of the lower respiratory tract responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in children under two years of age. According to World Health Organization bulletin, an estimated 150 million new cases of clinical pneumonia (principally Pneumonia and Bronchiolitis) occur annually; 11–20 million among them requiring hospital admission. Worldwide, 95% of all cases occur in developing countries. Epidemiologic data show that RSV accounts for about 65% of hospitalizations due to Bronchiolitis.

Multiple studies have documented variation in diagnostic testing, treatment modalities practiced and their outcomes in Bronchiolitis suggesting a lack of consensus for this common disorder. Likewise, despite the frequency of this condition, there is no unanimously accepted evidence driven treatment approach. Besides supplemental oxygen, fluids and supportive care, treatment options include, bronchodilators, epinephrine and corticosteroids. Hypertonic saline (3%) is a new agent that has been found to be promising in recent studies. The proposed mechanism are by improving mucus rheology, reducing airway wall edema and causing sputum induction and cough. A recent meta-analysis also showed a consistent improvement in clinical severity scores and suggested HS may also decrease the length of hospital stay in Bronchiolitis. However, multiple other studies have shown equivocal results with little or no clinical benefits with the use of hypertonic saline (3, 6 or 7%). Similary, there is a paucity of data on comparison of important outcomes like readiness for discharge, need for repeat hospital visits and hospitalization rates, which are important reflectors of morbidity and economic burden. In the paucity of rigorously controlled studies in developing countries using 3% HS, lack of a consensus regarding management of bronchiolitis in our practice and an opportunity to improve care for this common disorder this study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of 3% HS. We tried to study primarily the improvement in CS scores but also looked at parameters like readiness for discharge, need for hospital revisit rates and hospitalization which would reflect the morbidity and financial burden of disease.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^5630a30c]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Results

Sixty-two children were enrolled with 31 in each treatment arm. Ten were enrolled from the Saint John site and 52 from the Halifax site. All participants completed in-hospital follow-up but the parent of one child in the epinephrine group could not be contacted for the one-week post-discharge telephone call. The mean age of participants was 6.4 months. RSV was identified in nasopharyngeal samples of 81.5% of children randomized to epinephrine and 78.6% of those randomized on salbutamol. The two groups were similar at baseline; characteristics at enrolment are seen in Table 2. On admission, only 15% of infants had a normal feeding pattern; 83% had decreased feeding by parental/caregiver report and 7% were unable to feed. 245 children were screened who did not enroll: 46 did not meet inclusion criteria and in 34 parents refused consent. The rest were ineligible because of exclusion criteria. The most commons reason for exclusion was previous diagnosis of asthma (n = 58) and previous administration of systemic steroids (n = 44).

Table 2
Characteristics of children less than two years of age admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis by treatment group, at enrolment.

RDAI = Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument, CI = confidence interval

Racemic epinephrine resulted in a significant improvement in wheezing compared to salbutamol on day 2 (p = 0.01) and over the entire hospital stay (p = 0.01) (Table 3), but not on other days. The total RDAI (wheezing and retractions) in children receiving racemic epinephrine was also significantly better on the second hospital day and over the entire stay (p = 0.02). On the third hospital day a significant difference in oxygen saturation was observed in children receiving racemic epinephrine compared to those receiving salbutamol (96.20% v. 93.80%, 98.80 v. 92.00 p = 0.03) but this difference was not significant when the two groups were compared over the entire hospital stay or on other days.

### Heliox therapy in infants with acute bronchiolitis [^1c6a71d6]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the therapeutic effects of breathing a low-density gas mixture (heliox: 70% helium and 30% oxygen) in infants with bronchiolitis.

Design

Prospective, interventional, comparative study.

Setting

A pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a tertiary care, teaching hospital.

Patients

Thirty-eight infants, 1 month to 2 years old, consecutively admitted to the PICU for treatment of moderate-to-severe acute respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis.

Interventions

The first 19 patients were enrolled as the control group and received supportive care and nebulized epinephrine. In the next 19 patients, heliox therapy was added through a nonrebreather reservoir face mask. Measurements and Outcomes. Respiratory distress score, respiratory rate, heart rate, end-tidal CO(2) (etCO(2)), and pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (satO(2)) values were recorded at baseline and at regular intervals. Data obtained during the first 4 hours were analyzed for comparison purposes. Demographic data, age, time elapsed from the start of the symptoms to the admission to PICU, length of stay in PICU (PICU-LOS), and duration of heliox therapy were also collected for each patient. Reductions in clinical scores and PICU-LOS were considered primary outcomes. Main Results. At baseline, the heliox and control groups had similar age (5.5 ± 3.1 vs 5.9 ± 3 months), previous length of course (47.3 ± 19.3 vs 45.4 ± 18.6 hours), clinical score (6.7 ± 1.1 vs 6.6 ± 1), heart rate (160 ± 24 vs 165 ± 20 beats per minute), respiratory rate (64 ± 7 vs 61 ± 7 respirations per minute), satO(2) (91 ± 2.3 vs 91 ± 2.5%), and etCO(2) (34 ± 7 vs 33 ± 6 mm Hg). Clinical score, heart rate, respiratory rate, and satO(2) improved during the study in both groups. After 1 hour, the improvement in clinical score was significantly higher in the heliox group than in the control group (3.6 ± 1.16 vs 5.5 ± 0.89), and these differences continued to be significant at the end of the observation period (2.39 ± 0.69 and 4.07 ± 0.96, respectively), with a total average decrease in the score of 4.2 points in the heliox group versus 2.5 points in the control group. Heart and respiratory rates were also significantly lower in the heliox group compared with the control group after 1 hour and stayed lower throughout the rest of the study period. No changes were noted either in satO(2) between groups or in etCO(2) within or between groups throughout the study. Mean duration of heliox administration was 53 ± 24 hours (range: 24–112 hours) and no adverse effects were detected. PICU-LOS was significantly shorter in the heliox group (3.5 ± 1.1 days) than in the control group (5.4 ± 1.6 days).

Conclusions

In infants with moderate-to-severe respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis, heliox therapy enhanced their clinical respiratory status, according to the marked improvement in their clinical scores and the reduction of the accompanying tachycardia and tachypnea. This beneficial response occurred within the first hour of its administration and was maintained as long as heliox therapy continued. In addition, PICU-LOS was reduced in heliox-treated patients. Long-term prospective studies are required to corroborate these findings and to establish the proper place of heliox in the therapeutic schedule of bronchiolitis.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^a50898e2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric respiratory distress (bronchiolitis) — prehospital key considerations state that suctioning can be a very effective intervention to alleviate distress since infants are obligate nose breathers; heliox should not be routinely administered to children with respiratory distress; insufficient data exist to recommend the use of inhaled steam or nebulized saline; the most recent evidence does not demonstrate a benefit in routine use of albuterol or steroids for bronchiolitis; ipratropium and other anticholinergic agents should not be given to children with bronchiolitis in the prehospital setting; and although nebulized hypertonic saline has been shown to decrease hospital length of stay when used for bronchiolitis, it does not provide immediate relief of distress and should not be administered to children in respiratory distress in the prehospital setting.

### Viral bronchiolitis in infants in the era of targeted therapies: what now and what's next? [^49ef3e4f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Viral bronchiolitis is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 1 year of age. Most clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommend a minimalist management approach based on supportive therapy, focusing solely on maintaining oxygenation and hydration.

Objectives

To examine the reasons behind the poor adherence to evidence-based guidelines for bronchiolitis in real-world clinical practice and to explore potential strategies to improve future management.

Methods

This narrative review discusses factors that may explain the observed gap between guideline recommendations and clinical practice, including recent findings from the field that help clarify this poor adherence.

Results

We highlight the discrepancy between guideline-based recommendations and clinical implementation. We also discuss the evolving landscape of bronchiolitis management, including evidence supporting novel interventions such as maternal RSV vaccination during pregnancy and the use of monoclonal antibodies like nirsevimab and ziresovir, an oral RSV F protein inhibitor.

Conclusions

Understanding and addressing the causes of poor adherence to bronchiolitis guidelines is critical. Future research should aim to integrate evidence-based treatments with options for personalized adjustments. Updated guidelines should reflect emerging interventions and provide rational management pathways until robust evidence from new studies becomes available.

### Treatment for acute bronchiolitis before and after implementation of new national guidelines: a retrospective observational study from primary and secondary care in oslo, Norway [^15caa317]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

We included 680 cases from primary care and 1195 cases from secondary care. Mean age was higher in primary care than in secondary care, 6.1 months vs 4.8 months (p < 0.001). The gender distribution was similar, with 60.9% boys in both settings. Clinical characteristics are shown in table 1.

Table 1
Demographics and clinical features of children treated for acute bronchiolitis in primary care and at hospital in Oslo, Norway, before and after introduction of new treatment guidelines in 2013

There was a reduction in the use of nebulised racemic epinephrine treatment from 2009 to 2017; from 66.9% (162/242) of cases to 16.1% (32/199) (p < 0.001) in primary care and from 59.1% (257/435) to 4.9% (19/386) (p < 0.001) in secondary care (table 2). Simultaneously, there was an increase in the use of nebulised saline treatment; from 0.8% (2/242) to 53.8% (107/199) (p < 0.001) in primary care and from 39.3% (171/435) to 65.3% (252/386) (p < 0.001) in secondary care. The decrease in the use of nebulised racemic epinephrine occurred earlier in secondary care (13.4% (50/374) in 2014) than in primary care (56.1% (134/239) in 2014).

Background and Objectives

Evidence-based practice guidelines for bronchiolitis management published by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2006 recommend supportive care with limited diagnostic testing and treatment. We sought to determine the impact of these guidelines on the treatment of hospitalized children.

Methods

We analyzed data on inpatients with bronchiolitis aged 1 to 24 months from the Pediatric Health Information System, an administrative billing database, from November 1, 2004 to March 31, 2012. We compared trends in use of diagnostic and treatment resources before and after the publication of the guidelines by using segmented time series.

Results

A total of 41 pediatric hospitals contributed data to yield 130,262 patients; 58% were male, and 59% were publicly insured. Median age was 4.0 months (interquartile range, 2–9). Unadjusted analysis showed improvement in utilization rates before and after guidelines for diagnostic tests and for medications; however, there was no decreased use of antibiotics. A segmented regression analysis also demonstrated differences in rates of change before and after guidelines, with significant improvement for chest radiography, steroids, and bronchodilators (P < .0001).

Conclusions

In a nationally representative cohort of pediatric hospitals, publication of the 2006 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines was associated with significant reductions in the use of diagnostic and therapeutic resources.

Type of ALRI and RSV infection

Bronchiolitis (48.7%) followed by pneumonia (40%) were the commonest ALRI (Fig. 1, Table 2). RSV infection was documented in 26 (male/female ratio of 1) of all young infants less than 6 months (22.2%), but in 37% of those with bronchiolitis and only 11% of those with pneumonia. Females (31.7%) were slightly more affected by RSV than males (17.1%), but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). Most (58%) of the RSV infections were documented during rainy season. Although RSV infection was documented year round, the highest rate of infection occurred in the local summer time (June–August) followed by spring (September to November), while the lowest was in winter (December to February) (Fig. 2).

Treatment and outcome

The mean length of hospital stay was 5 (SD ± 5.2) days, ranging from 1 to 33 days. Most infants (75%) were treated with antibiotics, while 25% received only supportive care with hydration and oxygen. Bronchodilator and epinephrine nebulization were used in 48% infants. Steroids (mainly dexamethasone) were given in 10% of cases. Ampicillin +/− gentamicin was used in half of the cases and a quarter of the infants received broader spectrum antibiotics, mainly Cephalosporines, and vancomycin was also used in 5% of the cases.

Resolution of ALRI was documented in 98.3% with only 2 cases having complications, both of which were RSV negative: A one-month old infant with bronchiolitis developed persistent atelectasis and required a repeat admission for the same complaint in 4 weeks, and one death (0.9%) happened, with a diagnosis of pneumonia and sepsis, the latter being the cause of death (Table 2).

### Trends over time in use of nonrecommended tests and treatments since publication of the American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guideline [^2da96237]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Measures

The primary outcomes were rates of diagnostic testing and treatment as determined from billing data. We included tests (ie, CBC, CR, and viral testing) and treatments (ie, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics) that the AAP guidelines specifically recommend against in the evaluation and management of routine bronchiolitis. Bronchodilators included any form of epinephrine, albuterol, or levalbuterol. We analyzed LOS for inpatient and observation encounters and hospital admission rates from the ED between the 2 guideline periods as balancing measures.

Statistical Analysis

Demographic characteristics were summarized with frequencies and percentages, with values from guideline period 1 compared with those from guideline period 2 using χ 2 tests to identify candidate variables for adjustment. Segmented regression analysis with an interrupted time series (ITS) was conducted with the publication of the 2014 guideline as the event point. This analysis measured rates of change in outcomes over the 2 study periods, defined as the slope associated with use of tests and treatments over each period, and level change, defined as the change in use of tests and treatments between time periods divided by a single event point. Monthly rates of resource use were included in the segmented regression analysis. The model adjusted for the hospital providing service with random intercepts to control for clustering, as well as fixed effects for age, race/ethnicity, and payer. The ITS output is presented as a point estimate with 95% CIs for monthly slopes, change in slope between time periods, and level change between time periods.

All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) from June through December 2020. Changes were considered statistically significant if the 95% CI did not include 0.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^913d4841]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Children aged 5 years and younger — Step 1 initial treatment: As-needed inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) should be provided to all children who experience wheezing episodes for relief of symptoms, although it is not effective in all children. Use of SABA for the relief of symptoms on average more than twice a week over a 1-month period indicates the need for a trial of low-dose ICS. Initial episodes of wheezing in children < 1 year with infectious bronchiolitis should be managed according to local bronchiolitis guidelines and SABAs are generally ineffective for bronchiolitis. Oral bronchodilator therapy is not recommended due to its slower onset of action and higher rate of side-effects compared with inhaled SABA. For children with intermittent viral-induced wheeze and no interval symptoms, particularly those with underlying atopy (positive for modified API) when inhaled SABA is not sufficient, intermittent high-dose ICS may be considered, but because of the risk of side-effects, this should only be considered if the physician is confident that the treatment will be used appropriately.

### Racemic adrenaline and inhalation strategies in acute bronchiolitis [^c327d351]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Acute bronchiolitis in infants frequently results in hospitalization, but there is no established consensus on inhalation therapy — either the type of medication or the frequency of administration — that may be of value. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of inhaled racemic adrenaline as compared with inhaled saline and the strategy for frequency of inhalation (on demand vs. fixed schedule) in infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis.

Methods

In this eight-center, randomized, double-blind trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design, we compared inhaled racemic adrenaline with inhaled saline and on-demand inhalation with fixed-schedule inhalation (up to every 2 hours) in infants (< 12 months of age) with moderate-to-severe acute bronchiolitis. An overall clinical score of 4 or higher (on a scale of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe illness) was required for study inclusion. Any use of oxygen therapy, nasogastric-tube feeding, or ventilatory support was recorded. The primary outcome was the length of the hospital stay, with analyses conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Results

The mean age of the 404 infants included in the study was 4.2 months, and 59.4% were boys. Length of stay, use of oxygen supplementation, nasogastric-tube feeding, ventilatory support, and relative improvement in the clinical score from baseline (preinhalation) were similar in the infants treated with inhaled racemic adrenaline and those treated with inhaled saline (P > 0.1 for all comparisons). On-demand inhalation, as compared with fixed-schedule inhalation, was associated with a significantly shorter estimated mean length of stay — 47.6 hours (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.6 to 64.6) versus 61.3 hours (95% CI, 45.4 to 77.2; P = 0.01) - as well as less use of oxygen supplementation (in 38.3% of infants vs. 48.7%, P = 0.04), less use of ventilatory support (in 4.0% vs. 10.8%, P = 0.01), and fewer inhalation treatments (12.0 vs. 17.0, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In the treatment of acute bronchiolitis in infants, inhaled racemic adrenaline is not more effective than inhaled saline. However, the strategy of inhalation on demand appears to be superior to that of inhalation on a fixed schedule.

### Variation in the management of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis persists after the 2006 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines [^f6e9eab9]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe variation across US pediatric hospitals in the utilization of resources not recommended for routine use by the American Academy of Pediatrics guideline for infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis and to examine the association between resource utilization and disposition outcomes.

Study Design

We conducted a cross-sectional study of infants ≤ 12 months hospitalized for bronchiolitis from 2007–2012 at 42 hospitals contributing data to the Pediatric Health Information System. Patients with asthma were excluded. The primary outcome was hospital-level variation in utilization of 5 resources not recommended for routine use: albuterol, racemic epinephrine, corticosteroids, chest radiography, and antibiotics. We also examined the association of resource utilization with length of stay (LOS) and readmission.

Results

In total, 64,994 hospitalizations were analyzed. After adjustment for patient characteristics, albuterol (median, 52.4%; range, 3.5%-81%), racemic epinephrine (20.1%; 0.6%-78.8%), and chest radiography (54.9%; 24.1%-76.7%) had the greatest variation across hospitals. Utilization of albuterol, racemic epinephrine, and antibiotics did not change significantly over time compared with small decreases in corticosteroid (3.3%) and chest radiography (8.6%) use over the study period. Utilization of each resource was significantly associated with increased LOS without concomitant decreased odds of readmission.

Conclusions

Substantial use and variation in 5 resources not recommended for routine use by the American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guideline persists with increased utilization associated with increased LOS without the benefit of decreased readmission. Future work should focus on developing processes that can be widely disseminated and easily implemented to minimize unwarranted practice variation when evidence and guidelines exist.

### Effect of RSV bronchiolitis practice guidelines on resource utilization [^c09e2bc4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

We sought to determine whether institution of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) practice guidelines decreased resource utilization for a heterogeneous population of children hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis. Patients less than 24 months old with RSV bronchiolitis at a pediatric referral center were identified by retrospective chart review for consecutive RSV seasons. Before the guidelines were instituted patients were less likely to have a documented physician's assessment of response to albuterol, were more likely to have received supplemental oxygen and cardiorespiratory monitoring, and to be discharged on an albuterol regimen. Patients received more albuterol treatments. After the guidelines were in place fewer resources were utilized in the care of patients with RSV bronchiolitis. RSV practice guidelines may simplify and streamline the care of a heterogeneous population of children with bronchiolitis.
