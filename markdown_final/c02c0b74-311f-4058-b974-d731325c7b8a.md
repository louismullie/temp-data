## Question

Values of spirometry in asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret spirometry in asthma, including diagnostic thresholds, what to do when spirometry is normal, how to monitor, and how to integrate spirometry with adjunct tests and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology and diagnostic principle of variable expiratory airflow limitation. Then, I should verify the key spirometric indices and the bronchodilator reversibility thresholds. Next, I will examine how to interpret normal spirometry and when to escalate to bronchoprovocation or other tests. After that, I need to review monitoring strategies and the role of spirometry in routine follow-up. Finally, I will consider special populations, integration with FeNO and PEF, and synthesize a practical decision framework with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation: asthma is a clinical syndrome characterized by variable expiratory airflow limitation, so objective evidence of that variability is central to diagnosis and should be documented whenever feasible before starting controller therapy, because confirmation becomes harder once inhaled corticosteroids are initiated [^115ppn5R] [^111aC4up].

> I will now examine the primary spirometric indices. Wait, let me verify the key measures: FEV1, FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio are the core metrics, with the latter identifying obstruction when below the lower limit of normal. In adults, a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than the LLN supports airflow limitation, whereas in children the ratio is normally higher and age-appropriate cutoffs apply, so I should be cautious not to overcall obstruction in youth [^11792zsF] [^117AGe3D].

> Next, I should review bronchodilator responsiveness thresholds. Hold on, I should verify the adult diagnostic criterion: an increase in FEV1 of at least 12% and at least 200 mL from baseline after bronchodilator is accepted as consistent with asthma. A marked response exceeding 12% and 400 mL strongly favors asthma and is uncommon in COPD, though not absolutely exclusive, so I need to interpret this in clinical context [^112HHJDS] [^11792zsF]. For pediatrics, I initially thought the threshold was simply "more than 12%", but wait, I should double-check: many sources align with the adult 12% and 200 mL criterion, while some primary care summaries use a pediatric-specific "more than 12%" without the absolute volume. To avoid confusion, I will anchor to the adult 12% and 200 mL standard and note that pediatric guidance emphasizes documenting reversibility when obstruction is present, with ERS recommending bronchodilator testing when FEV1 or FEV1/FVC is below the LLN or less than 80% predicted [^117NCPzZ] [^111vT97D].

> But wait, what if spirometry is normal at the time of testing? I need to ensure I don't overinterpret a single normal study. Normal spirometry does not exclude asthma, especially in mild disease or when testing occurs during a symptom-free interval; in such cases, I should consider repeating spirometry when symptomatic, withholding bronchodilators appropriately, or proceeding to bronchoprovocation testing to uncover airway hyperresponsiveness, which has high sensitivity for asthma and a negative test substantially lowers the probability of asthma [^116i3ybZ] [^1162n8D6] [^113nnRSq].

> Let me consider adjunctive objective tests when spirometry is nondiagnostic. Peak expiratory flow variability over 1–2 weeks can support the diagnosis if diurnal variability exceeds about 10% in adults or 13% in children, but I should confirm technique and use the same meter because inter-device variability can approach 20%. FeNO can be a supportive adjunct when the diagnosis remains uncertain or to phenotype type 2 inflammation, but I must not use FeNO in isolation to diagnose or monitor control, and I should remember confounders like atopy and smoking that affect FeNO levels [^113UoMjB] [^1143mPZ9] [^111rLE4B].

> I should confirm the role of small airways testing. Oscillometry and other small airway measures can detect dysfunction not captured by conventional spirometry and may be useful when symptoms persist despite normal FEV1/FVC. However, evidence for routine diagnostic use remains limited, variability is higher than spirometry, and standardization is evolving, so I will reserve these tools for selected cases or specialized settings rather than routine practice [^111vNNr6] [^117B8qF8] [^117JEMS7].

> Next, I should review how to use spirometry for monitoring. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: routine spirometry at every visit for stable asthma has not consistently improved patient-centered outcomes, so guidelines suggest against routine spirometry for stable patients. Instead, I should measure FEV1 at diagnosis, reassess 3–6 months after initiating or changing therapy, and periodically thereafter, using results to stratify future risk, as low FEV1, particularly less than 60% predicted, independently predicts exacerbations even when symptoms are few [^1146q5XR] [^114mgymL] [^114wjAeY].

> I need to check special populations and contexts. In children under 5, objective testing is often not feasible, so diagnosis relies on symptom patterns, treatment response, and careful exclusion of mimics. In older adults, fixed airflow obstruction is more common and age-adjusted interpretation is essential to avoid overdiagnosis. In primary care, underuse and misinterpretation of spirometry contribute to misclassification, so training and access remain critical. During exacerbations, documenting PEF or FEV1 before treatment and tracking serial changes guides severity assessment and disposition decisions [^113ze1Ms] [^115bdX5g] [^111kT4QB] [^113GzsoZ].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, but I should verify each branch against guidance. If spirometry shows obstruction with reversibility meeting 12% and 200 mL, that supports asthma. If spirometry is normal but suspicion remains high, repeat testing when symptomatic or proceed to bronchoprovocation. If already on ICS, consider step-down or carefully timed withholding to unmask variability. If monitoring stable asthma, prioritize symptom control and exacerbation risk while reserving spirometry for periodic risk assessment rather than routine visits. Throughout, integrate FeNO and PEF as adjuncts, not substitutes, and tailor to pretest probability and patient context [^112HHJDS] [^113WFRcb] [^114mgymL] [^1143mPZ9].

> Finally, I should double-check key caveats. Spirometry can rule in asthma when obstruction and reversibility are present, but it cannot reliably rule out asthma when results are normal. Marked post-bronchodilator increases in FEV1 exceeding 12% and 400 mL strongly favor asthma yet are not pathognomonic. And discordance between symptoms and lung function is common, so I must avoid anchoring on a single data point and instead integrate serial objective measures with clinical course and response to therapy [^11792zsF] [^113h6MdB] [^1135HjLy].

In asthma, spirometry shows **variable expiratory airflow limitation** with a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio and a **post-bronchodilator FEV1 increase ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL** [^112HHJDS] from baseline, indicating reversibility [^11792zsF]. FEV1 is often normal or mildly reduced between exacerbations, and a low FEV1 (< 60% predicted) signals higher exacerbation risk and long-term decline [^114wjAeY]. Spirometry can be normal in well-controlled or mild asthma, so **normal results do not exclude asthma** [^1135HjLy]; if suspicion remains, use bronchoprovocation or FeNO to confirm variable airflow limitation [^113MyjHg] [^1147h6Tf]. Routine spirometry is recommended at diagnosis and periodically to assess control and risk, but not for routine monitoring of stable asthma [^111aC4up] [^112eniPc].

---

## Typical spirometric findings in asthma

- **FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second)**: Often normal or mildly reduced between exacerbations; may be significantly reduced during exacerbations or in severe asthma [^112MfK2d].

- **FVC (forced vital capacity)**: Typically normal or mildly reduced; may be reduced in severe asthma or during exacerbations.

- **FEV1/FVC ratio**: Reduced below the lower limit of normal (LLN), indicating airflow limitation [^11792zsF].

- **Bronchodilator reversibility**: Post-bronchodilator increase in FEV1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL from baseline is a hallmark of asthma [^112HHJDS].

---

## Spirometric patterns in different asthma severities

| **Severity** | **FEV1 (% predicted)** | **FEV1/FVC ratio** | **Bronchodilator reversibility** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | ≥ 80% | Normal or slightly reduced | Present |
| Moderate | 60–79% | Reduced | Present |
| Severe | < 60% | Significantly reduced | May be limited or absent |

---

## Clinical significance of spirometric values

- **FEV1**: Strong predictor of exacerbation risk and long-term decline; FEV1 < 60% predicted indicates higher risk [^114wjAeY].

- **Bronchodilator reversibility**: Confirms variable airflow limitation, supporting the asthma diagnosis [^112HHJDS].

- **Normal spirometry**: Does not exclude asthma, especially in well-controlled or mild disease [^112rNsHe].

---

## Limitations and challenges of spirometry in asthma

- **Variability**: Asthma is variable; spirometry may be normal during asymptomatic periods [^112rNsHe].

- **Effort dependence**: Requires patient cooperation and effort, which can be challenging for children and some adults [^111vNNr6].

- **Small airway involvement**: Standard spirometry may not detect small airway dysfunction [^111vNNr6].

---

## Role of spirometry in asthma management

Spirometry is essential at diagnosis to confirm **variable airflow limitation** and establish baseline lung function [^116i3ybZ]. Periodic spirometry helps **assess control and future risk**, particularly when symptoms are discordant with lung function [^114mgymL]. However, routine spirometry is not recommended for monitoring stable asthma because it **does not improve outcomes** [^1146q5XR].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive tests

When spirometry is normal or inconclusive, **bronchoprovocation testing** (methacholine or mannitol) can confirm airway hyperresponsiveness [^1147h6Tf]. FeNO is an adjunct in diagnostic uncertainty or when spirometry is not feasible [^113MyjHg]. Oscillometry detects small airway dysfunction and can complement spirometry, especially in children or when effort is limited [^111vNNr6].

---

Spirometry in asthma demonstrates **variable expiratory airflow limitation** with reversibility, and normal results do not exclude asthma. It is essential for diagnosis and risk assessment, but routine monitoring of stable asthma is not recommended.

Risk of bias

Two risks of bias and quality assessment tools were used in this systematic review, based on the design of the included studies. Six studies were assessed using the NOS(see figure 2A). This highlighted potential methodological issues in most studies, possibly affecting the reliability of the results and the reporting of study follow-up. There was an overall high risk of bias around patient selection, the representativeness of cases and cohorts, and the periods when patients were identified. One study was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB2)(see figure 2B). The risk of bias was found to be high, due to some concerns regarding randomisation and missing data and high risk due to deviation from intended intervention. Plots were created using the risk-of-bias visualisation (robvis) tool.

Results of individual studies

Spirometry (forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity (FEF25–75, FEF25, FEF50 and FEF75))

Forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity

Five studies reported FEF25–75. The test values were presented in different units: Crater et al reported absolute values in L/sec, while both Razi et al and Razi et al reported FEF25–75 in % predicted and absolute values in L/sec. Two studies, Tsaroucha et al and Brandao et al, reported FEF25–75 in % predicted only. Of the five studies, three included baseline and follow-up measurements; two reported a 2-week follow-up data, and one reported an 8-week follow-up. The results from the included studies are summarised below by measurement technique, highlighting individual study characteristics and key findings.

Crater et al recruited 113 participants divided into three groups: 53 healthy controls, 52 with acute asthma and eight with stable asthma. The study examined the relationship between pulmonary function and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), with participants undergoing spirometry and providing mixed vital capacity samples for eNO measurement. Patients with acute asthma demonstrated significantly lower values across FEV1, PEF, FEF25–75 and eNO compared with both stable asthma and control groups, with FEF25–75 showing particularly marked impairment.

Healthcare provider-related clinical inertia in asthma

Under- and misdiagnosis in asthma

Asthma is one of those diseases for which diagnostic criteria are not absolute. The GINA guidelines suggest a flow for diagnosing asthma if respiratory symptoms typical of asthma, such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough, are present. Past medical history and laboratory results are useful for the diagnosis of asthma, and spirometry tests show expiratory airflow obstruction. The proposed flow is to diagnose asthma when there is reversibility or diurnal variation in peak flow.

Management of patients with asthma requires that healthcare providers take two steps: diagnosis and treatment. One form of CI is underdiagnosis, resulting in the patient not being initiated on appropriate treatment. In a study of adult patients with morbid obesity (body mass index: ≥ 35 kg/m²), of the 54 patients whose physicians ruled out a diagnosis of asthma, 17 (31%) were later determined to have undiagnosed asthma based on respiratory symptoms suggesting airflow limitation using the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), and spirometry. Adams et al.examined 3422 randomly selected adults aged 18 years and older, who were examined by a physician, tested for allergies, and underwent spirometry. They found that 11.6% of participants had asthma but that asthma was undiagnosed in 19.2% of those with asthma. Participants with undiagnosed asthma had lower values for respiratory function, such as forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity, compared with those with diagnosed asthma.

An analysis of spirometry patterns showed that 6.1% of patients diagnosed with asthma had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and conversely, 56.3% of patients diagnosed with COPD were re-diagnosed with asthma. In other words, some healthcare providers do not clearly distinguish between asthma and COPD. A study of patients with COPD and no indication for ICS use found that one-quarter of the patients had a history of ICS prescription.

This underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis due to unawareness of asthma are crucial components of CI among healthcare providers, which hinders the introduction of appropriate initial and intensified treatment.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma — values and preferences emphasize how individuals use the potential benefits, harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience of measures in relation to one another, and in general, values and preferences increase the strength of the recommendation when there is high concordance and decrease it when there is great variability. In a situation in which the balance of benefits and risks are uncertain, eliciting the values and preferences of patients and empowering them and their surrogates to make decisions consistent with their goals of care becomes even more important. A recommendation can be described as having "similar values", "some variation", or "large variation" in typical values and preferences, and discussion questions include "Are you confident about the typical values and preferences and are they similar across the target population?", "What are the patient's values and preferences?", and "Are the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population?".

### Physiological tests of small airways function in diagnosing asthma: a systematic review [^117B8qF8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common but heterogeneous disease characterised by chronic airway inflammation and clinically defined by the presence of respiratory symptoms that vary over time and in intensity. Physiologically, asthma is characterised by variable expiratory airflow limitation which may become persistent over time. Symptoms and airflow limitation can be extremely variable, including the age of onset, triggers for symptoms, the decline in lung function and therapeutic response.

It is estimated that 339 million people are affected by asthma globallybut diagnosing asthma is often challenging as there is no gold standard test. This has led to a high burden of undiagnosed disease, especially in children and older adults. According to current guidelines, a diagnosis of asthma should be objectively supported with an assessment of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) reversibility. However, some patients with asthma have no evidence of reversibility or airflow obstructionand airflow obstruction and reversibility are seen in patients with alternative diagnoses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, the forced manoeuvres required for spirometry requires effort and coordination, which can be difficult for some individuals.

In the past, asthma was thought to only affect larger airwaysbut current evidence suggests that small airways (defined as airways of ≤ 2 mm in diameter) are affected as well. The small airways may form a site of active disease, even in the absence of airflow obstruction. If the small airways are the first to be affected in asthma, identifying small airways dysfunction (SAD) may help identify asthma earlier, enabling treatment. However, there are a large number of tests that report small airways function. Some of these are being used as secondary outcomes in experimental studies of asthma, to determine asthma phenotype and assess the response to new therapies. The evidence to support the use of any physiological test of small airways function in the diagnosis of asthma is unclear.

This systematic review aimed to assess the evidence to support the use of commonly reported physiological tests of small airways function to diagnose asthma in adults, and assess if the selected tests should be included in future clinical studies of the disease.

Fig. 1
Long-term variability of lung function and IOS parameters in stable COPD and asthma: SDbv (A) and COV (B) using GraphPad Prism 5 (Graphing replicates or error bars plot: Median). See Table 1 and Table 2 legend for expansion of abbreviations

The COR data during a period of stable disease for the two patient groups (Table 2) are novel. We showed that variations in R5 up to 35% in COPD and 36% in asthma were typical of stable patients. Variations in R20 up to 47% in COPD and 46% asthma can be present, equivalent to R5-R20 up to 46% in COPD and 47% in asthma, the COR values < 66% were considered good repeatability, the COR values of IOS resistance parameters and spirometry parameters were similar between COPD and asthma, and the COR values of IOS reactance parameters in asthma were higher than in COPD. However, the repeatability of spirometry parameters, IOS resistance parameters and AX with high ICC values noted, the repeatability of Freq and X5 with ICC values < 0.8 was low in COPD and asthma. Moreover, the relative CORs of IOS parameters were more variable compare to spirometry, but importantly, the ICCs of IOS resistance parameters were similar.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114Sz8fv]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring — After starting ICS, personal best PEF from twice daily readings is reached on average within 2 weeks, and average PEF continues to increase while diurnal PEF variability decreases for about 3 months; excessive variation suggests suboptimal control. Long-term PEF monitoring is now generally only recommended for patients with severe asthma or impaired perception of airflow limitation, and for clinical practice, displaying PEF on a standardized chart may improve interpretation; clinic-based and home-recorded spirometry are not interchangeable.

---

### Usefulness of monitoring lung function in asthma [^11222LwD]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

There is no firm evidence from randomised controlled trials that routine monitoring of lung function improves asthma control in children. Guidelines for management of asthma consistently recommend routine home monitoring of peak expiratory flow (PEF) in each patient. However, changes in PEF poorly reflect changes in asthma activity, PEF diaries are kept very unreliably, and self management programmes including PEF monitoring are no more effective than programmes solely based on education and symptom monitoring. PEF diaries may still be useful in isolated cases of diagnostic uncertainty, in the identification of exacerbating factors, and in the rare case of children perceiving airways obstruction poorly and exacerbating frequently and severely. If a reliable assessment of airways obstruction in asthma is needed, forced expiratory flow-volume curves are the preferred method. Monitoring of hyperresponsiveness and nitric oxide cannot be recommended for routine use at present. Clinical judgement and expiratory flow-volume loops remain the cornerstone of monitoring asthma in secondary care.

### Don't diagnose or manage asthma without spirometry.… [^113AoLag]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinicians often rely solely upon symptoms when diagnosing and managing asthma, but these symptoms may be misleading and be from alternate causes. Therefore, spirometry is essential to confirm the diagnosis in those patients who can perform this procedure. Recent guidelines highlight spirometry's value in stratifying disease severity and monitoring control. History and physical exam alone may over- or underestimate asthma control. Beyond the increased costs of care, repercussions of misdiagnosing asthma include delaying a correct diagnosis and treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11792zsF]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 7–3: Spirometric measures in asthma and COPD — reduced post-BD FEV1/FVC (< lower limit of normal, or < 0.7) indicates airflow limitation in asthma but is required for diagnosis of COPD and required for diagnosis of asthma+COPD. Post-BD increase in FEV1 ≥ 12% and 200 mL from baseline (reversible airflow limitation) is usual at some time in course of asthma but may not be present when well controlled or on ICS-containing therapy, and is common and more likely when FEV1 is low. Post-BD increase in FEV1 > 12% and 400 mL from baseline (marked reversibility) has high probability of asthma, is unusual in COPD, and is compatible with asthma+COPD.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111K9Vft]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis — In patients with chronic respiratory symptoms, diagnosis involves a stepwise approach beginning with whether the patient is likely to have chronic airways disease, then syndromic categorization as having typical asthma, typical COPD, features of both, and/or with other conditions such as bronchiectasis; lung function testing is essential to confirm persistent airflow limitation, and variable airflow obstruction can be detected with serial peak flow measurements and/or measurements before and after bronchodilator.

### Can measures of small airway dysfunction aid with the diagnosis or management of asthma exacerbations? A systematic review [^1115o4Mr]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory airway disease marked by airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, airway remodelling and underlying inflammation. Asthma affects people of all ages and is common. In 2019, it was estimated that over 260 million people globally had poorly controlled asthma. Due to structural alterations in the airways, people with asthma are susceptible to long-term airflow restriction. Only a small percentage of individuals experience severe obstruction, which is correlated with factors such as genetic predisposition, age at onset, length and severity of the disease, environmental exposures and inadequate therapy. The diagnosis of asthma remains a clinical one, with no gold standard test to identify the disease. In stable disease, there has been increasing interest in the use of small airways tests to diagnose and monitor asthma, as the small airways have been shown to represent an area of significant inflammation without impacting the results of tests which assess the large airways.

Asthma exacerbations are acute episodes marked by worsening symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing and a marked, progressive decrease in respiratory function. Asthma exacerbations burden patients, society and healthcare systems. As with stable asthma, there is no gold-standard test to diagnose an asthma exacerbation. Asthma exacerbations have been traditionally diagnosed and their severity assessed by clinical symptoms, physical examination and some physiology tests including the peak expiratory flow (PEF). In clinical studies, alongside clinical features and PEF, spirometric-based tests have been used including FEV1 and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC). However, published evidence suggests that the correlation between conventional lung function measurements (ie, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and PEF) and asthma symptoms is weak. Reasons for this are unclear and might include the involvement of small airway dysfunction in exacerbations which is not adequately detected by traditional tests of large airways function.

### Making the diagnosis of asthma [^112rNsHe]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tests can only increase or decrease the probability of the asthma diagnosis, so a thorough history is very important. In patients with asthma-like symptoms, spirometric evidence of airway obstruction plus a large bronchodilator response makes asthma much more likely. However, normal spirometry is common in patients with mild asthma who are not symptomatic at the time of testing, and patients with poorly controlled asthma may lack substantial bronchodilator response. Inhalation challenge test often helps confirm asthma in patients with normal spirometry. Adult smokers with intermittent respiratory symptoms may have either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Normal post-bronchodilator spirometry rules out COPD. In patients with airway obstruction, a low diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide increases the probability of COPD and makes asthma much less likely. A high exhaled nitric oxide level makes allergic asthma more likely. Response to inhaled corticosteroids makes asthma more likely and COPD less likely.

5 ASSESSMENT OF ASTHMA OUTCOMES

Yearly in‐office spirometry evaluations to determine FEV 1 are recommended, as per the 2012 European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task Force, for patients with asthma aged 3–95 years. 24, 29 For children with symptoms of poorly controlled asthma, such as exercise limitations or suspected nonresponse to treatment, high‐level assessments, such as evaluation of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, are recommended in a specialist's office. 24 In addition, short‐term monitoring of peak expiratory flow can be used to evaluate response to treatment because variation in peak expiratory flow is associated with poor asthma control. 2 Ideally, a patient's asthma control should be assessed 1‐3 months after starting treatment and every 3‐12 months thereafter, as well as within 1 week of an exacerbation. 2 As a child gets older, additional measures can be taken to protect lung growth, including age‐appropriate counseling on smoking avoidance/cessation, assessment of symptom reversibility with conventional therapy, occupational counseling, and environmental assessment.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115TQgF8]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Pre- or post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic approach — notes that, in line with other National and International guidelines, GOLD has recommended using post-bronchodilator values when considering a diagnosis of COPD; however, it is now recognised that the bronchodilator response has little value in differentiating asthma from COPD, that pre-bronchodilator values are reproducible, and that obstruction only found on post-bronchodilator measurements is uncommon. Obtaining post-bronchodilator values is more time consuming. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry can be used as an initial test in symptomatic patients, and if it does not show obstruction, performing post-bronchodilator spirometry is not necessary unless there is a very high clinical suspicion of COPD.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spirometry in primary care [^1135HjLy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

COPD can be estimated with high diagnostic accuracy using spirometry. It is also possible to rule in asthma with spirometry. However, asthma can not be ruled out only using spirometry. This diagnostic uncertainty leads to an overestimation of asthma presence. Patients with inconclusive spirometric results should be referred for NO – measurement and/or bronchial provocation if possible to guarantee accurate diagnosis.

### How to use the fractional exhaled nitric oxide test [^116Gifhy]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical questions

Can the test be used to diagnose asthma? Is FeNO more accurate than spirometry or peak flow diaries?

Asthma is a clinical diagnosis and as a result, there is no single diagnostic test. NICE guidelines recommend that for children under 5 years with suspected asthma, their symptoms should be treated according to clinical judgement and have regular reviews. Once they reach 5 years, symptomatic children should undergo objective testing, including spirometry, bronchodilator reversibility or FeNO testing.

Asthma can be diagnosed if the patient has symptoms suggestive of asthma and a FeNO level of ≥ 35 ppb with positive peak flow variability or obstructive spirometry with positive bronchodilator reversibility (table 2). In children, a FeNO level of ≥ 35 ppb makes asthma (and a response to ICS) very likely.

Table 2
A table to show the positive test thresholds for objective tests used to diagnose asthma in children and young people (aged 5 years and older)

Current guidance advocating serial monitoring (peak flow readings or spirometry) to confirm diagnosis may miss mild asthma as abnormal airway physiology may be undetectable, suggesting these tests used serially have a low sensitivity.

Research has shown that the predictive values for FeNO are higher than that of traditional diagnostic methods. Table 3 below summarises the diagnostic accuracy of FeNO compared with traditional methods.

Diagnosis confirmation in suspected difficult-to-treat asthma — spirometry, thresholds, and bronchodilator withholding: Confirmation of the diagnosis is important, because in 12–50% of people assumed to have severe asthma, asthma is not found to be the correct diagnosis; perform spirometry, before and after bronchodilator, to assess baseline lung function and seek objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, and if initial bronchodilator responsiveness testing is negative (≤ 200 mL or ≤ 12% increase in FEV1), consider repeating after withholding bronchodilators or when symptomatic or stepping controller treatment before further investigations such as bronchial provocation testing; check full flow-volume curve to assess for upper airway obstruction; if spirometry is normal or is not available, provide a peak flow meter and diary and consider bronchial provocation testing if able to withhold bronchodilators (short-acting beta2 agonist [SABA] for at least 6 hours, LABA for up to 2 days depending on duration of action).

### Spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma in children [^112PQpUZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the diagnostic accuracy of lung function measurements made using spirometry for childhood asthma, recent guidelines for the measurement and interpretation of spirometric lung function tests and recent developments for diagnosing asthma.

Recent Findings

Measurements of lung function and bronchial lability made using spirometry may not perform any better than other tests such as skin prick testing, or measurements of exhaled nitric oxide for diagnosing asthma. New guidelines are available.

Summary

Spirometry is a simple, robust and widely available tool for investigating lung function. There are published guidelines for making measurements and their interpretation. The place of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma, however, needs clarification. The diagnostic profiles of measurements of bronchodilator responsiveness and bronchial hyperreactivity made using spirometry, although reasonable, are not perfect. In schoolchildren, they are no better than knowledge of aeroallergen sensitization when considering a diagnosis of asthma.

### Distinguishing asthma and COPD in primary care: a case-based approach [^114Ze2M6]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect more than 40 million Americans, cost more than $100 billion annually, and together constitute the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. Distinguishing between asthma and COPD can be difficult; accurate diagnosis requires spirometry that demonstrates a characteristic pattern. Asthma is diagnosed if airway obstruction on spirometry is reversible (greater than 12% and greater than 200 mL improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]) with administration of bronchodilators or through the observation of bronchoconstriction (reduction in FEV1 of 20% or greater) with a methacholine challenge. COPD is diagnosed if airway obstruction (FEV1/forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC] ratio less than 70%) on spirometry is not reversible with bronchodilators. Although not considered a separate diagnosis, asthma-COPD overlap can be a useful clinical descriptor for patients displaying diagnostic features of both diseases. In these cases, spirometry will show reversibility after administration of bronchodilators, which is consistent with asthma, and the persistent baseline airflow limitation that is more characteristic of COPD. Treatment should follow Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines. In patients with asthma-COPD overlap, pharmacotherapy should primarily follow asthma guidelines, but pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches specific to COPD may also be needed.

FeNO testing in asthma — In individuals aged 5 y and older with diagnostic uncertainty despite history, clinical findings, clinical course, and spirometry (or when spirometry cannot be performed), the Expert Panel conditionally recommends the addition of FeNO measurement as an adjunct to evaluation, and in those aged 5 y and older with persistent allergic asthma and uncertainty in anti-inflammatory therapy decisions, conditionally recommends FeNO as part of an ongoing monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessments; however, in individuals aged 5 y and older with asthma, the Expert Panel recommends against use of FeNO measurements in isolation to assess control, predict exacerbations, or assess exacerbation severity and, if used, it should be part of ongoing monitoring and management, and in children aged 0–4 y with recurrent wheezing, the Expert Panel recommends against FeNO measurement to predict the future development of asthma.

Summary of the evidence

No RCTs could be found to address Question 2.1 (see Appendix B EtD Table I).

More than 50 studies have been conducted, and some of these studies included healthy and symptomatic individuals, smokers and nonsmokers, atopic and nonatopic individuals, and individuals with and without a prior diagnosis of asthma. The protocols for diagnostic Fassessments varied, and conclusions about the optimal testing protocol remain uncertain.

Based on the Expert Panel's interpretation of the literature and the systematic review report findings, the overall certainty of evidence for this recommendation is moderate. The Expert Panel considers implementation of the recommendation in a broad population to be appropriate based on the diversity of the populations included in the systematic review report. The imprecision in the studies on the utility of Fmeasurement in asthma diagnosis is notable.

Rationale and discussion

In the Expert Panel's opinion, an additional tool to aid in diagnosing asthma could be beneficial, especially when that tool may help identify specific asthma phenotypes. The Expert Panel considered many facets of harm, risk, opportunity, and benefits in making its recommendation.

The acceptability of Fmeasurement to individuals with a potential diagnosis of asthma is likely to be high, given that the test involves minimal effort and does not incur discomfort or side effects. Publications on studies that used Ftesting did not report any overt harms. The Expert Panel noted that most studies conducted Fmeasurements only in specialty care research settings, and few data are available on the use of Fmeasurement in primary care settings. As with many innovations, the cost of Fequipment and testing may limit its broader use. These barriers to broader dissemination could have a negative impact on the availability of Ftesting and lead to less equitable care for populations with limited resources.

Questions 2.2 and 2.3

What is the clinical utility of Fmeasurements to select medication options (including corticosteroids) for individuals aged 5 years and older?
What is the clinical utility of Fmeasurements to monitor response to treatment in individuals aged 5 years and older?

Recommendation 2: In individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent allergic asthma, for whom there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends the addition of Fmeasurement as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessments.

Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence

Key messages

The quality of childhood asthma diagnostic guidelines is highly variable.
The evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations is generally of very poor quality.
There is discrepant advice on recommended diagnostic tests and thresholds across guidelines.

### Novel measure of lung function for assessing disease activity in asthma [^113jRB51]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Key messages

In asthma, spirometric measurements associated with airways resistance are often discordant with other clinical features of disease activity or control.

This study demonstrates that a novel technology measuring the evenness of lung expansion and contraction can reflect these clinical features better than spirometry.

A reliable, objective measure of disease activity in asthma would be very valuable for both patient management and clinical research.

Spirometry plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of asthma. The hallmark spirometry finding of expiratory airflow variability can be demonstrated in several ways including peak airflow and bronchodilator and bronchoprovocation testing. Challenges of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis underscore the need to consider clinical context while interpreting these tests. A meticulous and multifaceted approach prioritizing objective testing is imperative while diagnosing asthma.

What are the goals of diagnosis and treatment in asthma?

Correct diagnosis is essential to ensure that every patient receives treatment appropriate to their condition and, unfortunately, misdiagnosis of asthma is still common. Correct diagnosis of asthma is generally based on a history of symptoms, family history (e.g. atopic disease), physical examination and, as the essential part of the diagnostic process, demonstration of variable airflow limitation by spirometry or peak flow measurement, with consideration of differential diagnoses, (Table 1).

Table 1
Factors in asthma diagnosis in adults.

Various guidelines and reports, such as the GINA Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention, have been developed with the aim of providing consistency of asthma treatment around the world. Most guidelines share a 'step care' approach to treatment, with the aim of achieving daily asthma control and preventing exacerbations (future risk) using the lowest level of medication needed to achieve these goals (Fig. 2). Controller medication should be stepped up or down in line with the observed variations in level of asthma control which can be detected by regular assessment, treatment and review.

Post-bronchodilator spirometry and reversibility testing — practice guidance: Post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, but assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction (e.g., measuring FEV1 before and after bronchodilator or corticosteroids) to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended because the degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate the diagnosis from asthma or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids; accordingly, it is not necessary to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

### Can measures of small airway dysfunction aid with the diagnosis or management of asthma exacerbations? A systematic review [^113RM5af]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

The findings of this systematic review suggest that small airway function tests are feasible during exacerbations and may aid in monitoring improvement. However, given that small airway function was not a primary outcome in most included studies and the limited number of RCTs, the evidence remains inconclusive regarding their added value over traditional lung function measures. More research is needed to determine which tests, if any, provide clinically meaningful information and whether small airway dysfunction during exacerbations is consistent across all asthma patients or varies by specific phenotypes. Previous studies have highlighted the role of small airways in asthma heterogeneity, with evidence suggesting that small airway dysfunction is present across multiple asthma subtypes and may be associated with worse disease outcomes.

Incorporating these tests into clinical practice could provide a more comprehensive assessment of airway function, particularly in patients whose symptoms are not adequately reflected by traditional spirometry. Small airway function tests may facilitate earlier detection of exacerbations, allowing for timely intervention or the development of new interventions if incorporated into clinical trials. This could potentially reduce the severity and duration of exacerbations, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Tests like IOS that do not require forced breathing manoeuvres are easier for patients to perform, especially during exacerbations. This can improve patient compliance and the reliability of test results, thereby enhancing clinical decision-making.

Despite the promising findings, several limitations need to be addressed. The heterogeneity in study designs, patient populations and outcome measures poses challenges in generalising the results. Additionally, small airway function tests exhibit variability in measurement techniques, with differences in device calibration, reference equations and interpretation thresholds leading to inconsistencies across studies. Moreover, the availability of small airway function tests in routine clinical practice remains limited, and their cost-effectiveness needs further evaluation.

Furthermore, while alternative spirometric measures such as FEV₃ and FEV₆ have been proposed for early airflow limitation detection, their clinical relevance in asthma and exacerbation settings remains under investigation. They were not included in this review due to limited validation and lack of standardised reference ranges

Addressing these challenges through large-scale studies could pave the way for a more nuanced understanding and management of asthma exacerbations. Developing standardised protocols for test administration and interpretation will be crucial for their widespread adoption. Integrating these tests with existing diagnostic frameworks could facilitate earlier detection of exacerbations and potentially improve patient outcomes by allowing for timely interventions.

### A stepwise approach to the interpretation of pulmonary function tests… [^1162n8D6]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Step 6: Bronchoprovocation If PFT results are normal but the physician still suspects exercise- or allergen-induced asthma, the next step is bronchoprovocation, such as a methacholine challenge, a mannitol inhalation challenge, exercise testing, or sometimes eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea testing. 15, 16 When the FEV 1 is 70% or more of predicted on standard spirometry, bronchoprovocation should be used to make the diagnosis. If the FEV 1 is less than 70% of predicted, a therapeutic trial of a bronchodilator may be considered.
17. METHACHOLINE CHALLENGE The methacholine challenge is highly sensitive for diagnosing asthma; however, its low specificity results in false-positive results. 15, 17 A positive methacholine challenge result is defined as a greater than 20% reduction in FEV 1 at or before administration of 4 mg per mL of inhaled methacholine. 15 The result is considered borderline if the FEV 1 drops by 20% at a dose between 4 and 16 mg per mL.
15.

MANNITOL INHALATION CHALLENGE The mannitol inhalation challenge has a lower sensitivity for the diagnosis of asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction than the methacholine challenge, but has a higher specificity for the diagnosis of asthma. 16, 17 A positive mannitol inhalation challenge result is defined as a greater than 15% decrease from baseline in FEV 1 at a cumulative dose of 635 mg or less of inhaled mannitol, or a 10% decrease between any two consecutive doses. 16, 17. EXERCISE TESTING A treadmill exercise test has excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, but has only modest sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of asthma. 17 In this test, baseline spirometry is measured, followed by exercise on a treadmill. The goal is to achieve 80% to 90% of the maximum heart rate within two minutes, and maintain that heart rate for eight minutes.

17 Inhaled medical-grade dry air or an air-conditioned room, with air temperature between 60°F and 77°F and humidity level less than 50%, is recommended. The patient must wear a nose clip.

### Asthma diagnosis using patient-reported outcome measures and objective diagnostic tests: now and into the future [^111bZLC5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The global prevalence of asthma continues to increase; however, asthma remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. This results in a significant burden on the healthcare system and preventable patient morbidity and mortality. Over-diagnosis of asthma based on clinical history alone also complicates patient management. This heightens the importance of a prompt and accurate asthma diagnosis. Therefore, a review of the literature was performed regarding both objective diagnostic testing for asthma and using patient-reported outcome measures.

Recent Findings

The cornerstone of asthma diagnosis remains spirometry with testing for bronchodilator reversibility testing for pediatric and adult populations. This test may need to be repeated at multiple time points due to its low sensitivity. Peak flow measurement, fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing, and allergy testing are useful adjuncts to the diagnosis and phenotyping of asthma. Bronchoprovocation testing is reserved for people with high clinical suspicion for asthma, but negative spirometry. Novel noninvasive testing modalities may play a diagnostic role in the future. The advent of remote digital health monitoring technology has resulted in revisiting patient-reported outcome measures for the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma.

Summary

Overall, improved diagnostic tools for asthma are crucial for earlier recognition and treatment of the disease and improved patient care outcomes worldwide.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spirometry in primary care [^111Ktbbr]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

In contrast to these promising results is the limited value of spirometry in excluding asthma. This might be explained by the reversibility of airway obstruction in asthma. It proved possible to speculate that patients with mild or moderate asthma show no airway obstruction when spirometry is performed. In these cases, it was necessary for the GP to estimate the presence or absence of asthma on the basis of the patient history and inconclusive spirometry. This was misleading in 53 (24.2%) of cases (46 patients false positive and 7 patients false negative). Therefore, alternative methods need to be found for diagnosing asthma in primary care. Guidelines recommend using the measurement of peak-flow-variability to diagnose asthma in case of inconclusive spirometry. However, the low diagnostic value of peak-flow-variability in primary care has already been demonstrated. The SAPALDIA study, which used an epidemiologic approach, has also shown a poor diagnostic value. The measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) which is elevated in eosinophilic airway inflammation has been shown to be more promising, although the technology is expensive. Therefore, patients suspected of having asthma might be tested with NO measurement or should be referred for bronchial provocation if possible to guarantee accurate diagnosis. Nevertheless, spirometry should be used in diagnosing asthma, as the positive predictive value has been comparatively high in general practice.

### Diagnostic accuracy of FEV1 / forced vital capacity ratio z scores in asthmatic patients [^111gkcfG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio is used as a criterion for airflow obstruction; however, the test characteristics of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma are not well established. The accuracy of a test depends on the pretest probability of disease.

Objective

We wanted to estimate the FEV1/FVC ratio z score threshold with optimal accuracy for the diagnosis of asthma for different pretest probabilities.

Methods

Asthmatic patients enrolled in 4 trials from the Asthma Clinical Research Centers were included in this analysis. Measured and predicted FEV1/FVC ratios were obtained, with calculation of z scores for each participant. Across a range of asthma prevalences and z score thresholds, the overall diagnostic accuracy was calculated.

Results

One thousand six hundred eight participants were included (mean age, 39 years; 71% female; 61% white). The mean FEV1 percent predicted value was 83% (SD, 15%). In a symptomatic population with 50% pretest probability of asthma, optimal accuracy (68%) is achieved with a z score threshold of -1.0 (16th percentile), corresponding to a 6 percentage point reduction from the predicted ratio. However, in a screening population with a 5% pretest probability of asthma, the optimum z score is -2.0 (second percentile), corresponding to a 12 percentage point reduction from the predicted ratio. These findings were not altered by markers of disease control.

Conclusion

Reduction of the FEV1/FVC ratio can support the diagnosis of asthma; however, the ratio is neither sensitive nor specific enough for diagnostic accuracy. When interpreting spirometric results, consideration of the pretest probability is an important consideration in the diagnosis of asthma based on airflow limitation.

### Baseline spirometry parameters as predictors of airway hyperreactivity in adults with suspected asthma [^113nnRSq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Methacholine challenge tests (MCTs) are used to detect and assess airway hyperreactivity (AHR). MCT has a negative predictive value of almost 90% for the provocative concentration causing a 20% fall (PC20) in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) when PC20 is greater than 16 mg/ml, which makes it useful for excluding the diagnosis of asthma, especially in the setting of equivocal spirometry findings, in the presence of typical asthma symptoms. Even though bronchial provocation tests are generally safe, they are time consuming and costly and often require a referral to a specialized testing center. Thus, it is of interest to minimize the amount of testing by predicting which patients will have a negative outcome in the MCT.

Several variables derived from the Maximal Expiratory Flow Volume (MEFV) curve have been suggested as possible predictors of AHR. Two possible candidates are the forced expiratory flow rate between 25 and 75% of vital capacity (FEF 25–75%) and at 50% of vital capacity (FEF 50%). They are considered approximate measures of the flow in the peripheral airways and a reduction in either variable may therefore represent airflow limitation in the small airways. A study analyzing AHR in asthmatics showed that FEF 50% percent of predicted was the best surrogate marker among all standard lung function variables to predict PC20 < 4 mg/ml, including FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, and FEF 25–75%. No studies have investigated the predictive ability of these variables in a general population consisting of both asthmatics and healthy individuals.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111rLE4B]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma — use cases, limitations, and operational considerations for FeNO testing: FeNO testing has a supportive role in evaluation when the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain, and individuals who may benefit include those aged 5 years and older who have an uncertain diagnosis of asthma and those in whom spirometry testing cannot be performed accurately. Because the data on the diagnostic accuracy of FeNO measurement in children younger than 4 years are not conclusive, FeNO measurement in this age group should not be used. FeNO test results should not be used alone to diagnose asthma; FeNO measurements can serve as an adjunct test when the results of a thorough clinical assessment, including other appropriate tests, are inconclusive. FeNO measurements should be performed by appropriately trained personnel, FeNO testing can be performed in primary or specialty care settings, and the costs of testing may prohibit adoption in the primary care office setting; recognition of allergen sensitivity is extremely important for interpreting FeNO levels because allergic rhinitis and atopy are associated with increased FeNO levels.

### Asthma update: part I. diagnosis, monitoring, and prevention of disease progression [^113kJiB9]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Despite increased scientific knowledge about asthma and improved therapeutic options, the disease continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel has updated its clinical guidelines on asthma medications, prevention of disease progression, and patient self-management. Diagnostic criteria have not changed, and identification of the disease relies on the physician's analysis of the patient's symptoms, family history, and spirometric measurements of lung function. Classification of asthma severity also has not changed, but many obstacles remain, including the variability of asthma and the classification system's inability to account for physical activity levels, which may result in significant underestimation of the severity of asthma. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recommends the use of written action plans with or without monitoring of peak expiratory flow, although evidence supporting these management techniques is inconclusive. Patients with asthma may benefit from earlier use of inhaled corticosteroids, which have been proven safe in the usual dosages. However, further studies are needed to determine whether inhaled corticosteroids can prevent the progression of asthma.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spirometry in primary care [^115emHzY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of spirometry for the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma in patients suspected of suffering from an obstructive airway disease (OAD) in primary care.

Methods

Cross sectional diagnostic study of 219 adult patients attending 10 general practices for the first time with complaints suspicious for OAD. All patients underwent spirometry and structured medical histories were documented. All patients received whole-body plethysmography (WBP) in a lung function laboratory. The reference standard was the Tiffeneau ratio (FEV 1 /VC) received by the spirometric maneuver during examination with WBP. In the event of inconclusive results, bronchial provocation was performed to determine bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR). Asthma was defined as a PC 20 fall after inhaling methacholine concentration ≤ 16 mg/ml.

Results

90 (41.1%) patients suffered from asthma, 50 (22.8%) suffered from COPD, 79 (36.1%) had no OAD. The sensitivity for diagnosing airway obstruction in COPD was 92% (95%CI 80–97); specificity was 84% (95%CI 77–89). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 63% (95%CI 51–73); negative predictive value (NPV) was 97% (95%CI 93–99). The sensitivity for diagnosing airway obstruction in asthma was 29% (95%CI 21–39); specificity was 90% (95%CI 81–95). PPV was 77% (95%CI 60–88); NPV was 53% (95%CI 45–61).

Conclusion

COPD can be estimated with high diagnostic accuracy using spirometry. It is also possible to rule in asthma with spirometry. However, asthma can not be ruled out only using spirometry. This diagnostic uncertainty leads to an overestimation of asthma presence. Patients with inconclusive spirometric results should be referred for nitric oxide (NO) – measurement and/or bronchial provocation if possible to guarantee accurate diagnosis.

### Asthma end points and outcomes: what have we learned? [^116YavZg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

In spite of the wide prevalence of asthma and its substantial consequences, the diagnosis and assessment of asthma has not been standardized, and the goals of therapy currently are not being achieved. Our purpose is to help delineate what the most important asthma end points are and what kinds of strategies we should use to guide therapy. Comparison of numerous studies reveals that asthma measures used routinely in the clinic, such as spirometric lung function, do not uniformly correlate with asthma control. We cannot improve outcomes until we determine which measures reveal the underlying disease process most clearly and at the same time offer ease of performance during routine office visits. We propose that by standardizing the way we collect and analyze data from our daily practice, we can better define which measures reflect true asthma control. Such measures most likely address a spectrum of changes occurring in the pathophysiology of asthma, notably distal airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Inflammation may provide the best opportunity for assessment and treatment, because if it is adequately addressed, airway sensitivity may improve, thereby reducing airway obstruction and subsequently minimizing exacerbations. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide as a measure of inflammation is suggested as offering the best combination of disease evaluation and practical implementation for improved asthma outcomes.

### Implications of the transition from zapletal to GLI reference values for spirometry [^111V6tp7]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The current standard for monitoring lung function in children with asthma is spirometry. In Europe, results of these lung function tests have been related to Zapletal reference values published in 1977. Recently, the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) published predicted values of spirometry for 5 ethnic groups, valid over an age range from 3 to 95 years. These reference values have been approved by many international lung societies, and the algorithms are increasingly being implemented globally. This report describes the consequences of the transition from Zapletal reference values to GLI reference values for 2 pediatric asthma patients, which include unexpected declines in lung function and the ability to take advantage of newly approved reimbursement for advanced therapy. The Zapletal and GLI reference values cannot be used interchangeably, and transition to the GLI values might lead to better treatment in the future.

### Diagnostic differentiation between asthma and COPD in primary care using lung function testing [^115Raemb]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we looked at which patient characteristics distinguish between patients diagnosed with asthma or COPD, and established the added value of spirometry and of more advanced lung function measurements when differentiating between the two chronic airways diseases. Although asthma and COPD are both heterogenous conditions with multiple overlapping features, there are important clinical differences as well. We observed that in the scenario using only medical history questions, it is already possible to reliably distinguish between asthma and COPD. The most important factors to aid differentiation are smoking behaviour, certain respiratory symptoms and the presence of allergies. The use of postbronchodilator spirometry provided important additional discriminative power in correctly labelling a patient as having asthma or COPD. More advanced diagnostic tests that are mainly used in secondary care, such as measuring bronchial hyperresponsiveness and diffusion capacity, did not provide a better differentiation in this primary care study population.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spirometry in primary care [^111ZZ8o2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common chronic disease with a high prevalence of approx. 5% in industrialized nations. It is characterized by a chronic inflammation process which induces bronchial hyper-responsiveness and in most cases, reversible airway obstruction. Another common pulmonary disease is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which shows irreversible airway obstruction, and which is mostly caused by inhaling tobacco smoke. The prevalence of COPD is estimated to be around 10% and expected to be the fourth most important cause of death in 2020. Due to this high morbidity, general practitioners play a key role in detecting the disease as they see patients during the earlier stages of disease. Spirometric investigation is seen as a gold standard for diagnosing airway obstruction. Therefore, office spirometry is increasingly seen as a quality standard in general practice.

The efficacy of spirometry in diagnosing COPD was demonstrated by a specialist team, which received referrals for performing spirometry and bronchodilator reversibility testing in patients suspected of having COPD. The DIDASCO Study revealed the difficulty of diagnosing COPD with screening questionnaires only and concluded that spirometry is essential for early diagnosis. These investigations focused on COPD only, which is marked by irreversible airway obstruction. The diagnostic value of spirometry for diagnosing asthma marked by reversible airway obstruction remains unclear. This is of importance, as asthma needs to be diagnosed by bronchial provocation testing when spirometry shows no airway obstruction. One diagnostic study in primary care used spirometry and bronchial provocation testing for identifying patients with asthma and COPD. However, this was only carried out in patients complaining of suffering from a cough; and spirometry was performed by a single specialist. Spirometry and bronchial provocation testing were also used in the DIMCA study. Indeed this was a screening study performed in a specialist center to detect patients in early stadiums of asthma or COPD.

Due to the design of these asthma and COPD trials, there is no evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of spirometry itself. Therefore, the true degree of the associated diagnostic uncertainty for patients with complaints suspected of having an airway obstruction remains unclear. The need for closing this gap of knowledge has been pointed out several times. The difficulty is that the pretest probability of a disease and its severity in primary care is lower when compared to a hospital setting, thus hampering the predictive values of diagnostic tests. Therefore, test results evaluated in hospital settings can not easily be transferred into general practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of spirometry for diagnosing airway obstruction in asthma and COPD in general practice.

### Office spirometry: indications and interpretation [^117NCPzZ]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

High-quality, office-based spirometry provides diagnostic information as useful and reliable as testing performed in a pulmonary function laboratory. Spirometry may be used to monitor progression of lung disease and response to therapy. A stepwise approach to spirometry allows for ease and reliability of interpretation. Airway obstruction is suspected when there is a decreased forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio, but there is no strong evidence to clearly define what constitutes a significant decrease in this ratio. A low FVC is defined as a value below the 5th percentile in adults or less than 80% of predicted in children and adolescents five to 18 years of age. The FEV1/FVC ratio and FVC are used together to identify obstructive defects and restrictive or mixed patterns. Obstructive defects should be assessed for reversibility, as indicated by an improvement of the FEV1 or FVC by at least 12% and 0.2 L in adults, or by more than 12% in children and adolescents five to 18 years of age after the administration of a short-acting bronchodilator. FEV1 is used to determine the severity of obstructive and restrictive disease, although the values were arbitrarily determined and are not based on evidence from patient outcomes. Bronchoprovocation testing may be used if spirometry results are normal and allergen- or exercise-induced asthma is suspected. For patients with an FEV1 less than 70% of predicted, a therapeutic trial of a short-acting bronchodilator may be tried instead of bronchoprovocation testing.

### The asthma diagnosis jigsaw puzzle: an adaptable teaching concept to facilitate the diagnosis of asthma in adults and children presenting to primary care [^112KkYgA]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction: what is the need for improved diagnosis of asthma in primary care given the availability of national and international guidelines?

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases encountered in primary care. The reported prevalence of asthma varies across countries, ranging from 1%–18%, although high rates of misdiagnosis are also well documented –. Evidence-based guidelines and consensus recommendations exist to support clinicians with asthma diagnosis –. For example, treatment pathways provided by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), start from diagnosis based on symptoms and a demonstration of variable airflow obstruction (and/or reversibility) using peak flow and/or spirometry. Where available, bronchodilator responsiveness (reversibility) testing is recommended for adults and children from 5 years, when they are symptomatic. However, in practice, this can be difficult as lung function is often normal when the patient is asymptomatic or has received treatment. There are currently no tests recommended for children < 5 years, typically diagnosis is based on history, observation and context, often over a period of time. In this group, asthma should be suspected if there are recurring episodes of cough, breathlessness and/or wheeze occurring with or between viral infections, that respond to bronchodilators or a trial of inhaled corticosteroids, and where there is a patient or family history of atopy.

Current guidelines and consensus statements are typically generated by respiratory specialists using data from research studies. Such guidelines are weighted towards specialist or secondary care settings and tend to be linear or algorithmic in approach. As such they do not capture or incorporate the expertise and flexibility used by expert practitioners in primary care in guideline implementation. Here, first contact presentations with multi-morbidity are increasingly common necessitating the use of multiple, sometimes overlapping, protocols, and information is often gathered in an iterative rather than linear manner. Additionally, access to diagnostic investigations (such as routine availability of peak flow meters or spirometry) and continuity of care is either limited or absent in many countries.

### Novel measure of lung function for assessing disease activity in asthma [^115YNXJM]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In asthma, lung function measures, such as spirometry, are often discordant with the clinical assessment of disease activity, as determined by symptoms, exacerbation frequency and response to treatment. There is no single diagnostic test for asthma, and both clinical assessment of symptoms and objective tests can produce false positives and false negatives. Spirometry may be normal in patients with active airways disease, and the diagnosis of asthma, for example, may require multiple measurements over time to demonstrate variable airflow obstruction. In addition, age-related changes in FEV 1 or fixed airflow obstruction may lead to overdiagnosis or treatment in older people. This disparity, alongside the fact that primary care clinicians may not have access to reliable lung function testing at the point of clinical decision-making, often leads clinicians to adopt a no-test approach to diagnosis and treatment.

Recently, Mountain et al. described a new approach to lung function testing that involved assessing the inhomogeneity of gas exchange in the lung. This study is a first look at whether this technique has the potential to provide a better measure of disease activity in the lungs of asthmatic patients than standard spirometry.

### Oscillometry in the diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring of asthma in children and adults [^111vNNr6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing asthma typically relies on clinical history, physical examination, and objective lung function test results. Spirometry, the gold standard for assessing lung function, is universally recommended for the diagnostic, assessment, and monitoring of asthma. It requires maximal respiratory effort that limits cooperation in certain populations and has limitations in detecting small airway dysfunction. Oscillometry requires minimal patient effort, is noninvasive, and provides valuable information on both large and small airways. Recent task force reports have suggested oscillometry as an alternative or a complementary lung function test to spirometry in the management of individuals with asthma. This review explores the scientific evidence and psychometric properties regarding oscillometry in the main purposes served by lung function testing in asthma, namely diagnosis, assessment of control and future risk, as well as longitudinal monitoring, including clinical utility. Furthermore, it addressed challenges and facilitators to implementation and future directions regarding its positioning as lung function testing in individuals with asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113h6MdB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Role of lung function in assessing asthma control — Lung function does not correlate strongly with asthma symptoms in adults or children. In some asthma control tools, lung function is numerically averaged or added with symptoms, but this is not recommended because if the tool includes several symptom items, these can outweigh clinically important differences in lung function. In addition, low FEV1 is a strong independent predictor of risk of exacerbations, even after adjustment for symptom frequency.

### Ascertainment of small airways dysfunction using oscillometry to better define asthma control and future risk: are we ready to implement It in clinical practice? [^1141VPwe]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The evidence suggests a clear advantage for including airway oscillometry into clinical practice for more accurate assessment, prediction of those at risk of deterioration, and management decision guidance. Clinicians would benefit from greater knowledge in terms of advantages and limitations to prescribe and interpret oscillometry. Further studies are ongoing to investigate the additive value of oscillometry to conventional spirometry and F. If a patient is not clinically responding to therapy despite normal spirometry, this is a strong indication for oscillometry. We recommend that oscillometry be considered for use in specialized care and community practice.

### When should a reversibility test be performed on patients with early stages of asthma and normal spirometry? [^114XseQT]. The Journal of Asthma (2008). Low credibility.

Subjects with bronchial asthmatic symptoms, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) and FEV(1)/forced vital capacity [FVC] > 80% could show a positive reversibility test with salbutamol in about 25% of the cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate if a limit functional value for spirometry exists where a reversibility test using salbutamol, over this limit, is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of asthma. Four hundred patients (mean age 31.12 ± 10.99) with asthmatic symptoms and normal spirometry (mean FEV(1) 96.06 ± 11.82%, mean FEV(1)/FVC 98.89 ± 6.03%) were recruited. The number of subjects with reversible airflow obstruction (RAO) was evaluated using the following different criteria of reversibility: FEV(1) and FVC ≥ 12%, peak expiratory flow (PEF) ≥ 15%, FEF(25–75) ≥ 35%, and at least one of these (ANY). In subjects with baseline FEV(1) > 100% (150 patients), 26 (17.3%) patients showed a FEV(1) increase > 12% and, among the criteria used, 45 patients (30%) showed ANY. In subjects with baseline FEV(1)/FVC > 100% (204 patients), 36 patients (17.6%) showed a FEV(1) increase > 12% and 53 patients (26.8%) showed ANY. In subjects with baseline FEF(25–75) > 70% (209 patients), 26 (12.44%) and 49 (23.44%) patients, respectively, showed an increase in FEV(1) > 12%, and ANY. In 56 patients with baseline cut-offs (evaluated together) FEV(1) > 100%, FEV(1)/FVC > 100% and FEF(25–75) > 70%, 10 patients (17.85%) showed a RAO with ANY. FEV(1) > 121% or FEV(1)/FVC > 110.8% or FEF(25–75) > 110% were cut-off values identified in this study where no RAO subjects were found over these limits. In conclusion, baseline FEV(1) > 100%, FEV(1)/FVC > 100% and FEF(25–75) > 70% cannot be considered cut-offs where it is not necessary to perform a reversibility test with a bronchodilator over these limits. It is improbable to find a positive reversibility test using salbutamol in patients with asthmatic symptoms and FEV(1) > 121% or FEV(1)/FVC > 110.8% or FEF(25–75) > 110% to confirm the diagnosis of asthma.

### Difficulties in the interpretation of lung function tests in the diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111sXsQB]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To ascertain differences in the interpretation of spirometry and peak flow measurement between primary care (several practioners and nurses) and specialists in patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Design

A randomized, prospective cohort study of 98 patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma or COPD. Two chest specialists independently interpreted the peak flow and spirometric data and they were also blinded to the primary care results.

Results

There was total agreement in interpretation of the data between general practitioners and specialists in only 20 (20.4%). Levels of diagnostic agreement were highest between the two chest specialists (55%) and lowest between the general practice records and the diagnosis assigned by general practitioners (16%). Disagreement between general practitioners and the two chest specialists was consistent (38%) indicating systematic differences in interpretation.

Conclusions

This study raises concerns about differences in the interpretation of spirometry and peak expiratory flow rates in general and hospital practice and the guidelines on which these interpretations are based.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114mgymL]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma control — defined as the extent to which the manifestations of asthma can be observed in the patient, or have been reduced or removed by treatment — has two domains (symptom control and future risk of adverse outcomes) and both should always be assessed; lung function, particularly FEV1 as a percentage of predicted value, is an important part of the assessment of future risk, and it should be measured at the start of treatment, after 3–6 months of treatment, and periodically thereafter, and it should be recorded at diagnosis, 3–6 months after starting treatment, and periodically thereafter.

Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) interpretation — during symptoms, if FEV1 is within the predicted normal range this reduces the probability that symptoms are due to asthma; however, patients whose baseline FEV1 is > 80% predicted can have a clinically important increase in lung function with bronchodilator or ICS-containing treatment, and the patient's own best reading ('personal best') is recommended as their 'normal' value.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^113M44Rj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Question 2.4 — fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) monitoring in individuals aged 5 years and older: In individuals aged 5 years and older with asthma, the Expert Panel recommends against the use of FENO measurements in isolation to assess asthma control, predict future exacerbations, or assess exacerbation severity, and states that FENO should only be used as part of an ongoing monitoring and management strategy, with a strong recommendation and low certainty of evidence. Implementation guidance states that the Expert Panel does not recommend FENO testing on its own to assess asthma control, predict a future asthma exacerbation, or assess the severity of an exacerbation; that FENO levels are not well correlated with standard measures such as the ACT and ACQ, subsequent exacerbations, or exacerbation severity; and therefore FENO testing is not a substitute for standard measures and should not be used in isolation to monitor disease activity, although FENO measurement may be used in conjunction with an individual's history, clinical findings, and spirometry as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy. The Expert Panel also recommends against the use of isolated FENO measurement for asthma management and monitoring and specifies that FENO measurement should only be used as a part of an ongoing monitoring and management strategy to predict future exacerbations and assess exacerbation severity.

### A stepwise approach to the interpretation of pulmonary function tests [^117AGe3D]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Office-based pulmonary function testing, also known as spirometry, is a powerful tool for primary care physicians to diagnose and manage respiratory problems. An obstructive defect is indicated by a low forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio, which is defined as less than 70% or below the fifth percentile based on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) in adults, and less than 85% in patients five to 18 years of age. If an obstructive defect is present, the physician should determine if the disease is reversible based on the increase in FEV1 or FVC after bronchodilator treatment (i.e., increase of more than 12% in patients five to 18 years of age, or more than 12% and more than 200 mL in adults). Asthma is typically reversible, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not. A restrictive pattern is indicated by an FVC below the fifth percentile based on NHANES III data in adults, or less than 80% in patients five to 18 years of age. If a restrictive pattern is present, full pulmonary function tests with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide testing should be ordered to confirm restrictive lung disease and form a differential diagnosis. If both the FEV1/FVC ratio and the FVC are low, the patient has a mixed defect. The severity of the abnormality is determined by the FEV1 (percentage of predicted). If pulmonary function test results are normal, but the physician still suspects exercise- or allergen-induced asthma, bronchoprovocation (e.g., methacholine challenge, mannitol inhalation challenge, exercise testing) should be considered.

### What is the best pulmonary diagnostic approach for wheezing patients with normal spirometry? [^1147h6Tf]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and variable air flow obstruction. The diagnosis of asthma, however, is often based upon nonspecific clinical symptoms of cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath. Furthermore, the physical examination and measurements of pulmonary function are often unremarkable in patients with asthma, thereby complicating the diagnosis of the disease. The following discussion will review approaches to the diagnosis of asthma when lung functions are normal, and will largely focus on the use of bronchial provocation tests to detect underlying AHR.

### Pulmonary function testing [^112A6J68]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary function testing is often considered the basis for diagnosis in many categories of pulmonary disease. Although most of the testing methodologies are well established and widely employed, there are still many questions regarding how tests should be performed, how to ensure that reliable data are produced, what reference values and rules should be used, and how pulmonary function tests (PFTs) should be interpreted to best support clinical decision making. This conference was organized around a set of questions aimed at many of these issues. Each presenter was asked to address a specific topic regarding what tests should be done, how those test should be performed to answer a particular clinical question, and to relate test results to an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the patient. These topics included testing of adults and children, with concentration on important disease entities such as COPD, asthma, and unexplained dyspnea. Special emphasis was given to discussing reference values, lower limits of normal, interpretive strategies to optimize disease classification, and those factors directly affecting data quality. Established techniques for spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity, exercise testing, and bronchial challenges were compared and contrasted with new technologies, and with technologies that might be part of pulmonary function laboratories in the near future.

### Can asthma control be improved by understanding the patient's perspective? [^1129BMMH]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The need for simple valid and reliable measures of asthma control

In many chronic diseases, healthcare professionals have a philosophy of treating to achieve a predefined target level in a surrogate marker that indicates good control However, in asthma, there is currently no simple, clear, accepted target measure that healthcare professionals can aim to achieve, and that patients can use as a reliable indicator of treatment effectiveness. Instead, asthma control is currently implied in a number of ways (Table 2).

Table 2
Current methods used to imply level of asthma control

Assessment of asthma has traditionally been based on parameters noted in management guidelines, such as lung function and symptoms. However, there is little correlation between commonly measured objective measurement of lung function using peak flow meters or spirometry and the level of symptoms or quality of life impairment perceived by patients, and less easily measured parameters such as lung hyper-inflation may show better correlations with symptoms such as breathlessness. This may be due, in part, to other factors that influence perception of symptoms, such as concomitant anxiety, depression and socioeconomic status. The demonstration of variability and reversibility of airflow limitation confirms asthma but the absence of these features at a given moment in time does not preclude the diagnosis.

Asthma — FeNO as adjunct in uncertain diagnosis: In individuals aged 5 years and older for whom the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain using history, clinical findings, clinical course, and spirometry, including bronchodilator responsiveness testing, or in whom spirometry cannot be performed, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends the addition of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement as an adjunct to the evaluation process.

Fractional exhaled nitric oxide — supporting diagnosis of asthma: FENO can support a diagnosis of asthma, with predictive values higher than for conventional measurements such as peak flows and spirometry and similar to those associated with bronchial challenge tests. However, because airway inflammation in asthma is heterogeneous and not always associated with increased FENO, in symptomatic patients an increased FENO provides supportive rather than conclusive evidence for an asthma diagnosis.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^1117Htjb]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and the US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to improve asthma awareness, prevention and management worldwide. GINA develops and publishes evidence-based, annually updated resources for clinicians. GINA guidance is adopted by national asthma guidelines in many countries, adapted to fit local healthcare systems, practices, and resource availability. GINA is independent of industry, funded by the sale and licensing of its materials. This review summarizes key practical guidance for primary care from the 2022 GINA strategy report. It provides guidance on confirming the diagnosis of asthma using spirometry or peak expiratory flow. GINA recommends that all adults, adolescents and most children with asthma should receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing therapy to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations, either taken regularly, or (for adults and adolescents with "mild" asthma) as combination ICS–formoterol taken as needed for symptom relief. For patients with moderate–severe asthma, the preferred regimen is maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with ICS–formoterol. Asthma treatment is not "one size fits all"; GINA recommends individualized assessment, adjustment, and review of treatment. As many patients with difficult-to-treat or severe asthma are not referred early for specialist review, we provide updated guidance for primary care on diagnosis, further investigation, optimization and treatment of severe asthma across secondary and tertiary care. While the GINA strategy has global relevance, we recognize that there are special considerations for its adoption in low- and middle-income countries, particularly the current poor access to inhaled medications.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115ppn5R]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for asthma, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose asthma in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged 6–11 years) patients based on typical variable respiratory symptoms and confirmed variable expiratory airflow:

- **Wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough**: symptoms occurring variably over time and vary in intensity; symptoms often worse at night or on waking; symptoms often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, cold air; symptoms worsen after end-exercise (very distinctive); symptoms often appearing or worsening with viral infections

- **Confirmed excessive variability in lung function (≥ 1 of the following)**: positive bronchodilator responsiveness test with spirometry (or peak expiratory flow); excessive variability in twice-daily peak expiratory flow over 2 weeks; increase in lung function after 4 weeks of ICS-containing treatment; positive bronchial challenge test; excessive variation in lung function between visits.

### The clinician's guide on monitoring children with asthma [^1112eyYr]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Based on a review of the evidence on the usefulness of monitoring disease outcome parameters in childhood asthma and the author's 20-yr clinical experience in managing childhood asthma, this article provides the clinician with up-to-date recommendations on how to monitor childhood asthma in everyday clinical practice. Monitoring should be focused on patient-centered outcomes, such as exacerbations and impact on sports and play. Composite asthma control measures, although reasonably validated, do not take exacerbations into account and have a short recall window, limiting their usefulness as a routine monitoring tool in clinical practice. Lung function, airways hyperresponsiveness, exhaled nitric oxide, and inflammatory markers in sputum are surrogate end points, of little if any interest to patients. There is no evidence to support their use as a monitoring tool in clinical practice; office spirometry may be used as additional information. Rather than monitoring surrogate end points, clinicians should focus on showing a genuine interest in the impact of asthma on children's daily lives, and building and maintaining a partnership by monitoring those characteristics of asthma which have the biggest impact on children (exacerbations and limitations in sports and play), and adjusting treatment accordingly.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: evaluation and management of asthma in the elderly [^115bdX5g]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2016). Medium credibility.

Physiologic tests and biomarkers for diagnosis and management of elderly patients with asthma emphasize that "Many of the same tests used in younger patients with asthma are useful to characterize AIE", and that "Spirometry and airway reactivity measurements are first-line methods for diagnosing and monitoring AIE". Evidence indicates "lower FEV1 and more severe airflow limitation in older patients with asthma", and that "Bronchoprovocation testing can detect airway reactivity in older as in younger patients", with older patients showing "more peripheral airway closure during bronchoconstriction (measured by the reduction in FVC)" than younger patients. When interpreting results, "age-adjusted values are essential, particularly when interpreting the FEV1/FVC ratio, to avoid overdiagnosing respiratory impairment", and although predicted values are available for the elderly, "data for nonwhite individuals and for those older than 75 years are sparse". Testing is limited because these are "effort-dependent maneuvers", and studies show "80% or more of older persons can achieve ATS-acceptable spirometry", though "this may be hard for some frail".

### Predicting response to therapy in acute asthma [^116jLUFp]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To analyze the prediction of response of therapy into the context of acute adult asthma assessment in the emergency department (ED) setting.

Recent Findings

Close monitoring of the patient's condition at presentation (static assessment) and response to treatment (dynamic assessment), including serial measurements of lung function, is an essential part of the acute asthma care in the ED. The severity of airflow obstruction cannot be accurately judged by patient's symptoms and physical examination alone. Accordingly, it is very important to use an objective measure of airway obstruction (spirometry or peak flow meter). Although spirometry can be performed in acutely ill ED asthmatics, measurement of peak expiratory flow, with values expressed as predicted normal values, represents an alternative if spirometry is not available.

Summary

Failure of initial therapy to improve expiratory flow predicts a more severe course and need for hospitalization. Although several score systems have been developed, different factors limit their applicability in the ED setting. Thus, peak expiratory flow rate measures at 15–60 min of treatment, joined with continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation may be the best ways to assess patients with acute asthma.

### Monitoring response to treatment in asthma management: food for thought [^112gFrr4]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that is characterized by episodic symptoms. In this regard, asthma management has classically involved periodic re-assessment by the health-care provider, during which therapy is altered mainly based on clinical and physiological parameters, such as assessment of symptoms, spirometry and peak expiratory flow monitoring. In this context, various markers of airway inflammation (e.g. eosinophils in the induced sputum, nitric oxide in the exhaled air) have been proposed to assess the severity of asthma and to adjust the therapy accordingly. The evaluation of airway hyper-responsiveness with different stimuli has also been suggested as a new tool to monitor asthma. However, the lack of definite relationships between airway inflammation and asthmatic symptoms strongly limit the use of markers of asthma severity in the clinical setting. Therefore, the need of new tools to assess the severity of asthma is raised. The ideal measurement employed to establish the proper asthmatic therapy should be safe, non-invasive, easy to perform, reproducible and accurate, and have the capability to monitor the changes induced by the therapeutic interventions. A careful review of the available techniques, and the evaluation of their sensitivity and specificity in the clinical setting is warranted.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in children [^113ze1Ms]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Differential diagnoses and diagnostic uncertainty

Misdiagnosis of asthma remains a major problem with rates of both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis being high. Overdiagnosis is problematic as it exposes children to unnecessary side effects of medications and runs the risk of trivialising asthma.

There are several conditions that may be associated with chronic cough, wheeze and/or shortness of breath in children and therefore present similarly to asthma (table 1). Due to the difficulties with diagnosis, especially in young children where objective testing is not possible, the diagnosis of asthma should be reviewed at each clinical presentation and interaction.

Table 1
Asthma differentials and clues in medical history

Diagnosing asthma in children

There is no single 'gold-standard' test that can be used to accurately diagnose asthma. In practice, a diagnosis should be made based on characteristic symptom patterns, evidence of variability in airflow limitation in the presence of airway inflammation, likelihood of alternative diagnoses and response to treatment. Getting the diagnosis correct is key for optimal management of paediatric asthma.

Lung function tests can be used to aid the diagnosis of asthma in children over the age of 5 years. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) and spirometry are commonly used to assess airflow obstruction and reversibility. PEF can be used to detect diurnal variation, which is a typical feature of asthma. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) specifically recommends the use of either PEF or spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma in children over 5 years. Once a child is old enough to reliably perform lung function testing, it is recommended that this be undertaken if the diagnosis of asthma has not been previously confirmed. In children under 5, lung function testing is rarely practical outside a research setting. This makes diagnosis in this age group additionally challenging. Guidelines vary between countries and regions with regard to diagnostic criteria. An overview of the similarities and differences between these guidelines is displayed in table 2. Lung function testing is frequently used to monitor progress of children with asthma as part of their care. Objective testing should be repeated if there is poor response to treatment or diagnostic uncertainty.

SECTION II: RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE OF FTESTING IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Nitric oxidecan be measured in exhaled breath and can serve as a measure of the level of airway inflammation. In individuals with asthma, Fmay be a useful indicator of type 2 (T2) bronchial or eosinophilic inflammation in the airway. Ftesting requires an expiratory maneuver into a device designed for this purpose.

The Expert Panel addressed key questions on the utility of Fmeasurement for asthma diagnosis, management, and prognosis. In this section, the panel discusses factors that confound Fmeasurement or the interpretation of Ftest results in the context of the key questions. The evidence in all of these areas reveals important limitations that affect the strength of the recommendations and limit the ability to determine the optimal strategies for Fmeasurement. A discussion of the equipment used to measure Fand how to perform the test is beyond the scope of this update.

Definitions of terms used in this section

Children and adults have allergic asthma if they become symptomatic after acute exposure to something to which they are allergic (eg, a pet) or during a specific season of the year (eg, in the spring, due to tree pollen, or in the fall, due to ragweed pollen).

"Recurrent wheezing" is defined as clinically significant periods of bronchial or respiratory tract wheezing that is reversible or that is consistent with the clinical picture of bronchospasm.

Question 2.1

What is the diagnostic accuracy of Fmeasurement(s) for making the diagnosis of asthma in individuals aged 5 years and older?

Recommendation 1: In individuals aged 5 years and older for whom the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain using history, clinical findings, clinical course, and spirometry, including bronchodilator responsiveness testing, or in whom spirometry cannot be performed, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends the addition of Fmeasurement as an adjunct to the evaluation process.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^1146q5XR]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD asthma — monitoring and follow-up: For stable asthma, the guideline states, "We suggest against utilizing spirometry for routine monitoring of patients with stable asthma" and rates this "(Weak against | Not reviewed, Not changed)". Supporting evidence notes that "The use of spirometry in routine monitoring of patients with asthma was not found to significantly improve patient outcomes on the standardized ACT" and an RCT "demonstrated no statistically significant difference between patients who received spirometry every three months versus patients who received only routine medical follow-up". The guideline also states that "Current literature does not support routine (e.g., quarterly) spirometry for stable patients with asthma in the general population" and, while "there are no obvious harms associated with spirometry, there may be added burden" with access and testing challenges; additionally, "there does not appear to be significant variability in patient preference for this test" and "The patient focus group revealed no comments or concerns regarding spirometry".

### Diagnostic differentiation between asthma and COPD in primary care using lung function testing [^116R1xQE]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both common chronic respiratory diseases affecting approximately 1 in 12 people worldwide. The two conditions are defined as different disease entities with unique pathophysiological mechanisms and characteristic clinical features. The underlying pathophysiology in COPD is characterized predominantly by neutrophilic inflammation, whereas in asthma the inflammatory pattern is mostly due to eosinophilic inflammation. Asthma typically presents with intermittent respiratory symptoms caused by airflow obstruction predominantly due to bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Asthma is often presented at younger age as part of an atopic constitution, but can also be diagnosed in adulthood. In contrast, COPD is a slowly progressive lung disease with patients having persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow obstruction. In high-income countries like the Netherlands COPD usually presents in patients older than forty who are generally current or former smokers. Patients with asthma or COPD are mostly diagnosed and managed by primary care clinicians.

Looking at the classic pathophysiological and clinical presentations, the distinction between asthma and COPD seems clear, but in clinical practice patients often show features of both diseases. These similarities make it difficult for clinicians to distinguish between asthma and COPD, especially in older and more diverse patient populations encountered in primary care –. However, differentiating between the two respiratory conditions is important as they have different pharmacotherapeutic regimens. In patients with asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are highly effective in reducing symptoms and reducing the risk of asthma-related mortality. In contrast, patients with COPD respond poorly to ICS and are mainly treated with (long-acting) bronchodilators to relieve symptoms. In addition to this, misdiagnosing asthma for COPD could lead to serious health risks considering that monotherapy with long-acting bronchodilators is contra-indicated in asthmatics since it increases the risk of severe exacerbation –. On the other hand, (unnecessary) treatment with ICS may cause pneumonia and increased risk of osteoporosis –.

Thus, establishing a correct diagnosis is essential for optimal treatment of asthma and COPD, but this can be challenging for primary care clinicians. Supporting them in the diagnostic process seems therefore essential, but this also depends on the availability of diagnostic tools. Although quality spirometry has shown to be feasible in primary care settingsthere is substantial room for improvement of its use to accurately diagnose chronic respiratory diseases. Thus, the first aim of our current study was to establish which patient characteristics distinguish between patients diagnosed with asthma or COPD. The second and main aim was to establish the added value of spirometry and more advanced lung function measurements to differentiate between these two chronic airways diseases.

Asthma diagnosis — GINA 2024 updates for clinical practice state that the diagnostic flowchart has been revised to accommodate limited access to spirometry, that peak expiratory flow (PEF) is less reliable than spirometry but better than relying on symptoms alone, and that the flowchart allows selection of different initial lung function tests with clarified criteria for variable expiratory airflow limitation and more details about bronchodilator withholding; GINA has not adopted the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society proposal to change bronchodilator responsiveness from an increase from baseline of ≥ 12% and 200 mL to > 10% predicted for diagnosis, noting the committee avoided diagnostic recommendations and that further population and outcome data will be considered.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112HHJDS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — bronchodilator responsiveness thresholds for diagnosis — states that in adults with respiratory symptoms typical of asthma, an increase or decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL from baseline, or if spirometry is not available a change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) of at least 20%, is accepted as being consistent with asthma. A Technical Standards Committee recommended changing the criterion for a positive bronchodilator responsiveness test from an increase from baseline in FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≥ 12% and > 200 mL to an increase from baseline of > 10% of the patient's predicted value; this recommendation was based on data for survival, and the Technical Standards Committee avoided making any recommendation about the use of this criterion for diagnostic decisions in clinical practice.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113GzsoZ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting (evaluation), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain pulmonary function testing in patients with asthma exacerbation presenting to the emergency department. Document peak expiratory flow or FEV1, if possible and without unduly delaying treatment, before initiating treatment. Monitor lung function at 1 hour and at intervals until a clear response to treatment has occurred or a plateau is reached.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113WFRcb]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — lung function testing to document variable expiratory airflow limitation — notes that lung function is most reliably assessed by spirometry testing with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the FEV1/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). Spirometry testing should be carried out by well-trained operators with well-maintained and regularly calibrated equipment, with an inline filter to protect against transmission of infection. When spirometry is unavailable, peak expiratory flow (PEF), although less reliable, is better than no objective measurement; if PEF is used, the best of 3 measurements should be used each time, and the same meter should be used for follow-up testing, as measurements may differ from meter to meter by up to 20%. Responsiveness refers to rapid improvements in FEV1 or PEF within minutes after a rapid-acting bronchodilator such as 200–400 mcg salbutamol, or more sustained improvement over days or weeks after introduction of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment. In patients with typical or suggestive respiratory symptoms, obtaining evidence of excessive variability in expiratory lung function is an essential component of diagnosis, with examples including an increase in lung function 10–15 minutes after a bronchodilator or after a trial of ICS-containing treatment; lung function may improve gradually, so it should be assessed after at least 4 weeks, a decrease in lung function after exercise or during a bronchial provocation test, and variation beyond the normal range on repeated measurements, including on twice-daily home monitoring over at least 1–2 weeks; a decrease in FEV1 or PEF during a respiratory infection does not necessarily indicate asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1148j9QB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — diagnosis in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years: The diagnosis of asthma is based on the history of characteristic symptom patterns and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, which should be documented from bronchodilator reversibility testing or other tests, and more than one test may be needed to confirm asthma or exclude alternative causes of respiratory symptoms. Many health professionals do not have access to spirometry; if so, peak expiratory flow (PEF) should be used, rather than relying on symptoms alone. Test before treating, wherever possible, i.e., document the evidence for the diagnosis of asthma before starting inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment, as it is often more difficult to confirm the diagnosis once asthma control has improved, and additional or alternative strategies may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of asthma in particular populations including patients already on ICS-containing treatment, the elderly, patients presenting with cough as the only symptom (including cough variant asthma), and patients in low-resource settings.

### Misdiagnosis of asthma and COPD and underuse of spirometry in primary care unselected patients [^111kT4QB]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) consists of a combination of classical symptoms and signs, and the evidence of consistent lung function abnormalities. Spiromety has been reported to be underused, possibly for practical difficulties in accessing to a lung function lab. This may lead to misdiagnosis of both asthma and COPD. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of spirometry use and the concordance between doctor-diagnosed asthma and COPD and spirometric patterns, in an unselected cohort of patients sent by general practitioners to perform a spirometry.

Methods

The first 300 patients consecutively enrolled patients performed spirometry and bronchodilator test with salbutamol 400 mcg. Demographic, clinical and lung function data have been collected.

Results

128 patients (42.7%) declared a doctor-diagnosed asthma and 75 (25%) a doctor-diagnosis of COPD; the remaining subjects never had received any respiratory diagnosis. Only 112 patients with doctor-diagnosed asthma (55.2%) and 114 (56.2%) with doctor-diagnosed COPD have ever performed a spirometry in their entire life (average time since the last spirometry was about 47.0 months). Eighty-nine (69.5%) and 10 (13.3%) patients with respectively doctor-diagnosed asthma and COPD had concordant spirometric patterns with their known diseases.

Discussion

we described a worrying lack of use of spirometry and a high proportion of misdiagnosis, in patients with suspect chronic airway inflammatory diseases and cared by primary care physicians. Novel strategies to overcome this situation include should be implemented to give a better care to our patients.

### Does the routine use of spirometry improve clinical outcomes in children? – A systematic review [^113NsTNi]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Spirometry is a portable and relatively simple test designed to identify and quantify abnormalities in respiratory function. The measurements derived from spirometry are measures of airflow and exhaled lung volumes. Spirometry can generally be reliably performed by children > 6 years of age and by some preschoolers under modified criteria.

Data from spirometry add to clinical management in numerous ways, including assisting in characterizing respiratory pathophysiology, grading the severity of lung disorders, monitoring disease, and determining the effectiveness of therapy. Hence, its use is recommended in pediatric clinical guidelines as part of clinical management including guidelines for chronic cough, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and recurrent wheezing, asthma, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. Other diagnoses and conditions in which spirometry aids in management include, but are not limited to, oncology conditions, connective tissue disorders, neuromuscular weakness, and scoliosis.

Although spirometry is widely advocated in pediatric guidelines and routine in most respiratory clinics, there is evidence of under‐utilization of spirometry in primary care settings. For example, only half of all family physicians and general pediatricians use spirometry in patients with asthma and only 21% routinely use it in asthma guideline‐recommended situations, that is, establishing an asthma diagnosis, severity, or control. Although pediatricians used spirometry 66% of the time, only 10% performed the test consistently on each asthma visit. In another survey of children with asthma, only a third were referred for spirometry and only one‐half of hospitalized children underwent spirometry during follow‐up.

Clarification of the value and impact of spirometry in routine consultations, with systematic review evidence, is essential for integrating spirometry into routine clinical practice. Thus, our systematic review aimed to evaluate the question "In children with suspected or known respiratory diseases, does the routine use of spirometry improve health‐related quality of life (QoL) outcome and guide clinical management, compared to not using spirometry?"

Lung function testing is essential — use lung function testing to confirm the presence of persistent expiratory airflow limitation and variable expiratory airflow limitation. Spirometry is preferably performed at the initial assessment; in cases of clinical urgency it may be delayed to a subsequent visit, but confirmation of diagnosis may be more difficult once patients are started on ICS-containing therapy. Early confirmation (or exclusion) of the presence of persistent expiratory airflow limitation may avoid needless trials of therapy or delays in initiating other investigations. Measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) on the same meter over a period of 1–2 weeks may help to confirm reversible airflow limitation and the diagnosis of asthma by demonstrating excessive variability; however, PEF is not as reliable as spirometry, and a normal PEF does not rule out either asthma or COPD. Consider alternative diagnoses; the above approach to diagnosis does not replace the need for a full assessment to first exclude non-respiratory diagnoses such as heart failure, and physical examination may provide supportive information.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^113UoMjB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Since asthma is a variable condition, bronchodilator reversibility (also called responsiveness) may or may not be present at the time of initial lung function testing. If it is not documented on spirometry at an initial attempt, the test should be repeated at one or more later visits, preferably when the patient is symptomatic and bronchodilator medicines have been withheld. Otherwise, an alternative test may be conducted (as below and in Table 2).

Spirometry is not always accessible in primary care. An alternative method is to instruct the patient to record peak expiratory flow (PEF) each morning and evening over a 2-week period in a diary or using an electronic peak flow meter. PEF should be measured three times on each occasion, and only the highest reading used. Diurnal PEF variability is calculated as each day's highest minus the day's lowest reading, divided by the mean of the day's highest and lowest, then these results are averaged over one week. Excessive diurnal PEF variability is defined as a mean variability of > 10% in PEFs in adults or > 13% variability in children. When measuring PEF, the same meter should be used for all readings, as variation between different PEF meters may be as large as 20%.

In people with suspected asthma who have normal expiratory airflow and no significant reversibility, a bronchoprovocation test (e.g. methacholine or mannitol) can reveal airway hyperresponsiveness, supporting a diagnosis of asthma. Bronchodilators must be withheld before challenge testing.

Variable expiratory airflow limitation should preferably be demonstrated before initiating asthma controller treatment, except in situations of clinical urgency, as it becomes harder to confirm the diagnosis once controller treatment has been started (Table 3). However, the diagnosis of asthma can also be confirmed if there is a clinically significant improvement in FEV 1 (by > 12% and > 200 mL) or in PEF by > 20% after 4 weeks of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — diagnostic flowchart for adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years in clinical practice outlines an approach for patients presenting with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms in clinical practice. The algorithm begins by asking "Are symptoms typical of asthma?", then evaluates objective testing feasibility with "Is spirometry or peak expiratory flow (PEF) available and feasible?" and directs to "Perform lung function test(s) as in Box 1–2, e.g. spirometry or PEF before and after bronchodilator" to determine whether "Is variable expiratory airflow limitation confirmed?". A branch conducts "Further history and tests for alternative diagnoses" with "Is alternative diagnosis confirmed?", leading to "Treat for alternative diagnosis" when confirmed. If other diagnoses are unlikely, it advises to "treat empirically with ICS-containing treatment (Boxes 4–5 & 4–11)", then "Review response in 1–3 months, including PEF or spirometry if available" and, if improved, "Treat for asthma with ICS-containing treatment See Boxes 4–5 & 4–11". The footnote states that "Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is less reliable than spirometry, but it is better than having no objective measurement of lung function", and that readings "may vary by up to 20% between different meters" and to use "only the highest of three readings".

Diagnosis: Forced Spirometry

A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who complains of dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, a history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease (see above), but forced vital capacity maneuver during spirometry showing the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 0.7 is needed to establish the diagnosis of COPD. The FEV 1 also serves to determine the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1, 2, 3, 4 or mild, moderate, severe, and very severe). Yet, several important aspects related to forced spirometry need to be considered here.

First, airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible is not specific for COPD. For instance, it may also be found in patients with asthma and other diseases, so the clinical context and risk factors (see above) must also be considered when establishing a diagnosis of COPD.

Ages 5–11 years terminology and monitoring — The terms ICS-LABA and ICS-formoterol indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler, and where formoterol is specified in the steps, it is because the evidence is based on studies specific to formoterol. In individuals ages 5–11 years with persistent allergic asthma in which there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement is conditionally recommended as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessment.

Diagnosis of exacerbations — exacerbations represent a change in symptoms and lung function from the patient's usual status, and the decrease in expiratory airflow can be quantified by lung function measurements such as PEF or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared with the patient's previous lung function or predicted values; in the acute setting, these measurements are more reliable indicators of the severity of the exacerbation than symptoms, although the frequency of symptoms may be a more sensitive measure of the onset of an exacerbation than PEF; consider the possibility of pertussis in a patient with an atypical exacerbation presentation, with predominant cough; a minority of patients perceive airflow limitation poorly and can experience a significant decline in lung function without a change in symptoms, especially affecting patients with a history of near-fatal asthma and appearing to be more common in males, and regular PEF monitoring may be considered for such patients; severe exacerbations are potentially life-threatening and require careful assessment and close monitoring, and patients with severe exacerbations should be advised to see their healthcare provider promptly or to proceed to the nearest facility that provides emergency access for patients with acute asthma.
