## Question

definition, pathophysiology, clinical course, risk factors, and prognosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), specifically its definition, pathophysiology, clinical course, risk factors, and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and modern terminology. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiologic mechanisms and how they differ in EIB with versus without asthma. Next, I will examine the clinical course and diagnostic thresholds. After that, I need to identify risk factors across populations and environments. Finally, I will consider prognosis, including natural history, treatment responsiveness, and long-term outcomes, and I will double-check any conflicting prevalence figures as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and terminology so I don't propagate outdated language. EIB is a transient, reversible narrowing of the lower airways that occurs during or after vigorous exercise. Importantly, it can occur in people with asthma (EIBa) and in those without asthma (EIBwa), and the older term "exercise-induced asthma" has been replaced by EIB to reflect this distinction, with ATS guidance codifying EIBa versus EIBwa and emphasizing objective confirmation rather than symptoms alone [^1126J8JL] [^114JP6cr] [^1147hd2b].

> Wait, let me verify the prevalence ranges before I anchor on a number. In the general population, EIB prevalence is roughly 5–20%, whereas in patients with asthma it can be as high as 70–90% depending on control and phenotype. In athletes, prevalence varies widely from about 7% up to 70% depending on sport, environment, and diagnostic method, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize a single figure across contexts [^115dDE8Z] [^111LoALM] [^114JP6cr].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology, starting with the osmotic hypothesis, which remains the most robustly supported mechanism. During high ventilation, airway surfaces lose water and become hyperosmolar, triggering mast cell degranulation with release of leukotrienes, prostaglandin D2, histamine, and tryptase, leading to bronchial smooth muscle contraction, mucus production, and microvascular leak; this mechanism explains why dry, cold air and high ventilation sports are particularly provocative [^113o73PH] [^113coWbH] [^11425yom].

> Hold on, I should verify the thermal/vascular contribution and not jump to conclusions. Rapid airway cooling during hyperpnea followed by rewarming causes vascular congestion and edema, which augments obstruction. This thermal–vascular interplay likely acts synergistically with osmotic mediator release, especially in cold environments, to amplify bronchoconstriction and symptom severity [^114YAzgF] [^112jqJex].

> Let me consider epithelial injury and neurogenic mechanisms next, because athletes often show a different endotype. Repeated exposure to cold, dry air, pollutants, and chlorine compounds can injure the airway epithelium, dysregulate repair, and heighten sensory nerve excitability, contributing to cough and bronchospasm; this helps explain persistent or "airway injury" phenotypes in some endurance and winter-sport athletes [^112jqJex] [^11773v5V] [^113uUQTh].

> But wait, what if the patient has asthma — does the mechanism change? In EIBa, the osmotic and thermal triggers overlay on top of baseline airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic inflammation; thus, EIB in asthma often signals suboptimal control and responds to anti-inflammatory therapy, whereas in EIBwa the response is more purely to the acute osmotic/thermal stimulus without chronic airway inflammation, though overlap exists and phenotypes can evolve over time [^113o73PH] [^112G8AZm] [^113ndUn5].

> Next, I should review the clinical course and diagnostic thresholds so I don't misstate timing. Symptoms typically begin within 2–5 minutes after exercise, peak around 10 minutes, and resolve spontaneously within about 30–90 minutes. Diagnosis requires objective evidence, most commonly a fall in FEV1 of at least 10% from baseline at two consecutive time points within 30 minutes post-challenge, with severity graded as mild (10– < 25%), moderate (25– < 50%), and severe (≥ 50%) [^111yRuTk] [^1179Sdb2] [^116KBCTR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the diagnostic threshold was universally 15%, but I should correct that. While some laboratories and pediatric protocols use higher cutoffs (for example, 15% or 13.2% in children), the ATS guideline accepts a 10% fall as diagnostic when reproducible, and many pharmaceutical trials require a 20% fall for inclusion. Thus, I need to specify the context when citing thresholds [^1179Sdb2] [^114ZCGQ8] [^116LkrwG].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about test protocols. Standardized exercise testing should target high ventilation (about 15–21 times FEV1) or 80–90% predicted maximum heart rate for 4–6 minutes with dry air and a nose clip, with serial spirometry at 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes. Surrogates such as eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH), hypertonic saline, or mannitol are acceptable when exercise testing is impractical, with EVH and mannitol offering good sensitivity for indirect airway hyperresponsiveness [^1157AFo3] [^114szD2z] [^115p2phU].

> Let me think about risk factors across populations, and I should double-check the strength of evidence for each. Asthma is the strongest risk factor, with EIB prevalence up to 70–90% in poorly controlled asthma; atopy, allergic rhinitis, and eczema increase risk even without overt asthma; elite and endurance athletes have higher prevalence due to prolonged hyperpnea of cold, dry air and pollutants; children and adolescents have higher prevalence than adults; urban residence and exposure to traffic-related pollutants elevate risk; and environmental triggers include low humidity, cold air, chlorine derivatives in swimmers, and high PM10/NO2 exposure [^115dDE8Z] [^115Cs3dM] [^114JP6cr] [^1163vRNZ] [^114YAzgF].

> Hold on, I should verify sport-specific risk stratification because not all activities carry the same hazard. High-risk sports involve sustained efforts beyond 5–8 minutes in cold, dry environments (e.g. Nordic skiing, ice hockey, long-distance running), medium-risk sports include team sports with intermittent efforts, and low-risk sports involve brief bursts of activity. This framework helps anticipate who needs more aggressive prophylaxis and objective testing [^116z3bTU].

> I will now examine prognosis and natural history, and I need to be careful not to overstate reversibility. Most EIB episodes are self-limited and resolve within 30–90 minutes, and symptoms generally respond to pre-exercise SABA, warm-up strategies, and, in asthma, ICS-based control. However, tachyphylaxis to SABA can develop with frequent use, and in some athletes, repeated airway injury may lead to persistent hyperresponsiveness even after stopping intense training, so longitudinal reassessment is prudent [^111yRuTk] [^113ndUn5] [^112VkYwp].

> Let me reconsider the long-term implications, especially for EIBwa. EIB without asthma may be an early marker of evolving bronchial hyperresponsiveness and can predict future asthma in some individuals, particularly those with atopy; nonetheless, with appropriate management, most patients can maintain full physical activity and competitive sports participation, and pediatric consensus emphasizes that EIB should not be a contraindication to exercise when controlled [^1147hd2b] [^113Z7j5w] [^114JP6cr].

> I should double-check treatment responsiveness and monitoring cadence to close the loop. Pre-exercise SABA remains first-line for acute prophylaxis, with ICS, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and mast cell stabilizers as controller options when symptoms persist or asthma is uncontrolled; regular follow-up every 3–6 months is reasonable to reassess control, adherence, inhaler technique, and the need to step down therapy after sustained control, aligning with pediatric consensus and general asthma principles [^1136zA91] [^113Z7j5w] [^113ndUn5].

> In summary, EIB is a transient, reversible airway narrowing provoked by exercise via osmotic, thermal, and epithelial injury mechanisms, with expression modulated by asthma status, atopy, age, sport, and environment. Accurate diagnosis hinges on objective testing rather than symptoms, and prognosis is favorable with individualized pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies, though vigilance for tachyphylaxis and airway remodeling is warranted in high-risk athletes and those with persistent symptoms [^1126J8JL] [^113ndUn5] [^114JP6cr].

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a **transient airway narrowing** that occurs during or after vigorous exercise, with symptoms typically peaking 10–15 minutes after exercise and resolving within 60–90 minutes [^111yRuTk] [^115xaVfx]. It is common in patients with asthma and in athletes, especially in cold, dry, or polluted environments [^111LoALM] [^115dDE8Z]. The **pathophysiology** involves airway cooling and drying, which trigger mast cell mediator release and bronchial smooth muscle contraction [^113o73PH] [^11425yom]. Risk factors include asthma, atopy, allergic rhinitis, elite/endurance sports, and environmental exposures; prognosis is generally excellent with appropriate management, though persistent symptoms may occur if asthma is uncontrolled or exposures continue [^114JP6cr] [^114GmPmr].

---

## Definition and clinical features

EIB is defined as a **transient narrowing of the airways** during or after exercise, with symptoms including cough, wheeze, dyspnea, chest tightness, and reduced exercise performance [^111yRuTk] [^115xaVfx]. Symptoms typically begin within 2–5 minutes after exercise, peak at 10–15 minutes, and resolve spontaneously within 60–90 minutes [^111yRuTk] [^115xaVfx]. EIB can occur in individuals with and without asthma, although it is more common in those with asthma [^111LoALM] [^115dDE8Z].

---

## Pathophysiology

The **pathophysiology** of EIB is multifactorial, involving several interconnected mechanisms:

- **Airway cooling and drying**: During exercise, increased ventilation leads to cooling and drying of the airway mucosa, triggering bronchoconstriction [^113o73PH] [^11425yom].

- **Mast cell mediator release**: Airway drying stimulates mast cells to release mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, causing bronchial smooth muscle contraction and airway narrowing [^113o73PH] [^113coWbH].

- **Airway hyperresponsiveness**: Individuals with asthma or atopy have heightened airway sensitivity, predisposing them to EIB [^113o73PH] [^115dDE8Z].

- **Epithelial injury and inflammation**: Repeated exposure to cold, dry, or polluted air can cause epithelial damage and chronic airway inflammation, particularly in athletes [^114YAzgF] [^11773v5V].

---

## Clinical course

The **clinical course** of EIB typically follows a predictable pattern:

- **Onset**: Symptoms begin within 2–5 minutes after exercise [^116KBCTR].

- **Peak**: Symptoms peak at approximately 10–15 minutes post-exercise [^116KBCTR] [^115xaVfx].

- **Resolution**: Symptoms resolve spontaneously within 60–90 minutes without intervention [^111yRuTk] [^115xaVfx].

- **Refractory period**: A short-lived refractory period (1–3 hours) may follow an episode, during which subsequent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is attenuated [^115EsK78] [^117W6QSD].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the **risk** of developing EIB:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Asthma | Present in ~90% of patients with asthma [^117Ptyo7] [^115dDE8Z] |
| Atopy | Personal or family history of atopy or allergic rhinitis [^115dDE8Z] [^115Cs3dM] |
| Elite athletes | Higher prevalence in endurance and winter sports athletes [^112KN64g] [^113o73PH] |
| Environmental exposures | Cold, dry air; pollutants; chlorine exposure in swimmers [^113o73PH] [^115JFQ7X] |
| Respiratory infections | Recent upper respiratory infections increase risk [^1148tq2D] [^114YAzgF] |

---

## Prognosis

The **prognosis** of EIB is generally favorable with appropriate management. Pharmacologic therapy — including **short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)**, **inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)**, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), and mast cell stabilizers — effectively controls symptoms and allows continued participation in physical activities [^1136zA91] [^113ndUn5]. Nonpharmacologic measures such as warm-up exercises, avoiding triggers, and environmental modifications further improve outcomes [^117W6QSD] [^115wGMVm]. However, persistent or severe symptoms may occur if **underlying asthma is uncontrolled** or if exposure to triggers continues, potentially impacting quality of life and athletic performance [^114JP6cr] [^116eJG6Z].

---

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is a **transient airway narrowing** triggered by exercise, with symptoms peaking 10–15 minutes after exertion and resolving within 60–90 minutes. It is driven by airway cooling, drying, and mast cell mediator release, and is more common in patients with asthma, atopy, and elite athletes. With appropriate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management, the prognosis is excellent, though uncontrolled asthma or ongoing exposures can lead to persistent symptoms.

Final summary statements

Definition

Two of the 3 statements (questions 1,3) on definition ("EIB may be the only symptom of asthma" and "EIB is not common in people with asthma") showed consensus during the first survey while uncertainty was initially observed about the presence of EIB in atopic subject without a diagnosis of asthma (question 2 "EIB may be present in people with atopic diseases without asthma"). After the first round, following the discussion of the results and the review of the literature, the panelists reached the consensus also on this topic.

Initially, the term 'Exercise-Induced Asthma' (EIA) was coined to indicate the narrowing of the airways occurring during or after physical exercise in asthmatic patients. However, in 1970 the term EIB was introduced to indicate the acute and transitory narrowing of the airways during or after physical activity that could occur also in non-asthmatic patients.

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) Clinical Practice Guideline proposed to differentiate the use of the term EIB between EIB occurring in asthmatic patients (EIBa — EIB with asthma) and EIB in patients without typical signs or symptoms of asthma (EIBwa — EIB without asthma). When presenting in patients without asthma, EIB exhibits distinctive clinical and pathological characteristics and may not be associated with bronchocostriction when the patient is not practicing physical activity. However EIBwa can be a predictor of future asthma and an early sign of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Allergic rhinitis, a personal history of allergies, and atopic dermatitis contribute higher risk of EIB even in absence of asthma.

Statement 1 (questions 1–3): EIB is characterized by acute and transitory narrowing of the airways during or after physical activity. EIB can manifest as unique symptom of asthma but can be also present in people without asthma, more frequently if atopic.

Follow-up

Adequate levels of physical activity are strongly recommended to children with EIB and the condition should not be a limitation. The physical activity pattern practiced by children with EIB should be monitored. Child and the caregivers must be adequately educated on EIB prevention and management of a possible acute episode of EIB. Clear indications on long-term management and follow-up of children with EIB are currently lacking. As suggested for asthma management, follow-up visits can be performed every 3–6 months. EIB symptoms, their occurrence, efficacy of treatment and adherence including administration technique should be assessed. Spirometry should be performed at every visit while exercise challenge test can be repeated depending on symptoms and, when needed, to assess the effectiveness of treatment.

Step down or discontinuation of treatment can be considered after a period of wellbeing

Statement 9: Children with EIB can practice physical activity and competitive sports if symptoms and asthma are under control with adequate treatment. Sports where the inhalation of salbutamol would be difficult, like diving, are generally discouraged. Regular assessments are suggested to review treatment and guarantee the recommended levels of physical activity.

Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) are closely related conditions that can make it challenging to differentiate between them. These conditions necessitate that asthmatic patients adhere to established asthma guidelines for baseline treatment. Short-acting beta-agonists are emphasized as the primary treatment for managing symptoms. The management of EIA and EIB in children is particularly complex due to their high levels of spontaneous physical activity. Patients must identify and avoid environmental triggers that may exacerbate their symptoms whenever possible. For effective management, physicians should regularly assess treatment efficacy through the remission of symptoms. However, athletes may require more specialized and serial testing to tailor their treatment plans effectively and ensure optimal performance. This article encapsulates the critical points concerning managing exercise-induced respiratory issues in asthmatic individuals, highlighting the need for careful and tailored approaches for different patient groups.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in elite or endurance athletes:: pathogenesis and diagnostic considerations [^11773v5V]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pathogenesis and evaluation of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction pertaining to the elite or endurance athlete, as well as propose a diagnostic algorithm based on the current literature.

Data Sources

Studies were identified using Ovid MEDLINE and reference lists of key articles.

Study Selections

Randomized controlled trials were selected when available. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of peer-reviewed literature were included, as were retrospective studies and observational studies of clinical interest.

Results

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is the physiologic entity in which exercise induces acute narrowing of the airways and occurs in patients both with and without asthma. It may present with or without respiratory symptoms, and the underlying cause is likely attributable to environment stressors to the airway encountered during exercise. These include the osmotic effects of inhaled dry air, temperature variations, autonomic nervous system dysregulation, sensory nerve reactivity, and airway epithelial injury. Deposition of allergens, particulate matter, and gaseous pollutants into the airway also contribute. Elite and endurance athletes are exposed to these stressors more frequently and in greater duration than the general population.

Conclusion

A greater awareness of EIB among elite and endurance athletes is needed, and a thorough evaluation should be performed if EIB is suspected in this population. We propose an algorithm to aid in this evaluation. Symptoms should not be solely relied on for diagnosis but should be taken into the context of bronchoprovocative challenges, which should replicate the competitive environment as closely as possible. Further research is needed to validate these tests' predictive values.

Recommendation strength definitions and clinical implications — Strong recommendation (StrRec) means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent (Grade A or B). Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Moderate (Mod) means the benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong (grade B or C). Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Weak (Weak) means that either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect (grade D) or that well-done studies (grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they might set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation (NoRec) means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence (grade D) and an unclear balance between benefits and harms. Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^111LoALM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) — prevalence and clinical features: Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) describes acute airway narrowing that occurs as a result of exercise and has been reported in subjects without a known diagnosis of asthma, with prevalence of up to 20% being reported; in Olympic or elite-level athletes, the documented prevalence of EIB varies between 30 and 70%, depending on the population studied and methods implemented. The symptoms of EIB are variable and nonspecific with very poor predictive value for objectively confirmed EIB; clinical presentation may include chest tightness, cough, wheezing, and dyspnea; symptoms may only occur with exercise or in specific environments such as ice rinks or indoor swimming pools and are often mild to moderate in severity and may cause impairment of athletic performance, but are not severe enough to cause significant respiratory distress, although severe episodes can occur and respiratory failure and even death have occurred in rare cases.

### Exercise-induced asthma [^112FSyw4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Exercise has been recognized as a trigger of bronchospasm for centuries. However, there remains much debate regarding the mechanism of this response, nomenclature to describe it, optimal tests for diagnosis, and treatment options. There is a need to review recent findings in this area both for clinicians and to highlight areas in need of additional research.

Recent Findings

Recent data have confirmed the high prevalence of exercise-induced bronchospasm among athletes and raise concern that many of these athletes may be unaware of this diagnosis. Variability in nomenclature, classification, and diagnostic testing methods continue to make comparisons among reported trials difficult. Both in-vitro and animal studies reveal a heterogeneous inflammatory response correlated with exercise-induced bronchospasm. This variability may underlie the variable response to pharmacotherapy.

Summary

Clinicians need to be alert to the nonspecific nature of exercise-induced symptoms and increase utilization of objective testing for accurate diagnosis. Future research is needed to better define the optimal diagnostic test or algorithm. Clinical outcome and translational studies should focus on more precise phenotyping of participants and include more global measures of inflammation.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) diagnosis and testing — timing and objective criteria are specified: "EIB usually develops within 15 minutes after 5 to 8 minutes of intensive aerobic training and usually resolves within 60 minutes". The diagnosis "can be made only when characteristic symptoms are accompanied by objective findings of variable airway obstruction through either spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility testing or bronchoprovocation tests", and athletes with such symptoms "should initially undergo spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility testing". Bronchodilator testing is emphasized because "athletes commonly have higher baseline FEV1 than nonathletes", and reversibility is "determined by an increase in FEV1 of more than 200 mL and more than or equal to 12% from baseline measure after inhalation of a short-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist (SABA)".

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) test selection, repetition, and interpretation — Exercise challenge by treadmill is most easily standardized for office practice or a hospital laboratory, whereas cycle ergometry can be more difficult and might provide a less standardized stimulus; field and running challenges are more difficult to standardize. There might be variability in airway response between tests, particularly in milder responders, and thus repeat testing might need to be considered in some cases in which EIB is strongly suspected. However, there is no single test that will identify all patients with EIB, and there is no single absolute cutoff for a decrease in FEV1 or other spirometric change that clearly distinguishes the presence and absence of EIB. A flat or truncated inspiratory flow-volume loop suggests an upper airway dysfunction rather than EIB.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in athletes — treatment parity and outcomes: Competitive and elite athletes might have EIB alone with characteristics that differ from EIB with asthma; however, recent studies indicate that both recreational and elite athletes with EIB without asthma can be treated in a similar manner. EIB alone, without underlying asthma, responds to similar treatment as with asthma, the presence of EIB reflects active asthma, and good control of EIB can be attained with the management discussed above, leading to a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and pursuit of the chosen sport.

### Exercise-induced bronchospasm in children [^113BuUDu]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

This review will encompass definition, history, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of exercise -induced bronchospasm in the pediatric individual with and without known asthma. Exercise induced asthma is the conventional term for transient airway narrowing in a known asthma in association with strenuous exercise usually lasting 5–10 minutes with a decline in pulmonary function by at least 10%. Exercise induced asthma will be referred to as exercise induced bronchospasm in an asthmatic. Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) is the same phenomenon in an individual without known asthma. EIB can be seen in healthy individuals including children as well as defense recruits and competitive or elite athletes. The diagnosis with objective exercise challenge methods in conjunction with history is delineated. Management is characterized with pharmacotherapy and non pharmacotherapeutic measures for underlying asthma as well as exercise induced bronchospasm and inhalant allergy. Children can successfully participate in all sports if asthma is properly managed.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^114ZCGQ8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) — diagnosis and severity criteria are based on objective lung function changes rather than symptoms; the diagnosis of EIB is established by changes in lung function provoked by exercise, not on the basis of symptoms, using serial lung function measurements after exercise or hyperpnea challenge with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) preferred for better repeatability and discrimination. The airway response is expressed as percent fall in FEV1 from baseline, calculated using the lowest FEV1 recorded within 30 minutes after exercise, and the criterion for diagnosis is a percent fall in FEV1 of ≥ 10%. Severity can be graded as mild, moderate, or severe when the percent fall in FEV1 is ≥ 10% but < 25%, ≥ 25% but < 50%, and ≥ 50%, respectively. Surrogates for exercise testing that may be easier to implement include eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea or hyperventilation and hyperosmolar aerosols, including 4.5% saline, as well as dry powder mannitol.

Country-specific prevalence* of EIB in children (general population). *Owing to differences in study methodology, comparisons between studies should be treated with caution. EIB exercise-induced bronchoconstriction

Children living in urban environments are 1.6 times more likely to experience EIB compared with those living in rural areas, based on a study conducted in Kenya. The higher rates observed in urban areas were partially explained by an increased family history of asthma symptoms or increased exposure to environmental factors in urban areas, such as vehicle fumes, crowdedness and household animals. Similar urban–rural difference were observed in India. In addition, children with a low or middle socio-economic status were 8–10% more likely to experience EIB than those with a high socio-economic status. However, this finding is not universal; a study conducted in Nigeria demonstrated that EIB was not related to socio-economic class.

Prevalence of EIB in patients with asthma

Asthma is the main co-morbid factor associated with EIB, and EIB is estimated to occur in approximately 90% of patients with asthma. Patients with poorly controlled or severe asthma are more likely to manifest with EIB than patients with well-controlled or milder disease. Consequently, between-country differences in the prevalence of EIB should be considered in the context country-specific asthma control levels. In children and adolescents with asthma, the prevalence of EIB is estimated to be approximately 20–90%, with one study reporting that 46.7% of children with asthma display symptoms of EIB compared with 7.4% of those who do not have asthma. The majority of patients with chronic asthma will likely experience a transient increase in symptoms following an appropriate exercise challenge. EIB is known to hinder children's participation in vigorous activities. Other risk factors contributing to the prevalence of EIB include allergic rhinitis, a personal history of allergies, history of asthma in a close relative or history of wheeze.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) describes the transient narrowing of the airways during, and particularly after exercise and occurs commonly in asthmatic individuals. Limitation of exercise capacity is a frequent complaint in all age groups, and severity of EIB ranges from mild impairment of performance to severe bronchospasm and a large reduction in FEV1. Treatment of EIB varies from daily to less frequent therapy, depending on the level of activity. In this article, the authors evaluate the treatment possibilities before, during, and after exercise. They also review medications currently used to treat EIB.

Exercise challenge testing for EIB — protocol determinants and targets include that sustained high-level ventilation and inspired air water content are key, with a possible refractory period up to 4 hours after prior exercise. A valid test targets ventilation at least 15 times FEV1 and preferably greater than 21 times FEV1, and heart rate is an unreliable surrogate. The ideal protocol rapidly increases intensity over approximately 2–4 minutes while breathing dry air (< 10 mg H2O/L) with a nose clip to reach 80–90% of predicted maximum heart rate (predicted maximum heart rate = 220 − age in years) or ventilation 15–21 times FEV1, then maintains this level for an additional 4–6 minutes.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) with or without underlying asthma is a condition with complex pathophysiology, where many factors play a role in its development and clinical presentation. EIB can be impacted by various environmental factors including climate, environmental allergens, air pollution, and altitude. Although it might be hard to escape one's environment, patients should nevertheless be counseled on how the environment could impact their symptoms. Patient education regarding environmental factors could help overcome impediments to exercise and improve performance.

### Work group report: perspectives in diagnosis and management of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in athletes [^115ohSpm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Management and risk reduction for athletes with EIBa or EIB parallel asthma care with sport-specific constraints and prevention steps. The management of EIBa and EIB in athletes is like that of nonathletic patients with asthma, with several pharmacologic limitations for professional athletes depending on the sport they train and compete in; to reduce exacerbation risk, athletes should be encouraged to avoid certain environmental and ambient triggers and address training frequency and intensity if required, and development of tolerance/tachyphylaxis to β2-agonists with regular use should also be addressed to prevent refractory disease. For professional athletes, both the patient and the respiratory clinician must be aware of the antidoping regulations placed on asthma drugs so that the athlete is properly managed and is not penalized for noncompliance. EIB represents an asthma phenotype that can be characterized clinically and is associated with an increasingly well-defined biological endotype, and as clinicians better characterize phenotypes and endotypes, management will become more individualized and targeted.

Impact of effective EIB management

Given the well-known health benefits of exercise in both the general population and individuals with asthma, the need to manage EIB effectively is clear. Exercise, in particular swimming, has been shown to improve lung function and asthma symptoms and outcomes, including QoL in patients with asthma. An analysis of the impact of an aerobic training programme (N = 101) on asthma-specific health-related QoL, asthma symptoms, anxiety and depression scores in patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma found that aerobic training had an important role in the clinical management of persistent asthma. Significant (p < 0.001) reductions in physical limitation and symptom frequency (Fig. 2) were reported in the training group compared with the control group. Moreover, only patients from the training group reported reductions in anxiety and depression levels (p < 0.001).

Fig. 2
Impact of aerobic training on symptomatic burden in patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma. Patients were 20–50 years old with moderate or severe persistent asthma. Patients were under medical treatment for 6 months and considered clinically stable; ✱ p < 0.05 compared with baseline; † p < 0.05 compared with baseline and control group (two-way repeated-measure analysis of variance). Control group, n = 45; aerobic training group n = 44. Time points are 0 days (1 month before treatment), 30 days (first month of treatment), 60 days (second month of treatment) and 90 days (third month of treatment)

Many patients stop exercising because of their EIB symptoms. In the 2011 EIB Landmark Survey, 22.2% of children with asthma aged 4−12 years and 31.8% of those aged 13−17 years avoided sports activities as a result of their EIB. As EIB affects up to 90% of patients with asthma, the potential impact on aerobic exercise participation is substantial. Arguably, patients with asthma and EIB are at greater disadvantage than those with asthma and no EIB, for symptom precipitation during exercise often leads to avoidance of regular exercise and reduced QoL. It is important to raise awareness in primary care settings that EIB restricts exercise in patients with asthma, given the clinical and psychosocial benefits associated with physical activity.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction update-2016 [^112m1v3y]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

The first practice parameter on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) was published in 2010. This updated practice parameter was prepared 5 years later. In the ensuing years, there has been increased understanding of the pathogenesis of EIB and improved diagnosis of this disorder by using objective testing. At the time of this publication, observations included the following: dry powder mannitol for inhalation as a bronchial provocation test is FDA approved however not currently available in the United States; if baseline pulmonary function test results are normal to near normal (before and after bronchodilator) in a person with suspected EIB, then further testing should be performed by using standardized exercise challenge or eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH); and the efficacy of nonpharmaceutical interventions (omega-3 fatty acids) has been challenged. The workgroup preparing this practice parameter updated contemporary practice guidelines based on a current systematic literature review. The group obtained supplementary literature and consensus expert opinions when the published literature was insufficient. A search of the medical literature on PubMed was conducted, and search terms included pathogenesis, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and therapy (both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical) of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction or exercise-induced asthma (which is no longer a preferred term); asthma; and exercise and asthma. References assessed as relevant to the topic were evaluated to search for additional relevant references. Published clinical studies were appraised by category of evidence and used to document the strength of the recommendation. The parameter was then evaluated by Joint Task Force reviewers and then by reviewers assigned by the parent organizations, as well as the general membership. Based on this process, the parameter can be characterized as an evidence- and consensus-based document.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction therapy — definitions of protection and challenge thresholds: As an inclusion criterion in a pharmaceutical trial, a 20% decrease in FEV1 is usually required to define a positive challenge result. In a clinical setting it is desirable to produce as complete protection as possible so that there is no decrease in FEV1 after exercise with treatment, whereas in pharmaceutical trials protection might be defined as a less than 10% decrease in FEV1 after exercise or 50% protection compared with placebo for patients who are required to have a 20% decrease at the screening visit. Complete protection can be suggested by predefined decreases in FEV1 percentage within an accepted reference range (e.g., < 10% for FEV1), and clinical protection has been defined as a 50% inhibition of the placebo response to exercise by drug pretreatment; the 10% decrease is based on the mean plus 2 SDs of the decrease in healthy subjects, and the 50% protection is based on the coefficient of variation for repeated tests.

Patients with Risk Factors for Exacerbations

Prescribe an ICS-containing controller, preferably with ICS–formoterol as the reliever, as this reduces the risk of severe exacerbations. Arrange review more frequently than for patients at low risk. Identify and address modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, overuse of SABA, comorbidities) (Box 3–8 in Reference). Consider nonpharmacological strategies, such as smoking cessation advice and trigger avoidance, to improve symptom control and/or reduce risk (Box 3–9 in Reference).

Management of Exercise-induced Symptoms

For patients with dyspnea or wheezing on exertion, distinguish between exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and symptoms due to obesity, poor cardiopulmonary fitness, or alternative diagnoses such as inducible laryngeal obstruction. For patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, prescribe ICS-containing controller treatment and advise sufficient warm-up before exercise. Patients using as-needed ICS–formoterol as their reliever (Track 1) can use the same medication before exercise, if needed, and do not need a SABA inhaler.

Rationale

For pre-exercise use by adults and adolescents, formoterol was recommended in guidelines for many years as an effective and safe alternative to albuterol but is no longer promoted because of risks of LABA-only treatment. Pre-exercise ICS–formoterol avoids this risk and is as effective as daily ICS plus pre-exercise SABA in reducing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

### Pathogenesis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^11425yom]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

This article presents the various potential mechanisms responsible for the development of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Although the etiology of EIB is multifactorial, and the physiologic processes involved may vary between individuals (especially between those with and without asthma), drying of the small airways with an associated inflammatory response seems prerequisite for EIB. Dysregulated repair processes following exercise-induced airway epithelial injury may also serve as basis for EIB development/progression.

In subjects with no history of current clinical asthma, exercise or surrogate challenges (such as EVH) might be indicated, and with exercise challenge the patient should achieve a heart rate at least 85% of maximum (95% in children) for 6 minutes after 2 to 4 minutes of ramping up. In patients with known asthma, a graded challenge with inhaled mannitol, if available, might be preferable for reasons of safety to diagnose EIB, and if there is no response to a graded challenge and EIB is still suspected, then consider an ungraded challenge.

### Mechanisms and biomarkers of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: current insights and future directions [^1162ntww]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) refers to temporary lower airway narrowing that occurs during or after vigorous physical exertion, with a high incidence in athletes and individuals with pre-existing asthma. The pathophysiology of EIB is not completely understood, but it is thought to involve a complex interplay among airway epithelial changes, immune responses, and environmental interactions. Phenotypic differences are apparent among those affected by EIB. This clinical review aims to summarize the complex mechanisms underlying EIB, explore the role of biomarkers in the diagnosis and management, and identify current gaps in knowledge to pave the way for future scientific discoveries.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), subgrouped as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction with asthma (EIBa) or without asthma, is defined as acute airway narrowing that occurs during or after exercise. EIB has been described mostly in patients with asthma and athletes. Prevalence differs according to the subjects studied, challenge methods, and EIB definition. In the general population, prevalence is approximately 5% to 20%. In EIBa, it can be as high as 90% of patients with baseline asthma. In athletes, reported rates range from 7% to 70%. Some of the risk factors for developing EIB are living in an urban environment, a family history of asthma and atopy, and environmental factors such as low humidity.

### Testing for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^114eeFjx]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a form of airway hyperresponsiveness that occurs with or without current symptoms of asthma. EIB is an indicator of active and treatable pathophysiology in persons with asthma. The objective documentation of EIB permits the identification of an individual who may be at risk during a recreational sporting activity or when exercising as an occupational duty. EIB can be identified with laboratory exercise testing or surrogate tests for EIB. These include eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea and osmotic stimuli (eg, inhaled mannitol) and offer improved diagnostic sensitivity to identify EIB and improved standardization when compared with laboratory exercise.

### Mechanisms and biomarkers of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^112jqJex]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Exercise is a common trigger of bronchoconstriction. In recent years, there has been increased understanding of the pathophysiology of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Although evaporative water loss and thermal changes have been recognized stimuli for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, accumulating evidence points toward a pivotal role for the airway epithelium in orchestrating the inflammatory response linked to exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Overproduction of inflammatory mediators, underproduction of protective lipid mediators, and infiltration of the airways with eosinophils and mast cells are all established contributors to exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Sensory nerve activation and release of neuropeptides maybe important in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, but further research is warranted.

### Management of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in athletes [^112KN64g]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a phenomenon observed in asthma but is also seen in healthy individuals and frequently in athletes. High prevalence rates are observed in athletes engaged in endurance sports, winter sports, and swimming. The pathophysiology of EIB is thought to be related to hyperventilation, cold air, and epithelial damage caused by chlorine and fine particles in inspired air. Several diagnostic procedures can be used; however, the diagnosis of EIB based on self-reported symptoms is not reliable and requires an objective examination. The hyperosmolar inhalation test and eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea test, which involve indirect stimulation of the airway, are useful for the diagnosis of EIB. A short-acting β-agonist is the first choice for prevention of EIB, and an inhaled corticosteroid is essential for patients with asthma. Furthermore, treatment should accommodate antidoping requirements in elite athletes. Tailoring of the therapeutic strategy to the individual case and the prognosis after cessation of athletic activity are issues that should be clarified in the future.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113ndUn5]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) — clinical features and management: Physical activity is an important stimulus for asthma symptoms, with symptoms and bronchoconstriction typically worsening after cessation of exercise, but shortness of breath or wheezing during exercise may also relate to obesity, a lack of fitness, or comorbid or alternative conditions such as inducible laryngeal obstruction. Regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) significantly reduces EIB (Evidence A), and training and sufficient warm-up reduce the incidence and severity of EIB (Evidence A); taking short-acting beta2 agonists (SABAs), long-acting beta2 agonists (LABAs) or chromones prior to exercise prevents EIB (Evidence B), but tolerance to the protective effects of SABAs and LABAs against EIB develops with regular (more than once-daily) use (Evidence A). In mild asthma, low-dose budesonide-formoterol taken as needed for symptom relief and before exercise was non-inferior for reducing EIB to regular daily ICS with as-needed SABA, and patients with mild asthma who are prescribed as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol can use the same medication prior to exercise, if needed, and do not need to be prescribed a SABA for pre-exercise use (Evidence B). Chromone pMDIs have been discontinued globally, and when breakthrough EIB occurs, stepping up ICS-containing treatment (after checking inhaler technique and adherence) generally results in the reduction of exercise-related symptoms.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of EIB in patients with and without asthma is multifactorial, leading to the condition often being either under- or over-diagnosed. A recent systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the widespread adoption of any existing EIB screening tools, and highlighted that there exists a substantial unmet need for a validated questionnaire. Here we will discuss a number of diagnostic methods that are currently used for diagnosing EIB in both patients with underlying asthma and in those with EIB alone.

EIB should be considered when patients report respiratory symptoms that are induced by exercise. One potential approach for family physicians is to ask the patient to measure his/her PEF after the typical exercise that usually provokes symptoms. If peak flow results are reduced compared with the patient's baseline readings, formal investigation is required. Diagnosis of EIB is confirmed based on specific changes in lung function provoked by exercise, rather than on the basis of symptoms. Such testing can involve the use of both spirometric and bronchoprovocation techniques (Fig. 3; see refs.).

Fig. 3

Spirometry

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) Clinical Practice Guidelines outline a decline in FEV 1 of ≥ 10% from baseline after exercise or hyperpnoea challenge as confirmation of a positive EIB diagnosis. A minimum of two reproducible FEV 1 measurements are taken in series post-exercise challenge, with the highest acceptable value being recorded at each interval (usually 5, 10, 15 and 30 min after exercise). The lowest percentage decline in FEV 1 within 30 min post exercise from the pre-exercise level can then be used to determine the severity of EIB (mild, 10– < 25%; moderate, 25– < 50%; severe ≥ 50%).

The highest FEV1 at each time point is used to calculate percent decrease from baseline, and a 10% or greater decrease from the pre-exercise value at any 2 consecutive time points within 30 minutes of ceasing exercise can be considered diagnostic of EIB; if a greater decrease in FEV1 such as 20% is required (eg, in some pharmaceutical studies), then only 1 time point might be necessary to be diagnostic.

Introduction

Exercise-induced respiratory symptoms were first described in 1962.

The term "exercise-induced bronchoconstriction" (EIB) was coined in the 70's and indicated the narrowing of the airways after or during physical activity that could occur both in asthmatic or non-asthmatic patients.

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) Clinical Practice Guideline proposed to differentiate the use of the term EIB between EIB occurring in asthmatic patients (EIBa — EIB with asthma) and EIB in patients without typical signs or symptoms of asthma (EIBwa — EIB without asthma) highlighting that some people with EIB may not have a diagnosis of asthma. An underlying undiagnosed asthma, individual susceptibility, presence of atopy, duration and intensity of physical exercise and environmental conditions, such as cold air, high atmospheric pressure, relative humidity and pollutants are the factors that can influence onset and severity of EIB. The prevalence of EIB in children can be high especially in subjects with asthma and in athletes. Accurate medical history about reported symptoms including onset, characteristics and duration, full physical examination and specific tests can suggest and demonstrate EIB.

A prompt diagnosis followed by targeted treatment can prevent children from not doing regular physical activity, improve exercise tolerance and guarantee high performance in those involved in competitive sports.

The aim of the present study was to assess the agreement between specialists of Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy) about the management of EIB in children and formulate statements in a consensus document to help clinicians in daily clinical practice. Clear definition of EIB and indications on diagnosis, treatment and follow-up should help to identify children with EIB, consider referral to tertiary care and promote physical activity also in children with asthma.

Background

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is common in children with asthma but can be present also in children without asthma, especially athletes. Differential diagnosis includes several conditions such as exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO), cardiac disease, or physical deconditioning. Detailed medical history, clinical examination and specific tests are mandatory to exclude alternative diagnoses. Given the high prevalence of EIB in children and its potential impact on health, sport performance, and daily levels of physical activity, health care professionals should be aware of this condition and able to provide a specific work-up for its identification. The aims of the present study were: (a) to assess the agreement among hospital pediatricians and primary care pediatricians of Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy) about the management of EIB in children and (b) formulate statements in a consensus document to help clinicians in daily clinical practice.

Methods

According to Delphi method, a panel of specialists scored 40 statements that were then revised and discussed during online meetings to reach full consensus. Statements were then formulated.

Results

To obtain full consensus, the questionnaire was administered in two rounds after full discussion of the uncertain topics on the basis of the latest evidence on EIB published over the last 10 years. Despite an overall agreement on EIB management, some gaps emerged in the sections dedicated to diagnosis and treatment. Nine summary statements on definition, pathogenesis, diagnostic work-up, treatment, and follow-up were eventually formulated.

Conclusions

This study describes the knowledge of EIB in a group of pediatricians and highlights gaps and uncertainties in diagnosis and treatment. The creation of statements shared by the specialists of the same area may improve the management of EIB in children. However, more research and evidence are needed to better clarify the best treatment and to standardize the best diagnostic protocol limiting useless examinations but at the same time assuring the best management.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in athletes — mechanisms, seasonal testing patterns, and management — are described as follows: An "airway injury" form of overuse is contrasted with EIB, which results from airway smooth muscle constriction from the osmotic release of bronchoconstrictive mediators from resident inflammatory cells; if airway injury is suspected in an athlete, treatment recommendations can include the limitation of activity rather than introduction of the pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of asthma and EIB; seasonally, in contrast to the winter athlete, summer athletes generally demonstrate higher rates of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to indirect tests and lower rates of BHR to direct tests.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) warm-up and refractory period — Health care professionals should tell patients that pre-exercise warm-up should be done at 60% to 80% HRmax (maximum heart rate) to attenuate EIB; the refractory period typically lasts 1 to 3 hours and can extend to 4 hours, and albuterol plus warm-up provides better protection than either alone. Mechanistically, repeated exercise after an initial stimulus yields an approximately 50% reduction in airway responsiveness in 50% of patients with EIB, but this is not well understood.

Objective

To review the literature regarding the pathophysiology of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).

Data Sources

The databases of PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Scopus were searched for articles using the subject headings and/or keywords asthma, exercise-induced/etiology, exercise, mechanism, pathogenesis, and bronchoconstriction.

Study Selections

Articles were selected based on their relevance to the focus of this review, with emphasis on the specific pathophysiologic mechanisms of EIB.

Results

EIB occurs in response to the loss of water from the lower airways that results from heating and humidifying large volumes of air in a short period. The resulting hyperosmolar environment activates various cellular mechanisms to release mediators from mast cells, eosinophils, epithelial cells, and sensory nerves. These mediators, in turn, lead to airway smooth muscle contraction and bronchoconstriction. Airway hyperresponsiveness in elite athletes may develop from a process of airway injury and changes in the contractile properties of airway smooth muscle.

Conclusion

EIB commonly affects individuals with and without clinically recognized asthma, especially those who participate in competitive athletics. Through years of research, the pathophysiology of EIB is now better understood and involves a complex interaction between several different cell types and mediators. Continued research to improve the knowledge regarding the mechanisms of EIB should aid the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of this common condition.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: prevalence, pathophysiology, patient impact, diagnosis and management [^116KBCTR]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Definition and prevalence

EIB is defined as acute airway narrowing (which is transient and reversible) that occurs during or after exercise and can be observed in both patients who have and those who do not have chronic asthma. Typical symptoms include dyspnoea, wheezing, cough, chest tightness, excessive mucus production or the feeling of a lack of fitness when the patient is in good physical condition. EIB reportedly usually occurs within 2−5 min after exercise, peaks after 10 min and resolves in approximately 60 min.

Prevalence of EIB in the general population

The prevalence of EIB in the general population is approximately 5−20%. – However, because few epidemiological studies differentiate people with asthma from the general population, the true prevalence of EIB within the non-asthmatic general population is poorly understood.

The prevalence of EIB is greater in high-performance athletes than in the general population owing to prolonged inhalation of cold, dry air and airborne pollutants. Studies have reported a prevalence of EIB among elite or Olympic-level athletes of 30–70%, but reports are variable depending upon the environment in which the sport is performed, the type of sport and the maximum intensity achieved.

In children, the prevalence of EIB is also higher than in the general population, ranging from 3 to 35% (children ≤ 16 years old) (Fig. 1). There is large variation in the prevalence of EIB in children worldwide, with studies conducted in Nigeria, Braziland Polandreporting higher rates of EIB than Ghana, Indiaand Greece(Fig. 1). The impact of ethnicity on the prevalence of EIB is unclear, as only one study has directly compared prevalence between different ethnic groups in Scottish and English children. Children from an Asian background were 3.6 times more likely to experience EIB compared with Caucasian inner-city children. The prevalence of EIB was 12.3% in children with Asian ethnicity compared with 9.1% in Afro-Caribbean children and 4.5% in Caucasian inner-city children. These results should be interpreted with care because studies of ethnicity are invariably confounded by non-genetic factors.

The fact that exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) may be both over- and underdiagnosed in athletes has led to calls for widespread screening for the condition. This article assesses such a strategy by employing the standard framework used when evaluating any screening policy.

Clinical features

All statements about clinical features of EIB (questions 5 "EIB may occur during or after exercise", question 6 "EIB typical symptoms include cough, wheezing, dyspnea, and chest tightness", question 26 "Stridor is a characteristic symptom of EIB") showed consensus of the participants during the first survey.

Common symptoms of EIB include cough, dyspnea, wheezing, chest tightness, increased respiratory effort, diminished performance, and increased fatigue or sense of reduced fitness in physically fit patients. In children stomachache or sore throat may also be indicators of EIB. EIB usually manifests after exercise and typically starts within 15 min, after 5 to 8 min of high-intensity aerobic training and with a peak after 10 min. Symptoms spontaneously resolve within approximately 60 min. In asthmatic children, the time to reach maximal bronchoconstriction after exercise is shorter compared to non-asthmatic children.

Statement 2 (questions 5, 6, 26): Typical symptoms of EIB include coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, fatigue, and chest tightness. They usually manifest after 5–10 min of high intensity aerobic training and resolve within 15–60 min.

Epidemiology

All statements about epidemiology of EIB showed consensus of the participants during the first survey (Question 4 "EIB is a contraindication to competitive sport activity", question 5 "EIB may occur during or after exercise", question 7 "EIB may be a cause for which the child avoids physical activity", question 8 "EIB is more frequent in patient with poorly controlled asthma", question 9 "EIB does not occur if physical activity takes place indoors").

EIB prevalence varies among populations depending on age, type and level of activity, coexistence of asthma or atopy. Exercise intolerance caused by EIB can be a limitation for children who practice physical activity contributing to sedentary habits and low performance if engaged in competitive sports.

The prevalence of EIB in the general population ranges between 5 and 20%, with children and adolescents being more susceptible to EIB with prevalence up to 45%. This reported variability is influenced by demographic and geographical factors and also by methods used for detecting the condition.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: prevalence, pathophysiology, patient impact, diagnosis and management [^117Ptyo7]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

EIB can occur in both patients with and without asthma, with the prevalence in patients with asthma estimated at approximately 90%.EIB may lead to a substantial emotional burden on patients, and restrict exercise and sports participation. This potentially leads to long-term QoL and physical health consequences in patients with EIB, with or without asthma. Increased awareness among patients and physicians of the symptoms and risk factors for EIB and increased use of objective diagnostic tests is key to the holistic management of patients with EIB. As such, there is a pressing need for more research into EIB in patients with and without asthma, and the development of validated and widely acceptable screening methods and/or accurate diagnostic methods, which can be made accessible to family physicians.

For patients with and without asthma, pre-exercise SABAs are recommended as the first-line option for pharmacological treatment of EIB. The primary focus should be to increase awareness of EIB and educate patients to recognise symptoms and risk factors of EIB. Improved diagnosis and patient education further helps to optimise symptom control. Furthermore, increasing the accuracy of EIB diagnoses and providing education in how the patient can use SABA to prevent symptoms are needed.

Pathophysiology

At present, the osmotic theory is widely accepted as the established underlying mechanism of EIB. The osmotic theory suggests that increased ventilation in the airways during periods of exercise leads to water loss from the airway surfaces by evaporation, thus dehydrating the airway surfaces and initiating the events that lead to the contraction of bronchial smooth muscle. During exercise-related hyperventilation, transient osmotic change at the airway surface occurs owing to reductions in epithelium liquid volume, which in turn triggers mast cell degranulation. Consequently, there is mast cell-mediated release of prostaglandins (prostaglandin D2), leukotrienes, histamine and tryptase. These signalling molecules are known to mediate airway smooth muscle contraction and increase mucus production and microvascular permeability and sensory nerve activation, and their release is thought to be the main stimulus for bronchoconstriction and airway oedema.

Precipitating factors for EIB

In patients with EIB and chronic asthma, the pathophysiological mechanisms described above simply represent a trigger of underlying airway hyperactivity associated with poorly controlled asthma.

On the other hand, in patients with EIB who do not have asthma, the mechanisms described by the osmotic theory are believed to be directly responsible for causing bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms. Intense ventilation of cold air can further increase dehydration of the airway surfaces and cause changes in bronchial blood flow, explaining why athletes performing in cold weather (e.g. ice hockey, Nordic skiing) demonstrate the highest rates of EIB. Epithelial injury that is caused by the inhalation of air pollutants and poorly conditioned air during exercise has also been hypothesised to be a contributing factor for the development of EIB in patients without asthma. This hypothesis likely explains why reported prevalence rates for EIB in competitive swimmers approach 50%, with exposure to chloramines from the pool water considered the probable cause of epithelial injury. Supporting this theory, a family or personal history of atopy to environmental factors has been identified as a known risk for EIB.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) — diagnostic criteria and severity grading define EIB by the percent fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline measured within 30 minutes after exercise, with some guidelines using ≥ 10%, many laboratories using ≥ 15%, higher thresholds recommended for children (15 and 13.2%), and a fall of ≥ 10% at two consecutive time points also recommended. Reproducibility between two tests shows 76% agreement; when both tests show a ≥ 10% fall the percent decline is ± 14.6%, and when only one test shows a ≥ 10% fall it is ± 15.7%. Severity grading uses > 10% but < 25% (mild), ≥ 25% but < 50% (moderate), and ≥ 50% (severe), and in a person taking inhaled steroids a decline in FEV1 of ≥ 30% would be considered severe.

On the other hand, the "thermal or vascular theory" consists in bronchial vasoconstriction and subsequent rapid rewarming with vasodilation following the contact with cold air. As a result, vascular congestion and increased microvascular permeability results in bronchial edema and bronchoconstriction.

Environmental conditions such as low air temperature and low air humidity have been shown to damage the airway epithelial barrier promoting bronchial inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. There is strong evidence that athletes exposed to these conditions have increased levels of epithelial damage and airway inflammation. In sports with elevated risk factors, such as swimmers exposed to chlorine and athletes exposed to cold air, the prevalence is up to 75%. The climatic condition is crucial for EIB. Several studies, conducted in pediatric populations, demonstrated that EIB is more severe in cold and dry environments than in humid and warm regions with greater reduction of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1), peak expiratory flow (PEF) and maximum expiratory flow rate at 50% of vital capacity (MEF 50).

These data support the aforementioned "theories" on the pathogenesis of EIB. In addition, the presence of air pollutants can significantly increase the risk of EIB. A study conducted among young competitive athletes, aged 12 to 18 years, showed the increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness in those exposed to air pollution, especially particulate matter 10 µm (PM 10). Air pollution exposure was responsible for greater epithelial damage and airway inflammation. Another pollutant, which contributes to the onset of EIB is nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), as shown by Sanchez KM et al. who demonstrated in their cross-sectional pilot study that the personal daily exposure to NO 2 correlated with decrease in lung function after physical exercise.

Allergic rhinitis, a personal history of allergies, and atopic dermatitis contribute to higher risk of EIB. Indeed, according to epidemiological evidence, as many as 40% of patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) suffer from EIB, especially those with persistent untreated signs and symptoms. Other studies have shown that atopy, elevated IgE levels, and sensitization to house dust mites are associated with EIB. Another risk factor that may expose the subject to the onset of EIB are frequent respiratory tract infections, since the increasing level of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by the damaged airway epithelium have been shown to facilitate the release of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF, IL-1b or IL-6 that may lead to bronchial hyperresponsiveness and onset of EIB symptoms.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: background, prevalence, and sport considerations [^1148tq2D]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The transient airway narrowing that occurs as a result of exercise is defined as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). The prevalence of EIB has been reported to be up to 90% in asthmatic patients, reflecting the level of disease control. However, EIB may develop even in subjects without clinical asthma, particularly in children, athletes, patients with atopy or rhinitis, and following respiratory infections. The intensity, duration, and type of training have been associated with the occurrence of EIB. In athletes, EIB seems to be only partly reversible, and exercise seems to be a causative factor of airway inflammation and symptoms.

Exercise-induced bronchospasm is an obstruction of transient airflow that usually occurs five to 15 minutes after physical exertion. Although this condition is highly preventable, it is still underrecognized and affects aerobic fitness and quality of life. Diagnosis is based on the results of a detailed history, including assessment of asthma triggers, symptoms suggestive of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and a normal forced expiratory volume at one second at rest. A trial of therapy with an inhaled beta agonist may be instituted, with the subsequent addition of inhaled anti-inflammatory agents or ipratropium bromide. Nonpharmacologic measures, such as increased physical conditioning, warm-up exercises, and covering the mouth and nose, should be instituted. If symptoms persist, pulmonary function testing is warranted to rule out underlying lung disease.

Statement 4 (questions 10–14): The underlying mechanisms responsible for EIB are complex and not fully understood. "Osmotic" and "thermal" theories have been proposed. Environmental factors, such as low temperature, low humidity, exposure to allergens and pollution, and individual factors like atopy and airway inflammation play a role in triggering EIB.

Diagnostic work-up

Some concerns have emerged in the discussion of this section. Uncertainty emerged about: spirometry as gold standard test to diagnose EIB (question 15 "Spirometry is the gold standard test to diagnose EIB"), heart rate percentage to be achieved during the exercise test (question 17 "During an exercise challenge test the child must reach at least 50% of its maximum heart rate"), timing of spirometry after the test (question 19 "The first spirometry is performed after 3 min of running" and question 20 "The first spirometry is performed 5 min after the end of the exercise challenge test"), value of FEV 1 needed to diagnose EIB severity (question 24 "The severity of EIB can be classified based on the reduction of FEV 1 ") and the possibility that a normal spirometry could exclude EIB (question 25 "The exercise challenge test may be negative even if the subject suffers from EIB"). The remaining statements obtained sufficient agreement during the first survey (question 16 "Exercise challenge test is the gold standard test to diagnose EIB", question 18 "During an exercise challenge test the child must reach at least 80% of its maximum heart rate", question 21 "Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV 1) is assessed in the exercise challenge test", question 22 "The exercise challenge test is considered positive if FEV1 is reduced by 5%", question 23 "The exercise challenge test is considered positive if FEV1 is reduced by 10%".

In children and adolescents with asthma, the prevalence of EIB is higher and estimated to range between 20 and 90%. EIB is more frequent in severe or poorly controlled asthma patients compared to those with well-controlled or mild asthma.

Atopy plays a major role in EIB: not only asthma but also atopic dermatitis, sensitization to house dust mites or cats, and elevated IgE levels are associated with greater risk of EIB.

Furthermore, polysensitization rather than monosensitization, significantly increased the risk of EIB in children aged 5 to 10 years.

The prevalence of EIB in athletes is higher than in general population but varies depending on the studied population, with a higher occurrence observed in those engaged in endurance activities such as long-distance running, cycling, triathlon, and pentathlon. According to a recent systematic review, the prevalence rate of EIB among general athletes is 23%, higher than in general population, while for Olympic athletes is 8%.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: prevalence, pathophysiology, patient impact, diagnosis and management [^113EpU8e]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) can occur in individuals with and without asthma, and is prevalent among athletes of all levels. In patients with asthma, symptoms of EIB significantly increase the proportion reporting feelings of fearfulness, frustration, isolation, depression and embarrassment compared with those without symptoms. EIB can also prevent patients with asthma from participating in exercise and negatively impact their quality of life. Diagnosis of EIB is based on symptoms and spirometry or bronchial provocation tests; owing to low awareness of EIB and lack of simple, standardised diagnostic methods, under-diagnosis and mis-diagnosis of EIB are common. To improve the rates of diagnosis of EIB in primary care, validated and widely accepted symptom-based questionnaires are needed that can accurately replicate the current diagnostic standards (forced expiratory volume in 1s reductions observed following exercise or bronchoprovocation challenge) in patients with and without asthma. In patients without asthma, EIB can be managed by various non-pharmacological methods and the use of pre-exercise short-acting β 2 -agonists (SABAs). In patients with asthma, EIB is often associated with poor asthma control but can also occur in individuals who have good control when not exercising. Inhaled corticosteroids are recommended when asthma control is suboptimal; however, pre-exercise SABAs are also widely used and are recommended as the first-line therapy. This review describes the burden, key features, diagnosis and current treatment approaches for EIB in patients with and without asthma and serves as a call to action for family physicians to be aware of EIB and consider it as a potential diagnosis.

### Mechanisms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in athletes: current perspectives and future challenges [^113uUQTh]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

The evidence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) without asthma (EIBw A) occurring in athletes led to speculate about different endotypes inducing respiratory symptoms within athletes. Classical postulated mechanisms for bronchial obstruction in this population include the osmotic and the thermal hypotheses. More recently, the presence of epithelial injury and inflammation in the airways of athletes was demonstrated. In addition, neuronal activation has been suggested as a potential modulator of bronchoconstriction. Investigation of these emerging mechanisms is of major importance as EIB is a significant problem for both recreational and competitive athletes and is the most common chronic condition among Olympic athletes, with obvious implications for their competing performance, health and quality of life. Hereby, we summarize the latest achievements in this area and identify the current gaps of knowledge so that future research heads toward better defining the etiologic factors and mechanisms involved in development of EIB in elite athletes as well as essential aspects to ultimately propose preventive and therapeutic measures.

Background

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) describes acute airway narrowing that occurs as a result of exercise. EIB occurs in a substantial proportion of patients with asthma, but may also occur in individuals without known asthma.

Methods

To provide clinicians with practical guidance, a multidisciplinary panel of stakeholders was convened to review the pathogenesis of EIB and to develop evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of EIB. The evidence was appraised and recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

Results

Recommendations for the treatment of EIB were developed. The quality of evidence supporting the recommendations was variable, ranging from low to high. A strong recommendation was made for using a short-acting β(2)-agonist before exercise in all patients with EIB. For patients who continue to have symptoms of EIB despite the administration of a short-acting β(2)-agonist before exercise, strong recommendations were made for a daily inhaled corticosteroid, a daily leukotriene receptor antagonist, or a mast cell stabilizing agent before exercise.

Conclusions

The recommendations in this Guideline reflect the currently available evidence. New clinical research data will necessitate a revision and update in the future.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) screening — Screening is defined as the strategy used in a population to detect a condition in a preclinical or asymptomatic phase with the aim of providing timely intervention to favorably influence outcome, whereas case detection is the identification of individuals with disease who are symptomatic, but undiagnosed. Evaluation of screening using World Health Organization criteria reveals important deficiencies in data needed to ensure validity, and a prior ATS report concluded there was insufficient evidence to support adoption of population-based asthma case detection. We were unable to locate any randomized controlled trials or large, well done observational studies evaluating the overall efficacy of a screening program for EIB on either health or performance outcome, so there presently remains major uncertainty in estimates of benefits, harms, and burdens, and more evidence is needed before the value of screening for EIB can be determined. Extrapolating findings from small, selected observational cohorts to a general screening policy is inappropriate.

### Work group report: perspectives in diagnosis and management of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in athletes [^114JP6cr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in athletes — definitions and clinical distinctions are clarified as follows: The prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is higher in competitive athletes than in the general population, with ranges up to 50%. The term exercise-induced asthma is no longer preferred; exercise-induced asthma is now referred to as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction with asthma (EIBa), while exercise-induced bronchoconstriction without asthma is referred to as EIB. Both EIBa and EIB commonly share airway hyperreactivity, and distinguishing between them is important for accurate diagnosis and management. Patients with EIBa have a history of asthma that is exacerbated by exercise, whereas patients with EIB do not have a history of asthma but experience symptoms of asthma with exercise only. Acute episodes of bronchospasm during exercise can result in significant morbidity in athletes and may affect athletic performance.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction update-2016 [^115p2phU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction diagnostic testing recommendations — Perform a standardized bronchoprovocation (exercise or a surrogate) challenge to diagnose EIB [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Evidence: A]. In subjects with no current clinical history of asthma, use an indirect ungraded challenge (eg, exercise challenge or surrogate testing, such as with EVH) for assessing EIB in the recreational or elite athlete who has normal lung function [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Evidence: D]. Use an indirect graded challenge (eg, mannitol, if available) for assessing EIB in recreational or elite athletes who have normal to near-normal lung function and who might currently require treatment for the prevention of EIB or asthma [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Evidence: D]. Perform an indirect challenge instead of a direct challenge for assessing EIB, recognizing that an indirect challenge is more sensitive for detection of EIB than a direct challenge. Direct challenges use a single pharmacologic agent (eg, methacholine or histamine) acting directly on airway smooth muscle, whereas indirect challenges use exercise or surrogates (eg, EVH, mannitol, hypertonic saline, or AMP) that trigger endogenous mediator release; indirect challenges are more specific in reflecting bronchial hyperresponsiveness and are preferred to confirm underlying asthma and potentially the need for ICSs and are recommended for monitoring asthma therapy.

### Pharmacologic strategies for exercise-induced bronchospasm with a focus on athletes [^117UBnvt]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is the transient narrowing of the airways during and after exercise that occurs in response to increased ventilation in susceptible individuals. It occurs across the age spectrum in patients with underlying asthma and can occur in athletes without baseline asthma. The inflammatory mechanisms underlying EIB in patients without asthma may be distinct from those underlying EIB in patients with asthma. This review summarizes mechanistic and clinical data that can guide the choice of chronic and acute pharmacologic therapies targeting control of EIB. Relevant regulations from the World Anti-Doping Agency are also discussed.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction update-2016 [^116hz43K]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) — nonpharmacologic and athlete-focused management includes that nonpharmacologic therapy is recommended by using pre-exercise warm-up to prevent and partially reduce EIB severity; dietary supplementation with fish oil, ascorbic acid, or sodium restriction is inconclusive; competitive and elite athletes can have EIB alone with characteristics differing from EIB with asthma, but both recreational and elite athletes with EIB with asthma can be treated similarly, and EIB alone responds to similar treatment as with asthma; the presence of EIB reflects active asthma, and good control can enable a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and sport.

### Diagnosing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction… [^114RiFae]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Background: Airway obstruction following vigorous exercise, known as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, is present in 60 to 90 percent of persons with asthma and 6 to 13 percent of persons without asthma or allergy. Symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction resemble those of an asthma exacerbation, including shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction begins three to 15 minutes after the cessation of exercise and can last from 20 minutes to one hour. If a patient's clinical history suggests exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, the diagnosis can be confirmed by a standardized exercise challenge. Management includes education, improved physical fitness, and medications.

Dryden and colleagues systematically reviewed evidence on the accuracy of several diagnostic tests for exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction, and the effectiveness of non pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Pharmacologic therapies for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction included bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents. There was consistent evidence that short- and longacting beta agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, mast cell stabilizers, and anticholinergics were safe and effective for prophylaxis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists were not directly compared with other therapies. Inhaled corticosteroids were found to be ineffective for prophylaxis. Despite a low strength of evidence, interval warm-up routines and warm-up routines that combined interval and continuous components showed more promise for preventing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction than did continuous warm-up routines of up to 30 minutes. Conclusion: The authors conclude that although several drug classes appear to be effective in preventing the onset of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma, evidence on the accuracy of diagnostic tests is limited. They suggest that future research investigate the effects of treatments on patients who have exercise-induced bronchoconstriction alone without asthma, as well as subgroups defined by asthma severity, age, and baseline activity level.

### Diagnostic testing in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^1136F218]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), a reversible airflow obstruction triggered by exercise, should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms of dyspnea, cough, wheeze, and chest tightness during or after vigorous exercise. Over the past several years, various diagnostic modalities have been developed and evaluated for the diagnosis of EIB, giving the clinician multiple options for diagnostic testing. Here, the authors present a review of the various testing options that can be used in the diagnosis of EIB, with a discussion of testing protocols and considerations for choosing the appropriate diagnostic test.

Questionnaire

The project coordinators and the scientific committee developed a questionnaire with 40 statements focusing on 4 main topics selected on the basis of available literature and clinical experience: (1) definition, epidemiology and clinical features; (2) pathogenesis; (3) diagnostic work-up; (4) treatment and follow-up. The complete questionnaire is available in the Supplementary Materials.

The statements were formulated after a careful review of the current scientific literature. Seven reviewers (RG, AG, AR, GZ, MM, NM, SP) independently searched for experimental studies, reviews, systematic reviews, metanalysis and guidelines using the MEDLINE database via the PubMed interface from 1 January 2014 to 30 April 2024 using the following query string: ("pediat" OR "paediatr" OR "child" OR "youth") AND ("exercise induced bronchoconstriction" OR "exercise-induced bronchoconstriction" OR "EIB" OR "exercise induced asthma" OR "exercise-induced asthma" OR "bronchoconstriction" OR "exertional asthma"). Only English-language articles were selected. The search was also implemented with older papers when necessary.

In our study Delphi procedure was performed over two rounds with the application Google Forms. In each round, panel members were e-mailed a unique link to the questionnaire. Questionnaires were completed online in a dedicated web platform and voted by the panel of experts using a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = somewhat disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = somewhat agree, 5 = strongly agree). Statements for which at least 75% of the responses were 1 and 2 (expression of disagreement) or 4 and 5 (expression of agreement) were considered as having reached the consensus. On the other side, statements answered with less than 75% of agreement or disagreement among the experts indicated uncertainty among responders. The results of the questionnaires for each round were analyzed by an independent statistician and reported to participants in plenary discussion during a virtual meeting. During the meeting each statement was supported by related references and those revealing different opinions among the participants (< 75% in agreement or disagreement), were debated and clarified.

A second round of the online questionnaire was then provided to reach the consensus in all the statements; this was followed by a further virtual meeting where the difference between the results of the first and second round was discussed and the panel of experts formulated the final summary statements. Figure 1 shows the diagram of the study design.
