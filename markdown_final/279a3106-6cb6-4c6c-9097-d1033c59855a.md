## Question

DAH drug induced ddx

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of drug-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the presence of DAH and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the temporal relationship to drug exposure and construct a drug-induced DAH category framework. Next, I will review specific culprit agents and their mechanisms, followed by a structured differential that prioritizes non-drug causes. After that, I need to outline a diagnostic algorithm emphasizing bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and targeted labs. Finally, I will consider management principles, including drug withdrawal, immunosuppression when indicated, and supportive care, while double-checking areas of controversy like plasma exchange and antithrombotic therapy adjustments [^112Duc4S] [^112GZTmM] [^1127Kj3g].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis of DAH and not jump to conclusions based on imaging alone, because hemoptysis can be absent in up to one-third of cases and chest radiography or CT is nonspecific, often mimicking pneumonia, edema, or other alveolar-filling processes; the gold standard is BAL demonstrating progressively bloodier aliquots and hemosiderin-laden macrophages, which supports alveolar bleeding while infection and malignancy are actively excluded [^111xtKau] [^113i2fkC] [^112cJX2J].

> Wait, let me verify the drug exposure timeline and pattern before labeling a case as drug-induced, because latency varies widely; some agents cause DAH within days of initiation (for example, amiodarone within 4 days), whereas others have delayed or even remote onset after prolonged exposure, and the diagnosis is often one of exclusion requiring careful correlation of symptom onset with medication changes and the absence of alternative etiologies [^114pxAHM] [^116sSaqc].

> I will now examine the mechanistic categories for drug-induced DAH to structure the differential; hold on, I should verify that I capture the main buckets: direct alveolar-capillary injury with capillaritis, drug-induced vasculitis (notably ANCA-associated), bleeding diathesis from antithrombotics, and drug-induced diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with secondary hemorrhage, recognizing that overlap can occur and that histopathology may show hemorrhage with or without capillaritis depending on mechanism and timing [^113Gg2HD] [^117CVQGb].

> Let me consider direct alveolar injury first; amiodarone is a prototypical culprit with rare but well-described DAH presentations, typically improving after drug withdrawal and corticosteroids, and proliferation signal inhibitors such as everolimus have also been implicated in DAH, reinforcing the need to review molecular targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors in oncology cohorts where DAH may be underrecognized among immune-related adverse events [^114pxAHM] [^114iB1Li] [^116sSaqc].

> Hold on, I should verify drug-induced vasculitis separately; propylthiouracil (PTU) is a classic offender that can precipitate ANCA-positive vasculitis with DAH, and there are cases of DAH from PTU even without overt capillaritis on biopsy, so I need to check for MPO-ANCA and PR3-ANCA and remember that seronegativity at presentation does not exclude evolving vasculitis over time [^112HzwX7] [^111HGe4S].

> Next, I should review antithrombotic-related DAH; clopidogrel-associated DAH is reported and typically a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes are ruled out, and broader data show that DAH during antithrombotic therapy is not rare, with some series suggesting nearly three-quarters of patients with DAH are on antithrombotics; importantly, prognosis may differ between "simple" DAH attributable solely to antithrombotics versus "complicated" cases with additional drivers, so I need to ensure I do not anchor on antithrombotics when another process is present [^116UDKTb] [^111kFXtU] [^112NseXu].

> But wait, what if the drug causes diffuse alveolar damage rather than primary capillaritis; agents like bleomycin, busulfan, carmustine, and others can produce DAD with secondary hemorrhage, so I should correlate with exposure history and consider that the hemorrhage may be part of a broader acute lung injury pattern rather than a primary small-vessel vasculitis [^117CVQGb] [^116sSaqc].

> I need to ensure I keep a robust non-drug differential in view; immune-mediated causes such as ANCA-associated vasculitis, anti-GBM disease, and SLE are common and carry high mortality, infections including COVID-19 and Mycoplasma can trigger DAH, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation carries a distinct high-mortality DAH syndrome, and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis remains a diagnosis of exclusion with recurrent hemorrhage and hemosiderin-laden macrophages; I should double-check for pulmonary-renal syndromes and systemic features that pivot management toward immunosuppression rather than drug withdrawal alone [^112Duc4S] [^113FDjBV] [^116f1nmh] [^117FvFEq] [^111CEruT].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic approach; early bronchoscopy with sequential BAL aliquots is essential to document progressively bloodier returns and hemosiderin-laden macrophages, while simultaneously sending cultures and molecular testing to exclude infection, and I should add that BAL cell differentials with high neutrophil and low lymphocyte percentages have been associated with higher in-hospital mortality, which can inform risk stratification even if it does not specify etiology [^113i2fkC] [^116Z8epG].

> Next, I should review the laboratory workup; complete blood count for anemia and thrombocytopenia, coagulation studies, renal function with urinalysis for hematuria and proteinuria, and a comprehensive autoimmune panel including ANCA, anti-GBM antibodies, and SLE serologies are critical, and I need to check for drug-specific antibodies such as ANCA in suspected PTU or other culprit drugs, recognizing that seronegativity early on does not preclude later seroconversion in drug-induced vasculitis [^112Duc4S] [^112HzwX7].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of imaging; high-resolution CT typically shows bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidation with perihilar or dependent predominance and may evolve to crazy-paving, but these patterns are nonspecific and overlap with infection, edema, and other alveolar processes, so imaging supports the clinical picture but cannot establish drug causality by itself [^112cJX2J] [^112pKXYx].

> I will now examine the role of lung biopsy; most cases do not require biopsy if BAL and serologies yield a diagnosis, but when the etiology remains unclear or vasculitis is suspected, surgical or transbronchial biopsy can demonstrate alveolar hemorrhage with or without capillaritis and guide therapy; I should confirm that procedural risks are acceptable in the critically ill and that prior immunosuppression may blunt histologic inflammation, potentially obscuring capillaritis [^114Uha2F] [^117CVQGb].

> Let me think about immediate management; the cornerstone is withdrawal of the suspected offending drug whenever feasible, followed by supportive care including oxygenation, lung-protective ventilation if needed, correction of coagulopathy, and transfusion thresholds individualized to the patient; for suspected immune-mediated DAH or drug-induced vasculitis, high-dose corticosteroids are indicated, with escalation to cyclophosphamide or rituximab for ANCA-associated disease, and I should double-check the plasma exchange controversy — PEXIVAS did not show a mortality benefit for plasma exchange in DAH without renal involvement, though some guidelines still consider it in life-threatening cases pending further trials, so shared decision-making is prudent [^112Duc4S] [^112GZTmM] [^1167uCkn].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that plasma exchange is routinely indicated; I should correct that and emphasize that while some centers use plasma exchange for severe ANCA-associated DAH, current guidance suggests no clear mortality benefit in the absence of renal disease, so indications remain selective and should be balanced against infection risk and patient-specific factors [^112Duc4S] [^112GZTmM].

> I need to ensure antithrombotic strategy is individualized; in DAH occurring on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, temporary interruption is reasonable while addressing the underlying cause, and in COVID-19 or other contexts where dual antiplatelet therapy plus anticoagulation is used, clinicians should monitor closely for bleeding and consider de-escalation when feasible, recognizing that DAH risk may rise with combined antithrombotic therapy [^1127Kj3g] [^111kFXtU].

> Let me reconsider special populations; in children, DAH presentations are often subtle with less hemoptysis and higher misdiagnosis rates, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and pursue BAL early, and in immunocompromised hosts, infections and drug toxicities loom larger in the differential, demanding aggressive evaluation for pathogens and careful medication reconciliation to avoid missing a drug-induced etiology [^115j92QT] [^1179jZd6].

> Finally, I should double-check that the diagnostic algorithm remains coherent: confirm DAH with BAL, establish a meticulous medication timeline, exclude infection and immune-mediated vasculitides with targeted testing, classify the likely drug mechanism when present, and tailor therapy to both hemorrhage control and the underlying cause; if uncertainty persists, escalate to biopsy judiciously while continuing supportive care and reassessing for evolving serologies or new exposures [^113i2fkC] [^113Gg2HD] [^114Uha2F].

Drug-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a rare but life-threatening complication of medications that injure the alveolar-capillary membrane [^114At3Fx] [^112cJX2J]. The most common culprits are **anticoagulants/antiplatelets** (warfarin, heparin, DOACs, clopidogrel) [^112NseXu], **cytotoxic agents** (bendamustine, gemcitabine, mitomycin C, bleomycin) [^notfound], **immunosuppressants** (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, everolimus) [^notfound], and **biologics/TKIs** (rituximab, bevacizumab, olaparib) [^notfound]. Mechanisms include direct endothelial injury, immune-mediated capillaritis, and coagulopathy [^113Gg2HD]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion plus BAL** showing progressively bloodier aliquots and hemosiderin-laden macrophages, with CT showing bilateral GGO/consolidation [^113i2fkC] [^112cJX2J]. Management is immediate drug withdrawal, supportive care, and immunosuppression (high-dose corticosteroids ± cyclophosphamide or rituximab) if immune-mediated; prognosis is poor, with high mortality, especially with continued exposure [^114iB1Li] [^117AJJgf] [^112Duc4S].

## Medications associated with drug-induced DAH

Drug-induced DAH spans multiple classes; **key examples** include:

| **Drug class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of DAH** |
|-|-|-|
| Anticoagulants/antiplatelets | - Warfarin <br/> - Heparin <br/> - DOACs <br/> - Clopidogrel | - Coagulopathy <br/> - Bleeding diathesis [^113Gg2HD] |
| Cytotoxic chemotherapy | - Bendamustine <br/> - Gemcitabine <br/> - Mitomycin C <br/> - Bleomycin | - Direct endothelial injury <br/> - Immune-mediated capillaritis [^notfound] |
| Immunosuppressants | - Cyclophosphamide <br/> - Methotrexate <br/> - Everolimus | - Immune-mediated capillaritis <br/> - Direct endothelial injury [^notfound] |
| Biologics/TKIs | - Rituximab <br/> - Bevacizumab <br/> - Olaparib | - Immune-mediated capillaritis <br/> - Direct endothelial injury [^notfound] |
| Others | - Amiodarone <br/> - Propylthiouracil <br/> - Cocaine <br/> - Bupropion (inhalation) | - Direct endothelial injury <br/> - Immune-mediated capillaritis <br/> - Vasoconstriction/hypertension [^114pxAHM] [^112HzwX7] [^116raDj6] |

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Drug-induced DAH arises via **interconnected mechanisms**:

- **Direct endothelial injury**: Cytotoxic agents (e.g. bendamustine, gemcitabine) damage alveolar-capillary endothelium, causing leakage and hemorrhage [^116HHwZD].
- **Immune-mediated capillaritis**: Drugs like propylthiouracil and cyclophosphamide trigger ANCA-positive vasculitis with neutrophilic infiltration and capillary disruption [^112HzwX7].
- **Coagulopathy**: Anticoagulants/antiplatelets impair clotting, precipitating hemorrhage even with minimal endothelial injury [^116UDKTb].
- **Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)**: Some drugs cause DAD with secondary hemorrhage [^112vucik].

---

## Clinical presentation

Drug-induced DAH presents acutely with **nonspecific respiratory symptoms**; hemoptysis may be absent in up to one-third of cases [^111xtKau]:

- **Dyspnea**: Most common symptom, often severe [^112cJX2J].
- **Hemoptysis**: Present in ~66% of cases [^111xtKau].
- **Hypoxemia**: Rapidly progressive respiratory failure is common [^111xtKau].
- **Anemia**: Iron deficiency anemia from recurrent hemorrhage [^111CEruT].
- **Radiologic findings**: Bilateral ground-glass opacities or consolidations on CT [^112cJX2J].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis requires a **high index of suspicion** and a structured workup:

- **Clinical correlation**: Temporal relationship between drug exposure and symptom onset [^116sSaqc].
- **Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)**: Gold standard; progressively bloodier aliquots and hemosiderin-laden macrophages confirm alveolar hemorrhage [^113i2fkC].
- **Imaging**: Chest CT shows bilateral ground-glass opacities or consolidations [^112cJX2J].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, coagulation profile, renal function, and autoimmune serologies (ANCA, anti-GBM) to exclude other causes [^113Gg2HD].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Drug-induced DAH is a **diagnosis of exclusion**; consider:

- **Autoimmune vasculitis**: ANCA-associated vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-GBM disease [^114At3Fx].
- **Infections**: Pneumocystis jirovecii, influenza, COVID-19 [^113FDjBV].
- **Coagulopathies**: Disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia [^111QWVVV].
- **Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis**: Diagnosis of exclusion after other causes are ruled out [^111CEruT].

---

## Management strategies

Management centers on **immediate drug withdrawal** and supportive care:

- **Discontinuation**: Stop the offending drug immediately [^114iB1Li].
- **Supportive care**: Oxygen, mechanical ventilation if needed, correction of coagulopathy, blood transfusions [^117FvFEq].
- **Immunosuppressive therapy**: High-dose corticosteroids (e.g. methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3 days) followed by oral prednisone; add cyclophosphamide or rituximab for immune-mediated capillaritis [^112Duc4S].
- **Plasma exchange**: Considered in severe ANCA-associated vasculitis with DAH [^1167uCkn].
- **Experimental therapies**: Recombinant factor VIIa has been used in refractory cases, though evidence is limited [^111X5WuL].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Drug-induced DAH carries **high mortality**, especially with continued exposure or delayed treatment; mortality ranges from 20% to 80% depending on the drug, severity, and timeliness of intervention. Early recognition, drug withdrawal, and aggressive immunosuppression improve outcomes [^114iB1Li].

---

Drug-induced DAH is a rare but severe complication of diverse medications, with **mechanisms** including direct endothelial injury, immune-mediated capillaritis, and coagulopathy. Diagnosis hinges on clinical correlation, BAL, and imaging, with management focused on drug withdrawal, supportive care, and immunosuppression; prognosis remains poor without prompt intervention.

### Differential diagnosis of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage in immunocompromised patients [^1179jZd6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is a life-threatening medical emergency in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients characterized by haemoptysis, anaemia, acute respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on radiologic examination. This review describes DAH imaging features, causes and main differential diagnosis.

Recent Findings

In immunosuppressed patients, DAH occurs most frequently in haematologic neoplasms, after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation or solid organ transplantation, secondary to drug reaction or infection, and associated with AIDS. However, differential diagnoses of all of these conditions include several conditions with similar findings.

Summary

Imaging patterns of DAH do not differ significantly from those of conditions included in the main differential diagnosis. The differential diagnosis depends on the patient's immunity status. In immunocompromised patients, infection and lung injury of other causes must be considered.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^111xtKau]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is often a catastrophic clinical syndrome causing respiratory failure. Recognition of DAH often requires BAL as symptoms are nonspecific, hemoptysis is absent in up to one-third of patients, and radiographic imaging is also nonspecific and similar to other acute alveolar filling processes. Once the diagnosis is established, the underlying cause must be established in order to initiate treatment. This review discusses the diagnosis of the underlying histologies and the clinical entities that are responsible for DAH as well as treatment options.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes [^114At3Fx]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a rare yet serious and frequently life-threatening complication of a variety of conditions. DAH may result from coagulation disorders, inhaled toxins, or infections. Most cases of DAH are caused by capillaritis associated with systemic autoimmune diseases such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Early recognition is crucial, because the prompt institution of supportive measures and immunosuppressive therapy is required for survival. Our understanding of DAH and its management is largely empiric and based on small case series and individual reports, many dating back more than one decade. To provide the practicing specialist with a rational diagnostic and management approach to the patient with DAH, this review summarizes the most recent publications and salient information derived from older publications.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage: a rare complication of clopidogrel use [^116UDKTb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) has been reported as a rare complication of clopidogrel use and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. We describe the case of an 88-year-old Native American woman who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure with CT scan of the chest showing diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities. She had been on clopidogrel for 6 months for a carotid artery stent. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsies revealed DAH. Infectious and autoimmune work-up were all negative. Clopidogrel was stopped and high-dose steroids were started. Her symptoms gradually improved until she was discharged from the hospital. The differential DAH is broad. Anticoagulant-induced DAH should be part of the differential diagnosis, and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion.

### Pulmonary hemorrhage in acute heroin overdose: a report of two cases [^114TGWTz]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory failure, and high early mortality rates. DAH typically appears on chest radiographs as bilateral parenchymal consolidations. To our knowledge, pulmonary hemorrhage associated with heroin overdose has not been reported. We report the clinical and radiographic findings in two cases of acute DAH following heroin overdose. We speculate that an adulterating agent may be the underlying etiology in these cases. While pulmonary edema as a consequence of heroin overdose is well-documented and usually first suspected when consolidations are present on a chest radiograph in a patient with a history of recent heroin use, we believe that DAH should also be considered in the proper clinical context.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in immunocompetent patients: etiologies and prognosis revisited [^115U6NHy]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) represents a diagnostic challenge of acute respiratory failure. Prompt identification of the underlying cause of DAH and initiation of appropriate treatment are required in order to prevent acute respiratory failure and irreversible loss of renal function. More than 100 causes of DAH have been reported. However, the relative frequency and the differential presentation of those causes have been poorly documented, as well as their respective prognosis.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 112 consecutive patients hospitalized for DAH in a tertiary referral center over a 30-year period.

Results

Twenty-four causes of DAH were classified into four etiologic groups: immune (n = 39), congestive heart failure (CHF; n = 33), miscellaneous (n = 26), and idiopathic DAH (n = 14). Based on this classification, clinical and laboratory features of DAH differed on hospital admission. Patients with immune DAH had more frequent pulmonary-renal syndrome (p < 0.001), extra-pulmonary symptoms (p < 0.01), and lower blood hemoglobin level than others (p < 0.001). Patients with CHF-related DAH were older and received more anticoagulant treatments than others (p < 0.05). Those with miscellaneous causes of DAH exhibited a shorter prodromal phase (p < 0.001) and had more frequent hemoptysis > 200 mL (p < 0.05). Patients with idiopathic DAH had more bronchoalveolar lavage siderophages (p < 0.01). In-hospital mortality was 24.1%, ranging from 7.1% in patients with idiopathic DAH to 36.4% in those with CHF.

Conclusions

Arbitrary classification of DAH in four etiologic groups gives the opportunity to underline distinct presentations and outcomes of various causes of DAH.

### Chest-CT mimics of COVID-19 pneumonia-a review article [^112cJX2J]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH)

DAH is a clinicopathologic syndrome consisting in diffuse bleeding into alveolar spaces due to an injury to the alveolar capillaries (pulmonary capillaritis).

DAH can appear at any age, without sex predilection and can be secondary to a wide variety of conditions such as systemic vasculitis, connective tissue diseases, infections, coagulation disorders, drug toxicities, or hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (SCT).

Clinical course is unpredictable and variable in severity, ranging from complete resolution to life-threatening progressive forms.

The classical clinical sign of DAH, hemoptysis, is absent in one third of cases. Other common clinical features are nonspecific such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and chest pain.

Imaging features are equally nonspecific and can mimic any other acute disease that causes diffuse alveolar filling. Diagnosis often requires BAL, which shows a persistent or increasingly bloodier return from lavage.

In the early acute phase, chest imaging can be normal in 20–50% of cases; when present, common findings are patchy ground-glass, centrilobular opacities without inter-lobular septal thickening, with a prevalent middle/lower lung zones distribution or batwing appearance (Fig. 7). In the subacute phase, interlobular and intralobular septal thickening may develop leading to a crazy-paving pattern.

Fig. 7
a – b Axial HRCT images of two different patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage show bilateral, diffuse hazy ground-glass (a – b) and centrilobular opacities (black circle in a) with subtle sub-pleural sparing and a prevalent middle/lower lung zones distribution or "batwing" appearance

CT abnormalities resolve in about 2 weeks. In case of recurrent episodes of DAH, fibrotic abnormalities might progressively develop, with architectural distortion and volume loss, coexisting with residual speared lung areas.

### Pulmonary hemorrhagic syndromes [^116A2YXm]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The alveolar hemorrhagic syndromes are rare and may be difficult to diagnose because the presentation may be subtle. Extrapulmonary and airway causes of bleeding should be excluded. A specific diagnosis should be aggressively pursued because there may be specific treatments for some entities. Severe acute DAH carries a bad prognosis.

### Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage: clues to the diagnosis [^112JfskE]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage (DPH) refers to an uncommon but significant condition of bleeding into the alveolar space. Anemia and hemoptysis are important clinical features, but they may be absent. Although the radiographic and computed tomography findings are often varied and nonspecific, the imaging manifestations of pulmonary hemorrhage and the associated findings in the thorax often provide important diagnostic information that may lead to a specific diagnosis. DPH significantly influences patient management and has important prognostic implications. This review article explores the imaging findings in DPH and its differential diagnosis, highlighting important clues to this diagnosis and to its underlying etiology. DPH is an uncommon condition characterized by bleeding into the alveolar space that, when recognized on imaging, provides important diagnostic and prognostic information.

### Amiodarone-induced diffuse alveolar haemorrhage: a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of a commonly prescribed medication [^114pxAHM]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that is used commonly in clinical practice. It is associated with many side effects, the most common being pulmonary manifestations. Interstitial pneumonitis is one of the most common complications, however rarely amiodarone can cause diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) too. We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented with shortness of breath and haemoptysis 4 days after starting amiodarone. She was diagnosed with amiodarone-induced DAH based on imaging and bronchoalveolar lavage. She was treated with intravenous and then oral steroids, and amiodarone was discontinued. The patient made a significant clinical and radiological recovery. She was discharged 10 days after her presentation. This case highlights a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of a commonly used medication.

### -associated diffuse alveolar haemorrhage: an atypical presentation of a prevalent pathogen [^116f1nmh]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A transgender man in his late teens presented with signs of multisystem disease, including hepatitis, mucositis and bone marrow suppression. He later developed dyspnoea, leucocytosis and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia. After several days of treatment, he developed hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to bronchoscopy-confirmed diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH). The differential diagnosis and workup were extensive, and he was ultimately treated with intravenous steroids and five sessions of plasmapheresis for a presumed autoimmune aetiology. Investigations were remarkable only for elevated IgM and IgG to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). This case represents a rare presentation of multisystem disease secondary to MP in adults. Clinicians should consider Mycoplasma infection in cases of multisystem disease and observe for DAH even after initiation of appropriate therapy.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage due to bupropion inhalation [^116raDj6]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a form of hemoptysis caused by disruption of the alveolar-capillary basement membrane causing alveolar bleeding. Inhalation of cocaine and other sympathomimetic agents are described as one of many pathologic causes. We describe what is to the author's knowledge the first reported case of DAH caused by inhalation of bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, which was successfully treated with systemic steroids. This case adds a novel agent to the known pathologic causes of DAH and introduces a novel form of bupropion toxicity, which should be considered as a cause in cases of DAH in the appropriate clinical context. The case also highlights the potential for further research into the pathologic interactions of bupropion at the alveolar basement membrane.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage as a manifestation of childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^112Ea7BD]. Hospital Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a devastating clinical syndrome characterized by a falling hematocrit, respiratory insufficiency, and radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. Literature regarding management of DAH in childhood-onset SLE (cSLE) is limited.

Methods

We reviewed the presentation, management, and outcome of DAH in a pediatric tertiary medical center with one of the largest cSLE cohorts in North America. During a 10 year period 7 of 410 children with cSLE had DAH.

Results

The majority of cSLE patients with DAH were male (71%) and Hispanic (57%). The median age at the time of DAH diagnosis was 14 years (range 3–15 years). DAH was the presenting manifestation of cSLE in 29% of children; 71% presented with DAH within 3 months of their diagnosis. All patients had cough, 86% had dyspnea, and 29% had hemoptysis. All patients had anemia and 71% had thrombocytopenia. Eighty-six percent had hematuria/proteinuria, and a positive anti-double stranded DNA antibody. Chest imaging showed diffuse ground glass opacities in all events. All patients developed respiratory insufficiency (29% supplemental oxygenation and 71% mechanical ventilation). Transfusions were required in 57% of cases. All patients received corticosteroids and additional immunomodulation to achieve disease control. Eighty-six percent of our DAH/cSLE cohort survived their initial event (median follow-up 2.5 years). No survivor required supplemental oxygen or had a DAH recurrence.

Conclusions

SLE should be in the hospitalist's differential diagnosis for any child with respiratory insufficiency, cytopenias, and/or urinary abnormalities. Once cSLE is identified, initiation of aggressive immune suppression with multiple agents may enhance outcomes.

### Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis: a state of the art review [^111CEruT]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is an uncommon cause of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Patients with IPH usually present with hemoptysis, and the diagnosis is often delayed by years. Patients often present with intermittent episodes of hemoptysis interspersed between periods of relative normalcy. However, massive hemorrhage resulting in acute respiratory failure and non-remitting hemoptysis have also been described. The classic triad includes hemoptysis, radiologic lung infiltrate, and iron deficiency anemia. Several hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of IPH have been proposed. These risk factors include an autoimmune, allergic or genetic predisposition, and possible environmental exposure. Since IPH appears to be responsive to corticosteroids, the autoimmune hypothesis is considered to play a crucial role. A diagnosis of IPH requires exclusion of other etiologies of DAH, including infection, medications, toxic inhalation, vasculitis, and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, among others. Histologically, IPH is characterized by the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages in the alveolar space without any evidence of vasculitis or immunocomplex deposition. Corticosteroid therapy represents the primary modality of treatment. Other immunosuppressive medications have also been used with varying success, especially in the setting of steroid-refractory disease. The prognosis of IPH in adults is somewhat better compared to the pediatric population. The severity of the initial presentation does not predict future outcomes. Which risk factors and patient characteristics are associated with a poor outcome are also unknown. More research is necessary to elucidate the pathophysiology and appropriate treatment.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^112Duc4S]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) in AAV — risk profile and plasma exchange considerations are summarized as follows: DAH occurs in 25% of patients with AAV and involvement of > 50% of lung area at presentation is an independent predictor of mortality; the standard of care is aggressive treatment with glucocorticoids plus either cyclophosphamide or rituximab; the PEXIVAS trial did not demonstrate any observed effect of plasma exchange on the primary composite outcome in patients with alveolar hemorrhage, and a recent guideline update recommended against plasma exchange in DAH without kidney involvement due to increased infection risk and no mortality benefit, yet plasma exchange should be considered as part of induction therapy until a dedicated DAH trial is conducted, with the American Society of Apheresis recommending its addition.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage with suspected idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and decrease in lung diffusing capacity and chronic respiratory failure [^112yyAf7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The patient was diagnosed with DAH, and a differential diagnosis was made for diseases that cause DAH. There was no physical finding of collagen diseases or vasculitis, such as arthralgia, peripheral neuropathy, rash, muscle pain or abdominal pain. Laboratory findings did not reveal significant detection of haematuria, proteinuria, renal dysfunction or autoantibodies (table 2). Based on physical and laboratory findings, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis, immunoglobulin A vasculitis, Goodpasture syndrome (anti-glomerular basement membrane disease) and collagen diseases were negative. Bleeding time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and platelet counts were normal. No organ other than the lung had any bleeding; thus, blood disease-associated bleeding was also negative. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest did not reveal pulmonary infarction or pulmonary embolism. Cardiac ultrasound excluded heart diseases such as mitral valve stenosis. Cardiac catheterisation did not present any finding indicative of pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. The mean pulmonary artery pressure was 19 mm Hg, whereas the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 13 mm Hg. There was no history of bone marrow transplantation, lung transplantation, radiation therapy or medication that could cause DAH. Infections such as leptospirosis and infective endocarditis, which could cause DAH, were excluded from the medical history of conditions that were recurring in the past 6 years. Bacteria and fungi were not detected in blood culture. Only indigenous bacteria were isolated in the BALF culture. Given that the patient's symptom improved without the administration of anti-infective drugs, infection was excluded. IPH is diagnosed when three main symptoms (anaemia, hemoptysis and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates) are found and when other diseases that can cause DAH are excluded. Our patient experienced hemoptysis with iron-deficiency anaemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates intermittently in the past 6 years and was hospitalised. As all diseases that cause DAH other than IPH were negative, the patient was suspected of IPH.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage with suspected idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and decrease in lung diffusing capacity and chronic respiratory failure [^117XEkqW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

IPH refers to recurring alveolar haemorrhage where hemosiderin deposition in the lungs is confirmed; however, its aetiology is unknown. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents are reportedly effective in treating IPH, and recurrent alveolar haemorrhage and structural destruction of pulmonary alveoli are likely caused by immunological abnormalities. A recent study reported that the pathogenesis of IPH most probably involves an immunologic mechanism with a genetic predisposition.

To diagnose IPH, other diseases that cause DAH must be excluded. Although no pathological finding of the lungs leads to an IPH diagnosis, lung biopsy is essential for excluding other diseases. However, even if IPH is diagnosed by a lung biopsy, a future diagnosis of vasculitis is possible. Thus, continuous vigilant observation is necessary for all cases. Our patient presented with severe respiratory failure at the time of admission, and lung biopsy could not be performed at that time. Although lung biopsy was possible after treatment, his symptoms had improved, and since the risk of biopsy was higher than the benefit, treatment continued without a lung biopsy. Since we were unable to perform a lung biopsy, we could not make a definitive diagnosis of IPH; however, vasculitis was clinically unlikely and IPH was strongly suspected.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage secondary toin a vaping patient [^115byJ8G]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is known to occur from several infectious and non-infectious aetiologies. Among the infectious aetiologies, Haemophilus influenzae, an organism known to cause community-acquired pneumonia, has not been reported in association with DAH prior to this case. On the other hand, vaping, an evolving epidemic concern, has been linked to various types of lung injury, including DAH. However, DAH related to vaping is only limited to several case reports. Our case describes H. influenzae pneumonia with DAH in a patient known to have vaped until the night prior to elective lobectomy for lung cancer and developed DAH within 24 hours of hospitalisation. He subsequently recovered with treatment. DAH requires immediate recognition, and healthcare providers need to be aware that neither haemoptysis nor decrease in haemoglobin level is necessarily associated. Prior to diagnosis, empirical treatment with intravenous steroids and antibiotics can be life-saving.

### Vaping and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: all EVALI is not created equal [^1155LNNw]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

E-cigarette, or vaping product, use associated lung injury (EVALI) refers to respiratory illness in patients with recent vaping and no signs of infection or underlying illness. EVALI can cause severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. A spectrum of diagnoses can fit the description of EVALI since it relies heavily on nonspecific, radiographic findings. We present a rare case of EVALI in which a patient with a history of vaping presented with acute hypoxemia and was diagnosed with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The mechanism of injury of DAH due to vaping is unknown, and further research into the topic is required.

### Severe diffuse alveolar hemorrhage related to autoimmune disease: a multicenter study [^114G9vvd]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, DAH related to autoimmune disease is a rare but potentially dreadful complication that requires mechanical ventilation in half of the cases admitted to ICU. Age, small-vessel vasculitis, and the time from dyspnea onset to ICU admission were associated with a longer mechanical ventilation duration. The best initial regimen remains to be determined.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in children [^111GnWsg]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a frequent life-threatening complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in adults. This noninfectious pulmonary disorder is rarely reported following BMT in neonates and children.

Study Objectives

To review the clinical features and course of children who underwent allogeneic BMT and developed DAH in the posttransplant period.

Design

A retrospective 6-year chart review.

Setting

Pediatric ICU in a university hospital.

Patients and Interventions

At total of 138 children who had undergone allogeneic BMT for nonmalignant (n = 66) or malignant (n = 72) diseases.

Measurements and Results

Six of 138 children (4.3%) aged 2 months to 10 years (male/female ratio, 1:1) developed DAH. Each had a fulminant course with rapidly developing severe respiratory failure, mandating mechanical ventilation within 24 h following symptom onset. They were all treated with methylprednisolone, 6 mg/kg/d for 3 days. Only one child survived, and there have been no sequelae at 2 years post-BMT. Four children died of respiratory causes, and one died of multiorgan failure.

Conclusions

DAH is a potentially fatal respiratory complication that should be included early in the differential diagnosis of acute respiratory failure in children following allogenic BMT for both malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Therapy with high doses of steroids apparently do not affect the course of the disease.

### Pediatric hemoptysis with pulmonary hemorrhage and respiratory failure [^117Y5Suj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Hemoptysis is a rare complaint in the pediatric population. It is most commonly of infectious etiology and is rarely life threatening. However, there are rare life-threatening causes of pediatric hemoptysis, which should be included in the differential diagnoses of children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with this complaint. This study aims to present a case of pediatric hemoptysis, briefly discuss the differential diagnosis, and present a review of the causes, manifestations, and treatment for hemoptysis secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).

### Two immunocompromised patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage as a complication of severe coronavirus disease 2019 [^113FDjBV]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a severe and potentially life-threatening disease manifestation. In addition to autoimmune diseases such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis and anti-glomerular basement membrane syndrome, pulmonary viral infections are known to be culprits of DAH. Health-care providers worldwide in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic have been confronted with an unprecedented number of viral lung infections, with great variance in symptoms and severity. Hemoptysis, the key symptom of DAH, is a rare complication. We present two cases of immunocompromised patients with rapidly developing hypoxemic respiratory failure and evidence of DAH in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage induced by everolimus [^114iB1Li]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary toxicity is a known complication of the proliferation signal inhibitor (PSI) sirolimus and consists of diverse entities such as interstitial pneumonitis, lymphocytic alveolitis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Several cases of interstitial pneumonitis have also been reported with the more recently developed PSI everolimus. In this report, a case of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage attributed to everolimus is described. The patient presented with respiratory symptoms of insidious onset, ultimately resulting in severe respiratory failure characterized by high lactate dehydrogenase levels, patchy ground-glass infiltrates, and bloody BAL fluid with predominance of iron-loaded macrophages and monocytes. Withdrawal of the offending drug and temporary association of high-dose steroids resulted in a rapid recovery. Given that prompt drug discontinuation is potentially life saving, PSI-induced pulmonary toxicity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with PSIs and presenting with respiratory symptoms or pulmonary lesions.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in our hospital. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Osaka Police Hospital (Osaka, Japan) and the medical records of patients admitted between October 2008 and July 2020 were reviewed. If a patient had been admitted due to DAH two or more times during this period, only the first admission was included in the analysis. In this study, DAH was defined by the following criteria: (1) Clinical and radiological presentation that was compatible with a diagnosis of DAH, and (2) BALF that was macroscopically bloody or cytologically contained hemosiderin-burden macrophages. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Hemorrhage of bronchial origin, (2) BALF findings incompatible with DAH, and (3) Lack of BALF cell-pattern data. All patients who met the inclusion criteria but not exclusion criteria were included in the analysis.

Data collection

Variables included demographic data, past medical history, use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs, clinical and biological findings on admission, and treatment regimens. We categorized DAH depending on the use of AT following the classification in a previous study; DAH-AT was defined as DAH that had occurred during AT and DAH-NAT as DAH that had occurred without AT. Then, as in the previous study, we classified DAH-AT depending on the presence of other causes of DAH; simple DAH-AT was defined as DAH-AT with no other causes, and complicated DAH-AT as DAH-AT with etiologies other than AT. Infection was confirmed when the specific microorganism was identified by culture or serological test. Considering serological findings, radiological findings and clinical courses, we clinically diagnosed immune-related disease, drug-induced pneumonitis, heart failure, and other diseases as causes of DAH. Idiopathic DAH was defined as no detection of etiological disease of DAH.

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was the occurrence of complications accompanied by discontinuation of AT.

### Respiratory infection induced episode of alveolar hemorrhage (RIIEAH) in the pediatric diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: a retrospective single-center study [^111jJgmA]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings demonstrated that various pathogens including bacteria, virus, even fungi could result in the RIIEAH. Of these pathogens, nonviral pathogens, especially Mp seemed to be more common. Of note, the majority of the pathogens found in this study were the common pathogens of community-acquired respiratory infection. In view of this, the strategies for RIIEAH prevention in pediatric DAH should focus more on the community-acquired infection. Still, several pathogens of the typical hospital-acquired respiratory infection were also found in this study, even resulted in death in 1 case. Therefore, hospital-acquired respiratory infection could not be ignored in RIIEAH prevention. Besides, there was one RIIEAH which was caused by the pueumocystis carinii. Pueumocystis carinii was an opportunistic pathogen and usually resulted in the pneumonia in the patients with immunodeficiency. The cases of pediatric DAH are at high risk of pueumocystis carinii pneumonia due to the immunosuppressive therapy.

In this study, the majority of RIIEAHs presented with prodromal symptoms and occurred at the early stage of respiratory infection. Further more, RIIEAHs seemed to be able to be screened out by the clinical manifestations or blood routine test, as hemoptysis or worsening anemia was relatively common in RIIEAHs in this study. Whereas, differentiation between RIIEAH and pneumonia is challenging sometimes. To the cases which are difficult to make the differential diagnosis, bronchoscopy may help clarify the diagnosis. In this study, there was 1 RIIEAH without worsening anemia or hemoptysis. In this case, the diagnosis of RIIEAH was confirmed by bronchoscopy. Moreover, the recent literature from Villeneuve T et al. had showed that bronchoscopy was an informative procedure at the onset of AAV disease in patients with respiratory manifestations, in which BAL could be used to confirm DAH. Besides, the RIIEAHs in which bronchosopy had been performed all presented with bleeding on bronchoscopy in this study. Consequently, bronchoscopy had good diagnostic value in the diagnosis of RIIEAH.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage with suspected idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and decrease in lung diffusing capacity and chronic respiratory failure [^111nGzv2]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disease of unknown aetiology that causes recurrent episodes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH). A male patient in his 50s had repeatedly experienced hemoptysis for the past 6 years, along with a decrease in the pulmonary diffusing capacity and chronic respiratory failure. After a 6-year follow-up, the patient experienced sudden exacerbation of hemoptysis and respiratory failure, and he was hospitalised. A CT of the chest revealed diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, whereas the bronchoalveolar lavage revealed hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with DAH. As all diseases that cause DAH other than IPH were negative, the patient was suspected of IPH. He was treated with a combination of glucocorticoids and azathioprine, and his hemoptysis and chronic respiratory failure improved; however, the decrease in the pulmonary diffusing capacity did not improve. Treating adult-onset IPH with glucocorticoids and azathioprine might not improve pulmonary diffusing capacity.

### Open lung biopsy in early-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112DA4zt]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

The clinical definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) includes the acute onset of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) of 200 mmHg or less, and no evidence of left atrial hypertension. Many risk factors, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and aspiration, are associated with the development of ARDS. However, other diseases and conditions, such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), adverse reaction to drugs, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), can also cause ARDS; despite similar clinical presentations, etiological diagnosis can be difficult especially for early-stage ARDS. Although the mortality rate of patients with ARDS improves recently, the rapid clinical deterioration of such patients, who often progress to multiple organ failure, remains a significant challenge for intensivists in the intensive care unit (ICU). To halt the disease progression of early-stage ARDS, accurate diagnosis is critical.

It can be difficult to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious etiology as the cause of ARDS in its early stages. Current microbiological sampling techniques are insufficiently sensitive to determine the causes of ARDS in all patients. In patients with negative microbiological cultures, separating a true infection from an inflammatory response with clinical data remains problematic. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are typically prescribed to these critically ill patients immediately after admission. However, unnecessary antibiotic therapy for non-infectious patients can enhance the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and increase the potential for subsequent nosocomial infections.

The therapeutic benefit of prolonged glucocorticoid therapy during the fibroproliferative stage of ARDS emphasizes the need for the elucidation of the underlying lung pathologies. Additionally, the specific diseases such as BOOP, drug reaction, DAH and HP can cause an ARDS response to steroid therapy. However, inappropriate steroid therapy for patients with ARDS may be associated with complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperglycemia and increased susceptibility to infection.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^113QSdZR]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Wrong diagnosis

In one study conducted in the ICU, 19% of patients admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia were ultimately diagnosed with non-infectious conditions. There are several non-infectious conditions that can mimic nonresponding or worsening severe pneumonia such as heart failure, neoplasms, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, acute interstitial pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, vasculitis, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (Fig. 2). Another frequently overlooked diagnosis is drug induced fever. The list of antibiotics associated with drug induced fever is long and this diagnosis should be suspected particularly in the presence of eosinophilia. Diagnostic uncertainty is highest when non-pulmonary conditions overlap with pulmonary inflammation.

### A review of clinical and imaging features of diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage [^112pKXYx]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to review the clinical and imaging features of diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. CONCLUSION. Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage is a life-threatening syndrome associated with a wide variety of underlying pathologic categories. Nonspecific clinical and imaging features pose challenges to promptly diagnosing this condition. Chest radiography commonly shows alveolar opacification, and CT reveals the extent of disease. Integration of clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and pathologic findings facilitates timely diagnosis and etiologic identification.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage — Clinical features include hemoptysis (two-thirds of patients), anemia, and diffuse opacity at imaging. Relevant factors include injury to alveolar-capillary microcirculation (eg, microscopic polyangiitis), circulating autoantibody (eg, ANCA), and coagulation disorders. Pathology shows intra-alveolar hemorrhage with hemosiderin-laden macrophages in alveolar spaces and interstitium and occasional focal or diffuse areas of capillaritis. Radiology typically shows bilateral patchy opacities in middle and lower lung zones on chest radiographs and diffuse or geographic ground-glass opacities/consolidation at CT scan.

### Etiologies, diagnostic strategies, and outcomes of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates causing acute respiratory failure in cancer patients: a retrospective observational study [^111Ks9sU]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Definitions

Diagnoses were based on clinical, radiologic, microbiologic, and histopathologic findings and were thoroughly reviewed by two of the authors (HY and KJ). Differences in observed findings were resolved by consensus. All diagnoses were classified as definite, probable, or non-diagnostic as follows. Definite diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was defined as the pathogen being identified in BAL fluid in an amount > 10⁴ CFU/mL or the same pathogen being isolated from respiratory specimens and blood cultures. Probable diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was defined as improvement of the patient's clinical conditions after antibiotic treatment even though the pathogen was not isolated from a respiratory specimen. Definite viral pneumonia was defined as observation of the cytopathologic effect of a virus in histopathology. Probable viral pneumonia was defined as recovery of a virus in BAL fluid or nasopharyngeal specimens from a patient with clinical features consistent with viral pneumonia. However, a positive CMV PCR test or antigenemia was not sufficient for diagnosis of CMV pneumonia. Pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed according to recently developed criteria for invasive fungal disease. The diagnosis of P. jiroveci pneumonia was made by identification of P. jiroveci from a clinically relevant specimen of sputum, BAL fluid or lung tissue. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was diagnosed when echocardiography and biomarkers showed cardiac dysfunction in patients with a compatible clinical picture. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) associated with an underlying malignancy was diagnosed using previously reported criteria. However, alveolar hemorrhage was considered to be a manifestation of lung disease but not a cause of ARF, except in patients with no BAL evidence of infection and no evidence of congestive heart failure. Drug-induced pneumonitis was defined as combination of the presence of a compatible clinical pattern, drug that is a known or suspected offender, and the exclusion of infection or pulmonary involvement from the underlying malignancy. As this study included only patients with malignancies, other definitions associated with cancer status were defined by previously reported definitions. Patients experiencing a relapse in their malignancies following intensive front-line chemotherapy or who failed to respond to initial chemotherapy were considered to be in a relapsed/refractory status. The extensiveness of malignancy was classified according to the extent of the tumor and major organ involvement, as reported previously. Disease extent was evaluated as extensive disease and/or major organ involvement. Extensive disease was defined as stage III or IV for lymphoma; metastatic or locally extensive disease for solid malignancies; and > 80% blasts in bone marrow, > 25,000 blasts/μL in peripheral blood, or the need for leukapheresis for hematological malignancies. Major organ involvement was defined as a pathologically confirmed or radiologically suspected invasion of the brain, heart, lung, liver, or kidney. Neutropenia was defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.5×10³/μL. Therapeutic modification was defined as the addition, change of class, or withdrawal of antimicrobial agents, chemotherapy, or steroids according to identification of an etiology or exclusion of a presumptive diagnosis.

### Propylthiouracil-related diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with negative serologies and without capillaritis [^111HGe4S]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Propylthiouracil (PTU) has been held responsible for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) with positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and capillaritis. We describe a case of a 23-year-old pregnant female with Grave's disease treated with PTU who presented with flu-like symptoms and progressive dyspnea. Open lung biopsy showed DAH without evidence of capillaritis. All serologies were negative. Five days after PTU withdrawal and intravenous steroid therapy, the patient improved dramatically. She remained symptom free without relapse 9 months after the episode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of PTU-related alveolar hemorrhage with negative serologic markers and without capillaritis.

### Pulmonary manifestations of acute lung injury: more than just diffuse alveolar damage [^117CVQGb]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Context

- Acute pulmonary injury may occur as a result of myriad direct or indirect pulmonary insults, often resulting in hypoxemic respiratory failure and clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome. Histologically, most patients will exhibit diffuse alveolar damage on biopsy, but other histologic patterns may be encountered, such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia, acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with capillaritis.

Objective

- To review the diagnostic features of various histologic patterns associated with a clinical picture of acute lung injury, and to discuss key features in the differential diagnosis.

Data Sources

- The review is drawn from pertinent peer-reviewed literature and the personal experience of the authors.

Conclusions

- Acute pulmonary injury is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In addition to diffuse alveolar damage, pathologists should be aware of alternate histologic patterns of lung disease that may present with a similar clinical presentation because this may impact treatment decisions and disease outcome.

### Respiratory infection induced episode of alveolar hemorrhage (RIIEAH) in the pediatric diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: a retrospective single-center study [^1149F9Z4]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a severe life-threatening clinical syndrome in children and can be caused by a wide variety of disorders. It is considered as a chronic disease with a relapsing course. Recurrent episode of alveolar hemorrhage can result in pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and restrictive lung function. What's more, severe episode of alveolar hemorrhage is the common cause of death in DAH. Therefore, preventing and managing of the episode of alveolar hemorrhage is crucial to improve the prognosis of pediatric DAH. Respiratory infections are recognized as common triggers of alveolar hemorrhage episodes in pediatric DAH. However, only the individual cases reports have been published and comprehensive studies investigating this association in detail remain limited. This might be mainly due to the rarity of the diseases and the limitations of the conventional detection techniques for the pathogens. In view of this, we conducted this study with the aim to explore the etiological spectrum, clinical features, treatment strategies and outcomes of the respiratory infection induced episode of alveolar hemorrhage (RIIEAH) in the pediatric DAH.

### Isolated pauciimmune pulmonary capillaritis successfully treated with rituximab [^116qNmsi]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a syndrome caused by different mechanisms, including capillary stress failure, diffuse alveolar damage, and capillaritis. Capillaritis is the most common cause and is often associated with systemic autoimmune disorders, most commonly antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. The occurrence of DAH with underlying pulmonary capillaritis but without clinical or serologic findings of an associated underlying systemic disorder is known as isolated pauciimmune pulmonary capillaritis (IPPC), and only eight cases have been described in the literature. The mainstay of treatment of this rare condition has been cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids. When cases are unresponsive to cyclophosphamide, there is no known alternative treatment. Herein, we describe a case of IPPC that failed cyclophosphamide treatment with recurrent DAH. Rituximab therapy was then initiated with no further evidence of recurrence. This case report suggests that rituximab could be considered an alternative therapy to induce remission in patients with IPPC.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in children with interstitial lung disease: determine etiologies! [^113A4ML1]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) in children is a rare condition resulting from different underlying diseases. This study aimed at describing characteristics and diagnostic measures in children with ILD (children's interstitial lung disease, chILD) and DAH to improve the diagnostic approach by increasing clinician's awareness of diagnostic shortcomings.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective data analysis of patients with ILD and DAH treated in our own or collaborating centers between 01/07/1997 and 31/12/2020 was performed. Data on clinical courses and diagnostic measures were systematically retrieved as case-vignettes and investigated. To assess suitability of diagnostic software-algorithms, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) was revised and expanded to optimize conditions of its associated tool the "Phenomizer".

Results

For 97 (74%) of 131 patients, etiology of pulmonary hemorrhage was clarified. For 34 patients (26%), no underlying condition was found (termed as idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage, IPH). Based on laboratory findings or clinical phenotype/comorbidities, 20 of these patients were assigned to descriptive clusters: IPH associated with autoimmune features (9), eosinophilia (5), renal disease (3) or multiorgan involvement (3). For 14 patients, no further differentiation was possible.

Conclusion

Complete and sometimes repeated diagnostics are essential for establishing the correct diagnosis in children with DAH. We suggest assignment of patients with IPH to descriptive clusters, which may also guide further research. Digital tools such as the Phenomizer/HPO are promising, but need to be extended to increase diagnostic accuracy.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is uncommon in pediatric patients and is a rare presenting sign of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). We present the case a 14-year-old girl who presented with respiratory failure secondary to DAH as the initial presenting sign of GPA. Her clinical course improved after initiation of plasmapheresis therapy and she is now in clinical remission.

### Rare cause of respiratory failure in a young woman: isolated diffuse alveolar haemorrhage requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^115GuL5h]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy 21-year-old young woman presented with worsening dyspnoea and haemoptysis. Imaging was suggestive of widespread pulmonary haemorrhage. There was no other organ system involvement in particular no evidence of renal involvement. Raised antimyeloperoxidase titres allowed diagnosis of isolated diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) secondary to microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). The patient rapidly deteriorated with worsening respiratory failure despite invasive mechanical ventilation and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This maintained the patient long enough to allow aggressive therapy in the form of immunosuppression and plasma exchange. She made a remarkable recovery and is asymptomatic 2 years on. Isolated DAH in the absence of renal disease is an atypical presentation of MPA and can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. A literature review reveals increasing reports of successful use of ECMO in severe DAH due to pulmonary vasculitis. Despite this, the need for systemic anticoagulation in the presence of pre-existing haemorrhage remains a challenging dilemma.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in children with trisomy 21 [^112tNt93]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Trisomy 21 (T21; or Down Syndrome) results from complete or partial duplication of chromosome 21. T21 affects 1 in 700 births and is characterized by developmental disability and dysmorphic features. Children with T21 are hospitalized five times more often, with respiratory conditions the leading cause of hospitalization and mortality. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a life-threatening cause of respiratory compromise that occurs at increased frequency in children with T21.

DAH occurs when blood enters the alveolar spaces due to a disturbance of the alveolar-capillary basement membrane and can result in respiratory failure and death. The diagnosis may be delayed or missed in children, as many do not expectorate blood and have non-specific findings on imaging. In one study, two-thirds of children with DAH were initially misdiagnosed, most often with pneumonia. Definitive diagnosis is made via bloody fluid return, microscopic red blood cells, or hemosiderin-laden macrophages on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or alveolar hemorrhage or hemosiderin on lung histology. Treatment decisions such as glucocorticoids, antimicrobials, and/or vasoactive medications often precede diagnosis and may be counterproductive.

A 2018 study utilizing the French RespiRare Network found that nine of 34 pediatric patients with DAH of unknown etiology (i.e. idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis) from 1997 to 2017 also had T21, estimating a 75-fold higher prevalence in children with T21. Children with T21 had earlier onset, more severe respiratory distress, less hemoptysis, and increased morbidity and mortality. The reasons for this are neither well understood nor widely studied.

Here, we report five DAH cases in children with T21 at one center and a review of the literature. We aim to increase awareness of this life-threatening condition, highlight how it presents in this population, and identify opportunities to improve outcomes.

Figure 1
Study sample flowchart. Patient selection and reasons for exclusion.

Table 1
Patient demographics and diagnostic methods.

Table 2 details the primary etiology identified for DAH in our subjects. Bleeding diathesis (anticoagulation, thrombocytopenia, or coagulopathy) was present in 35 (49%) patients, all of whom had at least one additional contributing diagnosis. None of the patients with autoimmune disease leading to their DAH (seven with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA]‐associated vasculitis and one with mixed connective tissue disease) had a prior history of autoimmune disease, indicating that DAH was a part of their initial presentation of autoimmunity. The two patients with AIPH and four patients with IPH had negative rheumatologic and infectious evaluations; all four patients with IPH had lung biopsies without evidence of capillaritis or autoimmune disease, though all were prescribed systemic steroids before and at the time of the biopsy which could have masked capillaritis. One of the seven patients with sepsis as the primary etiology of their DAH was known to be immunocompromised. Patients with infections leading to DAH were more likely than those with another etiology to have a history of cerebral palsy or other major neurodevelopmental impairment (38% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.004). The group labeled "other" included a patient with acute aspiration pneumonitis, a patient with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a patient with vaping‐associated lung injury, three critically ill patients who died before a final diagnosis could be made, one critically ill complex patient in whom no single etiology was clearly the primary trigger of DAH, and one patient whose initial clinical presentation and pathology were consistent with IPH but who had resolution of the DAH without immunosuppressive treatment.

Table 2
Comparison of patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and disease severity outcomes by primary etiology.

Half of the 20 patients with cardiovascular disease had either cardiac surgery or a cardiac catheterization intervening on the pulmonary vasculature in the weeks preceding the DAH. Of the remaining 10 patients with cardiovascular disease, six had severe pulmonary hypertension, three had critical congenital heart disease, and one had acute mitral regurgitation due to bacterial endocarditis.

The age at which patients presented with DAH varied by the underlying diagnosis (p < .001, Figure 2). Patients with autoimmune disease were significantly older than those with IPH/AIPH, with no overlap in the age ranges (p < .001). All seven (10%) patients in this study who had DAH during their birth hospitalization had underlying cardiovascular disease.

### Emphysema: an ignored radiologic sign of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^111iys1R]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by hemoptysis, iron deficiency anemia, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the clinic. A variety of etiologies, including immune and nonimmune disorders, can cause DAH. Hemorrhage originates in the pulmonary microvasculature and is pathologically characterized by intra-alveolar accumulation of hemosiderin-laden macrophages. On chest computed tomography (CT), it usually presents as diffuse ground glass opacities and / or consolidation bilaterally. Recently, Stainer A et al. reported the development of emphysema in three cases with DAH, which has received little attention in patients with DAH. Whereas, the incidence, imaging subtypes, and clinical impact of emphysema on a background of DAH are still unclear. Here, we performed a retrospective study to analyze emphysema in children with DAH and explored the clinical features and risk factors for diffuse emphysema.

Emphysema is defined as abnormal airspace enlargement distal to the terminal bronchioles and accompanied by destruction of the alveolar walls. It is being increasingly recognized in other interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and ILD related to rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis and ANCA-associated vasculitis). In this study, chest CT scans revealed emphysema in 29.8% of the cases with DAH, which demonstrated that emphysema was not uncommon in the children with DAH. In addition, we noticed that there were five cases who developed emphysema within a short period of time (≤ 3 months) in this study, unlike the cases reported by Stainer A et al. in which all three cases developed emphysema many years after onset. This demonstrated that destruction of the alveolar walls can develop in the early course of DAH.

Introduction

Pulmonary complications occur frequently in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a serious pulmonary complication with a high mortality rate after HCT. The incidence of DAH varies between 3% and 10% after allogeneic HCT.

The clinical symptoms of DAH include cough, hypoxemia, fever, and rarely hemoptysis. Chest radiography shows non-specific bilateral areas of ground-glass attenuation and patchy areas of consolidation. Bronchoalveolar lavage findings are characteristic for the diagnosis of DAH with progressively bloodier lavage returns. The etiology of DAH remains unknown, but lung tissue injury, inflammation and cytokine release have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of DAH. Some may require that no microorganism is isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; however, DAH syndromes after allogeneic HCT have been shown to have similar clinical characteristics and presentation with or without an associated infection.

The reported outcomes of patients with DAH after allogeneic HCT have been dismal. Generally, patients with DAH require intensive care unit support and often mechanical ventilation because of severe hypoxemia. The mortality rate can reach 70–100% in patients with DAH because of multiorgan failure and/or sepsis.–

Recent changes in allogeneic HCT and supportive care practices include: (i) more frequent use of alternative donor allografts [e.g. umbilical cord blood (UCB) and haploidentical donors]; (ii) use of reduced intensity conditioning for older patients or those with comorbidities; (iii) advances in the use of antibiotics targeting fungal and viral infection; and (iv) improvements in intensive care unit support. We therefore evaluated the impact of these changes on the contemporary incidence, risks, and outcomes of DAH after allogeneic HCT.

2 PULMONARY (ALVEOLAR) HEMORRHAGIC SYNDROMES

These are rare, with an estimated prevalence of 0.24–1.23 cases/million children/year in National studies. The presentation in childhood may be subtle. Hemoptysis may not be a feature and presentation may be nonspecific, including breathlessness, fatigue and iron deficiency anemia. Indeed, many children undergo unnecessary invasive investigations for gastroenterological causes of anemia before the lungs are identified as the cause. Occasionally, presentation may be dramatic and acute. Physical signs may include digital clubbing, pallor, tachypnoea and respiratory distress, and signs of extrapulmonary involvement. Imaging (chest X‐ray (CXR), computed tomography (CT)) shows diffuse infiltrates but is nonspecific. Confirmation that pulmonary bleeding has occurred is by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), demonstrating hemosiderin laden macrophages, but this does not allow a specific diagnosis to be made. Serological investigations will include platelet count and coagulation studies, an autoantibody screen, celiac screen to exclude Lane‐Hamilton syndrome and an echocardiogram to exclude cardiac causes. The question of lung biopsy is debated. A biopsy may allow the diagnosis of neutrophilic pulmonary capillaritis, but there is often poor agreement on this diagnosis even between specialist pediatric pathologists. A biopsy may suggest a specific diagnosis (below).

Broadly, the causes of alveolar hemorrhagic syndromes can be considered as Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH, a diagnosis of exclusion); isolated pulmonary vasculitis; pulmonary vasculitis as part of a systemic disease; and other systemic causes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Heiner's syndrome (IgD milk antibodies, now nowhere measured) is vanishingly rare, if indeed it exists. There are no randomized controlled trials of treatment; IPH is generally treated with systemic corticosteroids, often intravenous pulsed methyl prednisolone, sometimes with additional azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. For refractory cases, other immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, azathioprine and rituximab have been prescribed on an anecdotal basis. Pulmonary vasculitis is treated with more intensive induction regimes, including combined pulses of methyl prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and immunoglobulin, sometimes combined with plamapheresis, again based on anecdotal evidence.

5 CONCLUSIONS

DAH has a wide range of causes in children, which vary by age. The overall mortality of DAH is high, predominantly attributable to cardiovascular disease and stem cell transplant. Larger multicenter studies would be helpful to better elucidate risk factors for mortality in these populations. In our study, no patients with IPH/AIPH or autoimmune disease died during follow‐up. Though most patients with DAH are critically ill and require mechanical ventilatory support, patients who survived DAH did well, with few experiencing long‐term respiratory impairment or recurrent DAH.

Subjects and methods

Subjects

The children of DAH aged less than 16-year-old, who had RIIEAH and a definite etiological diagnosis were included. All the subjects had been hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from January 2023 to February 2024. The cases caused by the definite non-immune disorders such as congenital heart disease, coagulation disorders, acute respiratory distress syndrome, inhalation injury and those with incomplete data were excluded in this study.

Study design

A retrospective study was conducted. Clinical data were collected by reviewing the medical records including the etiology of DAH, age, gender, disease stage, disease severity, etiological diagnosis and prodromal symptoms, clinical features, treatment strategies and outcomes of RIIEAH.

Diagnostic criteria for DAH

DAH was diagnosed when the subjects fulfilled all the following conditions: (1) presence of respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, hemoptysis or cough) or anemia; (2) diffuse pulmonary infiltrates (ground-glass opacities or consolidations) on the chest CT; (3) presence of hemosiderin laden macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or lung tissue specimen.

Diagnostic criteria for episode of alveolar hemorrhage

Episode of alveolar hemorrhage was defined when the subjects fulfilled all the following conditions: (1) presence of hemoptysis or anemia or bleeding on bronchoscopy (bloody secretions or progressively hemorrhagic BALF); (2) an increase of the pulmonary infiltrates (ground-glass opacities or consolidations) on the chest CT; (3) exclusion of the bleeding caused by the other diseases or conditions rather than alveolar hemorrhage.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage with suspected idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and decrease in lung diffusing capacity and chronic respiratory failure [^1116PXAB]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

IPH is extremely rare. A Swedish retrospective study reported that annually, there are 0.24 incidences of IPH per 1 000 000 children aged ≤ 11 years. A Japanese retrospective study reported that annually, there are 1.23 incidences of IPH per 1 000 000 children aged ≤ 14 years. Generally, 80% of patients with IPH are childhood-onset, whereas 20% are adult-onset. Whereas the incidence is low in children, it is even lower in adults. Thus, a large-scale randomised controlled trial cannot be conducted on adult-onset IPH, and treatment must be determined based on case reports and case series. To prevent IPH recurrence, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents (eg, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide) are sometimes used together. Saeed et al administered glucocorticoids in 17 children and achieved a 5-year survival rate of 86% regardless of the use of immunosuppressive agents (hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine). A previous report had stated that the prognosis of IPH was about 2.5 years. These reports indicate that glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents are effective in treating IPH. The combined use of corticosteroids and azathioprine has been reported as the ideal method of preventing IPH exacerbation. In our case, when the prednisolone dose was gradually reduced from 15 mg to 12 mg, hemoptysis and respiratory failure recurred. Adding 100 mg of azathioprine improved hemoptysis and respiratory failure, and prednisolone could be reduced to 8 mg. However, the pulmonary diffusing capacity impairment did not improve as observed on pulmonary function tests. Thus, we discussed the cause of decrease in DLCO in the present case. Initially, we suspected that COPD or pulmonary hypertension caused severe decrease in DLCO. However, since restrictive ventilatory impairment was not confirmed and decrease in FEV₁ was limited, COPD was excluded. Moreover, we performed cardiac catheterisation, but pulmonary hypertension was not confirmed. Since COPD was excluded, we considered the possibility that the emphysematous changes in the CT of the chest was due to hemosiderin deposition through structural destruction of pulmonary alveoli. DAH can cause increase in DLCO, but we measured DLCO when DAH was not confirmed. As a result, we considered long-term and repetitive DAH caused by IPH, which led to emphysematous change and thereby a decrease in DLCO. However, smoking may be the possible cause of emphysema instead of COPD, which resulted in decreased values for DLCO only. Therefore, careful differential diagnosis is needed in the future. Some IPH reports have confirmed the impairment of restrictive ventilatory and pulmonary diffusing capacities on performing pulmonary function tests. Hemosiderin deposited in the interstitial space causes irreversible lung damage, which, in turn, is assumed to cause the impairment of restrictive ventilatory and pulmonary diffusing capacities. Our patient did not present with restrictive or obstructive ventilatory impairment, but presented with pulmonary diffusing capacity impairment and chronic respiratory failure. Generally, decreased pulmonary diffusing capacity does not cause respiratory failure; however, if extreme, it can lead to respiratory failure. In our case, irreversible lung damage developed long after DAH onset, and the patient's chronic respiratory failure may be attributed to a drastic decrease in pulmonary diffusing capacity. Although FVC %pred and TLC %pred significantly improved by the treatment, improvements in FEV₁ and DLCO %pred were limited, and pulmonary diffusing capacity impairment persisted. IPH treatment with glucocorticoids and azathioprine might be difficult for the improvement of the decreased pulmonary diffusing capacity caused by irreversibly advanced lung damage. Limited number of reports exists on pulmonary function tests on adult-onset IPH, and further investigations are necessary.

### Emphysema: an ignored radiologic sign of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^116fpF7U]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

DAH is a progressive pulmonary disorder characterized by alveolar space and interstitial involvement, frequently complicating with emphysema development and restrictive ventilatory impairment.

In this study, Histopathological confirmation was otained in three emphysema-associated DAH cases. Among the three cases that underwent lung biopsy, two cases had inflammatory cell infiltration in the alveolar septa. Of these, one case was definitively diagnosed with pulmonary capillaritis, and another one was diagnosed with suspected pulmonary capillaritis. However, the third case had no features of capillaritis or vasculitis, which supported the diagnosis of IPH. Additionally, the lung biopsy findings revealed no features of capillaritis or vasculitis in one case of the three cases having been reported by Stainer A et al. Thus, in addition to the inflammatory reaction within capillaries and/or small vessels, other mechanisms likely contribute to emphysema development in DAH.

Emphysema has been well described in IPF, a typical progressive fibrotic ILD in adults. This is a description of a proposed distinct entity named the combination of pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE). In IPF, a reduction in DLCO is related to a reduction in lung volume. When CPFE occurs, a marked reduction in DLCO, but with normal or near normal lung volumes, can be revealed by pulmonary function testing (PFT). However, it seems to be unavailable for DAH, as the reduction in DLCO in patients with DAH may be mainly due to alveolar hemorrhage rather than a reduction in lung volume. Air trapping, a characteristic of emphysema, is usually characterized by an increased RV/TLC ratio, which may help clinicians recognize the emphysema, especially in patients with diffuse emphysema. We further analyzed the PFT results of the cases with diffuse emphysema in this study. Only three cases had detectable lung volumes after developing diffuse emphysema, in which one case had an increased RV/TLC. In addition, four cases underwent spirometry after developing diffuse emphysema. Although none of them had obstructive ventilatory dysfunction, one case had small airway dysfunction, which might reflect the development of diffuse emphysema.

Methods

Diagnostic criteria for DAH

DAH was diagnosed as the presence of respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or hemoptysis), iron deficiency anemia, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest CT, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and / or lung tissue specimens.

Radiology methods

Emphysema severity was independently assessed by two board-certified thoracic radiologists using a six-lobe visual scoring system. Lobar extents of emphysema were summed and divided by 6 to obtain a lung percentage of emphysema. The low-density shadows, reduced CT values, thinning of peripheral blood vessels, as well as thickened and enlarged hilar vessels are evaluated. CT protocols standardized acquisition parameters: 100–120 kVp, 70–120 mA, helical pitch (1.0–1.5), and slice thickness (1.0–1.25 mm). Images were reconstructed using iterative algorithms and analyzed at lung window settings (window width:1500 WW; window level:-450 WL). For the purposes of this study, a patient was defined as having emphysema if they had any related features on a CT. To assess interobserver agreement, ninety-four subjects underwent blinded duplicate evaluations using semi-quantitative scoring criteria. This dual-reading protocol enabled quantification of measurement variability through comparative analysis of their respective emphysema extent classifications.

Study population and data collection

Children with DAH who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University between January 2013 and December 2019 were included in this study. Patients aged > 16 years on admission or without chest CT were excluded. All included chest CT scans underwent blinded, independent evaluation by two board-certified thoracic radiologists to:

Confirm emphysema presence using standardized diagnostic criteria.
Classify morphological subtypes (panlobular/centrilobular/paraseptal).

The demographic data, clinical information, laboratory test results and lung biopsy findings of the patients with emphysema were collected. The clinical features of the patients with diffuse emphysema were further analyzed. A matched case-control study with matching for the following factors was performed to explore the risk factors for the development of diffuse emphysema in patients with DAH: age, sex and the interval between onset and the last chest CT assessment.

Statistical analysis

All analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 22.0). Continuous variables are reported as medians. Qualitative variables were reported as percentages. The Mann‒Whitney test was used for continuous variables.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH)

DAH is a severe and potentially fatal condition. Clinical history is important in diagnosis of DAH and differentiation from COVID-19. The presence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, hemoptysis, collagen-vascular disease, pulmonary-renal syndromes (Wegener granulomatosis and Goodpasture syndrome) or recent bone marrow transplantation raises the possibility of DAH. On CT, DAH often shows diffuse, patchy or lobular GGO and consolidation with perihilar and dependent distribution. A "crazy-paving" pattern occurs resulting from associated interlobular septal thickening (Fig. 11). DAH usually resolves within 10 days to 2 weeks.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)

PAP is a rare lung disorder with three clinical forms: autoimmune, secondary and congenital. It is characterized by periodic acid Schiff stain positive material within the alveoli. CT shows areas of "crazy-paving" pattern that is more common in patients with autoimmune PAP than in secondary PAP (Fig. 12). Subpleural sparing, geographic distribution and lower lung predominance were also more frequent in autoimmune PAP. Air space disease with patchy areas of parenchymal abnormalities may also reproduce a COVID-19 appearance; however, perihilar distribution in PAP is a differentiating point. Pulmonary nodules, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy are not a feature of PAP but if present, then a superimposed infection should be considered. Clinically, PAP is different from COVID-19 as patients often present with low-grade fever, progressive exertional dyspnea and cough; however, patients may experience respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation, which is an unusual but recognized complication.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage associated with subsequent development of ANCA positivity and emphysema in three young adults [^115r9Wp5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is characterized by intra-alveolar accumulation of red blood cells, with diffuse ground glass opacities and/or consolidation on chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The clinical spectrum of DAH ranges from incidental findings on imaging and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in asymptomatic patients, to life-threatening acute respiratory failure. Histologically, DAH is characterized by the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages, fibrin deposition, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, organizing pneumonia and acute inflammation. When present, capillaritis is associated with neutrophilic interstitial infiltration and disruption of the alveolar wall, although these changes can be subtle and difficult to detect.

DAH etiology is wide, including immunological and non-immunological causes. Among immunological causes of DAH, systemic vasculitides are one of the most frequent, particularly ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV). If no known cause or association can be found, DAH is classified as idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH).

We describe three cases presenting with recurrent pulmonary haemorrhage, who develop anti myeloperoxidase antibodies (MPO) positivity and radiologically, cystic areas resembling emphysema many years after their first presentation.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, we present the largest case–control study of lupus DAH reported to date. There were similarities and differences between our findings and those in the work of others. For example, similar to previous studies, we found that dyspnoea was a more common presentation than haemoptysis. While active nephritis was often associated with DAH in our study (36% of patients), the percentage was somewhat lower than what has been described by others. In comparison to the other large case series from Asia and South America, we describe a US lupus population that is predominantly of European descent. This difference in ethnicity may have contributed to the lower percentage of nephritis. It should also be pointed out that kidney biopsies were typically only obtained if the clinician felt it would change clinical management. Given the degree of serological activity that was present in these patients (75% had decreased complement levels from baseline), it is reasonable to assume that several additional patients had early or subclinical nephritis that may have been effectively treated by the potent immunosuppression employed for DAH.

Also notable is that all 22 patients survived their first DAH episode; further, although 6 patients had recurrence, none resulted in death. In contrast, prior studies have shown acute mortality as high as 62%. Ours is a predominantly outpatient cohort, with the majority of patients recruited and enrolled during a visit to outpatient clinic. These patients were carefully followed and monitored, and it is possible that this attention resulted in earlier diagnosis as well as more aggressive treatment. It is also notable that the majority of our patients (14/22, 64%) were diagnosed after 2007; it is therefore conceivable that newer therapeutic agents such as mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab contributed to better outcomes and more durable induction of remission. Finally, it should again be pointed out that this is the first time a lupus population predominantly of European descent has been considered in a large DAH case series; as such, it is possible that this is a population predisposed to better outcomes.

Prodromal symptoms and clinical features of RIIEAHs

The majority of the RIIEAHs (n = 19) presented with prodromal symptoms and most of them (n = 15) occurred within 3 days from the prodromal symptoms. Prodromal symptoms included fever, cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and sore throat, in which cough was most common and found in 17 RIIEAHs (Table 1).

Thirteen RIIEAHs presented with worsening anemia which was defined as presence of anemia and a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) level by greater than 10.0 g/L. Of these RIIEAHs with worsening anemia, the median Hb level at the time of occurring RIIEAH was 103.2 (74.0, 108.7) g/L and the median decrease in Hb level was 23.0 (16.0, 37.0) g/L. Notably, the 2 RIIEAHs occurring at the end stage presented with a decrease in Hb level by greater than 20.0 g/L, but no anemia. Hemoptysis and dyspnea developed in 13 and 9 RIIEAHs respectively. All the 12 RIIEAHs in which bronchosopy had been performed presented with bleeding on bronchoscopy (Table 1). Compared to the RIIEAHs occurred at the stable stage of DAH, the RIIEAHs occurred at the unstable stage or end stage had a higher incidence of worsening anemia, dyspnea and hemoptysis, but the difference was not statistically significant (Table 2).

Treatments and outcomes

An intensive glucocorticoid therapy with methylprednisolone ≥ 2 mg/kg.d intravenously was administrated in the 19 RIIEAHs, in which a glucocorticoid pulse therapy with methylprednisolone 10 ~ 30 mg/kg.d with the maximum 1 g intravenously was administrated in the 4 RIIEAHs. A targeted anti-infection treatment was administrated in the 11 RIIEAHs and hemostatic agents were only administrated in 3 RIIEAHs (Table 1).

The majority of the RIIEAHs (n = 19) resolved, whereas there was 1 case death due to the RIIEAH. Of these cases with intensive glucocorticoid therapy (n = 19), 18 RIIEAHs resolved (Table 1).

Results

Patients characteristics

During the study period, 147 patients were suspected of having DAH. However, 79 patients were excluded for the following reasons: bronchoscopy was not performed (n = 59), hemorrhage from bronchial origin was responsible for the symptoms (n = 3), BALF findings were not compatible with DAH (n = 2), and the data of the BALF cell pattern were not obtained (n = 15). Consequently, 68 patients were included in our analysis (Fig. 1). The backgrounds of patients are shown in Table 1. The median age was 75 (72–80) years, and 49 (72%) patients were male. Forty-eight (71%) patients were receiving AT; 7 (10%) received antiplatelet therapy alone, 23 (34%) received anticoagulant therapy alone, and 18 (26%) received both antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies. The etiological diseases of DAH were immune disease (8.8%), infection (13%), drug-induced pneumonitis (5.9%), heart failure (4.4%), other disease (13%), and idiopathic (54%). No variable was significantly different between the survival and death groups. The clinical characteristics of patients on admission are displayed in Table 2. Forty-seven (69%) patients received invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Fifty-six (82%) patients were administered corticosteroids. Neutrophils and lymphocytes percentages in BALF, and eGFR were significantly different between the survival and death groups.

P206 Spectrum of histopathological findings and underlying causes in 59 patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage

S Sangli, M Baqir, J Ryu

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA

Introduction: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is an acute life-threatening event and recurrent episodes of DAH may result in irreversible interstitial fibrosis. Identifying the underlying cause is often challenging but is needed for optimal treatment. Lung biopsy is often performed in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected DAH. However, the role of lung biopsy in this clinical context is unclear. Hence, we sought to identify the spectrum of histopathologic findings and underlying causes in patients with DAH who underwent lung biopsy, surgical or transbronchial.

Methods: We identified 59 patients who underwent surgical lung biopsy (n = 25) or bronchoscopic biopsy (n = 34) in the evaluation of DAH over a 19-year period from 1999 to 2017. We extracted relevant clinical pathologic and laboratory data.

Results: The median age in our cohort was 67 years with 51% females. Serologic evaluation was positive in 47% of patients (n = 28). Most common histopathologic findings on surgical lung biopsy included alveolar hemorrhage (AH) with capillaritis in 11 patients of whom six had necrotizing capillaritis, followed by AH without capillaritis in 7 patients. The most common histopathologic finding on bronchoscopic lung biopsy was AH without vasculitis/capillaritis in 22 patients, followed by AH with capillaritis in 11 patients. There were no procedure related complications or mortality observed with either method of lung biopsy. The clinico-pathologic diagnoses in these patients are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Conclusions: In patients with DAH undergoing lung biopsy alveolar hemorrhage without capillaritis was found to be the most common histopathologic finding followed by pulmonary capillaritis. These histopathologic findings contributed to the final clinico-pathologic diagnoses of granulomatous polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis in a substantial portion of cases. Future studies are needed to ascertain the benefits vs. risks of lung biopsy in patients with suspected DAH.

Pathological features of the cases with emphysema

Two emphysema cases underwent thoracoscopic lung biopsy, with one demonstrating diffuse patterns and one non-diffuse morphology. Histopathological confirmation of emphysema was obtained in both cases (Fig. 3). The case with diffuse emphysema had inflammatory cell infiltration in the alveolar septa and was definitively diagnosed with pulmonary capillaritis (Fig. 3), whereas the case with non-diffuse emphysema had no features of capillaritis or vasculitis and was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH). Complementary transbronchial biopsy in the diffuse emphysema cohort (n = 1). Pathologic diagnosis of pulmonary capillaritis was suspected due to the presence of inflammatory cell infiltration in the alveolar septa (Fig. 3). In addition, significant accumulation of hemosiderin-laden macrophages within alveolar lumens was found in both cases with diffuse emphysema (Fig. 3).

### Respiratory infection induced episode of alveolar hemorrhage (RIIEAH) in the pediatric diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: a retrospective single-center study [^111E2kQw]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory infections are recognized as common triggers of alveolar hemorrhage episodes in pediatric diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). However, comprehensive studies investigating this association in detail remain limited. The aim of this study was to explore the etiological spectrum, clinical features, treatment strategies and outcomes of the respiratory infection induced episode of alveolar hemorrhage (RIIEAH) in the pediatric DAH.

Methods

The children of DAH who had RIIEAH and a definite etiological diagnosis were included. All the subjects had been hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from January 2023 to February 2024. A retrospective, single-center study was conducted.

Results

1. A total of 21 RIIEAHs were included, in which 12 RIIEAHs occurred at the unstable stage, 6 RIIEAHs occurred at the stable stage and 3 RIIEAHs occurred at the end stage. 2. Various pathogens could result in RIIEAHs including mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 7), coronavirus (n = 3), haemophilus influenzae (n = 3), chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 2), human metapneumovirus (n = 2), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), pueumocystis carinii (n = 1) and mixed pathogens (n = 2). 3. The majority of the RIIEAHs (n = 19) presented with prodromal symptoms. Clinical manifestations of RIIEAHs included worsening anemia (n = 13), hemoptysis (n = 13), bleeding on bronchoscopy (n = 12) and dyspnea (n = 9). 4. An intensive glucocorticoid therapy was administrated in the 19 RIIEAHs, in which 18 RIIEAHs resolved.

Conclusions

RIIEAH can be caused by various pathogens at any disease stage of pediatric DAH and an intensive glucocorticoid therapy seems to be effective for this condition.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage secondary to propylthiouracil-induced vasculitis [^112HzwX7]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Propylthiouracil is a drug used to treat hyperthyroidism. It can cause several side effects including pulmonary disorders that, although rare, can be severe. The authors describe the case of a woman treated with propylthiouracil who developed diffuse alveolar haemorrhage with severe respiratory failure and anaemia, which improved with discontinuation of the antithyroid drug and on starting systemic corticosteroid therapy.

### Respiratory infection induced episode of alveolar hemorrhage (RIIEAH) in the pediatric diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: a retrospective single-center study [^1173y7EH]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In clinic, pediatric DAH was classified as acute stage, unstable stage, stable stage and end stage. The cases at the acute stage typically present as episode of alveolar hemorrhage, those at the unstable stage present a similar clinical manifestations to the episode of alveolar hemorrhage due to the recurrent, dormant alveolar hemorrhage and those at the stable stage nearly perform as normal person. In addition, some cases develop to the end-stage lung disease with extensive pulmonary interstitial lung fibrosis and alveolar structural damage. In this study, RIIEAH occurred at any disease stage of pediatric DAH and seemed to be more severe in the cases at the unstable or end stage. This might be due to the damaged integrity of the pulmonary vascular in the cases at the unstable and end stage.

In this study, the predominant method to identify the pathogen is NGS. Compared to the routine pathogen tests, it has the advantages of high throughput, high sensitivity and quantification and brought innovation to the etiological diagnosis. BALF is the appropriate specimen for NGS due to the little bacterial colonization. In this study, BALF was the most commonly used specimen for NGS. Also, Mp infection was identified using the serological method in this study. In some studies, Mp infection was identified by an Mp-specific IgM of ≥ 1:160. Whereas, Mp-specific IgM may exist for several months after Mp infection, detection of Mp-specific IgM in a single serum for diagnosis of current MP infection has limited values, as it may be a reaction to the Mp infection several months before. Therefore, we identified the current MP infection by seroconversion or fourfold increase of Mp-specific IgM titer in this study.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage associated with subsequent development of ANCA positivity and emphysema in three young adults [^117LJcAa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is characterized by the diffuse accumulation of red blood cells within the alveoli, presence of ground glass opacities and/or consolidation on computed tomography (CT). Aside from identifiable non-immune causes, DAH is classically subdivided into idiopathic (idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis, IPH) and autoimmune DAH. Here we describe three cases presenting with recurrent pulmonary haemorrhage, initially classified as IPH, who, several years after first presentation, develop anti myeloperoxidase antibodies (MPO) positivity, emphysema on CT and, in one case, renal involvement.

Case presentation

Patient 1 was diagnosed with IPH aged 14. Her disease remained poorly controlled despite immunosuppression, although ANCA remained negative over the years. Nineteen years from initial presentation, she developed MPO-ANCA positive antibodies and mild renal impairment. She was treated with Rituximab with good response. From first presentation, the chest CT was consistently characterized by diffuse ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening. Ten years later, cystic opacities consistent with emphysema, with a striking peribronchovascular distribution, developed. Patient 2 was diagnosed with IPH aged 32. He was treated with corticosteroids and methotrexate, with fluctuating response. At 11 years from initial presentation, MPO-ANCA positivity was identified, and emphysema with a peribronchovascular distribution was observed on CT, with subsequent significant increase in extent. Patient 3 was diagnosed with IPH at the age of seven, and had recurrent episodes of haemoptysis of varying degree of severity, treated with intermittent courses of corticosteroids until age 11, when he was intubated due to severe DAH. Eight years after the diagnosis emphysematous changes were noted on CT and MPO-ANCA positivity developed for the first time 11 years after initial diagnosis.

Conclusions

We believe these three cases highlight: 1) the possibility of development of ANCA positivity several years down the line from first DAH presentation 2) the possibility that DAH may lead to cystic/emphysematous changes with peribronchovascular distribution on CT. Moreover, the need for ongoing immunosuppressive treatment and the development of emphysema, emphasize a possible role played by autoimmune phenomena, even when DAH is initially diagnosed as "idiopathic". Further studies are required to better understand the relationship between DAH, ANCA positivity and development of emphysema.

### Cobalamin C deficiency presenting with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary microangiopathy [^1158643p]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocysteinemia is a genetically heterogeneous disorder of cobalamin (cbl; vitamin B12) metabolism, which consists of five subtypes including cblC, cblD, cblF, cblJ, and cblX deficiencies. The purpose of this study is to summarize new clinical features mainly diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) in cblC deficiency.

Methods

We made a retrospective analysis of four pediatric patients diagnosed with DAH and pulmonary microangiopathy due to cblC deficiency between January 2017 and December 2018 in Beijing Children's Hospital.

Results

This study describes four patients with their ages ranging from 4 years 2 months to 7 years 6 months with cblC deficiency who developed late-onset diffuse lung disease (DLD). Of these, the first three patients presented predominantly with DAH, and the last patient with pulmonary microangiopathy confirmed by thoracoscopic lung biopsy. All patients were accompanied by pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), two accompanied by respiratory failure, and two accompanied by moderate megaloblastic anemia. Diffuse ground-glass opacification and poorly defined ground-glass centrilobular nodules were seen on high-resolution computed tomography in one patient and three patients, respectively. All patients were suspected of having idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis or interstitial lung disease at other hospitals. All of them received treatment with corticosteroid before admission, but the symptoms did not improve. Moreover, all patients carried compound heterozygous mutations (c.80A > G, c.609G > A) in MMACHC and improved significantly after being treated for cblC deficiency and PAH.

Conclusions

CblC deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of DAH especially with PAH, and pulmonary microangiopathy be the main reason of DLD in these patients.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in pediatrics: etiologies and outcomes [^111hqRRn]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

Following the resolution of acute illness, few patients in our cohort had abnormal PFTs. This contrasts with findings in the European study identifying that among those able to complete PFTs, only 31% of patients had normal pulmonary function, with eventual improvement in TLC but not in FEV₁. The initial PFTs reported in the European study were all within 1 month of the DAH diagnosis while the median time to initial PFTs in our cohort was longer. Those patients were identified by specialists in interstitial lung disease, and as such those patients may have been more likely to come to their attention due to chronic respiratory impairment, while our cohort was inclusive of all patients with DAH seen at our institution. PFTs were often performed months or years after the DAH episode, and as such, it is unsurprising that we did not identify the elevated diffusing capacity that may be seen in patients with DAH.

Our initial chart review identified many neonates with DAH attributable to challenges with the transition to extrauterine life or to extreme prematurity, all of whom were less than 10 days corrected gestational age. An analysis by Welsh et al. of infants under 1 year of age with DAH identified prematurity and disorders specific to the neonatal period as common risk factors in infants. Given the work already done in this population, we chose to focus on older infants and children. The etiologies in infants greater than 10 days corrected gestational age were similar to those seen in older children.

Limitations of this study are dictated by the nature of a retrospective study in complex, often critically ill patients with a rare syndrome. We chose to include patients who did not have invasive diagnostics to confirm DAH; while this allowed us to include patients who otherwise would not have been captured, it is possible that non‐alveolar bleeding could have been identified in some patients had bronchoscopy been performed. It can be difficult to identify the true proximate cause of DAH, though we mitigated this by having the primary etiology adjudicated independently by two physicians. We chose to classify patients with a recent cardiac arrest based on the primary cause of their critical illness rather than classifying the etiology of their DAH as cardiac, particularly as for many of them, it was unclear whether the DAH happened shortly before or subsequent to the arrest. Though our study is similar in size to the others that have been published, DAH is uncommon in children, so the relatively small study population limited our analyses, especially of etiologic subgroups.

### Respiratory infection induced episode of alveolar hemorrhage (RIIEAH) in the pediatric diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: a retrospective single-center study [^11285Npt]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

DAH is a relatively rare but life-threatening disease in children. It can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies including the immune disorders and non-immune disorders. The cases caused by the immune disorders such as ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), systemic lupus erthematosus (SLE), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are definite immune-mediated DAH. Recently, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) has also been considered as immune-mediated DAH as numerous studies have demonstrated that IPH presented a good response to immunosuppressive therapy. In this study, the etiological diagnosis included idiopathic in 18 cases, AAV in 3 cases and the cases caused by the definite non-immune disorders were excluded. Therefore, all of which were considered as immune mediated DAH.

Previous studies have reported that the prognosis of pediatric DAH was poor and the cases survived only 3 ~ 5 years on average after onset of disease. With the application of immunosuppressive therapy, the prognosis of pediatric DAH has been improved significantly. At present, the majority of the cases can survive long-term. Still, it can result in death in some cases. Also, a substantial proportion of the cases with long-term survival had persistent abnormal radiology and a limited improvement in lung function. Episode of alveolar hemorrhage is the predominant cause of death in the pediatric DAH. And, recurrent episode of alveolar hemorrhage can result in end stage lung disease with extensive pulmonary interstitial lung fibrosis. So, reducing the episode of alveolar hemorrhage is an essential way to improve the prognosis of pediatric DAH. Respiratory infection is related to the episode of alveolar hemorrhage in the pediatric DAH. The mechanism is still unknown. It is possible that respiratory infection activates the inflammation or immune response in the lungs. In this study, RIIEAH was referred as the episode of alveolar hemorrhage induced by the respiratory infection in pediatric DAH. To our knowledge, this was the first study to explore the etiological spectrum, clinical features, treatment strategies and outcomes of RIIEAH in the pediatric DAH systematically.

### Interstitial lung diseases in the hospitalized patient [^112vucik]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP)

AEP is an eosinophilic lung disease that can lead to hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Recent reports suggest that AEP may develop as a hypersensitivity reaction to tobacco smoke or dust exposure. Patients present with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and a complete blood count may show peripheral eosinophilia. Radiographically, the HRCT shows bilateral ground glass opacities that are predominantly located in the lung periphery. Cell differential on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid typically contains greater than 30% eosinophils. Lung histopathology shows marked infiltration of eosinophils in the lung interstitium and alveolar spaces with patchy areas of organizing pneumonia.

Drug-induced interstitial lung disease

Drug-induced ILD comprises 2–3% of all ILDs. More than 350 drugs have been reported to cause lung disease. The diagnosis of drug-induced ILD may be challenging because clinical and radiographic findings are similar to those of many pulmonary diseases. Clues to drug-induced ILD are that the onset of symptoms may correlate to time of first use of the medication (although this relationship is variable and the latency period can be quite long) and a high index of suspicion in all new cases of ILD. Depending on the implicated drug, nearly all radiographic and histopathologic types of lung disease, including NSIP, DAD, OP, eosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage have been reported. NSIP is the most common pathologic pattern of drug-induced ILD.

Comorbidities

IPF and other fibrotic ILDs may be associated with comorbid illnesses, including pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary infection, pneumothorax, left-sided heart disease, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, emphysema, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or sleep disorders. Progression of these comorbidities may be the cause of hospitalization and significantly impact patient outcomes. Thus, patients with worsening of respiratory symptoms require evaluation for progressive disease and consideration that these comorbidities may be contributing.

Discussion: diagnosis and management of acute manifestations of ILD

### Treatment of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage after allogeneic bone marrow transplant with recombinant factor VIIa [^111X5WuL]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a potentially life-threatening pulmonary toxicity that occurs in 1–21% of patients following bone marrow transplantation. The syndrome is associated with a high mortality rate; and current treatment options are limited. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, Novoseven) has recently been approved for the treatment of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A/B with inhibitors. A greater understanding of the mechanism by which rFVIIa restores hemostasis has recently become available; with in vitro evidence supporting that the thrombin burst achieved by rFVIIa is independent of the presence or binding to tissue factor. This insight has suggested a range of other potential clinical uses for the drug; including the setting of pulmonary hemorrhage. We review our experience with using rFVIIa for treatment of DAH in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia following a matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant. Boluses of 90 microg/kg rFVIIa were given every 3 h × 4 doses/day, concurrently with high-dose corticosteroids and maintenance of a platelet count > 50 000/mm³. Rapid clinical and radiological improvement was noted within several doses of rFVIIa, with discontinuation of the drug after eight doses. However, the patient's clinical condition began to rapidly deteriorate following cessation of rVIIa, resulting in reinstitution of therapy 24 h later. The patient again exhibited rapid clinical improvement; and rFVIIa was continued for an additional 16 doses with no further evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage noted. No toxicity or adverse events were observed with rFVIIa treatment. Our experience indicates that rFVIIa may be an effective treatment option for DAH post bone marrow transplant; although further clinical studies are needed before recommendations can be made regarding off label use of rFVIIa in this clinical setting.

### Pulmonary capillaritis in children: a review of eight cases with comparison to other alveolar hemorrhage syndromes [^113LBiHV]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review clinical, laboratory, and outcome characteristics of children diagnosed with pulmonary capillaritis (PC), a small-vessel vasculitis, presenting as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and to compare these findings with those for children with other alveolar hemorrhage syndromes.

Study Design

A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent a lung biopsy because of a clinical suggestion of pulmonary hemorrhage.

Results

PC was identified in 8 of 23 patients. In these patients, cough, crackles, and hypoxia were common. Alveolar infiltrates on radiography and anemia were present in 7 of 8 cases. Serologic evidence of a systemic vasculitis was present in 50% of patients. High-dose corticosteroids proved effective in controlling alveolar hemorrhage in all cases. There were no presenting signs or symptoms that could differentiate patients with PC from those with non-immune-mediated alveolar hemorrhage. In general, patients with PC had a lower hematocrit and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

Conclusion

Children presenting with lower respiratory tract symptoms, chest x-ray abnormalities, and anemia should undergo evaluation for PC, as early initiation of immunosuppression can be lifesaving and organ sparing. No clinical signs to differentiate immune and non-immune-mediated alveolar hemorrhage were evident in this study.

### Effect of plasma exchange in acute respiratory failure due to anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis [^1167uCkn]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory failure related to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a typical presentation of small-vessel vasculitis that requires prompt multidisciplinary management. The primary treatment is based on immunosuppressive drugs, whereas urgent plasma exchange has been proposed in case of life-threatening complications. We addressed the course of respiratory failure in 12 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis-related DAH.

Patients and methods

Observational retrospective case series performed in the medical ICU of a tertiary hospital in Paris, France. Consecutive patients with ANCA-associated DAH admitted to our ICU for acute respiratory failure and treated by plasmapheresis were included in the analysis. We evaluated the SpO₂/FiO₂ ratio and assessed the mechanical ventilation mode hourly for 7 days.

Results

Twelve patients were included. Five of them required invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients were treated by plasma exchange in addition to a combination of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents. Oxygenation improved over the first 7 days following initiation of plasma exchange, as shown by a dramatic increase in the median SpO₂/FiO₂ ratio from 183 [interquartile 137–321] to 353 [239–432] (p = 0.003), along with a decrease in the level of ventilatory support. All but one patient survived.

Conclusions

A multimodal induction regimen combining immunosuppressants and plasma exchange may rapidly reverse the respiratory dysfunction in ANCA-associated vasculitis-related DAH.

### High neutrophils and low lymphocytes percentages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are prognostic factors of higher in-hospital mortality in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^117AJJgf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a clinicopathological syndrome that describes the accumulation of intra-alveolar red blood cells originating from the alveolar capillaries. DAH can induce severe respiratory failure. In-hospital mortality has ranged from 15 to 51% in previous studies. Additionally, some clinical characteristics and biological parameters have been proven to be prognostic factors of DAH.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is an essential DAH diagnostic method. The BAL fluid (BALF) of DAH presents visually hemorrhagic and cytologically hemosiderin-laden macrophages. However, to the best of our knowledge, the association between the BALF cell pattern and prognosis has never been investigated in DAH.

Antithrombotic therapy (AT) is known to be one of the causes of DAH, and other etiologies can induce DAH during AT. Only two studies have investigated the association between AT and prognosis in DAH. In those studies, the mortality was not significantly different between DAH that occurred during AT (DAH-AT) and DAH that occurred without AT (DAH-NAT). On the other hand, one study showed that prognosis was better for DAH-AT with no cause other than AT (simple DAH-AT) than for DAH-AT with causes other than AT (complicated DAH-AT) and DAH-NAT. However, considering the current trend toward more patients receiving AT, the prognostic influence of AT in DAH remains insufficient. Consequently, it is important to investigate the relationship between AT and prognosis and characterize the differences in prognoses among complicated DAH-AT and simple DAH-AT.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in pediatrics: etiologies and outcomes [^113jxfT6]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The results of this first US‐based study of children with DAH highlight that pediatric DAH causes severe illness and is associated with a high mortality rate, which varies depending on the underlying etiology. A minority of patients in our cohort had IPH/AIPH or autoimmune lung disease; all of these patients survived. Mortality was high in the remainder of the cohort and highest for those with cardiovascular disease. The underlying etiology varied with age; patients with cardiovascular disease often had DAH during their birth hospitalization, and patients with IPH/AIPH were notably younger than those with autoimmune disease. Nine (13%) of our patients did not have hemoptysis before the procedure (bronchoscopy or biopsy) that diagnosed the DAH, highlighting the need to maintain a high index of suspicion.

A strength of our study that likely accounts for the differences in our population compared to those reported in other studies, is our systematic case identification strategy and narrow exclusion criteria. As such, we were able to examine pediatric populations with DAH that have not previously been described, including patients with cardiovascular disease and those with recent trauma. The broad inclusion and narrow exclusion criteria should allow the findings of this study to be generalizable at least to patients in other tertiary pediatric healthcare systems in the United States.

Patients in our cohort with DAH were generally very ill, with most requiring ICU‐level care, and many requiring lengthy hospital admissions often attributable to comorbid conditions. Other studies reporting severity of illness with DAH are limited, though our population required more respiratory support than a Chinese population reported by Qi et al. In their study, researchers report only half of their patient cohort required oxygen and one‐third required mechanical ventilation. Prior studies of children with DAH have reported lower mortality rates of 0%−26%; the higher mortality (37%) in our study is likely related to the lower representation of cardiovascular disease (high mortality) and overrepresentation of IPH/AIPH (low mortality) in previous reports. The lack of mortality in children with autoimmune disease in our cohort is similar to findings in a European study by Ring et al. A recent analysis of children with interstitial lung disease (chILD) identified an overall mortality of 6% (much lower than in an earlier study of chILD, which identified 30% mortality); no children with DAH (either idiopathic or vasculitis‐related) in that cohort died.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: an underreported complication of transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy [^111D4Ljr]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) are well recognized post-transplant complications that carry a high risk of mortality; however, the risk of DAH complicating the course of transplant patients with TA-TMA is not well understood. We conducted a ten-year retrospective study at our institution to determine the incidence of DAH in a cohort of pediatric patients with TA-TMA and described their presentation and outcomes. Additionally, autopsy slides, when available, were reviewed to assess for histological evidence of microvascular injury and alveolar hemorrhages. A total of 58 pediatric patients with TA-TMA were identified. Of these, 14 (24%) had DAH. Majority of DAH cases occurred within a week of TA-TMA diagnosis (n = 8, 57%, range 0–698 days). Mortality was 100% for patients with DAH and TA-TMA. Infections were found to be a significant risk factor for DAH in TA-TMA. Autopsy was performed in 11 of the 14 patients, and pulmonary slides were available for review in ten cases. 70% cases had pathological evidence of microvascular injury, concerning for pulmonary TA-TMA. We conclude that DAH is a potentially fatal complication in patients with TA-TMA and may be a result of pulmonary microangiopathy.

### Pathogenesis of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in murine lupus [^115DUQfj]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) in lupus patients confers > 50% mortality, and the cause is unknown. We undertook this study to examine the pathogenesis of DAH in C57BL/6 mice with pristane-induced lupus, a model of human lupus-associated DAH.

Methods

Clinical/pathologic and immunologic manifestations of DAH in pristane-induced lupus were compared with those of DAH in humans. Tissue distribution of pristane was examined by mass spectrometry. Cell types responsible for disease were determined by in vivo depletion using clodronate liposomes and antineutrophil monoclonal antibodies (anti-Ly-6G). The effect of complement depletion with cobra venom factor (CVF) was examined.

Results

After intraperitoneal injection, pristane migrated to the lung, causing cell death, small vessel vasculitis, and alveolar hemorrhage similar to that seen in DAH in humans. B cell-deficient mice were resistant to induction of DAH, but susceptibility was restored by infusing IgM. C3 -/- and CD18 -/- mice were also resistant, and DAH was prevented in wild-type mice by CVF. Induction of DAH was independent of Toll-like receptors, inflammasomes, and inducible nitric oxide. Mortality was increased in interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient mice, and pristane treatment decreased IL-10 receptor expression in monocytes and STAT-3 phosphorylation in lung macrophages. In vivo neutrophil depletion was not protective, while treatment with clodronate liposomes prevented DAH, which suggests that macrophage activation is central to DAH pathogenesis.

Conclusion

The pathogenesis of DAH involves opsonization of dead cells by natural IgM and complement followed by complement receptor-mediated lung inflammation. The disease is macrophage dependent, and IL-10 is protective. Complement inhibition and/or macrophage-targeted therapies may reduce mortality in lupus-associated DAH.

### Bad for breathing: a pictorial of drug-induced pulmonary disease [^113Fm4qL]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Drug-induced lung disease has been described with over 300 different agents, some of which are asymptomatic and may first present on imaging. These pulmonary diseases may present with variable imaging manifestations, and often overlap with other etiologies such as rejection, lymphoproliferative disorders, and infection that may be suspected in this patient population. However, there are several drugs that have classic imaging appearances, and in the proper clinical context, the radiologist should include their toxicity in the differential diagnosis, potentially expediting withdrawal of the drug and avoiding irreversible lung injury such as fibrosis.

### Aortic dissection presenting as shortness of breath from diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^114Pqksh]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Aortic dissection is a rare but well-known life-threatening disease that classically presents with tearing chest pain radiating to the back yet can have deceiving clinical presentations.

Case Report

A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency department with mild shortness of breath without chest pain. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) detected diffuse B-lines, a dilated aortic root, aortic regurgitation, and pericardial effusion. A computed tomography angiogram confirmed a Stanford type A aortic dissection with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), a rare complication of type A aortic dissection involving the posterior aortic wall with extension into the main pulmonary artery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Acute aortic dissection can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations with a high mortality rate for patients with an untimely diagnosis. Although an intimal flap within the aortic lumen is the characteristic finding on ultrasound, additional POCUS findings of a pericardial effusion, aortic regurgitation, and a dilated aortic root may be seen with proximal dissections. Diffuse B-lines on thoracic POCUS, although commonly associated with pulmonary edema in decompensated heart failure, can be seen in patients with DAH which has a multitude of etiologies, including aortic dissection.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura in children: not only kidney but also lung [^112tWjtE]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis of childhood and affects the small blood vessels. Pulmonary involvement is a rare complication of HSP and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is the most frequent clinical presentation. Little is known about the real incidence of lung involvement during HSP in the pediatric age and about its diagnosis, management and outcome.

Methods

In order to discuss the main clinical findings and the diagnosis and management of lung involvement in children with HSP, we performed a review of the literature of the last 40 years.

Results

We identified 23 pediatric cases of HSP with lung involvement. DAH was the most frequent clinical presentation of the disease. Although it can be identified by chest x-ray (CXR), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is the gold standard for diagnosis. Pulse methylprednisolone is the first-line of therapy in children with DAH. An immunosuppressive regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide or azathioprine plus corticosteroids is required when respiratory failure occurs. Four of the twenty-three patients died, while 18 children had a resolution of the pulmonary involvement.

Conclusions

DAH is a life-threatening complication of HSP. Prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment are essential in order to achieve the best outcome.

### Bendamustine hcl (bendamustine) [^112pbeYF]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression

Bendamustine hydrochloride caused severe myelosuppression (Grade 3–4) in 98% of patients in the two NHL studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Three patients (2%) died from myelosuppression-related adverse reactions; one each from neutropenic sepsis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia from an opportunistic infection (CMV).

Monitor complete blood counts, including leukocytes, platelets, hemoglobin (Hgb), and neutrophils frequently. In the clinical trials, blood counts were monitored every week initially. Hematologic nadirs were observed predominantly in the third week of therapy. Myelosuppression may require dose delays and/or subsequent dose reductions if recovery to the recommended values has not occurred by the first day of the next scheduled cycle. Prior to the initiation of the next cycle of therapy, the ANC should be ≥ 1×10⁹/L and the platelet count should be ≥ 75×10⁹/L [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and (2.3)].

5.2 Infections

Infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, hepatitis and death has occurred in adult and pediatric patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. Patients with myelosuppression following treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride are more susceptible to infections. Advise patients with myelosuppression following bendamustine hydrochloride treatment to contact a physician if they have symptoms or signs of infection.

Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride are at risk for reactivation of infections including (but not limited to) hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and herpes zoster. Patients should undergo appropriate measures (including clinical and laboratory monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment) for infection and infection reactivation prior to administration.

5.3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have occurred following treatment with bendamustine, primarily in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, withhold bendamustine hydrochloride treatment and perform appropriate diagnostic evaluations. Consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML.

### Thoracic involvement in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases: pathogenesis and management [^114ZU6Dp]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

In non-randomized retrospective studies, tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, has been shown to improve or stabilize FVC and DL CO in patients with progressive or refractory ARDs-ILD, especially polymyositis and dermatomyositis; in addition, it may lead to reduction and sometimes complete discontinuation of concomitant steroid/immunosuppressive treatments. A randomized controlled pilot 24-week trial, the ATtackMy-ILD trial, which is currently ongoing, will investigate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous ABA compared with placebo in patients with anti-synthetase syndrome and ILD.

LES and Sjoögren's Syndrome

No evidence-based guidelines for treatment of SLE-ILD or SS-ILD are currently available. The first-line regimen typically includes GCs, alone or in association with other immunosuppressive agents such as CYC or MMF. RTX has been suggested as a second-line therapy. In DAH, the most frequently used therapies are high-dose i.v. GCs (particularly methylprednisolone), CYC and plasmapheresis, although the latter does not appear to influence outcome. Conversely, CYC was associated with improved survival. RTX, in combination with GCs, may also be beneficial, though this has only been shown in case reports. In SS, GCs, either alone or in combination with AZA or other immunosuppressants, are the treatment of choice. In refractory cases, RTX should be considered.

Other thoracic involvements

The treatment of other thoracic manifestations of ARDs is not standardized, due to the paucity of sufficiently large case series or randomized clinical trials. Treatment of thoracic complications other than ILD is summarized in Table 1.

Risk of Death at 3 Months and 1 Year in Patients with or without DAH, and by Severity of DAH, by GC Regimen Treatment Allocation

Initial immunosuppression was specified by the treating clinicians at the time of randomization, before learning the allocated PLEX or GC regimen, rather than assigned by the trial. Given the differences in agent selected between those with versus without DAH, as presented in Table 1, the effects of these on death at 1 year among those with DAH were evaluated and no differences were found. Using intravenous cyclophosphamide as the referent, oral cyclophosphamide had a HR of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.57–1.78) and rituximab an HR of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.32–1.94).

Among participants with DAH requiring mechanical ventilation, there was no difference in ventilator-free days between the PLEX (median, 25; IQR, 22–26) and no-PLEX groups (median, 25; IQR, 22–27; P = 0.83). Participants receiving the reduced GC had fewer ventilator-free days (median, 23; IQR, 20–25) than those receiving the standard GC regimen (median, 26; IQR, 25–28; P = 0.009) (Figure 4). Sensitivity analysis comparing duration of mechanical ventilation yielded similar results (data not shown).

### High neutrophils and low lymphocytes percentages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are prognostic factors of higher in-hospital mortality in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^116Z8epG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a syndrome resulting from bleeding in the microcirculation of the lung, with a poor prognosis. The study aim was to identify prognostic factors of DAH, especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) cell pattern.

Methods

We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed as having DAH and hospitalized at our hospital between October 2008 and July 2020. We performed univariate logistic regressions to identify variables associated with in-hospital death.

Results

Sixty-eight patients were included in our analysis. In-hospital mortality was 26.5%. Variables associated with in-hospital death were neutrophils percentage in BALF ≥ 44.5% [Odds Ratio (OR) 16.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.33–58.9)], lymphocytes percentage in BALF < 14% (OR 7.44, 95% CI 2.11–26.2), idiopathic DAH (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10–0.95), oxygen flow ≥ 4L/min (OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.20–12.6), and estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min (OR 5.00, 95%CI 1.29–19.4).

Conclusions

High neutrophils and low lymphocytes percentages in BALF were associated with poor prognosis.

### Chest CT diagnosis and clinical management of drug-related pneumonitis in patients receiving molecular targeting agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors: a position paper from the Fleischner society [^116sSaqc]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Clinical features of drug-related pneumonitis (DRP) — Incidence was estimated at 1.2 per 100,000 per year with a prevalence of 2.6 per 100,000, and DRP accounts for 2.5% to 5% of prevalent cases of interstitial lung disease; cancer drugs (eg, bleomycin) are the most common cause, followed by drugs for autoimmune diseases (eg, methotrexate), amiodarone, and antibiotics (eg, nitrofurantoin). The onset may be acute, insidious, and sometimes delayed with a long latent period (eg, beyond 10 years in some cases of carmustine-induced pulmonary fibrosis) following completion of drug treatment, and symptoms are generally nonspecific, including dyspnea, cough, malaise, and low-grade fever, though some patients may be asymptomatic even in the presence of diffuse pulmonary opacities and lung auscultation often reveals crackles but may be normal. It is difficult to clinically distinguish DRP from infections, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, radiation-induced pneumonitis, and metastases, and evaluation for cardiovascular etiologies including heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary venoclusive disease, and other forms of pulmonary hypertension needs to be considered. The clinical suspicion for DRP arises from the temporal relationship between drug exposure and the onset of clinical presentation, and in most patients the diagnosis is unlikely to be made with certainty even after extensive clinical evaluation, including lung biopsy. The increasing use of molecular targeting agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has broadened the spectrum of lung toxicity encountered clinically, exemplified by immune-related adverse effects in patients treated with ICIs that include pneumonitis and are thought to result from general immunologic activation, including autoimmune response.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and anticoagulation in COVID-19 — We suggest close monitoring of the patients on DAPT who also need anticoagulation because of COVID-19-related hospitalization, and no clear guidelines or robust evidence exist to propose a threshold for the platelet count below which DAPT should be switched over to single antiplatelet therapy; recent literature highlighted the risk of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in patients with COVID-19 treated with DAPT after PCI, and prasugrel may be an option to consider if concerns of drug-drug interaction and variable efficacy exist.

Fig. 1
Chest computed tomography (CT), a noninvasive medical procedure that uses X‐rays to create cross‐sectional images of the body showing evidence of diffuse bilateral infiltrates. This imaging description is consistent with the radiological manifestation of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) because this condition involves bilateral and widespread bleeding into the alveoli, leading to increased lung opacities. This results in the characteristic appearance of ground glass opacities or infiltrates on chest X‐rays or CT scans as shown in this case.

Fig. 2
Bronchial washings completed during bronchoscopy. The presence of blood in bronchial washings is confirmatory for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) because it indicates active bleeding within the alveoli. Unlike other conditions, DAH shows persistent blood across consecutive samples, indicating diffuse bleeding from the small capillaries within the lungs, more specifically within the alveolar spaces.

The lab findings in this case were crucial for diagnosing PRS. Urinalysis revealed hematuria and significant proteinuria, indicating glomerular damage, whereas leukocytosis reflected ongoing inflammation and infection. The rising creatinine level signaled worsening renal function. Elevated antistreptolysin O (ASLO) titre indicated a recent streptococcal infection, along with a low complement C3 level and normal C4 levels, supporting the diagnosis of PGN. The patient's intense hemoptysis, combined with chest CT findings of diffuse bilateral infiltrates and bloody bronchial washes, confirmed DAH. This clinical picture was sufficient for PRS diagnosis.

### Drug-induced interstitial lung disease caused by olaparib: three case reports and review of the Japanese adverse drug event report database and literature [^111uRVsA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 5 shows the clinical features of the six Japanese case reports of olaparib-induced lung disease that are currently available in the literature, including the present three cases. Two cases reported by Sakai et al. one with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and the other with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like pattern, were treated with discontinuation of olaparib alone, without the need for steroids, and were able to restart olaparib afterward. Another case reported by Suzuki et al. showed GGO, which quickly improved with steroids (Table 5).

KL-6, a biomarker that is elevated in 53% of DIILD cases and correlates with diffuse alveolar damage patterns associated with poor prognosis, is considered useful for DIILD diagnosis. However, the establishment of a biomarker with high specificity for the diagnosis of DIILD remains a challenge for the future. The following diagnostic criteria should be used when the onset of DIILD is suspected: (1) a history of administrations of a drug known to induce lung injury, (2) exclusion of other causes for the clinical manifestations. The exclusion of differential diagnoses is an essential step in diagnosing DIILD. Notably, even in the presented three cases, the diagnosis of DIILD was based on the exclusion of differential diagnoses, highlighting the challenges in diagnosing DIILD in actual clinical practice. Therefore, it is important to consider the discontinuation of the suspected drug at an early stage if DIILD cannot be ruled out. PARP inhibitors are widely used to treat various cancers. It is essential to accumulate more cases of DIILD caused by PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, and to characterize the pathogenesis to develop countermeasures.

### Factors associated with mortality and infections in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^1135fgD3]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate factors associated with mortality and infections in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).

Methods

A retrospective chart review was carried out for medical admissions of patients with a diagnosis of SLE and DAH in 9 hospitals. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded for each patient at DAH diagnosis.

Results

We included 57 episodes of DAH of 50 patients (7 recurrences), 49 women (86%), 14 juvenile SLE (24.6%); 24 had died (42.1%). In the chart review we detected infection in 22 episodes (38.6%): 8 invasive fungal infections, 16 bacterial infections, and 2 patients had both types. In the bivariate analysis, factors associated with mortality were high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, requirement of mechanical ventilation (OR 15.0, 95% CI 1.9 to 662.2), infections (fungal or bacterial; OR 3.2, CI 0.9 to 11.1), renal failure (OR 4.9, CI 1.4 to 18.0), and thrombocytopenia (OR 4.3, CI 1.2 to 15.6). We found similar mortality between children and adults. Infections were associated with treatment for SLE, requirement of mechanical ventilation, hypocomplementemia, and high levels of C-reactive protein.

Conclusion

Infection is a frequent finding in patients with DAH and SLE; we found similar mortality between adult SLE and juvenile SLE. Factors that we describe associated with infections may influence the therapeutic selection for these patients.
