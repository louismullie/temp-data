## Question

GOLD guidelines for COPD management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the GOLD guidelines for COPD management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative source and confirm the current GOLD document. Then, I should verify the overarching goals and principles of care. Next, I will review diagnostic criteria and the ABE classification. After that, I need to examine pharmacologic strategies, including escalation and de-escalation, and reconcile any apparent discrepancies. I will then consider non-pharmacologic care, exacerbation management, and special populations. Finally, I should assess implementation gaps and synthesize a practical, patient-centered approach with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the primary source and its credibility. The 2025 GOLD Report is the most current and authoritative document, building on the 2023 major revision and updated annually by the GOLD Science Committee; it provides a non-biased, evidence-informed review of diagnosis, assessment, and treatment, and it explicitly details the methodology and update cycles, which supports using it as the backbone for this synthesis [^1dce09fb] [^da2744ac].

> I need to state the overarching goals and principles clearly. GOLD emphasizes two parallel aims: reduce symptoms and improve quality of life, and reduce future risk of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and death; management should be individualized based on symptoms, exacerbation history, comorbidities, device technique, and patient preferences, with regular reassessment and adjustment over time [^db17c630] [^601f56c6] [^034b4931].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis without verifying the spirometric threshold. GOLD defines COPD by a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than 0.70, confirming persistent airflow limitation; severity is staged by post-bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted, while clinical decisions are driven by symptoms and exacerbation risk rather than FEV1 alone, which is a key shift from older paradigms [^6788fdd0] [^677c1d4e] [^da2744ac].

> Wait, let me verify the classification system because I initially thought in terms of ABCD. The 2023 revision moved to an ABE grouping that separates symptom burden from exacerbation risk, replacing the old ABCD matrix; Groups A and B reflect low exacerbation risk with low versus high symptom burden, while Group E reflects high exacerbation risk regardless of symptoms, and this ABE framework guides initial pharmacotherapy choices and follow-up adjustments [^a4339aed] [^2c7c6059].

> I will now examine pharmacologic management for stable COPD, starting with low-risk patients. For Group A, short-acting bronchodilators are reasonable for occasional symptoms, but I should confirm that GOLD also supports starting with a LAMA or LABA when symptoms are more persistent; indeed, GOLD prefers long-acting bronchodilators over short-acting agents except for rescue or occasional use, and LAMAs may have a greater effect on exacerbation reduction than LABAs, which is clinically meaningful when choosing monotherapy [^31fa7f37] [^677d1281].

> Next, I should review dual bronchodilation. For Group B, dual LABA/LAMA is preferred over monotherapy to improve FEV1, symptoms, and health status; this is supported by GOLD and aligns with contemporary guidance that favors earlier optimization of bronchodilation rather than slow stepwise escalation, which can delay symptom control and functional gains [^d0685375] [^4561a047].

> For Group E, I need to ensure I get the sequence right regarding ICS. Initially, I thought dual LABA/LAMA might suffice, but wait, let me verify the current stance: GOLD recommends triple therapy with LABA/LAMA/ICS for patients with high exacerbation risk, given improvements in lung function, symptoms, and exacerbation reduction versus dual therapy; importantly, recent data suggest a mortality benefit in symptomatic patients with frequent and/or severe exacerbations, which strengthens the case for triple therapy in this phenotype [^fabab145] [^a2a683c1].

> But wait, what if a patient is already on triple therapy and doing well without recent exacerbations? I should confirm de-escalation guidance. GOLD and ATS suggest considering ICS withdrawal after 12 months without exacerbations, with close monitoring for relapse; this balances the risks of pneumonia and other ICS adverse effects against the potential loss of exacerbation control, and it is a key de-escalation principle in modern care [^e8ae03c3] [^419b1319].

> I should double-check the role of roflumilast and other agents. Roflumilast is recommended for severe to very severe COPD with chronic bronchitis and frequent exacerbations, improving lung function and reducing moderate to severe exacerbations; conversely, vasodilators for pulmonary hypertension secondary to COPD are discouraged because they do not improve outcomes and may worsen oxygenation, and leukotriene modifiers lack sufficient evidence for routine use in COPD [^adf0237a] [^f7f88d77] [^6da87bd0].

> Next, I should review non-pharmacologic care because it meaningfully alters outcomes. Smoking cessation is the most effective intervention to slow progression and improve survival; vaccinations, structured pulmonary rehabilitation, and long-term oxygen for severe chronic hypoxemia are foundational; GOLD also highlights comprehensive comorbidity screening and management, since cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, anxiety/depression, and metabolic syndrome independently affect morbidity and mortality in COPD [^601f56c6] [^4fe98a1f] [^07ef5f42].

> I will now examine exacerbation management. For acute respiratory failure, noninvasive ventilation is first-line in the absence of contraindications to improve gas exchange, reduce intubation, shorten hospital stay, and improve survival; systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics are indicated for appropriate exacerbations; and post-discharge pulmonary rehabilitation reduces readmissions and improves recovery, which should be arranged whenever feasible [^d99d1768] [^4fe98a1f].

> Let me consider special populations and implementation realities. Many patients are older than 80, have multiple comorbidities, or exhibit COPD–asthma overlap; evidence is limited in these groups, so shared decision-making and careful monitoring are essential; real-world data show persistent overuse of ICS and triple therapy in low-risk patients, underscoring the need to align prescribing with ABE risk strata and to reassess inhaler technique and adherence at every visit [^57956459] [^27cb704d] [^03581b2e].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up cadence and what to monitor. Routine visits should track symptoms, exacerbations, and objective measures of airflow obstruction; treatment should be escalated or de-escalated based on response, with explicit checks for adherence, inhaler technique, and comorbidities that could mimic or worsen COPD symptoms; this iterative loop is central to GOLD's individualized care model [^ddd5bdb4] [^e8ae03c3].

> Finally, I need to ensure the synthesis is coherent and actionable. GOLD 2025 operationalizes a patient-centered, risk-stratified approach: confirm COPD with post-bronchodilator spirometry, classify into ABE by symptoms and exacerbation risk, start with appropriate bronchodilation and escalate to dual or triple therapy when indicated, incorporate non-pharmacologic essentials, manage comorbidities proactively, and adjust therapy dynamically at follow-up; this strategy aims to relieve symptoms and reduce future risk while minimizing overtreatment and adverse effects [^db17c630] [^601f56c6] [^1b2bf8f0].

---

The GOLD guidelines recommend a **stepwise, individualized approach** to COPD management, prioritizing symptom control and exacerbation prevention [^601f56c6]. Key elements include:

- **Diagnosis**: Confirm with post-bronchodilator spirometry (FEV1/FVC < 0.70) [^6788fdd0] and classify severity by FEV1% predicted [^677c1d4e].
- **Assessment**: Use the ABE tool (symptoms and exacerbation history) to guide therapy [^1b2bf8f0].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Start with a LAMA or LABA; escalate to LAMA/LABA dual therapy for persistent symptoms; add ICS only for frequent exacerbations or asthma features [^31fa7f37] [^c4f741de] [^273e1640].
- **Non-pharmacologic**: Smoking cessation, vaccination, pulmonary rehabilitation, and oxygen for hypoxemia [^601f56c6] [^4fe98a1f].
- **Exacerbations**: Treat with short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics when indicated; use noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure [^d99d1768].
- **Follow-up**: Monitor symptoms, exacerbations, and lung function; adjust therapy based on response and patient preferences [^ddd5bdb4] [^034b4931].

This approach balances benefits and risks, emphasizing **shared decision-making** and regular reassessment [^601f56c6].

## Diagnosis and assessment

### Diagnosis

Confirm COPD with **post-bronchodilator spirometry** showing FEV1/FVC < 0.70 [^6788fdd0], indicating persistent airflow limitation. Classify severity by **post-bronchodilator FEV1% predicted** [^677c1d4e]:

| **Gold grade** | **Fev1% predicted** |
|-|-|
| Grade 1 | ≥ 80% |
| Grade 2 | 50–79% |
| Grade 3 | 30–49% |
| Grade 4 | < 30% |

---

### Initial assessment

Use the **ABE assessment tool** [^1b2bf8f0] to categorize patients by symptom burden and exacerbation risk, guiding therapy selection [^db17c630]. Evaluate **comorbidities** — including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, anxiety/depression, and lung cancer — because they affect outcomes and management [^1c83303e].

---

## Pharmacologic management

### Stable COPD

- **Initial therapy**: Start with a LAMA or LABA for symptomatic patients [^notfound]; prefer LAMA/LABA dual therapy for persistent dyspnea or exercise intolerance [^c4f741de].
- **Triple therapy**: Add ICS only for frequent exacerbations (≥ 2/year or ≥ 1 hospitalization) or asthma features [^273e1640] [^fabab145].
- **Roflumilast**: Consider for severe COPD with chronic bronchitis and frequent exacerbations [^adf0237a].
- **Avoid**: LABA/ICS without LAMA in COPD without asthma features [^a2a683c1].

---

### Acute exacerbations

- **Bronchodilators**: Short-acting bronchodilators are first-line [^notfound].
- **Corticosteroids**: Systemic corticosteroids reduce relapse and improve recovery [^notfound].
- **Antibiotics**: Use when sputum purulence, increased dyspnea, or infection signs are present [^notfound].
- **Noninvasive ventilation**: For acute respiratory failure, improves gas exchange and reduces intubation [^d99d1768].

---

## Non-pharmacologic management

- **Smoking cessation**: Most effective intervention to slow progression [^d6611f5c].
- **Vaccination**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines recommended [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and quality of life [^52ee416d].
- **Oxygen therapy**: For chronic hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88%) [^52ee416d].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regularly reassess **symptoms, exacerbations, and lung function** to guide therapy adjustments [^ddd5bdb4]. Emphasize **shared decision-making** to align treatment with patient preferences and goals [^601f56c6].

---

## Special considerations

In COPD with **asthma features**, include ICS in the regimen [^273e1640]. For **end-of-life care**, integrate palliative approaches and advance care planning [^843768a3].

---

The GOLD guidelines provide a **comprehensive, evidence-based framework** for COPD management, emphasizing individualized care, regular reassessment, and shared decision-making to optimize outcomes [^601f56c6].

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^22664f95]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a06ec887]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^0aac7041]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was developed recently to unify international efforts in the management of the disease. The most important GOLD objective is raising awareness that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an increasing health problem. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, named "Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD", based on best-validated evidence and current pathogenetic and clinical knowledge. It encourages implementation of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management of the disease in all countries, and emphasizes the importance of renewed research initiatives.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive lung disease 2017 report. GOLD executive summary [^2d17ee22]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This Executive Summary of the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017 report focuses primarily on the revised and novel parts of the document. The most significant changes include: (1) the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been refined to separate the spirometric assessment from symptom evaluation. ABCD groups are now proposed to be derived exclusively from patient symptoms and their history of exacerbations; (2) for each of the groups A to D, escalation strategies for pharmacologic treatments are proposed; (3) the concept of deescalation of therapy is introduced in the treatment assessment scheme; (4) nonpharmacologic therapies are comprehensively presented; and (5) the importance of comorbid conditions in managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is reviewed.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^7f8b26f2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a major public health problem. It is the fourth leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality in the United States, and is projected to rank fifth in 2020 in burden of disease worldwide, according to a study published by the World Bank/World Health Organization. Yet, COPD remains relatively unknown or ignored by the public as well as public health and government officials. In 1998, in an effort to bring more attention to COPD, its management, and its prevention, a committed group of scientists encouraged the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization to form the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). Among the important objectives of GOLD are to increase awareness of COPD and to help the millions of people who suffer from this disease and die prematurely of it or its complications. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, published in 2001. The present, newly revised document follows the same format as the original consensus report, but has been updated to reflect the many publications on COPD that have appeared. GOLD national leaders, a network of international experts, have initiated investigations of the causes and prevalence of COPD in their countries, and developed innovative approaches for the dissemination and implementation of COPD management guidelines. We appreciate the enormous amount of work the GOLD national leaders have done on behalf of their patients with COPD. Despite the achievements in the 5 years since the GOLD report was originally published, considerable additional work is ahead of us if we are to control this major public health problem. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of governments, public health officials, health care workers, and the general public, but a concerted effort by all involved in health care will be necessary.

### Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^011efcbc]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacts a heavy toll on society, yet its prevention, diagnosis and treatment receives inadequate attention from both the medical community and from society at large. Guidelines released in 2001 from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are aimed at redressing this inequity. In this review, we integrate information from the GOLD guidelines with recent updates on the prevention, treatment and management as related specifically to the most severe form of this disease. In order to help distinguish COPD from other disorders that may mimic or confound its treatment, we place particular emphasis on the definition, underlying pathophysiology and diagnosis of COPD. In addition, we discuss future directions in pharmacotherapy.

### Outpatient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: going for the GOLD [^df4d49a8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with a burden of $50 billion in direct health care costs. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines airflow obstruction as spirometry where the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second to forced vital capacity after bronchodilation is less than 0.70. The guidelines also provided graded recommendations on current therapy for COPD. Treatment can be guided based on severity of disease and severity of symptoms. We review the GOLD guidelines to provide an overview of treatment modalities aimed at improving lung function, reducing hospitalization, and reducing mortality.

### Guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment and issues of implementation [^b46bce08]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment advances over the last decade, although limited, have precipitated the development of clinical practice guidelines, with the aim of improving the quality of care received by patients through fostering evidence-based decision making and accelerating the application of new advances to everyday practice. Of the COPD guidelines that have been developed, those developed through the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), initially a joint activity between the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom have both published their methods for evaluation of evidence. These comprehensive guidelines cover all aspects of the disease, with the aim of providing the basis for local care pathways. The guideline development process includes evaluation of the evidence, development of the guideline, and dissemination of the findings. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have focused on improving the methods and approaches to implementation, which requires an appreciation of the issues that stop translation of guideline definitions of best practice into improved patient care. A variety of questions remain unanswered in the clinical management of COPD, including the definition of outcome measures that move beyond lung function, the potential application of multidimensional grading systems that assess respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD and that could possibly better categorize and predict outcome in these patients, and the impact of new clinical trial findings. Large ongoing outcome studies may also have an effect on defining best practice within future guideline recommendations.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review and comparison of current resources [^eeb5b207]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the assessment and management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were published 30 years ago. These and subsequent CPGs issued by professional societies and other groups prior to 2000 were consensus recommendations based on expert opinion and available studies, and they have been criticized for being inconsistent and not explicitly evidence-based. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, released the first of a new generation of rigorous, evidence-based COPD guidelines in 2001. Since that time several other CPGs, notably those developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and by the British National Collaborating Center for Chronic Conditions and Institute for Clinical Excellence, have also become available. While previous COPD guidelines had different severity-grading systems and differed in their therapy recommendations, the new CPGs are remarkably consistent and have very few areas of clinically relevant discrepancy. All are available free via the Internet, provide for regular revision and updating, and include materials for patients and the public, as well as for health-care providers. Although the GOLD and ATS-ERS guidelines both have international authorship and are intended for worldwide use, implementation of many of their recommendations (such as the requirement for spirometry in diagnosis and staging, an escalating management scheme that includes expensive inhaled medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration for lung-volume reduction surgery) remains beyond the reach of many patients and health care systems.

### An update on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2017 guidelines with a focus on classification and management of stable COPD [^679beea1]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines offer important changes to the assessment and management of stable COPD of importance to practitioners, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, and nurses who care for patients with COPD. Therapies are now chosen based on the burden of symptoms and the history of COPD exacerbations, and inhaler regimens are modifiable based on continual clinical reassessment. Although identifying the degree of airway obstruction remains important for informing the clinical status of the patient with COPD, FEV 1 is no longer used to direct the therapeutic approach. Therapies and modes of inhaled medication delivery for each GOLD grouping have been modified and reflect the need for reevaluation of patient symptoms and COPD exacerbation history as an indicator to add or withdraw therapies. As the knowledge of this important disease continues to expand, exacerbation and symptom prevention in patients with stable COPD will remain as an important target of COPD therapies and research. Novel drug combinations and delivery devices are sure to positively affect the practitioner's approach to patients with stable COPD. The new 2017 GOLD guidelines represent a step toward personalized care of the patient with COPD.

### The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report and practice implications for the respiratory therapist [^819d3f86]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

Since 1998, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has worked with health care professionals, medical researchers, and public health officials around the world to optimize the prevention, treatment, and management of COPD. GOLD has continually worked to ensure COPD management strategy recommendations are aligned with current published research. The 2017 GOLD report represents a major revision to GOLD strategy guidelines, the first such major revision in the last 5 years. As such, the 2017 report has significant implications for the diagnosis of COPD, the management of stable disease, and the treatment of exacerbations. As respiratory therapists (RTs) are front-line clinical professionals throughout the COPD continuum of care, a thorough understanding of the new GOLD recommendations for practice is critical. New recommendations regarding diagnosis, severity assessment, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of COPD are presented, and suggestions for how RTs can integrate these recommendations into COPD care practices are provided.

### The 2007 GOLD guidelines: a comprehensive care framework [^0424f736]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Comprehensive management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes proper assessment, monitoring of disease, reduction of risk factors, the management of stable COPD, and the prevention and management of exacerbations. The 2007 COPD guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease address each of these aspects of COPD management in detail and provide evidence-based recommendations for patients and health-care professionals. Reduction of risk factors emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation and control of environmental indoor and outdoor pollutants. The management of COPD must be individualized. Aerosol administration of bronchodilators is the most effective method of reducing the work of breathing and alleviating dyspnea. Glucocorticosteroid therapy is recommended to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve health-related quality of life for patients with stage 3 and 4 COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation proves effective in relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing patients' physical and emotional participation in activities of daily life. Oxygen therapy is essential for patients with substantial hypoxia. Patients with COPD and respiratory failure may benefit from noninvasive ventilation. Surgery may play a limited role in the management of selected patients with COPD. Since exacerbations influence lung function and clinical decline in patients with COPD and contribute to the cost of caring for this disease, efforts must be directed at prevention and management of exacerbations. In addition to controlled oxygen therapy, antimicrobials, brief courses of systemic corticosteroids and, on occasion, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation may play a role. The role of respiratory therapists in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of stable COPD and exacerbations is absolutely essential if the goals of the 2007 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines are to be attained.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^27196cb6]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to the high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, some important controversies in COPD management still exist. The classic way to define COPD has been based on spirometric criteria, but more relevant diagnostic methods are needed that can be used to describe COPD severity and comorbidity. Initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease to slow disease progression is debatable, there are many controversies about the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of COPD, and long-term antibiotics for prevention of exacerbation have had a resurgence in interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimum management of the acute COPD exacerbation. COPD is a complex disease and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that in future will guide its management.

### Preventing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: what is known and what needs to be done to make a difference to the patient? [^280ff31e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable systemic disease with symptoms that overlap other respiratory illnesses. An estimated 24 million adults in the United States have COPD, but > 50% of them are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Spirometry remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing COPD and for monitoring the progression of the disease. Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD; therefore, smoking cessation is an integral component of any program to reduce COPD risk and delay or limit the progression of airflow obstruction. Influenza vaccinations will also reduce acute respiratory illness in patients with COPD. With increasing awareness of COPD and earlier diagnosis, implementation of treatment guidelines and smoking-cessation efforts may lead to more effective management of this disease, which is projected to be the third leading cause of death in the United States by 2020.

### Adherence to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines in the real world: current understanding, barriers, and solutions [^90c75fbb]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides a comprehensive review and guidance for clinicians managing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, adherence to GOLD guidelines has been suboptimal over the years. The current review summarizes the current body of literature addressing the multitude of reasons for the lack of adherence to GOLD guidelines in clinical practice.

Recent Findings

There continue to be several reasons for suboptimal adoption of GOLD guidelines in clinical practice. A primary and recurrent theme appears to be both delayed as well as missed diagnosis of COPD. There are several reasons for this including lack of awareness about current COPD guidelines, lack of availability as well as utilization of office spirometry and improper symptom assessment. Other issues include improper selection of proper pharmacotherapy options, misdiagnosis/mislabeling of COPD phenotypes, lack of smoking cessation counselling as well as enrollment in pulmonary rehabilitation. Potential solutions include adoption of clinical decision support systems, self-care models and careful phenotyping of COPD patients.

Summary

There are currently several barriers for the adoption of GOLD guidelines into routine clinical practice. These barriers are all amenable to systematic solutions that will increase adherence to current GOLD guidelines.

### Systematic assessment of clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^4eca7b6e]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically evaluate the quality of the development of guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Methodology

MEDLINE and Excerpta Medica search for published guidelines, followed by independent evaluation by two reviewers, according to previously reported guideline development quality criteria, on a three-point scale.

Results

Five national COPD guidelines and two international COPD guidelines were retrieved. Reviewers demonstrated good inter-observer agreement in assessing the 10 combined guideline development criteria for the seven guidelines [kappa = 0.66]. Guidelines were only partly multi-disciplinary with little or no consumer input, were up to 48 pages in length, and often lacked practical summaries or management flow charts which could have facilitated retrieval of key management recommendations. Almost all the papers were based upon a consensus approach, rather than evidence based, and methods of resolution of differences of opinion were not stated. Patient outcomes, ethical and medico-legal implications were not addressed and six of the guidelines were sponsored directly or indirectly by a single drug company.

Conclusions

In spite of COPD guidelines being reported by major national bodies for over a decade now, most fail to meet important criteria for high-quality guideline development, and evaluation of clinical impact remains undetermined.

Background

The ultimate treatment goals in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management remain uniform across the majority of national and international COPD clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), and include reduced symptoms, reduced exacerbation risk and improved quality of life. To achieve these goals, CPGs require regular updates with recent and relevant state-of-the-art medical and scientific developments. Guidelines strive to improve the quality of healthcare and to reduce variations in the treatment and management of COPD.

Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on patient management based on available evidence and, in certain cases, educated opinion where there is no direct evidence available. The quality of the available evidence and the intended audience of CPGs remain core considerations for their development. In recent years, CPGs have further evolved in response to an increasing recognition of the need for more stringent, systematic approaches when recommending specific therapeutic interventions or strategies. The importance of rigorous processes to ensure that only accurate and appropriate treatment recommendations are made is now well-accepted among professional scientific societies. In fact, standards to guide the preparation of CPGs are now available. However, little attention is afforded to the challenges and pitfalls associated with the development of such documents.

A concerted effort between multiple stakeholders is needed to ensure precise, practical and up-to-date clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal management of COPD. Guidelines must be locally relevant; therefore local expert stakeholders should offer local proposals, while referring to global evidence-based documents.

This review article highlights the challenges associated with the development and implementation of national CPGs for COPD in Europe and Russia.

### Contemporary management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease… [^52ee416d]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

An inhaled corticosteroid, either alone or more commonly in combination with a long-acting bronchodilator, can further reduce exacerbations and improve the health status of these patients. Furthermore, patients with severe COPD, particularly those who are debilitated, should be considered for pulmonary rehabilitation because these programs have been proven useful in maintaining, or in some cases improving, health status for these patients. Finally, correction of resting arterial hypoxemia with oxygen therapy for more than 15 h/d prolongs survival of COPD patients for those with a resting PaO2 lower than 55 to 60 mm Hg. Once a clinical diagnosis of COPD is made, its severity can be determined, in part, by the patient's postbronchodilator FEV1 values. NHLBI/WHO Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Criteria1 Stage 0: normal lung function Stage 1: FEV1 ≥ 80% of predicted Stage 2: 50% to 79% of predicted Stage 3: 30% to 49% of predicted.

In general, long-term administration of oxygen should be reserved for individuals with COPD who have arterial hypoxemia, or a PaO2 between 55 and 60 mm Hg with evidence of pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, or secondary erythrocytosis. Besides long-acting bronchodilators for symptom control, a growing body of evidence shows that inhaled corticosteroids are beneficial for COPD patients who have an FEV1 of less than 2. 0 L by reducing the rate of acute exacerbations. As well, the use of combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-agonists has been shown to reduce the rate of acute exacerbations compared with monotherapy with these products. The choice of therapy for this patient would be to change one or both short-acting bronchodilators to a long-acting preparation and to add an inhaled corticosteroid to further reduce the rate of acute exacerbation.

Moreover, if she is physically well enough, this patient should be enrolled in a comprehensive, multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program, which includes individualized exercise training, nutrition counseling, and education. With such a program, she can expect improvements in exercise tolerance and a reduction in symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines in Europe: a look into the future [^cee1f3bc]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

There is potential for significant alleviation of time and budget constraints through a concerted, collaborative effort between European countries. Who should take the lead during such a collaboration remains to be discussed, but it is likely that the European Respiratory Society (ERS) is in the best position to lead such a project. The ERS is committed to the development of high quality CPGs, and either alone or in concert with sister societies such as the American Thoracic Society (ATS), has also delivered evidence-based CPGs for the management of COPD. Developing a European collaboration would be best achieved through the ERS and national societies, agreeing on a common methodology. Tight links with the GOLD group could also be useful to share retrieved evidence and increase reactivity, allowing a continuous update and adaptation process.

Can COPD guidelines be simplified?

There is an apparent contradiction between the exponential increase in the scientific knowledge of COPD complexity (phenotypes, endotypes, comorbidities etc.) and the need for simplified treatment pathways. Complex raw data needs to be aggregated and translated into meaningful, useful information to support recommendations of new treatments. Algorithms may be helpful to guide COPD therapy in a simple, stepwise and coordinated manner. Such algorithms need to be flexible and continuously evolving in order to remain up-to-date and clinically relevant. Importantly, the availability of algorithms does not negate the need for scientific principles, and the role of clinical judgement should always be acknowledged.

Implications of Strong and Conditional Recommendations: From the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group

The target audience for this guideline includes specialists in respiratory medicine. However, given that COPD is a common condition, primary care physicians, internists, other healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers may also find benefit from these recommendations.

Although the panel used a systematic approach and the best available evidence to develop this guideline, it is important to note that study participants in many clinical trials may not reflect all populations. Specifically, patients older than 80 years, those with multiple chronic conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma are rarely represented in clinical trials. We recommend that for all clinical management decisions, the patient and the healthcare provider should engage in a shared decision-making process.

For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the worry of developing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as well as the effects of the pandemic on the basic functions of society and/or social services pertaining to their health imposes additional stressors to their condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has made routine management and diagnosis of COPD more difficult as a result of reductions in face-to-face consultations, difficulties in performing spirometry, and limitations in traditional pulmonary rehabilitation and home care programs. Patients have also faced shortages of medication.

The dramatic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been accompanied by an enormous number of publications on the virus and its consequences. The statements made in this report (Table 1) use the published Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) approach to data review and should be seen as provisional based on the best assessment of the current evidence, including papers published or available up to the September 11, 2020. As new evidence emerges, this report will be updated at regular intervals, and updates will be posted on the GOLD website.

### Guidance for the better care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^88ab387f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Writing guidelines is hard work. At first sight, it seems simple to summarize what you believe to be optimal care, but beliefs should be based on evidence, and that can be hard to identify in an unbiased way. To reduce the risk of bias when preparing guidelines, a range of complex methodologies have been developed. Documents such as the standards of care for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society in 2004 would not be methodologically acceptable today. The newer approach has narrowed the scope of the guidance offered, improving the certainty of the conclusions drawn at the cost of restricting the number of questions addressed. Although there have been moves in the guidelines community to open up the types of evidence considered, most published guidelines try to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that offer evidence directly or indirectly with which the guideline writers can address the clinical question they are trying to understand. Limiting acceptable answers to questions for which RCT evidence is present can lead to some strange anomalies, as we found when writing the European Respiratory Society/ATS guidance about the management of acute exacerbations of COPD. Although observational studies suggested that stopping smoking had a beneficial on exacerbation numbers, we could not make a recommendation about this, because no RCT to test this idea was ethically possible! However, there are still questions to consider for which RCT data can provide answers, even in a well-worked area such as COPD care, and this was the challenge taken up by a group of North American and British physicians (pp.) who developed the clinical practice guideline on the pharmacologic management of COPD published in this issue of the Journal.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1dce09fb]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

GOLD 2025 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) report methodology — program history, update cycle, search strategy, and review process are specified as follows: The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) program was initiated in 1998; the first report was issued in 2001; complete revisions were prepared in 2006 and 2011; and the GOLD Science Committee was established in 2002 to review research and to post yearly updates. This 2025 GOLD Report is the second update of the 2023-revised report, and the 2023 GOLD Report was the 5th major revision. Updates of the 2017-revised report were made in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022; updates of the 2011-revised report were released in January 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Evidence identification used a PubMed search with Committee-defined fields: 1) COPD or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (All Fields) AND 2) Clinical Trials or Meta-analysis (All Fields) OR 3) articles in the top 20 medical or respiratory journals (available on request) or The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; publications not captured by the search could be submitted in English. Each abstract is assigned to two unbiased Committee members, and reviewers answer four specific written questions to assess impact on recommendations and identify modifications; the GOLD Science Committee meets twice yearly to discuss potentially impactful publications, the full Committee reaches a consensus on inclusion or change to the report, and in the absence of consensus disagreements are decided by an open vote of the full Committee.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^da2744ac]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Introduction — global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) states that the GOLD Report provides a non-biased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of people with COPD, with treatment objectives organized into two groups that relieve and reduce the impact of symptoms and reduce the risk of adverse health events in the future. The original FEV1-based staging system is described, but at an individual level FEV1 alone is an unreliable marker of the severity of breathlessness, exercise limitation, health status impairment, and risk of exacerbation. The report highlights that there are simple and reliable questionnaires designed for routine clinical practice, enabling an assessment system that draws together the impact of symptoms and the patient's risk of a serious adverse health event and can be used in any clinical setting anywhere in the world to move COPD treatment toward individualized medicine.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management — aims, assessment, and therapy review: The aim of COPD management is to reduce symptoms and future risk, COPD patients should have an assessment of the severity of their airflow obstruction, symptoms, history of exacerbations, exposure to risk factors and comorbidities to guide management, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy should be adjusted as necessary with further reviews undertaken.

### Clinical course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: review of therapeutic interventions [^d6611f5c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease in which patients experience a progressive decline in lung function. Based on clinical evidence, the management of COPD should focus on (1) earlier diagnosis; (2) risk reduction through smoking cessation, decreased exposure to inhaled irritants, and immunization against respiratory pathogens; (3) symptom reduction with pharmacotherapy and pulmonary rehabilitation; (4) decreasing complications by reducing exacerbations and improving pulmonary function; and (5) improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Smoking cessation has been shown to slow lung function decline and to reduce mortality — including deaths due to lung cancer, other respiratory disease (including COPD), and cardiovascular disease. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines advocate interventions according to the severity of COPD and recommend initiation of maintenance long-acting bronchodilator therapy in patients with moderate disease. However, recent evidence from a post hoc analysis of randomized controlled trials of tiotropium suggests that initiation of long-acting bronchodilator therapy at earlier stages of disease may also provide improvements in lung function and HRQOL. The results of ongoing long-term studies may soon provide evidence that in addition to relieving symptoms and improving patient HRQOL, specific pharmacologic therapies may also alter the clinical course of COPD.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^15d20ad4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: This document provides clinical recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It represents a collaborative effort on the part of a panel of expert COPD clinicians and researchers along with a team of methodologists under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society. Methods: Comprehensive evidence syntheses were performed on all relevant studies that addressed the clinical questions and critical patient-centered outcomes agreed upon by the panel of experts. The evidence was appraised, rated, and graded, and recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: After weighing the quality of evidence and balancing the desirable and undesirable effects, the guideline panel made the following recommendations: 1) a strong recommendation for the use of long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance; 2) a conditional recommendation for the use of triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance who have experienced one or more exacerbations in the past year; 3) a conditional recommendation for ICS withdrawal for patients with COPD receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year; 4) no recommendation for or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization, for whom ICS is conditionally recommended as an additive therapy; 5) a conditional recommendation against the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids in patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations; and 6) a conditional recommendation for opioid-based therapy in patients with COPD who experience advanced refractory dyspnea despite otherwise optimal therapy. Conclusions: The task force made recommendations regarding the pharmacologic treatment of COPD based on currently available evidence. Additional research in populations that are underrepresented in clinical trials is needed, including studies in patients with COPD 80 years of age and older, those with multiple chronic health conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma.

### Global initiative for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive lung disease. the 2020 GOLD science committee report on COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^bde7aacd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised many questions about the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and whether modifications of their therapy are required. It has raised questions about recognizing and differentiating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Science Committee used established methods for literature review to present an overview of the management of patients with COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether patients with COPD are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high community prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should only be used when it is essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. Patients with COPD should follow basic infection control measures, including social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask or face covering. Patients should remain up to date with appropriate vaccinations, particularly annual influenza vaccination. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an acute COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung strategy in patients with COPD and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients who developed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual COPD protocols. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

### Nonmedical therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^bbb2ec64]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a category of diseases with chronic airflow obstruction and hyperinflation. The GOLD committee and the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society have published detailed, evidence-based reviews of management, providing stepped-care algorithms for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy. Over the past several decades, this has led to numerous nonpharmacologic approaches to ameliorate symptoms in these patients.

### Treatment of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the GOLD guidelines [^6ae90a50]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common problem in primary care. COPD is diagnosed with spirometry only in clinically stable patients with a postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio of less than 0.70. All patients with COPD who smoke should be counseled about smoking cessation. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are recommended for all patients with COPD. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease assigns patients with COPD into four groups based on the degree of airflow restriction, symptom score, and number of exacerbations in one year. Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended for patients in groups B, C, and D. Those in group A should receive a short-acting anticholinergic or short-acting beta2 agonist for mild intermittent symptoms. For patients in group B, long-acting anticholinergics or long-acting beta2 agonists should be added. Patients in group C or D are at high risk of exacerbations and should receive a long-acting anticholinergic or a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2 agonist. For patients whose symptoms are not controlled with one of these regimens, triple therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting beta2 agonist, and anticholinergic should be considered. Prophylactic antibiotics and oral corticosteroids are not recommended for prevention of COPD exacerbations. Continuous oxygen therapy improves mortality rates in patients with severe hypoxemia and COPD. Lung volume reduction surgery can improve survival rates in patients with severe, upper lobe-predominant COPD with heterogeneous emphysema distribution.

Conclusions

Evidence-based CPGs are rigorous by their very nature, but are difficult to implement in real-life clinical practice. Some suggestions for improvement in the development and implementation of COPD CPGs are presented in Table 2. The authors suggest that an ideal COPD guideline document should comprise a fair balance between evidence-based and expert opinion-based recommendations where definitive evidence is unavailable. For transparency, each recommendation should clearly state whether it is supported by evidence or based on expert opinion and clinical judgement.

Table 2
Suggestions for improvement in the development and implementation of COPD guidelines

The key target medical audience of COPD guidelines include pulmonologists and GPs, with patients, payors and policy-makers also comprising the intended audience. All end-users should be involved in the development of guidelines. Formally assessing what they expect from the guidelines and which barriers may impede their implementation could help overcome current insufficiencies in routine care for COPD patients.

Some guideline developers struggle to provide the necessary resources to support the development and/or regular update of their guidelines. Furthermore, it is possible that not all aspects of international guidelines will be directly relevant to all local patients. In this regard, improved collaboration between European countries and the ERS may be beneficial, where a single intermediary strategy document for the management of COPD should be considered. This document could encompass some overarching high-level common principles, with the important opportunity for local adaptation. This may significantly reduce the costs and resources associated with guideline development for many countries.

Although the majority of COPD management is conducted by GPs, familiarity of guidelines amongst general practitioners is suboptimal. Approximately 24% of general practitioners have reported that they are not familiar with the GOLD strategy for COPD.

Quick and easy access to guidelines on a website or smart phone is important to maximise guideline implementation. A quickly- and easily-understandable treatment algorithm may help to simplify COPD guidelines. The algorithm must be flexible and continually evolving in accordance with new research and evidence.

There is still a paucity of knowledge on the effect of adequate COPD guideline implementation on disease management and patient outcomes. Further studies are warranted to address this gap in the literature.

Evolving COPD guidelines

2011 saw a substantial revision of the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for diagnosis, management, and prevention of COPD, which has recently been updated. Recommendations for treatment are no longer based primarily on categorization ("staging") by spirometric assessment, but on categorization by existing symptoms (using validated modified Medical Research Council and COPD Assessment Test questionnaires) and risk (based on severity of airflow limitation and history of exacerbations). This approach acknowledges the importance of consideration of both short- and long-term outcomes when making treatment decisions (Figure 1).

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^57956459]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In developing this guideline, we performed a rigorous, PICO-driven distillation of the scientific evidence to provide recommendations pertaining to key questions regarding the pharmacologic treatment of COPD. We hope that clinicians and researchers will find this guideline useful; however, it is important to apply these recommendations along with clinical assessments and shared decision-making to ensure that patients receive optimal clinical care. We also recognize that slowing the progression of disease and improving mortality are important goals of therapy; however, pharmacotherapy has not definitely been proven to affect these outcomes. Improvements in COPD mortality and disease progression have thus far only been achieved through smoking cessation.

The panel recognizes that there are limitations to this clinical practice guideline. The recommendations were based on the available scientific evidence. In many cases, the available clinical trials did not include certain COPD populations, such as patients over 80 years of age, those with chronic comorbid conditions, and those with COPD/asthma overlap. In addition, the available evidence did not risk stratify patients with exacerbations or those with eosinophilia. It is also important to note that the panel did not include patient representatives or family/caregiver representatives. Their participation might have been important in prioritizing clinical outcomes.

Many questions remain regarding the optimal pharmacologic therapy for patients with varying risks of exacerbations and varying levels of eosinophilia, as well as potentially different responses to medication among current and former smokers. We hope that the research priorities outlined in this document will prompt new research to identify more specific patient profiles and enable personalized, patient-centered care.

### Meeting the GOLD standard: COPD treatment in the UK today [^ab9cbe0c]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Since its first report almost 20 years ago, the Global initiative in chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has had a major effect on COPD management. The GOLD system of classifying COPD has been widely adopted both clinically and academically while the regularly updated treatment recommendations has led to their promotion ahead of more formal evidence-based documents like The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. Initially GOLD classified COPD severity by the degree of FEV 1 impairment, but now a more sophisticated (and complex) approach stratifies by symptom intensity (commonly using a cut-point of 2 on the modified MRC dyspnoea scale) and on a history of exacerbations. The resultant 4 × 4 classification of clinical phenotypes from minimal symptoms without exacerbations to severe symptoms and frequent/significant exacerbations is graded A-D and has been linked to both initial and subsequent treatment choices.

Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019, and a large clinical database study indicates the highest magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality in individuals with increased severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD groups B and D, and those with lower FEV1 (particularly GOLD 3 and 4). Demonstrating mortality benefits in randomized controlled trials has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow-up duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow-up, and the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mortality in most trials difficult.

### Real-world effectiveness study of guideline-directed COPD STANDARDized management in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cluster randomised trial design [^2c7c6059]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects the ageing population worldwide. Exacerbations worsen health status and increase health resource use. Existing guidelines recommend disease management, but they are not fully implemented in a clinical setting. Evidence regarding best practice and real-world effectiveness is limited.

Methods and Analysis

A nationwide multicentre clinical effectiveness trial is being performed between 2023 and 2027, involving 99 secondary hospitals in urban and rural areas in China. It is an open-label, adjudicator and assessor-blinded, parallel group, cluster randomised pragmatic trial. Hospitals are randomly allocated to standardised management (SM) or usual care. A total number of 3456 stable patients with COPD who are symptomatic (individuals in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Group B) or have exacerbation risk (individuals with one moderate exacerbation history in Group A and individuals in Group E) using GOLD 2023 ABE classification will be enrolled. In the SM group, an integrated intervention comprising five components will be delivered using a physician and nurse model. These are: (1) long-term inhaled maintenance therapy, (2) periodic inhaler technique assessment and symptom monitoring, (3) annual pulmonary function testing, (4) COPD education session and (5) health behaviour adoption (smoking cessation, vaccination, pulmonary rehabilitation). In the control group, patients will receive routine care. The primary goal is to assess the real-world effectiveness of guideline-directed disease management on exacerbation prevention, with moderate-to-severe exacerbation as the primary outcome and hospital admission, mortality, health status and COPD self-management as secondary outcomes. It is the first pragmatic trial undertaken of this form in a developing country. It is anticipated that it will provide a feasible and effective COPD management model that can inform guidelines and be rolled out into secondary and primary care, with modification, to ensure standardised COPD care nationwide.

### The adherence to and utility of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines for treating COPD among pulmonary specialists: a retrospective analysis [^27cb704d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the evidence-based guidelines promoted by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), the overuse of prescription drugs to manage COPD, particularly inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), remains a persistent challenge. In this real-world study, we evaluated how patients with COPD were divided into ABCD groups based on the 2017 GOLD guidelines, determined the rate of adherence to the GOLD treatment recommendations, described the rate of ICS usage, and determined the rate of triple therapy (TT) prescription.

Methods

The charts of 2291 patients diagnosed with COPD were retrospectively analyzed, of which 1438 matched the eligibility criteria.

Results

The average patient age was 69.6 ± 10.9 years; 52% of patients were female. The average COPD assessment test (CAT) score was 18.3 ± 9.1. The ABCD breakdown was as follows: group A 19.5%, group B 64.1%, group C 1.8%, and group D 14.6%. All groups, except group D, showed discordance in COPD treatment relative to the proposed GOLD guidelines. Only 18.9% of group A and 26% of group B were treated in concordance with the guidelines. TT was primarily used in group D (63.3%) and overused in groups A (30.6%) and B (47.8%). ICS was overused in all groups, particularly in groups A (56.2%) and B (67.3%).

Conclusion

Studies from the last decade have consistently revealed a lack of conformity between what physicians prescribe and what GOLD guidelines recommend. The excessive usage of ICS, which continues despite all the associated adverse effects and the attributable costs, is concerning. The awareness of GOLD guidelines among primary care physicians (PCPs) and respiratory specialists needs to be improved.

### Guideline adherence in management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a3dc0297]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the only leading cause of death with rising morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to optimize pharmacotherapy for patients with COPD have been updated based on promising results of randomized clinical trials. We examined the frequency of and factors associated with guideline adherence by physicians in clinical practice at an academic medical center.

Methods

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, confirmed by spirometry, who presented to the ambulatory clinics, were enrolled. The primary outcome was provider's adherence to the 2007 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. Subjects were categorized as guideline-concordant who received a rescue inhaler (all patients), or at least one long-acting bronchodilator (stage II), or at least one long-acting bronchodilator plus an inhaled corticosteroid (stage III-IV). Demographics, clinical information and type of provider were recorded. Provider type was classified as primary care physician (PCP), pulmonologist, or co-management by both.

Results

Among 450 subjects who met study criteria, 246 (54.7%) received guideline-concordant treatment. Age, sex, race, disease severity, and co-morbidities were not associated with guideline adherence. Multivariate analysis showed that patients co-managed by a PCP and pulmonologist had a higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than those managed by one or the other (Odds Ratio: 4.59; 95% Confidence Interval: 2.92, 7.22, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Just over half of stable COPD patients receive guideline-concordant care. Co-management by a PCP and pulmonologist increases the likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant inhaler therapy.

### The adherence to and utility of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines for treating COPD among pulmonary specialists: a retrospective analysis [^03581b2e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a slowly progressive, inflammatory disease that causes airflow restriction and an irreversible loss of lung function. COPD is becoming increasingly common worldwide due to the rapid aging of the population. Approximately 16 million cases of COPD have been reported in the United States, and COPD is the third leading cause of death in the country. The economic impact of COPD is substantial. The annual per-patient direct medical and hospitalization costs have been reported to be $10,367 and $6852, respectively. A study conducted in 2010 reported that prescription drug costs totaled $472 billion, whereas the total annual US payment for COPD care was $6.6 billion.

Despite evidence-based guidelines published and promoted by the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) science committee, the overuse of prescription drugs in COPD management, particularly the overuse of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at all stages of COPD, remains a persistent challenge. The impact of excessive medication usage on the rising costs of COPD management cannot be overlooked. Although smoking cessation and reducing COPD exacerbations significantly limit the increasing costs, the appropriate use of inhalers in this population would also reduce expenses. Primary care physicians (PCPs) in many countries have been accused of overprescribing ICS. Moreover, this prescription pattern is not restricted to PCPs only. Safka et al. conducted their research in a respiratory department of an academic center in Canada. They discovered that 26.8% of the patients in GOLD group A received triple therapy (TT) and that 42.6% in GOLD group B likewise received TT.

The aim of this study was to describe the distribution of COPD in a nonacademic pulmonary specialty practice and to determine the adherence to the COPD GOLD 2017 recommendations.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to (1) determine how patients with COPD are divided into ABCD groups using the 2017 GOLD guidelines and (2) assess adherence to the 2017 GOLD recommendations.

### Triple therapy in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^65852dbf]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents one of the most important public health challenges because of its high prevalence and related disability and mortality. Management of COPD mainly relies on inhaled drugs, including inhaled corticosteroids, long acting β2 adrenoceptor agonists (LABA), and long acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMA). Pharmacological management of COPD tends to begin with monotherapy, and step up to dual or triple therapy, as necessary, to control symptoms.

The Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) management strategy recommend triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, LABA, and LAMA for GOLD group D patients who develop further exacerbations after receiving initial dual treatment of LABA and LAMA. Triple therapy using multiple inhalers has been shown to improve forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and health status, but evidence of triple therapy versus dual therapy for preventing exacerbations is not well documented in previous meta-analyses. Recently, several recent large randomised controlled trials have also assessed the efficacy and safety of triple therapy using one fixed dose combination inhaler for patients with COPD at increased exacerbation risk. These studies showed similar results, but no meta-analysis including these trials has been published so far to our knowledge.

Consideration of triple therapy for COPD is common in current clinical practice, and the writers of the GOLD guideline stressed the need for research on this matter. Therefore, in the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to examine eligible randomised controlled trials assessing the effect of triple inhaled therapy on the risk of exacerbation, and to obtain more comprehensive, accurate, and precise results about this effect.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^e8ae03c3]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up pharmacological treatment (Figure 3.9) presents suggested escalation and de-escalation strategies based on available efficacy and safety data and can be applied to any patient already taking maintenance treatment(s) irrespective of the GOLD group allocated at treatment initiation. The response to treatment escalation should always be reviewed, and when treatment modification, in particular de-escalation, is considered, patients should be under close medical supervision. The report notes that treatment escalation has not been systematically tested and that trials of de-escalation are limited and only include ICS. If response to initial treatment is appropriate, maintain it; if not, check adherence, inhaler technique and possible interfering comorbidities, evaluate whether dyspnea/activity limitation or prevention of exacerbations is the predominant treatable trait, use the exacerbation pathway if both need to be targeted, then select the corresponding algorithm and identify the box matching the current treatment to follow the suggested algorithm.

### European hospital adherence to GOLD recommendations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation admissions [^e42925da]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Understanding how European care of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admissions vary against guideline standards provides an opportunity to target appropriate quality improvement interventions. In 2010–2011 an audit of care against the 2010 'Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease' (GOLD) standards was performed in 16 018 patients from 384 hospitals in 13 countries. Clinicians prospectively identified consecutive COPD admissions over a period of 8 weeks, recording clinical care measures on a web-based data tool. Data were analysed comparing adherence to 10 key management recommendations. Adherence varied between hospitals and across countries. The lack of available spirometry results and variable use of oxygen and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) are high impact areas identified for improvement.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines in Europe: a look into the future [^9c0a07d9]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

A standardised pan-European guideline; is this realistic?

Duplicate efforts are made across Europe, with individual countries investing significant resources into the development of CPGs. Institutional collaboration and consolidation of efforts may significantly reduce the cumbersome nature of guideline development and frequent updates. Furthermore, variations in individual sets of guidelines will inevitably continue unless collaboration is encouraged and optimised between countries. These variations, however minor, have the potential to mislead or confuse practicing healthcare professionals.

Most national guidelines in Europe have been influenced to varying extents by GOLD. Moreover, GOLD 2017 will likely impact future revisions of European national guidelines in a move towards more personalised treatment of COPD. The GOLD strategy also carries a major positive advantage in that the document is updated annually with the most recent and relevant literature and studies; however, no formal evaluation of evidence (i.e. GRADE or similar) is performed. In addition, since by its definition, GOLD aims to provide a global strategy document, some recommendations may not be directly (i.e. without any adaptation) applicable in some areas or contexts. As most countries do not have the resources to facilitate an annual update to their national guidelines, each country has the opportunity to adopt specific sections of GOLD that are locally relevant. Such processes could be facilitated by tighter collaboration between GOLD committees and regional, national or local initiatives.

Owing to the importance of national guidelines, coupled with the international availability of the GOLD 2017 document, there may be potential for the development of an intermediary document between the two. This could comprise a single detailed "umbrella" evidence base supporting common principles but with an adaptation of recommendations to reflect local practices. Individual sensitivities could therefore be facilitated within this common adaptable template. National reimbursement policies, availability of resources and/or regulatory legislation may cause guideline recommendation and prescription deviations between countries. In brief, first-line treatment recommendations (at the class level) and secondary recommendations could be included within the common guideline, with local alternative suggestions added at a local level in line with local policy and scientific societies.

To support the introduction and implementation of a common, adaptable European guideline, a pan-European guideline development resource repository could be compiled as a support tool. Moreover, different sections of a guideline dedicated to a specific healthcare practitioner role may boost implementation across clinical practice.

Prevention and management of COPD — treatment goals and pharmacotherapy: The main treatment goals are to reduce symptoms and future risk of exacerbations, and the management strategy of stable COPD should be predominantly based on the assessment of symptoms and the history of exacerbations. Pharmacotherapy can reduce COPD symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance, and data suggest beneficial effects on rates of lung function decline and mortality. Each pharmacological treatment regimen should be individualized and guided by the severity of symptoms, risk of exacerbations, side-effects, comorbidities, drug availability and cost, and the patient's response, preference, and ability to use various drug delivery devices, and inhaler technique needs to be assessed regularly.

### The clinical management in extremely severe COPD [^9f82c733]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects 6% of the general population and is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States with severe and very severe disease accounting for 15% and 3% of physician diagnoses of COPD. Guidelines make few recommendations regarding providing the provision of care for the most severe stages of disease, namely Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages III and IV with chronic respiratory failure. The effectiveness of inhaled drug therapy in very severe patients has not been assessed yet. Health care systems in many countries include public funding of long-term oxygen therapy for eligible candidates. Currently, there is little evidence for the use of mechanical ventilatory support in the routine management of hypercapnic patients. Pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered as a significant component of therapy, even in the most severe patients. Although Lung Volume Reduction Surgery has been shown to improve mortality, exercise capacity, and quality of life in selected patients, this modality is associated with significant morbidity and an early mortality rate in the most severe patients. Despite significant progress over the past 25 years, both short- and long-term outcomes remain significantly inferior for lung transplantation relative to other "solid" organ recipients. Nutritional assessment and management is an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Morphine may significantly reduce dyspnoea and does not significantly accelerate death. No consistent improvement in dyspnoea over placebo has been shown with anxiolytics. Supplemental oxygen during exercise reduces exertional breathlessness and improves exercise tolerance of the hypoxaemic patient. Non-invasive ventilation has been used as a palliative treatment to reduce dyspnoea. Hypoxaemic COPD patients, on long-term oxygen therapy, may show reduced health-related quality of life, cognitive function, and depression. Only a small proportion of patients with severe COPD discuss end-of-life issues with their physicians.

### Real-world effectiveness study of guideline-directed COPD STANDARDized management in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cluster randomised trial design [^a4339aed]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects the ageing population worldwide. Exacerbations worsen health status and increase health resource use. Existing guidelines recommend disease management, but they are not fully implemented in a clinical setting. Evidence regarding best practice and real-world effectiveness is limited.

Methods and analysis

A nationwide multicentre clinical effectiveness trial is being performed between 2023 and 2027, involving 99 secondary hospitals in urban and rural areas in China. It is an open-label, adjudicator and assessor-blinded, parallel group, cluster randomised pragmatic trial. Hospitals are randomly allocated to standardised management (SM) or usual care. A total number of 3456 stable patients with COPD who are symptomatic (individuals in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Group B) or have exacerbation risk (individuals with one moderate exacerbation history in Group A and individuals in Group E) using GOLD 2023 ABE classification will be enrolled. In the SM group, an integrated intervention comprising five components will be delivered using a physician and nurse model. These are: (1) long-term inhaled maintenance therapy, (2) periodic inhaler technique assessment and symptom monitoring, (3) annual pulmonary function testing, (4) COPD education session and (5) health behaviour adoption (smoking cessation, vaccination, pulmonary rehabilitation). In the control group, patients will receive routine care. The primary goal is to assess the real-world effectiveness of guideline-directed disease management on exacerbation prevention, with moderate-to-severe exacerbation as the primary outcome and hospital admission, mortality, health status and COPD self-management as secondary outcomes. It is the first pragmatic trial undertaken of this form in a developing country. It is anticipated that it will provide a feasible and effective COPD management model that can inform guidelines and be rolled out into secondary and primary care, with modification, to ensure standardised COPD care nationwide.

### Efficacy of non-invasive ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^eac85a5d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant public health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide and imposing a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The diagnosis of COPD involves a comprehensive assessment of symptoms, lung function tests (spirometry), and physical examination. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides guidelines for diagnosis and staging, which inform treatment decisions. According to GOLD criteria, a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio < 0.7 is diagnostic for COPD. Managing COPD requires a multifaceted approach, including pharmacological interventions (such as steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics), pulmonary rehabilitation, and ventilator support. Stable COPD is characterized by a period of time when the patient's symptoms are stable and not experiencing an acute exacerbation. During this period, patients may experience symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, and coughing, but these symptoms are typically manageable with medication and other treatments. Conversely, post-exacerbation COPD (PECOPD) patients are those who have recently experienced an acute exacerbation of COPD and are in the recovery phase. These patients are at increased risk of recurrent exacerbations, hospital readmissions, and mortality, and require careful management to prevent further decline and improve outcomes.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines in Europe: a look into the future [^b055dea5]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are ubiquitous and are developed to provide recommendations for the management of many diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The development of these guidelines is burdensome, demanding a significant investment of time and money. In Europe, the majority of countries develop their own national guidelines, despite the potential for overlap or duplication of effort. A concerted effort and consolidation of resources between countries may alleviate the resource-intensity of maintaining individual national guidelines. Despite significant resource investment into the development and maintenance of clinical practice guidelines, their implementation is suboptimal. Effective strategies of guideline dissemination must be given more consideration, to ensure adequate implementation and improved patient care management in the future.

Conclusions

There is little direct evidence about management of COVID-19 in people with COPD. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion of COVID-19 in patients with COPD presenting with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, and/or any other symptoms that could be COVID-19 related, even if these are mild, and should test for SARS-CoV-2. Patients should keep taking their oral and inhaled respiratory medications for COPD as directed, as there is no evidence that COPD medications should be changed during this COVID-19 pandemic.

Summary of Recommendations

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance, we recommend long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

In patients with COPD who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite dual therapy with LABA/LAMA, we suggest the use of triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

In patients with COPD who are receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA), we suggest that the ICS can be withdrawn if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

We do not make a recommendation for or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization, for whom we suggest ICS as an additive therapy (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

In patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations despite otherwise optimal therapy, we advise against the use of maintenance oral corticosteroid therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).

In individuals with COPD who experience advanced refractory dyspnea despite otherwise optimal therapy, we suggest that opioid-based therapy be considered for dyspnea management, within a personalized shared decision-making approach (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

### The impact of integrated disease management in high-risk COPD patients in primary care [^fadbf767]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease characterized by increasing symptoms, decreasing (QoL), and increasing frequency of exacerbations. – These inter-related patient outcomes are the foundational elements of the current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) severity classification (A–D).GOLD A and B patients are low and medium-risk patients who infrequently experience exacerbations. Collectively, GOLD C and D patients are high-risk patients defined by frequent exacerbations and/or a severe exacerbation requiring hospitalization. The high-risk "frequent-exacerbation" COPD phenotype persists over time, and accounts for one-third of the COPD patient population. Exacerbations exact a substantial personal toll on COPD patients, reducing their QoL significantly. – In addition, COPD-related hospitalization accounts for more than half the cost of managing COPD in our health systems. International practice guidelines recommend effective pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions to specifically address these patient and health system outcomes; however, the impact of these recommendations on high-risk COPD patients in our communities has been limited by a substantial knowledge-to-care implementation gap.

The majority of COPD patients are managed by primary care practitioners. Although evidence-based management of COPD is increasingly complex, primary care providers manage high-risk COPD patients with multiple comorbidities within health systems that have enduring challenges. There are diagnostic barriers related to spirometry access and utilization. – There is a low level of provider knowledge of COPD clinical practice guidelines. – Chronic management of severe COPD requires multiple medications provided in different inhalation devices. To achieve self-efficacy, patients require self-management education and ongoing support. In practical terms, these evidence-based objectives are difficult to achieve by individual practitioners within the context of a regular clinical encounter. Thus, in practice, a minority of patients have an objectively confirmed diagnosis, or action plan, receive smoking cessation counseling, and for many medications, are under-prescribed relative to disease severity. – Narrowing the knowledge-to-care implementation gap in primary care requires transformative innovation.

Initial assessment of COPD — The goals of the initial COPD assessment are to determine the severity of airflow obstruction, the impact of disease on the patient's health status, and the risk of future events (such as exacerbations, hospital admissions, or death), to guide therapy. Additional clinical assessment, including the measurement of lung volumes, diffusion capacity, exercise testing and/or lung imaging may be considered in COPD patients with persistent symptoms after initial treatment.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease — key question sub-populations include adults suspected of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For patients with COPD, specified groups include those with "elevated serum eosinophils (> 150 cells/μl or > 300 cells/μl)" and those with "frequent exacerbations (> 2/year or one hospitalization for COPD)", as well as "mucopurulent bronchitis", "severe obstruction and/or lung hyperinflation or predominant dyspnea without exacerbations", and "low level eosinophils (< 100 cells/μl) and/or pneumonia". Additional populations are "Adults ≥ 18 years who have a diagnosis of COPD and clinical indications for beta-blockers", "Adults ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of COPD who have only hypoxemia during exercise or nocturnal hypoxemia", and "Adults ≥ 18 years with COPD and an acute exacerbation". High-risk definitions include "BODE Index: Approximate 4 years survival by using BMI, FEV1, mMRC, 6MWT", use of the "Refined ABCD assessment tool in COPD: Use GOLD standard, adverse events history in 1 year, COPD Assessment Test (CAT), and mMRC", and "Patients with frequent exacerbations (> 2/year or one hospitalization for COPD)", and the table also lists "Adults with stable COPD on long-term inhaled corticosteroids".

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^ed0f8ec3]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Background — global burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) notes that COPD is one of the top three causes of death worldwide and 90% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). More than 3 million people died of COPD in 2012 accounting for 6% of all deaths globally. COPD represents an important public health challenge that is both preventable and treatable, and the COPD burden is projected to increase in coming decades because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors and aging of the population.

### Optimizing pharmacotherapy management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: don't miss the forest for the trees [^4561a047]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite significant advancement in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) therapeutics and management over the past decades, hospitalizations and mortality continue to increase. In Canada, hospital admissions for COPD continue to increase even after adjusting for population growth and aging, despite declining rates of all-cause hospital admissions. Risk of death in the 90 days after hospital admission for COPD ranges from 6.1 to 11.1%.

Considering the availability of effective evidence-based therapies, the persisting unmet needs are unacceptable. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines over the years, in tandem with others such as the 2023 Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) COPD pharmacotherapy guideline, have clearly identified a treatment pathway based on evidence, transforming the pharmacotherapy approach for clinicians.

This Viewpoint article highlights facets of COPD pharmacotherapy that could lead to an improvement of patient outcomes, and we discuss controversies in the context of the GOLD report. A summary of the highlights of COPD pharmacotherapy and key messages is given in Table 1.

Table 1.
Summary of the Highlights of COPD Pharmacotherapy and Key Messages

In recent years, GOLD, the American Thoracic Society, and the CTS have come to make the same recommendation of using inhaled long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) and long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) dual bronchodilation at the initiation of therapy for symptomatic patients with COPD at low risk of exacerbation. This new "success approach" is supported by evidence from meta-analyses that shows the clinical superiority of LABA and LAMA compared with monotherapy. Previously, "stepping up" from monotherapy to dual therapy, adjusting treatment regimens at visits, was the recommendation. One shortcoming of this approach is the inaccuracy and lack of a definitive way to define optimal therapy for a given individual. We now appreciate that a delay in optimizing bronchodilation contributes to long-standing negative consequences for patient-reported outcomes.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to classify airflow obstruction severity based on post-bronchodilator FEV1 (in patients with FEV1/FVC < 0.70), as follows:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|GOLD 1 (mild)|- ≥ 80% of predicted|
|GOLD 2 (moderate)|- 50–79% of predicted|
|GOLD 3 (severe)|- 30–49% of predicted|
|GOLD 4 (very severe)|- < 30% of predicted.|
