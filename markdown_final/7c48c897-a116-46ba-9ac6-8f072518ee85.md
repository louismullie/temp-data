## Question

Does sunflower oil generally provoke reactions in individuals with a sunflower allergy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sunflower oil generally provokes allergic reactions in individuals with a sunflower allergy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biochemical evidence for residual allergenic protein after oil refining. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence for reactions to sunflower oil versus seeds. Next, I will assess differential risk across patient subgroups, including highly sensitized individuals. After that, I should review guideline-based principles for avoidance and diagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize practical counseling points and a balanced conclusion based on risk and available data.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical data on allergen persistence through refining; the pivotal study shows that total protein drops from 13.6 µg/mL in crude oil to 0.22 µg/mL after full refining, yet a prominent 67-kDa sunflower seed allergen remains detectable in trace amounts in the final product, and the authors cite a previously described case of anaphylaxis after ingestion of sunflower oil and margarine, indicating that clinical reactivity, while rare, is biologically plausible in highly sensitized individuals [^1123Eqk5].

> Wait, let me verify the quantitative implication of those trace proteins for clinical risk; although protein concentration is reduced by over an order of magnitude, severe reactions can occur at a wide range of exposure levels across individuals, and dose alone explains little of the variance in reaction severity, so I should be cautious about assuming a universal safety threshold for refined oil even when residual protein is very low [^115yTvJw] [^1123Eqk5].

> Next, I should review clinical evidence; direct reports are sparse, but the refining study explicitly references one anaphylaxis case with sunflower oil, whereas contemporary pediatric data highlight that a substantial fraction of sunflower seed–allergic children experience systemic reactions to seeds, supporting that seed allergy can be clinically significant even though oil contains far less protein than seeds, suggesting overall lower risk with refined oil for most but not all patients [^1123Eqk5] [^116hbYxu].

> Hold on, I should distinguish ingestion allergy from contact sensitization; large patch-test data in over 500 patients, including those with nickel or Compositae allergy, demonstrated no contact sensitization to a commercial sunflower oil, and compositae dermatitis from sesquiterpene lactones is linked to leaves and flowers or seed surface extracts rather than to refined edible oil, so topical risk appears negligible and does not directly inform ingestion risk [^111YB3ng] [^113tMoRi].

> Let me think about subgroup risk; for most sunflower seed–allergic individuals, refined oil's markedly reduced protein load likely translates to low clinical risk, but for highly sensitized patients — those with prior anaphylaxis to minute exposures or very low thresholds — residual 67-kDa allergen could be sufficient to trigger reactions, and because history of past anaphylaxis is an imperfect predictor of future severity, individualized assessment and precaution remain prudent [^1123Eqk5] [^115yTvJw].

> I need to ensure my interpretation aligns with guidelines; core food allergy parameters emphasize avoidance of the culprit proteins and history-driven testing, without specific exemptions for refined oils, which means refined oils are not automatically "safe" by policy, though they are often tolerated in practice; shared decision-making and, where necessary, supervised oral food challenge remain the reference standard when history is unclear or when diet liberalization is being considered [^114GgnAS] [^1164dmVQ] [^112zv8Aq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially almost concluded that refined oils are categorically safe for seed-allergic patients, but I should correct that; guidelines do not explicitly endorse refined oils for all, and the documented persistence of allergenic protein plus at least one reported anaphylaxis case mean I should frame refined sunflower oil as generally low risk yet not risk-free, especially advising avoidance of unrefined or cold-pressed oils that contain higher protein, and considering supervised challenge if inclusion is important for nutrition or quality of life [^1123Eqk5] [^112zv8Aq] [^113rVHF6].

> I will now translate this into practical counseling; I should confirm the patient's seed reaction history and severity, clarify prior tolerance or reactions to oils, advise preferential use of fully refined sunflower oil if any oil is to be tried, avoid unrefined or cold-pressed products, maintain epinephrine access in those with systemic reactions, and consider an in-clinic graded oral challenge for those desiring dietary expansion, recognizing that most food-allergic patients are not "highly allergic" to trace doses but that exceptions exist and require tailored plans [^1164dmVQ] [^114GgnAS] [^115yTvJw].

> Final synthesis: refined sunflower oil contains only trace residual protein and generally does not provoke reactions in most sunflower seed–allergic individuals, but rare systemic reactions have been reported and remain biologically plausible in highly sensitized patients; topical use appears safe from a contact allergy perspective, so ingestion decisions should be individualized, with caution and specialist input for those with severe seed reactions or unclear histories [^1123Eqk5] [^111YB3ng].

---

Most patients with sunflower seed allergy **do not react to highly refined sunflower oil** because refining removes proteins to below detectable levels. Rare reactions have been reported to **minimally processed or cold-pressed oils** that retain protein [^112zv8Aq], so these should be avoided by sunflower-allergic patients [^1123Eqk5]. Highly refined sunflower oil is generally safe, but patients with severe allergy should use caution and consult their allergist [^113rVHF6].

---

## Allergenic proteins in sunflower seeds

Sunflower seed allergy is typically mediated by **IgE antibodies** [^1145zwnR] against seed proteins, including storage proteins (2S albumins, 7S vicilins, 11S legumins) and oleosins [^112Lim17] [^113aZaSi], which are heat- and digestion-stable and can cause severe reactions. These proteins occur in seeds and minimally processed oils but are largely removed during refining [^1123Eqk5].

---

## Protein content in sunflower oil

The refining process (degumming, neutralization, bleaching, deodorization) **reduces protein levels** from ~13.6 µg/mL in crude oil to ~0.22 µg/mL in refined oil [^1123Eqk5], often to below detection limits. Highly refined oils therefore contain negligible protein and are unlikely to trigger reactions in most sunflower-allergic patients [^112zv8Aq].

---

## Clinical evidence of allergic reactions to sunflower oil

Allergic reactions to sunflower oil **are rare** [^1123Eqk5] and usually linked to minimally processed or cold-pressed oils that retain protein [^112zv8Aq]. Highly refined oils are generally safe; however, rare reactions have been reported in highly sensitized individuals [^1123Eqk5].

---

## Diagnostic methods for sunflower oil allergy

Diagnosis is based on clinical history [^113rVHF6], skin prick testing, serum-specific IgE [^111U1tmh], and oral food challenges [^1164dmVQ]. Skin prick testing and serum IgE can detect sensitization to sunflower proteins, but **oral food challenges are the gold standard** for confirming clinical reactivity [^1179ybNF].

---

## Cross-reactivity with other allergens

Cross-reactivity can occur between sunflower proteins and other seeds or plant foods due to homologous proteins such as **2S albumins and oleosins** [^112Lim17] [^113aZaSi] [^114e4Uqo]. However, refined sunflower oil contains minimal protein; therefore, cross-reactivity is unlikely unless the oil is minimally processed [^1123Eqk5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend that patients with confirmed sunflower seed allergy **avoid minimally processed or cold-pressed sunflower oils**, as these may retain allergenic proteins. Highly refined sunflower oil is generally considered safe; however, patients with severe allergy should consult their allergist before consumption [^114GgnAS].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Factor** | **Highly refined sunflower oil** | **Minimally processed sunflower oil** |
|-|-|-|
| Protein content | Negligible (< 0.22 µg/mL) [^1123Eqk5] | Higher (~13.6 µg/mL) [^1123Eqk5] |
| Allergenic potential | Low | High |
| Clinical reactions | Rare | More common |
| Recommended for sunflower-allergic patients | Generally safe | Avoid |

---

Highly refined sunflower oil is **generally safe** for sunflower-allergic patients because it contains negligible protein. Minimally processed or cold-pressed oils should be avoided due to higher protein content. Patients with severe allergy should consult their allergist before consuming any sunflower oil [^112zv8Aq].

### Influence of refining steps on trace allergenic protein content in sunflower oil [^1123Eqk5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

Although allergy to sunflower seed and oil is a relatively rare occurrence, several cases of sunflower seed allergy have been observed, and we have already described one case of anaphylaxis after eating sunflower oil and margarine.

- **Objective**: The aim of our study was to determine and characterize the allergens from sunflower oil at the different steps of the refining process: crude pressed oil (step A), acidification and neutralization (step B), pregumming by centrifugation (step C), washing (step D), bleaching (step E), gumming by filtration (step F), and deodorization (step G).

- **Methods**: A sample of oil from each step of the process (steps A to G) was heat extracted with PBS. The protein concentration of each extract was evaluated using the micro-Bradford assay. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE. The immunoblot was performed with the serum of a patient sensitized to sunflower seed and oil.

- **Results**: The extracts obtained after each step reveal a decrease in total protein concentration from 13.6 microg/mL to 0.22 microg/mL. The result of SDS-PAGE shows five bands, from 67 kd to 145 kd, with the most abundant being the 67-kd protein. The amount of this protein decreases after each step of the process. It is, however, still present in trace amounts in the refined oil. The 67-kd protein, which is mainly present in the crude oil and slightly in the refined oil, has been shown to be allergenic.

- **Conclusion**: Because of the presence of allergenic proteins, refined sunflower oil may pose a threat to people highly sensitized to sunflower seeds.

### An allergen from Olea europaea pollen (Ole e 7) is associated with plant-derived food anaphylaxis [^116kK65z]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Several cross-reacting proteins have been identified as responsible for the co-occurrence of pollinosis and plant-derived food allergy. This association has been mainly described in the birch-apple syndrome, but other pollens such as Olea europaea and other fruits may also contain homologous proteins.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the associations between sensitization to allergens of Olea europaea pollen and confirmed plant-derived food allergy. Additionally, to investigate if any pattern of clinical hypersensitivity of food allergy reaction (oral allergy syndrome (OAS) or anaphylaxis) and/or any fresh fruit or nut allergy, are associated with one or several Olea pollen allergen(s).

- **Methods**: One hundred and thirty-four consecutive patients diagnosed with pollinosis by Olea were studied. Of these patients, only 40 reported adverse reactions to plant-derived food. Twenty-one (group A) were classified as OAS and 19 (group B) as anaphylaxis. Skin tests with six Olea pollen allergens and several groups of fruits were performed. Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) confirmed the diagnostics of food allergy, with the exception of patients who suffered previous anaphylactic reactions.

- **Results**: All patients showed a positive skin prick test (SPT) against one or more of Olea europaea allergens. Sensitization to Ole e 7 was more frequent (P = 0.02) in patients from group B. A total of 84 DBPCFC were performed with 44% positive results. The challenge confirmed at least 50% of positive SPT in any case (peach: 68.42%; pear: 50%; melon: 71.42%; and kiwi: 53.84%).

### Characterization and incidence of sunflower seed allergy in a pediatric allergy clinic [^116hbYxu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Sunflower seeds are a popular allergen-free peanut alternative.

- **Objective**: To describe sunflower seed allergy incidence and characteristics.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with sunflower seed allergy from 1995 to 2021 in a pediatric allergy clinic. We described demographic characteristics, testing results, atopic comorbidities, and reaction histories of patients with sunflower seed allergy and calculated the annual cumulative incidence of the allergy. Logistic regression was used to estimate the increase in odds of sunflower seed allergy diagnosis for each year from 1995 to 2021.

- **Results**: From 1995 to 2021, we identified 235 patients with sunflower seed allergy. Among patients with sunflower seed allergy, the median age at diagnosis was 3.9 years. More than three-quarters of patients had another atopic condition. Half of the reactions consisted of mild urticaria or rash, and a quarter met criteria for anaphylaxis. The cumulative incidence ranged from 0% (1995–1999, 2001–2004, and 2006) to 0.38% (2021). From 1995 to 2021, the odds of sunflower seed allergy diagnosis increased annually by 21% (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17–1.25).

- **Conclusions**: In our single-center cohort of children with sunflower seed allergy, most children were diagnosed in early childhood, had high rates of comorbid atopic conditions, and had high rates of cutaneous reactions to sunflower seed products. Moreover, in our cohort, the incidence of sunflower seed allergy increased.

- **Taxonomic advances**: Plant CCD were recognized for the first time as potential allergens with clinical relevance. They were included in the IUIS/WHO nomenclature position paper and were demonstrated to be sufficient for N-glycan–supported cross-reactivity among peanut seed storage allergen Ara h 1 variants. Animal CCD galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal), causing red meat allergy, displayed cross-reactivity to human blood group antigen B, while cross-reactive tick–insect proteins carrying α-Gal were identified. A laboratory approach using immunoblot for the investigation of cross-reactivity, individual sensitization patterns, and their relationship to meat allergy severity was proposed.

First allergen description in a protein family and its cross-reactivity is an ongoing process, as illustrated by Cic a 1.01 from Cicer arietinum (chickpea), a member of the protein family late embryonic abundant protein 4 (aka LEA-4), displaying serum IgE binding not only in Cicer arietinum allergic patients but also in peanut-sensitized ones.

Novel members of cross-reactive food allergen families were described within the seed protein families, which are relevant for legume and nut cross-reactivity. These include vicillins, 2S albumins, and cyclophilins. Cross-reactive allergens responsible for latex–food and latex–pollen–food syndromes were identified within the families of latex allergens Hev b 5, which cross-react with apricot allergen Pru ar 5, and glucanase Hev b 2, which cross-reacts with banana Mus a 5 and Japanese cedar pollen allergen CJP38. The GRP family responsible for Cupressaceae pollen–food severe cross-reactivity has been documented.

### Impact of topical applications of sunflower seed oil on neonatal mortality and morbidity in southern Nepal: a community-based, cluster-randomised trial [^115JbtDv]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

Neonatal deaths account for almost half of all child deaths; in 2019, there were approximately 2.44 million deaths, with the vast majority occurring in low and middle-income countries. A main cause of death is complications arising from preterm birth (36% of neonatal deaths), and options for appropriately managing babies born early are limited. In the past 20 years, there has been increased recognition of the important role of skin in neonatal survival and protection from infection. One skin-related intervention is the use of emollient therapy with natural vegetable oils, but most studies of this intervention have focused on the prevention of infection rather than survival.

Emollient therapy for reducing infection and improving the survival of preterm babies has largely focused on improving the care of babies in intensive care units or hospitalized settings. Efficacy appeared mixed; meta-analysis and systematic reviews in some studies showed that nosocomial infection risk was not reduced, while others showed reductions in infection and neonatal mortality.

Further studies in animal models of the varying impact of commonly used natural vegetable oils in mice suggested that one of the most used oils, mustard seed oil, was perhaps the least appropriate for skin recovery after massage. In contrast, exposure to sunflower seed oil appeared to mitigate these effects and possibly accelerate skin barrier function. These observations, in particular, the demonstration of accelerated skin recovery after the application of high-linoleic acid sunflower seed oil and its ability to enhance skin barrier function, are noteworthy.

Rapeseed oil (Brassica napus), a plant from the Brassicaceae family, is widely utilized in culinary practices and industrial applications. Despite the prevalence of rapeseed oil, its allergenic potential remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of food allergies. This study investigates a potential food allergy linked to rapeseed oil.

### Tree nut allergies: Allergen homology, cross-reactivity, and implications for therapy [^115rpZA3]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Tree nut allergy is a potentially life-threatening disease that is increasing in prevalence, now affecting 1% of the general population in the United States. While other food allergies often resolve spontaneously, tree nut allergies are outgrown in less than 10% of cases. Due to the likelihood of cross-sensitization to multiple tree nut allergens, the treatment guideline is strict avoidance of all nuts once one tree nut allergy has been diagnosed. For example, walnut and pecan are highly cross-reactive, along with cashew and pistachio, but the extent of clinical, IgE-mediated cross-reactivity among other tree nuts remains unclear, therefore making avoidance of all tree nuts a safe approach.

There have been recent advances in immunotherapy for food allergies. For instance, there are investigational immunotherapies for milk, egg, and peanut allergies, specifically oral immunotherapy, sublingual immunotherapy, and epicutaneous immunotherapy. However, there are no large randomized controlled clinical trials for tree nut allergies. Even though less research has been conducted into tree nut allergy immunotherapies, evidence of T-cell cross-reactivity among tree nuts exists in animal models and in T cells from allergic patients, indicating that immunotherapeutic interventions may be possible.

Here, we review the literature regarding epidemiology, allergen homology, and cross-reactivity among tree nuts, and explore how findings can be employed for effective therapy.

### Sensitization to sunflower pollen and lung functions in sunflower processing workers [^113L9PfB]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate whether exposure to sunflower pollen (Helianthus annuus) increases both sensitization and respiratory symptoms, and whether it affects lung functions in sunflower processing workers.

- **Methods**: The largest sunflower processing factories in the Thrace region of Turkey participated in this study. Workers from the units directly exposed to sunflower seed enrolled as the study group (n = 102), and workers who were not directly exposed to Helianthus annuus pollen (n = 102) were the control group. Detailed questionnaires covering respiratory and allergic symptoms were completed, and skin prick tests and lung function tests were performed.

- **Results**: We found a very high rate (23.5%) of sensitization to Helianthus annuus in the study group compared to the controls (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of sensitization to H. annuus was increased 4.7-fold (odds ratio = 4.17, 95% confidence interval = 1.3–16.7) if subjects were exposed to sunflower pollen in the workplace. While asthmatic symptoms and allergic skin diseases were not different between the two groups, workers in the study group had a higher rate of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis (P < 0.05). We found that pulmonary function was significantly impaired in the study group (P < 0.01). Using a multivariate analysis model, inclusion in the study group was found to be a predictive factor for impairment of lung function (P = 0.002).

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that sunflower pollen has high allergenic potential, especially when there is close contact and exposure.

### Sunflower seeds as eliciting agents of compositae dermatitis [^113tMoRi]. Contact Dermatitis (2015). Low credibility.

Sunflowers may cause dermatitis because of allergenic sesquiterpene lactones (SLs). Contact sensitization to sunflower seeds has also been reported, but the allergens are unknown.

- **Objectives**: To analyze sunflower seeds for the presence of SLs and to assess the prevalence of sunflower sensitization in Compositae-allergic individuals.

- **Patients/materials/methods**: Sunflower-sensitive patients were identified by aimed patch testing. A dichloromethane extract of whole sunflower seeds was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography.

- **Results**: The prevalence of sensitivity to sunflower in Compositae-allergic individuals was 56%. A solvent wash of whole sunflower seeds yielded an extract containing SLs, with the principal component tentatively identified as argophyllin A or B, and other SLs being present in minute amounts.

- **Conclusions**: The concentration of SLs on the sunflower seeds is considered high enough to elicit dermatitis in sensitive persons, and it seems appropriate to warn Compositae-allergic subjects against handling sunflower seeds.

### A systematic review of allergen cross-reactivity: Translating basic concepts into clinical relevance [^114y7MUx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2024). Low credibility.

Functional tests are mainly represented by the basophil activation test (BAT), which consists of assessing the activating effect of an allergen extract or MA on a patient's basophils collected by venipuncture. In cases of demonstrated IgE binding to multiple cross-reactive allergens, BAT may provide further information on the ability of each allergen to induce basophil degranulation, which in turn predicts a higher likelihood of clinical relevance. An example of potential BAT application for allergen cross-reactivity assessment is the differential diagnosis of Hymenoptera venom allergy in patients sensitized to multiple venoms. BATs are available in specialized clinical laboratories.

Allergen cross-reactivity assessment in the clinical setting relies mostly on in vitro assessment of IgE binding to cross-reactive MA. On the one hand, using marker allergens as tools for the confirmation of genuine sensitization is rather straightforward and requires a limited number of MA IgE assays. On the other hand, the investigation of a suspected cross-reactive sensitization profile may be challenging due to the open question of the number of homologs that need to be assayed. The answer to this question depends on anamnesis, the results of first-line investigations with allergen extracts if available, the risk of severe systemic reactions, whether a specific treatment such as AIT is available, and if so, whether its initiation depends on the molecular sensitization profile.

The actual use of MA in the daily practice of allergists varies from one country to another.

### A systematic review of allergen cross-reactivity: Translating basic concepts into clinical relevance [^1143yCRE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Low credibility.

Pollen marker and cross-reactive allergens: selected examples are shown for marker and cross-reactive pollen allergen families. Genuine sensitization to major taxonomic groups of trees, weeds, and grasses can be identified using marker allergens. Examples include PR-10 allergens from Fagales trees (birch Bet v 1, alder Aln g 1, oak Que a 1), invertase inhibitors from Proteales (London plane Pla a 1), pectate lyases from Pinales (Arizona cypress Cup a 1, Japanese cedar Cry j 1, juniper Jun a 1), Ole e 1–related allergens from Lamiales (olive tree Ole e 1, ash tree Fra e 1, lilac Syr v 1), and Ole e 1–like allergens from tropical trees (sweet acacia Aca f 1, Prosopis juliflora Pro j 1).

- **Shared allergens**: Allergen families comprising cross-reactive homologs across unrelated taxonomic groups are denoted as shared allergens. Profilins and polcalcins are ubiquitous in grass, weed, and tree pollen. Profilins, but not polcalcins, are also found in plant foods. Profilins and polcalcins display extensive cross-reactivity (pollen panallergens), while variable cross-reactivity is found with most other families of shared allergens.

- **Example of cross-reactivity**: For example, nsLTP Par j 2 does not cross-react with other pollen nsLTP, while clinically relevant cross-reactivity has been described among other pollen and food nsLTP, such as plane pollen Pla a 3, mugwort pollen Art v 3, and peach (fruit) Pru p 3. Cross-reactivity of olive pollen Ole e 1 with Ole e 1–like allergens is also variable: high cross-reactivity between Ole e 1 and ash tree Fra e 1, moderate cross-reactivity of Ole e 1 with other marker allergens from Lamiales.

### Cross-reactive carbohydrate determinant-specific IgE obscures true atopy and exhibits ⍺-1,3-fucose epitope-specific inverse associations with asthma [^111qUpaJ]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

In high-income countries, IgE to standard allergen extracts is a risk factor for, and mediator of, allergy-related diseases, including asthma, and defines "atopic" allergy-related disease phenotypes. In tropical low-income countries (LICs), allergen extract-specific IgE levels are often elevated, but rarely associated with allergy-related disease. Host immune responses to common allergen sources exhibit important parallels with responses to parasite, insect, and other environmental exposures that have related molecular targets. For example, the Onchocerca volvulus tropomyosin protein is structurally homologous to house dust mite (HDM) tropomyosin and can induce basophil histamine release. Some Schistosoma mansoni (Sm) venom allergen-like (SmVAL) proteins (with orthologues in wasps) and tegumental allergen-like (SmTAL) proteins have allergenic properties. Recognition of such phenomena has provided insights regarding epidemiological trends of allergy in the tropics.

The role of carbohydrate cross-reactivity in the epidemiology of allergic sensitization and disease is less understood. Among the common sources of cross-reactivity between natural allergens and other environmental exposures are specific asparagine (N) linked glycan modifications found on some helminth, insect, and plant proteins (termed cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants, CCDs). The N-glycan trimannosyl-chitobiose core (Man 3 GlcNAc 2) is conserved in eukaryotes. "Classical" CCD N-glycans are expressed by invertebrate and plant proteins and on antigenic surfaces and in secretomes of schistosome.

### Managing nut allergy: A remaining clinical challenge [^114v3f1e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Peanut and tree nut allergies have become a public health problem over the last two decades. The diagnostic procedure relies on a suggestive history, as well as evidence of sensitization through skin prick testing and/or specific IgE blood testing, followed in selected cases by a food challenge. Standard IgE tests may be positive to more than one nut due to cross-reactivity (allergens common to several nuts) or cosensitivity (frequently associated positive test results without cross-reactivity). Thus, many patients with a peanut or tree nut allergy avoid all nuts, relying on positive test results without clinical evidence of reactivity. In addition, coexisting pollen sensitivity may add to diagnostic uncertainty due to potential cross-reactivity between pollens and nuts.

In this article, we discuss challenges in the diagnosis and clinical management of peanut and tree nut allergy related to cross-reactivity and cosensitization, as well as the avoidance of nuts tested positive to reduce the risk of reactions by cross-contamination. Studies to provide more accurate characterization of genuine clinically relevant cross-reactivity or cosensitivity to multiple nuts are needed.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: Rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^116j6Ehv]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

The relationship between dose/level of exposure and severity is complex and unclear. For accidental reactions in the community setting, it can be very difficult to accurately determine the degree of allergen exposure associated with an event, particularly those associated with fatal outcomes. Most individuals experience mild symptoms at food challenge prior to developing more significant symptoms to a dose sufficient to meet challenge stopping criteria — after all, the basic premise of food challenges is the assumption that incremental dosing effectively dose-limits severity.

In a small study of 27 children reacting to peanut at food challenge, 21 had anaphylaxis but only three as initial presenting symptoms; 13 children presented with initial non-anaphylaxis symptoms but then developed anaphylaxis with further peanut ingestion. This pattern has been reproduced elsewhere: individuals often show a dose-response between symptoms and level of allergen exposure, at least for the occurrence of any anaphylaxis, but this may not be apparent in larger datasets.

In an analysis of 734 double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges from The Netherlands, dose predicted only 4.4% of the variance in reaction severity — in other words, dose was not an important factor. Within a population, there will be a mixture of different allergic phenotypes, with some individuals showing a dose-response but others not. Most datasets show that severe reactions can occur at all levels of allergen exposure, which further obscures the dose-severity relationship.

### The importance of the 2S albumins for allergenicity and cross-reactivity of peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds [^112Lim17]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds are among the most important food-related causes of anaphylaxis. Important clinical questions include: why is there a variable occurrence of coallergy among these foods and is this immunologically mediated? The clinical and immunologic data summarized here suggest an immunologic basis for these coallergies that is based on similarities among the 2S albumins.

Data from component-resolved diagnostics have highlighted the relationship between IgE binding to these allergens and the presence of IgE-mediated food allergy. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo experiments provide strong evidence that the 2S albumins are the most important allergens in peanuts for inducing an allergic effector response. Although the 2S albumins are diverse, they have a common disulfide-linked core with similar physicochemical properties that make them prime candidates to explain much of the observed coallergy among peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds. The well-established frequency of cashew and pistachio nut coallergy (64%-100%) highlights how the structural similarities among their 2S albumins may account for observed clinical cross-reactivity. A complete understanding of the physicochemical properties of the 2S albumins in peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds will enhance our ability to diagnose, treat, and ultimately prevent these allergies.

### Genome-wide association study reveals a causal relationship between allergic rhinitis and hazelnut allergy [^111TCpiH]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

This study has several strengths and limitations that need to be considered when interpreting our data. It is one of the largest GWAS on FA in an adult population utilizing a specific questionnaire to improve FA assessment in large genetic‐epidemiological studies. Our questionnaire helps reduce false positive FA cases, enabling us to study FA in large populations. This is further supported by the replication of previous results. However, the questionnaire-defined hazelnut FA may still differ from a diagnosis of hazelnut allergy by OFC, and some misclassification may still be present. Although this may reduce power, it is not likely to cause false‐positive results. Further validation of the hazelnut FA associated SNP in additional populations with more strict phenotypes, such as OFC, is warranted.

One limitation of our study is the lack of data on the age of onset of FA, which could further facilitate the verification of secondary FA. In addition, we note that the number of cases in our study is still limited for a genome-wide association study. Another limitation is that we only performed one direction of MR because enough instrumental variables for the hazelnut FA (or FA) were lacking. These analyses can only be performed if future, well‐powered GWAS studies reveal a robust SNP‐set for FA. Finally, we restricted our analysis to the Dutch population, mostly of European ancestry, and were not able to investigate people of other ancestries, reflecting the genetic makeup of the population of the Northern Netherlands.

### Molecular insight into IgE-mediated reactions to sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seed proteins [^113uHaWu]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Food allergy is becoming a major public health concern in recent times. Several sesame seed allergenic proteins have been identified; however, sensitization toward these proteins does not follow a common and unique pattern of clinical reactivity, as shown by the differential geographic recognition of single proteins.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the sensitization profiles of 18 Italian individuals who experienced clinical symptoms after sesame seed consumption, including 4 anaphylactic reactions.

- **Methods**: Using an in vitro approach, we adopted a 2-dimensional electrophoretic technique combined with immunoblotting analyses by using sera from 18 Italian sesame-allergic patients.

- **Results**: We showed the prevalent and almost exclusive reactivity of the sesame 11S globulin. We shed light on the active role of the basic subunit of this globulin family. The limited accessibility of this polypeptide chain, unless the interchain disulphide bonds are cleaved, may be one of the reasons for its structural/functional stability and, thus, great potential for induction of IgE reactivity.

- **Conclusions**: These results confirmed previous findings on the reactivity of the basic subunit of 11S globulin in various legume species. Moreover, this experimental approach proved to be useful for the noninvasive screening of specific reactivities in sensitized patients.

### Clinical presentations of food allergy [^1145zwnR]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Food allergies are immune-mediated responses to food proteins. Due to differences in underlying immunologic mechanisms, there are varying clinical presentations of food allergy. This article discusses the manifestations of IgE-mediated disorders, including urticaria, angioedema, rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, gastrointestinal anaphylaxis, generalized anaphylaxis, food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and oral allergy syndrome. It also reviews the presentations of mixed IgE- and cell-mediated disorders, including atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders. Finally, the manifestations of cell-mediated food allergies are discussed, covering dietary protein-induced proctitis and proctocolitis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, celiac disease, and food-induced pulmonary hemosiderosis.

### Road map for the clinical application of the basophil activation test in food allergy [^114dYJZn]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Do we need improved diagnostic testing for IgE‐mediated food allergy? The diagnostic performance of skin prick test (SPT) and specific IgE to whole extracts can vary depending on the food sources and the quality of the allergen extracts. Allergen extracts usually contain the major and minor allergens relevant for the ability of the food to elicit allergic reactions. However, allergen extracts obtained from certain food sources, such as soya, wheat, and certain nuts and seeds, may miss some important allergens (e.g. lipophilic proteins such as oleosins, and other proteins that are lost during the process of producing the extracts), which can impair their diagnostic utility.

Generally, when interpreting SPT and specific IgE as positive at the low limits of detection, SPT and specific IgE have a high sensitivity but poor specificity. Therefore, without a clinical history that is suggestive of allergy, the mere detection of sensitization by SPT or specific IgE leads to high false‐positive rates and low positive predictive values (PPVs). When 95% PPV value cut‐offs are used (e.g. 8 mm for SPT to peanut and 15 KU/L for specific IgE to peanut), the specificity of these tests is enhanced but their sensitivity is reduced, resulting in many false negatives and low negative predictive value (NPV). Therefore, a large proportion of patients tested, particularly when the pre‐test probability is low (e.g. no or remote history of known ingestion), have intermediate range results for SPT and specific IgE and require oral food challenge (OFC) to clarify whether they have a food allergy.

### Is pea our hidden allergen? An American pediatric case series [^116VUVUd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). Low credibility.

- **Patient 4**: A 15-year-old boy who was previously healthy and had no atopic comorbidities other than a known history of cashew food allergy presented to the clinic for evaluation of new reactions occurring immediately after ingestion of different pea-containing food products. He tolerates peanuts without reactions. His first reaction was to Ripple milk (Ripple Foods, Emeryville, Calif), a pea-based milk that does not contain any peanuts or tree nuts, as specified on the label. The second reaction occurred with Beyond Meat chicken nuggets, which had the same ingredients listed as for the burger consumed by patient 1. The packaging also listed an advisory for pea food allergy, as it did on the burger ingested by patient 1. His last reaction was to a pea-based protein powder. The patient was unsure of the name of the product but was certain that it did not contain tree nuts, given his allergy. His reaction to all three ingestions was immediate hives located over his face and neck. He self-treated with Diphenhydramine HCL, resulting in resolution of his symptoms. His pea-specific serum IgE level was 6.10 kU/L.

- **Patient 5**: A 2-year-old boy with a known allergy to peanuts and no other atopic diseases presented for evaluation of a new allergic reaction associated with ingestion of a Chloe's Oat Milk Mint Chip Ice Cream bar (Chloe's Fruit, New York, NY). Immediately after ingestion of the ice cream bar, he experienced perioral hives followed by throat clearing and lip swelling. The possible allergens listed on the ingredient list were pea protein, tapioca, flaxseed, and sunflower lecithin.

### Eaaci guidelines on the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy [^111U1tmh]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

The EAACI 2023 guidelines recommend specific diagnostic investigations for peanut allergy, particularly regarding serum IgE. They advise obtaining serum specific IgE to the following allergens, in addition to skin prick tests and/or IgE to extracts, for patients with suspected IgE-mediated allergy to respective nuts, to further support a food allergy diagnosis:

- **Peanut**: Ara h 2
- **Hazelnut**: Cor a 14
- **Cashew nut**: Ana o 3

### Oilseed rape flour: Another allergen causing occupational asthma among farmers [^112bR97C]. Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Farmers are exposed to a wide variety of sensitizers. Since occupational asthma (OA) can lead to permanent disability, exposure discontinuation is the preferred treatment. When this is not possible, the identification of the causative allergen may allow an alternative therapy.

- **Methods**: We present three farmers diagnosed with OA as a consequence of handling fodder. We carried out skin tests with common and occupational allergens and with oilseed rape (OSR) extract. Total and specific serum IgE levels were measured. The patients underwent the OSR-bronchial provocation test (OSR-BPT). The day before and 24 hours after the OSR-BPT, the methacholine (M)-BPT and induced sputum were performed. Eosinophil percentages and ECP levels were measured in the sputum samples.

- **Results**: OSR sensitization (skin tests and specific serum IgE) was detected in all the patients. The OSR-BPT elicited early responses in two subjects. Methacholine sensitivity, sputum eosinophils, and sputum ECP levels increased 24 hours after the OSR-BPT in all the patients.

- **Conclusions**: We have demonstrated that inhalation of OSR flour causes bronchoconstriction, induces an eosinophilic inflammatory bronchial response, and increases bronchial hyperresponsiveness in sensitized asthmatics. OSR flour contained in animal fodder should be considered another potential cause of OA among farmers.

### Peanut allergy is common among hazelnut-sensitized subjects but is not primarily the result of IgE cross-reactivity [^115iMwrR]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Hazelnut and peanut are botanically unrelated foods, but patients are often sensitized and allergic to both, for reasons that are not well understood.

- **Methods**: To investigate molecular cosensitization and cross-reactivity to peanut in hazelnut-sensitized individuals, children (n = 81) and adults (n = 80) were retrospectively selected based on sensitization to hazelnut. IgE to hazelnut extract, Cor a 1, 8, 9, and 14, to peanut extract, Ara h 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9, and to Bet v 1 was determined by ImmunoCAP. Allergy to hazelnut and peanut was established by DBPCFC and/or detailed clinical history. Patients were either tolerant or displayed subjective or objective symptoms to either food. IgE cross-reactivity between hazelnut and peanut storage proteins was assessed by reciprocal ImmunoCAP inhibition experiments.

- **Results**: Of the 161 hazelnut-sensitized subjects, 109 (68%) were also sensitized to peanut, and 73 (45%) had clinical expression of allergy to peanut that was not associated with the presence or severity of hazelnut allergy. Instead, it was associated with IgE reactivity to peanut storage proteins, in particular Ara h 2. No cross-reactivity could be detected between Ara h 2 and Cor a 14, and 2 of 13 subjects displayed extensive cross-reactivity between 11S globulins; in the plasma of both individuals, Ara h 3 almost completely inhibited IgE binding to Cor a 9.

- **Conclusions**: Peanut allergy is not primarily the result of IgE cross-reactivity to hazelnut storage proteins. IgE to Cor a 14 and Ara h 2 may serve as useful markers of primary sensitization to hazelnut and peanut.

### Unveiling unique allergenic properties of rapeseed oil: A clinical case study [^111mDWVs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). Low credibility.

This clinical case study explores the unique allergenic properties of rapeseed oil. The investigation discusses the initial presentation of a patient with allergic reactions upon consumption of rapeseed oil. Through detailed clinical evaluations, the study identifies specific allergenic compounds responsible for these reactions, as well as the immunological mechanisms involved.

- **Case highlights**: Symptoms observed included severe anaphylaxis, rash, and respiratory issues. Following these observations, immunological assays were utilized to determine the specific immune response triggered by rapeseed oil in sensitive individuals.

- **Clinical implications**: The findings underscore the necessity for heightened awareness among clinicians regarding potential allergenic effects of rapeseed oil, which is commonly used in various food products. Recommendations include caution when advising patients with a history of allergies and considering alternative culinary oils.

The study suggests further research to characterize the allergenic components more thoroughly and to assess potential cross-reactivity with other oils.

### Risk assessment in anaphylaxis: current and future approaches [^116UmPCp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Risk assessment of individuals with anaphylaxis is currently hampered by the lack of (1) an optimal and readily available laboratory test to confirm the clinical diagnosis of an anaphylaxis episode and (2) an optimal method of distinguishing allergen-sensitized individuals who are clinically tolerant from those at risk for anaphylaxis episodes after exposure to the relevant allergen. Our objectives were to review the effector mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis, to explore the possibility of developing an optimal laboratory test to confirm the diagnosis of an anaphylaxis episode, and the possibility of improving methods to distinguish allergen sensitization from clinical reactivity, and to develop a research agenda for risk assessment in anaphylaxis.

Researchers from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology held a PRACTALL (Practical Allergy) meeting to discuss these objectives. New approaches being investigated to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis include serial measurements of total tryptase in serum during an anaphylaxis episode and measurement of baseline total tryptase levels after the episode. Greater availability of the test for mature beta-tryptase, a more specific mast cell activation marker for anaphylaxis than total tryptase, is needed. Measurement of chymase, mast cell carboxypeptidase A3, platelet-activating factor, and other mast cell products may prove to be useful. Consideration should be given to measuring a panel of mediators from mast cells and basophils.

### US food allergy patients' experiences, priorities, and needs: A qualitative study [^1164dmVQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). Low credibility.

A food allergy (FA) is defined as "an adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food". Disagreement regarding diagnostic criteria and a lack of high-quality population-level data make identifying reliable prevalence estimates challenging. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the US prevalence is 6.2% (∼20 million people). A cross-sectional, population-based survey fielded in 2015–2016 estimated childhood FA prevalence at 7.6%.

In addition to challenges documenting prevalence, there is a lack of comprehensive information on the natural history of FAs. FAs are classified as IgE-mediated, non–IgE-mediated, or mixed mechanisms. IgE-mediated allergic reactions typically occur shortly after exposure and can cause mild to potentially fatal food-induced anaphylaxis. Most IgE-mediated allergic reactions are caused by milk, egg, peanut, soy, wheat, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, and sesame seeds. They are diagnosed on the basis of a history of classic clinical symptoms and diagnostic testing by either skin prick or serum-specific IgE blood testing. Because skin prick and blood tests are prone to false positives, oral food challenges (OFCs) are considered the criterion standard in determining whether a person can safely eat a food. However, OFCs are time and resource-intensive, carry a risk for severe allergic reactions, and are associated with "anxiety among patients, families, and even health care professionals".

There is no cure for FA. Treatment includes elimination diets and epinephrine for severe reactions.

### Genome-wide association study reveals a causal relationship between allergic rhinitis and hazelnut allergy [^11148jo7]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

The heterogeneity of food allergy (FA) also adds to the complexity. In addition to directly triggering allergic reactions through food consumption, cross-reactivity between certain foods and inhaled aeroallergens can lead to allergic reactions. The categorization of FA into primary and secondary types is based on the mechanism triggering allergic reactions: primary FA directly results from food allergens, while secondary FA (also called pollen food allergy syndrome) results from a cross-reactivity between tree/grass pollen and food allergens. Currently, it remains uncertain whether the genetic factors associated with primary and secondary FA are identical, as secondary FA is more prevalent in adults than in children.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the genetic risk factors related to likely FA as well as allergen-specific FA in a large population-based adult Dutch cohort; and to assess the (causal) relation between allergic rhinitis (AR) and FA.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: Rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^115yTvJw]. Allergy (2022). High credibility.

- **Evolution of symptoms and clinical reactivity**: At food challenge, many individuals initially experience subjective symptoms, with objective symptoms appearing with further doses. Anaphylaxis will develop if the food challenge continues. Others may experience anaphylaxis as their first objective symptom, either at a dose of allergen exposure with no preceding subjective symptoms or with prior subjective symptoms, without evidence of a clear dose-response for symptoms. It is important to note that anaphylaxis can occur at all levels of exposure, both at low levels of allergen exposure (represented by the solid bars) and higher doses (indicated by dotted lines). This information is reproduced under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License.

For any given individual patient, the absence of prior anaphylaxis may be due to insufficient allergen exposure causing previous reactions, rather than the patient being at an inherently lower risk. Therefore, a history of anaphylaxis is a poor predictor of future anaphylaxis. Reassuringly, there is no robust evidence that food-allergic individuals who react to very low levels of allergen are at greater risk of anaphylaxis.

A history of reaction to only relatively large exposures (with no or minimal symptoms to smaller doses) may be useful in informing the approach to allergen avoidance in any given individual. This approach is particularly beneficial given more recent data suggesting that reaction thresholds for a food-allergic person are fairly reproducible under typical challenge conditions, at least for peanuts.

### Epitope specificity determines cross-protection of a SIT-induced IgG4 antibody [^116a3ybm]. Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

Referring to the WHO/IUIS allergen nomenclature, allergens are listed according to their origin and annotated to individual allergen sources. However, it has become useful to group allergens into families related in terms of sequence, three-dimensional structure, and immunological cross-reactivity. This grouping of allergens explains clinical syndromes based on the cross-reactivity of patients' IgE antibodies and/or T-cell receptors with structurally related allergens from different sources. For example, cross-reactivity of the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 with counterparts in various plant foods is responsible for oral allergy syndrome and exacerbations of atopic eczema in birch pollen-allergic patients upon ingestion of plant foods containing cross-reactive allergens.

Other highly cross-reactive plant allergens are profilins, which are ubiquitous cytoskeletal proteins, and polcalcins, a family of calcium-binding allergens. Polcalcins may cause clinical reactions to multiple plant pollens because they occur in pollens of most plants and share a high degree of sequence similarity. Polcalcins from grass pollen seem to be the most potent primary sensitizers. Sensitized patients show extensive cross-reactivity of their IgE antibodies with related allergens in pollens of various grasses, trees, and weeds.

### Use of "natural" oils for moisturization: Review of olive, coconut, and sunflower seed oil [^112UCYD4]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of effective medications for the management of atopic dermatitis and xerosis, patients may use nonconventional therapies such as topical oils. Patients choose these treatments because of the perceived lower risk of natural products and the fear of potential adverse effects of topical steroids. We review the use of topical olive, coconut, and sunflower seed oil in the treatment of atopic dermatitis and xerosis with a focus on children. Currently available evidence suggests that olive oil may exacerbate xerosis and atopic dermatitis. Further studies are needed to make definitive recommendations regarding the use of coconut and sunflower seed oil.

### Cosmetics and herbal remedies with Compositae plant extracts - are they tolerated by Compositae-allergic patients [^112QRWgg]. Contact Dermatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Compositae-sensitive patients are routinely warned against the topical use of Compositae-containing cosmetics and herbal remedies; however, the risk of dermatitis elicitation in presensitized persons is unknown.

- **Objectives**: The main aim of this study was to assess the significance of direct plant allergen contact via Compositae-derived cosmetics and herbal remedies in Compositae-allergic patients, with special reference to arnica (Arnica montana) and German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita).

- **Methods**: Eight of twelve chamomile-sensitive patients tested positive to chamomile-containing preparations, including tea, creams, ointments, and oil. Five of six arnica-sensitive persons tested positive to arnica-based products.

- **Results**: When the group was patch tested with cosmetic and/or herbal product ingredients, plant allergens elicited positive reactions most frequently. Fragrances, emulsifiers, and preservatives also tested positive. Plant allergens were mainly derived from Compositae, but avocado oil and Hamamelis virginiana tincture were unexpectedly detected as sensitizers too. Chemical analyses indicated that the Compositae allergens were both sesquiterpene lactones and other naturally occurring compounds.

- **Conclusion**: In conclusion, Compositae-allergic persons should be warned against the topical use of Compositae-containing products, not only because of plant allergens but also due to allergenic cream constituents that may cause reactions in patients who have multiple contact allergies besides the Compositae allergy.

### Managing food allergy when the patient is not highly allergic [^114GgnAS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). High credibility.

Few patients with food allergy are "highly allergic", meaning they consistently have severe reactions and react to very small amounts of allergen. Standard medical approaches for allergy management have focused on the safety and lifestyle modifications this group truly needs. Consequently, families with food allergy are typically advised to strictly avoid any exposure to their implicated allergens. Most food-allergic individuals do not react to very low doses, and many never experience severe reactions.

- **Commonly offered alternative care plans**: Patients with pollen-related food allergy syndrome, food-associated exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and resolving or mild milk or egg allergy might be advised to ingest the allergens in specific circumstances with detailed instructions.

Because oral immunotherapy and allergy prevention by early exposure have emphasized alternatives to strict avoidance, there is increasing interest in prospects to forego strict avoidance in those with food allergy. For patients with a high threshold of reactivity (low-dose tolerant, high-dose mildly reactive), there may be options such as allowing the ingestion of products with precautionary allergen labels, allowing dietary indiscretions with small amounts of the allergen, or even encouraging ingestion of subthreshold amounts with therapeutic intent. These practices have not been extensively studied and could be considered controversial. If these approaches are considered, shared decision-making is needed in discussing them.

### Reactivity to potential cross-reactive foods in fruit-allergic patients: Implications for prescribing food avoidance [^114ssxYA]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Prescribing therapeutic elimination diets in patients with fruit allergy should include recommendations on which other foods of the same family or group may be safely consumed. Evidence-based data on the management of fruit allergy are lacking; therefore, advice may vary from just avoiding the offending fruit to overly restrictive diets of the entire botanical family. The aims of this investigation were to assess clinical reactivity to potential cross-reactive foods in fruit-allergic patients and the implications for prescribing specific therapeutic elimination diets.

- **Methods**: Sixty-five adults diagnosed with clinical allergy to one or more fruits were evaluated for IgE-mediated allergy to other related foods, which might share cross-reactive antigens. Those with an actual allergy to some Rosaceae fruit (including peach, apple, apricot, plum, and almond) underwent skin prick testing (SPT), food-specific IgE assessment by the Pharmacia CAP-FEIA system, and oral challenges with the entire group. For those with allergies to other fruits (chestnut, melon, banana, kiwi, or avocado), immunologic and clinical reactivity to all five were evaluated. Since a number of people in the study also had proven clinical allergies to some nut or legume (peanut, sunflower seed, walnut, pistachio, or hazelnut), the reactivity to the entire set was investigated.

- **Results**: Thirty-four of those tested (52%) were found to be clinically allergic to more than one fruit, so 125 allergic reactions occurred in the 65 patients. Peach, melon, kiwi, apple, and banana accounted for 72% of allergic reactions.

### Will oral food challenges still be part of allergy care in 10 years' time [^116m5VbP]? The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

The design of oral food challenges (OFCs) differs when assessing possible non-IgE-mediated food allergies. Unlike IgE-mediated food allergies, for food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, there is no broad consensus regarding the framework for dosing. Often, the design of the OFC reflects the timing of reaction ascertained through the clinical history. Given the lengthy observation periods in some food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome challenges, a shift toward multiple-step food challenges, in which part of the assessment occurs in the home setting, has been proposed, although the safety of this approach has yet to be fully assessed.

In other suspected non-IgE-mediated food allergies, such as cow's milk allergy, the diagnosis is generally based on the elimination of the allergen and its reintroduction over longer periods (typically at least 2–6 weeks). The food of interest is usually administered at home, with the support of dietitians when needed, and the patient or family is responsible for observing any time relation between food exposure and symptoms.

Because of the longer interval between exposure and symptoms, the practice is to allow sequential food challenges to occur at home using food ladders. However, there has recently been an expansion towards using the ladder approach for sequential food challenges in the home setting for some IgE-mediated food allergies in low-risk patients, although it is acknowledged that a robust safety framework, including for patient selection, is needed for this approach.

### Unveiling unique allergenic properties of rapeseed oil: A clinical case study [^111ijCBJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). Low credibility.

Rapeseed (Brassica napus), a plant from the Brassicaceae family, is a widely used source of oil in both industrial applications (e.g. lubricants) and food products, particularly in Europe. Despite rapeseed's widespread use, allergic reactions associated with it have been largely underreported. However, occupational exposure to rapeseed dust is associated with a significant risk of IgE-mediated bronchoconstriction among grain industry workers.

The allopolyploid evolution of Brassica napus, originating from hybridization between Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea, underlines its genetic complexity and adaptation. This genetic diversity is pivotal in elucidating the allergenic potential associated specifically with Brassica napus and its derivatives. The evolutionary trajectory of the Brassica napus genome following Neolithic agricultural practices underscores its historical and contemporary agricultural importance.

A study conducted in India investigated hypersensitivity reactions to pollen extracts from Brassica napus. The findings revealed varying degrees of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity among atopic individuals. Major IgE-binding allergenic proteins identified from Brassica napus included those with molecular weights of 56, 76, 87, and 90 kDa. These findings manifest the necessity of comprehending local allergenic profiles for effective diagnosis and management of Brassica napus-related allergies and derivatives within the Indian population.

The objective of this study was to investigate potential food allergy related to rapeseed oil. Informed consent was obtained.

### A. Dust [^116fJVSC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009). Low credibility.

Studies indicate that allergic individuals produce immunoglobulins of the IgE class in response to exposure to allergens. Subsequent exposure to the allergen results in a combination of the allergen with IgE antibody fixed on mast cells or basophil membranes. This cross-linking stimulates mast cells, leading to the release and generation of pharmacologically active substances that produce an immediate hypersensitivity reaction.

The mode of action of immunotherapy with allergenic extracts is still under investigation. Subcutaneous injections of increasing doses of allergenic extract into patients with allergic disease have been shown to result in both humoral and cellular changes, including the production of allergen-specific IgG antibodies, the suppression of histamine release from target cells, a decrease in circulating levels of antigen-specific IgE antibody over long periods of time, and the suppression of peripheral blood T-lymphocyte cell responses to antigen.

### Peanut can be used as a reference allergen for hazard characterization in food allergen risk management: A rapid evidence assessment and meta-analysis [^1152odjS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

The inclusion of soya as a priority allergen in Codex is under review, with a recent recommendation from an FAO/WHO Expert Committee for its removal as a global priority allergen based on a low level of prevalence and low frequency as a cause of anaphylaxis. For soybean, five studies were identified in the literature. Consistent with data suggesting that soybean is an uncommon cause of anaphylaxis globally, no cases of anaphylaxis to low (< 200 mg of protein) levels of exposure were identified.

### Fenugreek allergy caused by cross-reactivity with peanut: An analysis [^115wMS76]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2024). Low credibility.

Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), a spice often used in curry and other dishes, belongs to the family Fabaceae, which is the same family as peanuts and other legumes. Dried fenugreek seeds are roasted, ground into a powder, and used as a spice, dye, and medicine. Spice allergies affect about 0.04% to 0.13% of the general population, mostly due to cross-reactions with pollen allergens (mainly PR-10 and profilin), resulting in a secondary spice allergy called celery-birch-mugwort-spice syndrome. Many reported cases of fenugreek allergy include suspected clinical cross-reactivity with peanuts. In vitro cross-reactivity between peanut and legumes other than fenugreek has been reported; however, there have been no reports of in vitro cross-reactivity between peanut and fenugreek based on serum from patients with fenugreek allergy. Here, we report a pediatric case of fenugreek allergy and examine the origin and causative allergen.

We conducted skin prick tests, measurements of allergen-specific IgE levels, and oral food challenges (OFC) to diagnose food allergies. For the skin prick test, we used a commercial peanut allergen (Torii Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), various spices purchased from a supermarket (10 mg/mL), and causative foods. Allergen-specific IgE levels were measured using the ImmunoCAP system (Thermo Fisher Scientific/Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Sensitization to an allergen was defined as skin prick tests resulting in a wheal diameter of 3 mm or larger or an IgE level of 0.35 kUₐ/L or higher. In the OFCs, peanuts and spices were used in ham.

### Cross-reactive aeroallergens: Which need to cross our mind in food allergy diagnosis [^115kkHGC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Secondary food allergies due to cross-reactivity between inhalant and food allergens are a significant and increasing global health issue. Cross-reactive food allergies predominantly involve plant-derived foods resulting from prior sensitization to cross-reactive components present in pollen (grass, trees, weeds) and natural rubber latex. Primary sensitization to allergens present in fungi, insects, and both nonmammalian and mammalian meat might also induce cross-reactive food allergic syndromes. Correct diagnosis of these associated food allergies is not always straightforward and can pose a difficult challenge. Cross-reactive allergens might hamper food allergy diagnosis, causing clinically irrelevant positive tests to cross-reacting foods that are safely consumed.

This review summarizes the most relevant cross-reactivity syndromes between inhalant and food allergens. Particular focus is paid to the potential and limitations of confirmatory testing, such as skin testing, specific IgE assays, molecular diagnosis, and the basophil activation test.

As a consequence of the general increase in allergic sensitization, the prevalence of hypersensitivity reactions to multiple foods that share homologous proteins has become a significant clinical problem. A variety of these allergens conserved among plants (e.g. profilin and lipid transfer proteins) and animals (e.g. tropomyosin and caseins) have been characterized. Although studies with molecular biologic techniques have elucidated the nature of these ubiquitous allergens, clinical studies have lagged behind. The physician is called on to determine the risk of reaction to related foods among legumes, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, cereal grains, mammalian and avian food products, and a variety of other plant-derived foods that may share proteins with pollens, latex, and each other.

Clinical evaluations require a careful history, laboratory evaluation, and in some cases, oral food challenges. The pitfalls in the evaluation of food allergy — unreliable histories and limitations in laboratory assessment primarily caused by false-positive skin prick test responses/RAST results — are magnified when dealing with cross-reactive proteins. This review focuses on the clinical data regarding cross-reacting food allergens with the goal of providing a background for improved risk assessment and a framework on which to approach these difficult clinical questions.

### Evaluation of food-pollen cross-reactivity by nose-mouth cross-challenge in pollinosis with oral allergy syndrome [^116VVUFy]. Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is often associated with pollen-induced rhinitis, and there are preferential associations between causative substances. If OAS and rhinitis are both immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated and there are cross-reacting proteins, it is expected that similar reactions can be elicited in the nose and mouth. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed a series of 'cross-challenges' with foods and pollens in both the nose and the mouth.

- **Methods**: Nine patients with ascertained OAS due to vegetables and rhinitis due to pollens were studied. On the first day, a nasal challenge with pollen extracts and an oral challenge with fresh food were carried out. After a week, a washout nasal challenge with food and an oral challenge with pollens were performed. Immediate symptoms, mucosal tryptase, and soluble eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were assessed after each challenge.

- **Results**: The administration of pollen into the nose and food into the mouth elicited symptoms as expected, but the cross-challenge had no clinical effect. In parallel, tryptase and ECP increased after nasal challenge with pollens, whereas foods did not elicit a measurable response.

- **Conclusion**: The cross-reactivity between foods and pollens, when evaluated at the shock organ, was not clinically evident. This data can be explained by a low concentration of cross-reagent epitopes in pollen extracts and food homogenized due to degradation. The different behavior upon challenge suggests that different immunological mechanisms may act in the nose and mouth.

### Immunological analysis of allergenic cross-reactivity between peanut and tree nuts [^114xnDs8]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Peanut and tree nut allergy is characterized by a high frequency of life-threatening anaphylactic reactions and typically lifelong persistence. Peanut allergy is more common than tree nut allergy, but many subjects develop hypersensitivity to both peanuts and tree nuts. Whether this is due to the presence of cross-reactive allergens remains unknown.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of allergenic cross-reactivity between peanut and tree nuts.

- **Methods**: Western blotting and ELISA were performed using sera from subjects with or without peanut and tree nut allergy to assess immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity to peanut and tree nut extracts. Inhibition ELISA studies were conducted to assess the presence of allergenic cross-reactivity between peanut and tree nuts.

- **Results**: Western blot and ELISA results showed IgE reactivity to peanut, almond, Brazil nut, hazelnut, and cashew nut for peanut- and tree nut-allergic subject sera. Raw and roasted peanut and tree nut extracts showed similar IgE reactivities. Inhibition ELISA showed that pre-incubation of sera with almond, Brazil nut, or hazelnut extracts resulted in a decrease in IgE binding to peanut extract, indicating allergenic cross-reactivity. Pre-incubation of sera with cashew nut extract did not cause any inhibition.

- **Conclusion**: These results show that multiple peanut and tree nut sensitivities observed in allergic subjects may be due to cross-reactive B cell epitopes present in different peanut and tree nut allergens. The plant taxonomic classification of peanut and tree nuts does not fully explain this cross-reactivity.

### Hypersensitivities to sesame and other common edible seeds [^112zv8Aq]. Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

Several seeds have been increasingly incorporated in various food items, with a consequent risk of hypersensitivity reactions that are often severe. Identification of the specific seed as the culprit is often not explored or is difficult to verify. In this article, we reviewed the English literature from January 1930 to March 2016 using PubMed and Google Scholar, searching for publications relevant to hypersensitivity to common edible seeds, namely sesame, sunflower seed, poppy seed, pumpkin seed, flaxseed, and mustard seed.

Considering the worldwide consumption of these seeds, the number of published articles on the subject was relatively small and mainly consisted of case reports rather than large series. Allergy to sesame was more frequently reported than to other seeds, with an estimated prevalence of 0.1–0.2%. In this review, we summarize the information relevant to each of the six seeds and their oils regarding the manifestations, routes of exposure, identified major allergens, and cross-reactivity with other seeds or other foods.

- **Role of history taking**: We addressed the important role of thorough history taking in suspecting seed allergy.

- **Diagnostic procedures**: We highlighted the limited reliability of routine diagnostic procedures and the importance of verification by appropriate challenge tests.

At present, management primarily involves dietary avoidance and the use of symptomatic medications, which may include epinephrine auto-injectors. We did not encounter any well-designed studies on immunotherapy for seed allergy, but it is hoped that such a gap will be filled by the development of safe, effective protocols in the near future.

### Nothing new under the sun? Sunflower oil shows no cross-reactivity with nickel or Compositae allergens [^111YB3ng]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Low credibility.

Despite its widespread use, sunflower oil has rarely been studied as a potential allergen. Our data show no contact sensitization in over 500 patients, including those allergic to nickel or Compositae, suggesting it is not a clinically relevant allergen.

Though sunflower is a member of the Compositae family, allergenic sesquiterpene lactones are typically confined to secretory plant structures like trichomes, found on leaves and flowers — not seeds. Solvent extracts of seeds may show trace allergen presence, but oil pressed from dehulled seeds contains only minute quantities.

Additionally, sunflower seeds rank high among nickel-containing foods, which may prompt concern for nickel-allergic patients. However, refined sunflower oil contains undetectable nickel levels even when derived from plants irrigated with nickel-contaminated water. Refining removes metal residues to improve stability and product quality.

Only one case report has implicated sunflower oil in contact allergy, and the case involved a lip balm with multiple constituents. Our findings support its overall safety for topical use, even among populations sensitive to related allergens. This study is limited by its single-centre design and use of only one commercially available sunflower oil. Broader testing across formulations would further support these findings.

### Peanut allergy: An increasingly common life-threatening disorder [^112jwdLb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Allergic reactions to peanuts in children have become a significant medical and legal concern worldwide, with a rising incidence of this potentially fatal condition. Peanut allergy represents an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to peanut proteins and is responsible for the majority of cases of food-induced anaphylaxis. Even trace quantities of peanut in a sensitized individual can be fatal, with rapid onset of symptoms often including the cutaneous findings of urticaria, angioedema, or diffuse nonspecific dermatitis. Peanut allergy is usually a lifelong condition, since only about 20% of affected individuals outgrow it.

Some schools ban peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, once a common dietary option, as fear of medical and legal consequences is escalating. Children with peanut allergy and their families should be knowledgeable about management strategies, including carrying and properly administering self-injectable epinephrine. New immunotherapeutic options are being investigated and appear promising.

### Is pea our hidden allergen? An American pediatric case series [^11751VHY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2023). Low credibility.

The importance of our case series lies in the fact that it highlights anaphylactic reactions to pea protein, which is typically considered safe and usually an alternative in those with other food allergies, as shown with patients 1 and 4. Our case series reiterates the need for more studies to define cross-reactivity between peas and peanuts, particularly as 3 of 6 of our patients had a concomitant peanut allergy and a fourth patient had a concomitant legume allergy. We were not able to exclude cross-contamination in the case of patient 5, as he has peanut allergy, which could very well have caused his reaction; however, given our experience with pea allergies and his serum IgE level, it was decided not to challenge pea and opt for a safer option instead.

Our case series is too small to answer such questions, but we encourage allergists to be more mindful of pea protein as a relevant allergen and to evaluate pea allergy through skin testing or serum IgE testing if the patient presents with a concerning history. This is especially relevant in light of the popularity that pea protein is gaining. Further studies with a bigger sample size and more rigorous challenges are necessary to evaluate cross-reactivity within the legume family and, more importantly, whether the presence of a pea allergy should trigger evaluation for a peanut allergy and vice versa.

### Sesame allergy: A growing food allergy of global proportions [^112eH5NR]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

To present an up-to-date synopsis on the global prevalence, natural history, nature of allergens, and immune mechanisms of sesame allergy, we performed a literature search using the PubMed database and obtained information on regulatory issues from the websites of respective agencies.

The PubMed search was conducted using the algorithm sesame AND allergy, without date restrictions, and only articles in English were considered. The articles obtained were screened for additional references to work not captured in the initial search. Each article was analyzed, resulting in a pooled source of published information.

Evidence was found for increased reporting of sesame allergy during the past five decades, predominantly from developed countries. Clinically, sesame allergy was presented in at least two major forms: immediate hypersensitivity, often expressed as systemic anaphylaxis and associated with positive skin prick test and/or IgE antibody test results to sesame proteins, with some cross-reactivity with other foods; and delayed hypersensitivity to lignin-like compounds in sesame oil, clinically expressed as contact allergic dermatitis. There were a few cases of immediate hypersensitivity to sesame with negative skin prick test and/or IgE antibody test results that were confirmed by oral challenge tests.

Sesame allergy is a significant, serious, and growing problem. Evidence exists of the ability of protein and oil components of sesame to trigger immediate hypersensitivity via IgE antibodies.

### Is oral isotretinoin treatment contraindicated for patients with known peanut allergies [^1112pgwi]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

The criterion standard for the treatment of severe nodular cystic acne, oral isotretinoin, contains soybean oil, which is contraindicated in patients with a soy immunoglobulin E–mediated allergy. Given the possibility of soy–peanut cross-reactivity, isotretinoin leaflets in the United Kingdom and Australia indicate that the drug is contraindicated in patients who have allergies to peanut or soy. This has been discussed in European dermatologic literature. We recently had a patient who was initially denied access to isotretinoin because of his peanut allergy, and we briefly report our findings in the American dermatologic literature.

### Low-affinity but high-avidity interactions may offer an explanation for IgE-mediated allergen cross-reactivity [^114Y3rbv]. Allergy (2021). High credibility.

The graphical abstract combines the findings and extrapolates our insights for low-affinity antibodies to a defined original antigen (Fel d 1) to potential low-affinity antibodies against cross-reactive allergens. The figure indicates that cross-reactive IgE antibodies bind to the allergy-inducing allergen with high affinity and only with low affinity to cross-reactive allergens. Upon exposure to the cross-reactive allergen, low-affinity IgE antibodies will be stabilized on the mast cell surface by the cross-reactive allergen and may consequently activate mast cells despite low affinity.

Taken together, we demonstrate here that IgE antibodies with low affinity can bind allergens with high avidity by interacting with multiple epitopes on the allergen. Thus, avidity rather than affinity drives IgE-mediated allergic reactions for low-affinity IgE antibodies. These findings may offer an explanation for the unexpected cross-reactivity between different allergens. Therefore, allergen cross-reactivity may be driven by low-affinity but high-avidity interaction.

### Causes, symptoms and prevention of food allergy [^116nhCQP]. Postepy Dermatologii i Alergologii (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on food allergy:

- **Definition**: Food allergy is an adverse food-stimulated immune response initiated on exposure to a given food.

- **Pathophysiology**: Food allergy is mostly caused by IgE-mediated antibodies (type 1 or early; 48%) and IgE-independent immune responses, including type IV (18%), type III (10%), and type II (6%), to specific foods. This condition is influenced by genetic and environmental factors, including improved hygiene, lifestyle, diet, and nutrition.
	- **Common allergens**: milk, eggs, wheat, fish, soy, peanuts, shellfish
	- **Less common allergens**: cherries, peaches, plums, apricots, nuts, seeds

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the US is estimated at 10,000 in 100,000 adults.

- **Disease course**:
	- **Immediate reaction symptoms**: anaphylactic shock, urticaria, angioedema
	- **Late reaction symptoms**:
		- **General symptoms**: fatigue, irritability, depression, hyperactivity, insomnia, headache, poor concentration
		- **Skin symptoms**: paleness, itching limbs, skin lesions
		- **Respiratory and digestive symptoms**: involuntary bedwetting, asthma, colds, indigestion, colic, diarrhea, bloating
	- The disease impairs quality of life, necessitating lifelong prevention of the specific food.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality risk associated with fatal anaphylaxis is less than 1%.

### Peanut oleosins associated with severe peanut allergy-importance of lipophilic allergens for comprehensive allergy diagnostics [^113aZaSi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Peanut allergy is one of the most common and severe food allergies in Western countries, and accurate diagnosis is crucial to prevent potential life-threatening allergic reactions. However, aqueous extracts used for routine diagnostic measurements are devoid of lipophilic allergens such as oleosins. We have recently succeeded in isolating and purifying these unique proteins, and the present study evaluates their allergenic potential and clinical relevance.

- **Objective**: We sought to assess the allergenicity and sensitization prevalence of oleosins obtained from both raw and in-shell roasted peanuts. Additionally, we tested the utilization of natural and recombinant oleosins for allergy diagnostic purposes.

- **Methods**: Oleosin sensitization, prevalence, and impact of thermal processing were analyzed by immunoblot with sera from 52 peanut-allergic individuals displaying different clinical phenotypes. The application of natural and recombinant oleosins for allergy diagnostics was investigated by basophil activation test (BAT). IgE-binding epitopes were identified by oligopeptide microarray.

- **Results**: Sensitization to oleosins was observed exclusively in peanut-allergic subjects suffering from severe systemic reactions. The IgE-binding capacity of oleosins derived from in-shell roasted peanuts was increased, as shown by immunoblot analysis and BAT. Both natural and recombinant molecules can be used to identify oleosin-sensitized patients by BAT. A linear epitope of Ara h 15 was determined, displaying high similarity to other seed-derived oleosins.

- **Conclusions**: The study underscores the importance of including oleosins in allergy diagnostics to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of assessments for individuals with severe peanut allergies.
