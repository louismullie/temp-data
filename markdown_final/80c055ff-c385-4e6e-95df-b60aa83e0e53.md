## Question

Provide a management plan for an eGFR of 52.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a management plan for a patient with eGFR 52 mL/min/1.73 m². Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming CKD diagnosis and staging. Then, I should assess risk with albuminuria and the Kidney Failure Risk Equation. Next, I will determine indications for nephrology referral. After that, I will outline core interventions for blood pressure, glycemia, cardiovascular risk, diet, and nephrotoxin avoidance. Then, I will review complication screening and monitoring cadence. Finally, I will address patient education, documentation, and escalation triggers, ensuring each step aligns with guideline references.

> Let me first confirm the CKD diagnosis and stage, because an isolated eGFR of 52 mL/min/1.73 m² suggests CKD G3a, but I need chronicity for ≥ 3 months or other markers of kidney damage before labeling CKD; I should repeat eGFR within about 3 months if chronicity is not already established and classify albuminuria using ACR categories A1 to A3 for full risk stratification according to KDIGO 2024 and earlier KDIGO definitions [^111rAoay] [^111BzKRJ].

> Wait, I should verify risk stratification next, since management intensity depends on albuminuria level, rate of eGFR decline, and predicted kidney failure risk; I need to obtain a urine ACR and review eGFR trajectory to identify a rapid decline of > 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year, and I should calculate 5-year kidney failure risk using the 4-variable KFRE, noting that NICE has adopted a ≥ 5% threshold for referral, while ensuring albuminuria measurement methods follow KDIGO recommendations for protein assessment [^1116SLVS] [^116WnUKT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about referral; with eGFR 52, nephrology referral is not automatic unless other high-risk features are present such as A3 albuminuria, rapid eGFR decline, active urinary sediment, refractory hypertension, suspected hereditary disease (e.g. ADPKD), or elevated KFRE risk, so stable G3a with low albuminuria can be managed in primary care with appropriate surveillance and co-management as needed [^116TpWH4] [^116NJi6Z] [^11623Vfp].

> I will now examine blood pressure management, since BP control is central to slowing CKD progression; my target should generally be < 140/90 mmHg, with a lower target such as < 130/80 mmHg considered in the presence of albuminuria, and I should initiate an ACE inhibitor or ARB when hypertension coexists with A2 or A3 albuminuria, monitoring creatinine and potassium 1–2 weeks after starting or adjusting the dose [^116TpWH4] [^113X3kfP].

> Let me consider glycemic management next if the patient has diabetes; a reasonable HbA1c target is around ≤ 7% individualized to comorbidity and hypoglycemia risk, and I initially thought metformin needed dose reduction when eGFR is below 60, but wait, I should double-check that — KDIGO 2022 emphasizes monitoring eGFR more frequently once it is < 60, generally reducing dose and reassessing at eGFR < 45, and discontinuing at eGFR < 30, so I should correct my earlier thought and align with those thresholds while avoiding lactic acidosis risk [^116TpWH4] [^112rmmPh]. Next, I started to say "consider SGLT2 inhibitors if eGFR 20–45 and ACR < 25 mg/mmol to slow progression", but hold on, I should verify the nuance — UKKA 2023 supports initiation for CKD with eGFR 20–45 even with low albuminuria, and some recommendations extend consideration even when eGFR is < 20 in select cases, so the corrected approach is to consider SGLT2 inhibitors broadly for CKD progression risk down to eGFR 20, and in some settings even below with careful judgment, alongside standard ADA glucose optimization guidance [^112uK1Be] [^112jjyMz] [^1173uJHn].

> I need to ensure cardiovascular risk reduction is addressed because CKD G3a elevates ASCVD risk; statin therapy is recommended in adults ≥ 50 years with CKD, independent of baseline LDL, which applies here, and I should align lipid management with KDIGO lipid guidance and consider broader primary prevention as per general CKD care standards [^111crHa7] [^112fpdLD] [^112LEEhG].

> Next, I should review lifestyle and dietary measures; let me verify protein goals — about 0.8 g/kg/day is reasonable in stage 3 CKD with attention to nutrition status, while sodium restriction toward < 2 g/day supports BP and albuminuria control, and I should reinforce smoking cessation, regular physical activity, and weight management, tailoring exercise recommendations to comorbidity and tolerance [^113X3kfP] [^115uaaDn].

> I will now examine avoidance of nephrotoxins and medication safety; I need to ensure NSAIDs are avoided, all renally cleared medications are reviewed and dose-adjusted to eGFR, and contrast exposure is minimized with appropriate hydration and risk mitigation if imaging is essential [^116TpWH4].

> Let me reconsider complication screening appropriate to G3a; I should screen annually for anemia when eGFR is < 60, check bicarbonate if acidosis is suspected or kidney function declines further, and monitor CKD-MBD parameters based on risk and trajectory, typically intensifying calcium, phosphate, and PTH assessments as kidney function worsens or albuminuria increases, using serial trends to guide interventions rather than single targets [^113X3kfP] [^112vVf49].

> Next, I should review the monitoring schedule; for stable G3a with A1 albuminuria and no rapid decline, eGFR can be checked every 6–12 months, ACR annually, electrolytes annually, and BP at every visit, while higher-risk G3a, such as A2/A3 albuminuria or rapid decline, warrants more frequent assessments and consideration of co-management, and I should escalate evaluation if there is a > 30% fall in GFR on subsequent testing, recognizing this exceeds expected variability; incorporating eGFR graph surveillance can help detect trajectory changes early [^111rAoay] [^115FPwCr] [^114MksYH].

> I should confirm that patient education is embedded throughout care; I need to explain what CKD G3a means, the role of BP and glucose control, the importance of medication adherence to ACEi/ARBs and statins, dietary guidance, red-flag symptoms such as rapid weight gain, dyspnea, confusion, or marked oliguria, and the need for routine immunizations per general medical guidance in CKD [^116TpWH4].

> Hold on, I should verify documentation and coordination; I must code CKD G3a accurately in the problem list, communicate clearly if nephrology referral is made, track eGFR and ACR trends in the EHR, and consider using KFRE in G3–G5 to inform risk and shared decision-making and to time referral or co-management appropriately [^11623Vfp] [^114MksYH].

> But wait, what about triggers for escalation; if I detect A3 albuminuria, a rapid decline > 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year, sustained > 30% drop in eGFR after a hemodynamically active drug change, refractory hypertension, active urinary sediment or suspected glomerulonephritis, suspected hereditary disease, or KFRE ≥ 5% at 5 years, I should expedite further evaluation and likely nephrology referral, ensuring timely intervention and preparation if progression risk is high [^1116SLVS] [^115FPwCr] [^116NJi6Z].

> In summary, let me ensure the bottom line is clear: eGFR 52 mL/min/1.73 m² (CKD G3a) is usually manageable in primary care when chronicity is confirmed, with priority on albuminuria-based risk stratification, BP and glycemic optimization, statin therapy, lifestyle changes, nephrotoxin avoidance, complication screening, and risk-aligned monitoring, with nephrology referral reserved for high-risk features or accelerated decline [^111rAoay].

---

For a patient with eGFR 52 mL/min/1.73 m², confirm CKD with repeat eGFR and albuminuria testing [^111BzKRJ] [^111rAoay] and optimize blood pressure to < 130/80 mmHg using an ACEi/ARB if albuminuria is present [^113X3kfP]. Monitor eGFR and albuminuria every 6–12 months, avoid nephrotoxins (especially NSAIDs), and adjust drug doses to kidney function [^111rAoay] [^116TpWH4]. If diabetic, target HbA1c ~7% [^1173uJHn] and consider SGLT2 inhibitors [^112uK1Be]; start statins if age ≥ 50 [^112fpdLD]. Refer to nephrology for eGFR decline > 5 mL/year, albuminuria ≥ 300 mg/g, rapid progression, or refractory hypertension [^1116SLVS] [^112QgRz3].

---

## Confirm diagnosis and assess progression risk

Confirm CKD and assess progression risk by repeating eGFR testing over at least 3 months to verify a persistent reduction [^111BzKRJ] and measuring the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) [^116WnUKT] to stratify risk and guide therapy [^111rAoay]. Evaluate comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other risk factors [^115oLdaN].

---

## Monitoring schedule

- **eGFR and albuminuria**: Monitor every 6–12 months; increase frequency if rapid decline (> 5 mL/year) or significant albuminuria (≥ 300 mg/g) [^111rAoay].

- **Blood pressure**: Check at each visit; aim for < 130/80 mmHg [^113X3kfP].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Check serum creatinine, electrolytes, and hemoglobin annually or more often if indicated [^111BzKRJ].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Implement lifestyle changes: **limit sodium to < 2 g/day**, target protein intake of 0.8 g/kg/day [^113X3kfP], and maintain a healthy weight. Encourage at least 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity [^115uaaDn] and strongly advise smoking cessation [^113Sn7B8].

---

## Pharmacological management

- **Blood pressure control**: Use ACE inhibitors or ARBs, especially with albuminuria [^113X3kfP].

- **Glycemic control**: Target HbA1c ~7% in diabetics [^1173uJHn]; consider SGLT2 inhibitors to slow progression [^112uK1Be].

- **Lipid management**: Initiate statins if age ≥ 50 years.

- **Avoid nephrotoxins**: Avoid NSAIDs and adjust medications based on kidney function [^116TpWH4].

---

## Indications for nephrology referral

- **Rapid progression**: eGFR decline > 5 mL/year or > 30% reduction over 2 years.

- **Significant albuminuria**: ACR ≥ 300 mg/g [^1116SLVS].

- **Refractory hypertension**: Uncontrolled despite optimal therapy [^112QgRz3].

- **Complex cases**: Uncertain diagnosis or multiple comorbidities [^117KYrvs].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Provide **education on CKD**, its progression risks, and the importance of adherence [^115oLdaN]. Teach self-monitoring of blood pressure and recognition of concerning symptoms, and involve patients in shared decision-making about treatment choices and lifestyle changes [^1144t7nJ].

---

## Multidisciplinary care approach

Coordinate **team-based care** with primary care, nephrology, dietitians, and pharmacists [^115c5bRJ]. Ensure regular follow-up to monitor progression and adjust therapy, tailoring interventions to patient preferences and clinical status [^1144t7nJ].

---

A patient with eGFR 52 mL/min/1.73 m² **requires a structured plan** emphasizing **confirmation of CKD**, risk stratification, regular monitoring, lifestyle changes, and targeted pharmacotherapy, including timely nephrology referral for rapid progression or significant albuminuria.

### Primary and specialist care interaction and referral patterns for individuals with chronic kidney disease: a narrative review [^1116SLVS]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Currently, various international guidelines, including The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), the National Institute for Health Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, and the Caring for Australians and New Zealanders with Kidney Impairment (CARI) guideline, recommend an eGFR threshold of < 30 ml/min as a trigger for referral of individuals with CKD to nephrology services. They also recommend referral based on urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) thresholds as well as a rapid decline in eGFR. The 2021 revised NICE guideline and the Canadian Society of Nephrology have incorporated in their referral criteria a 5-year risk of kidney failure (KF) of ≥ 5% and ≥ 3% respectively, using the 4-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE). Despite the availability of guidelines, the incidence of KF and the mortality associated with CKD continues to rise in some countries, raising the possibility of poor implementation of preventative measures due to lack of adherence to guidelines by health care practitioners.

The objective of this literature review is to explore the risk assessment process and referral patterns of individuals with CKD from primary care to specialist nephrology services. It will focus on the primary-specialist care interface, the timeliness of referral, the adequacy of pre-dialysis care, and the role of clinical criteria versus risk-based prediction tools in guiding the referral process.

### Practical approach to detection and management of chronic kidney disease for the primary care clinician [^116TpWH4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A panel of internists and nephrologists developed this practical approach for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative to guide assessment and care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by primary care clinicians. Chronic kidney disease is defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and/or markers of kidney damage for at least 3 months. In clinical practice, the most common tests for CKD include GFR estimated from the serum creatinine concentration (eGFR) and albuminuria from the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio.

Assessment of eGFR and albuminuria should be performed for persons with diabetes and/or hypertension, but is not recommended for the general population. Management of CKD includes reducing the patient's risk of CKD progression and risk of associated complications such as acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease, anemia, metabolic acidosis, and mineral and bone disorder. Prevention of CKD progression requires blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for patients with albuminuria and hypertension, hemoglobin A1c ≤ 7% for patients with diabetes, and correction of CKD-associated metabolic acidosis.

To reduce patient safety hazards from medications, the level of eGFR should be considered when prescribing, and nephrotoxins such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided. The main reasons to refer to nephrology specialists are eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², severe albuminuria, and acute kidney injury. The ultimate goal of CKD management is to prevent further complications and ensure optimal patient outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline on management of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease stage 3b or higher (eGFR < 45 mL/min) [^114MUFFD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). High credibility.

In the context of managing patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those in stage 3b or higher (eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or on dialysis), the ERBP 2015 guidelines offer important recommendations. **Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors**: The guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to justify the initiation of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in adult patients with CKD stage 3b or higher who also have a cardiovascular indication, such as heart failure or ischemic heart disease, but an intolerance for ACE inhibitors (ACEis).

### Optimizing multidisciplinary care of patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115c5bRJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). High credibility.

An estimated 37.3 million people in the United States have diabetes, which equates to 11.3% of the general population. Approximately one in three adults with diabetes will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) in their lifetime. Diabetes is the leading cause of CKD and accounts for approximately 40% of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) cases. Furthermore, advanced-stage CKD (stages 4 and 5) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, predominantly due to the development of ESKD and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD).

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), among US adults diagnosed with advanced-stage CKD between 2017 and 2020, the prevalence of diabetes (including pre-diabetes) was 36.1%, compared with 3.6% of adults having advanced-stage CKD and no diabetes. Where CKD was noted as the cause of death in the Global Burden of Disease study in 2017, 28.4% of these deaths were in patients who had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In a separate analysis using data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), the presence of diabetes and kidney disease was shown to impart an almost sixfold greater risk of cardiovascular (CV) mortality compared to those without these conditions.

It is clear from these data that diabetes is an important risk factor for developing CVD and CKD. Indeed, deaths attributable to CVD due to impaired kidney function caused 4.6% of global deaths in 2017, making CKD the 12th leading cause of death globally.

Early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatments are essential.

### Evaluating the feasibility of the KDIGO CKD referral recommendations [^112QgRz3]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2012, the international nephrology organization Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) released recommendations for nephrology referral for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The feasibility of adhering to these recommendations is unknown.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the primary care population at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). We translated referral recommendations based upon serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and albuminuria into a set of computable criteria in order to project referral volume if the KDIGO referral recommendations were to be implemented. Using electronic health record data, we evaluated each patient using the computable criteria at the times that the patient made clinic visits in 2013. We then compared the projected referral volume with baseline nephrology clinic volume.

- **Results**: Out of 56,461 primary care patients at BWH, we identified 5,593 (9.9%) who had CKD based on albuminuria or estimated GFR. Referring patients identified by the computable criteria would have resulted in 2,240 additional referrals to nephrology. In 2013, this would represent a 38.0% (2,240/5,892) increase in total nephrology patient volume and a 67.3% (2,240/3,326) increase in new referral volume.

- **Conclusions**: This is the first study to examine the projected impact of implementing the 2012 KDIGO referral recommendations. Given the large increase in the number of referrals, this study suggests that implementing the KDIGO referral guidelines may not be feasible under current practice models due to substantial increases in referrals.

### Referral criteria for chronic kidney disease: Implications for disease management and healthcare expenditure-analysis of a population-based sample [^111Aqvok]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

The aim of referral criteria is to ensure timely and adequate access to nephrology services for patients most at risk of complications or progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and patients requiring specific treatment. Avoiding unnecessary referral of low-risk patients is usually not an explicitly stated goal but is important, given the limited number of nephrologists, the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the additional healthcare expenditures.

Specific referral recommendations often cannot be based on scientific evaluation; rather, they reflect assumptions on acceptable referral thresholds or consensus of guideline authors and stakeholders from medical societies.

The aim of this study is to simulate and compare referral rates and the corresponding healthcare expenditure of applying referral criteria according to the following guidelines and recommendations:

- **Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO, 2012)**;
- **National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, 2014)**;
- **Recommendation of the German Society of Nephrology/German Society of Internal Medicine (DGfN/DGIM, 2015)**; and
- **German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians (DEGAM, 2019)**.

Additionally, we calculated the ESRD risk for subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) as suggested by the update of the NICE guideline 2021.

The second aim is to report the actually observed number of patients consulting a nephrologist.

### Reporting the eGFR and its implication for CKD diagnosis [^1164PVLh]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The process of diagnosing chronic kidney disease using the estimated GFR involves several pitfalls. The estimated GFR laboratory report should be requested only by practitioners who are familiar with how to interpret the result. Until a more reliable method is available to estimate the GFR, the chronic kidney disease classification should be revised by reducing the central role of the GFR cutoff levels.

### Optimizing care for patients with CKD [^1144t7nJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Care for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is complex and requires a standardized, multidisciplinary approach. Various strategies have been suggested to improve care, including the development of clinical practice guidelines and the introduction of chronic disease management (CDM) programs.

CDM programs represent a proactive approach to care, supporting both the physician and patient with an emphasis on preventing exacerbations and complications through a coordinated multidisciplinary team. In addition to targeting patients at the highest risk, CDM programs emphasize intensive monitoring and proactive follow-up. The expansion of professional roles may also play a crucial role in ensuring the success of this approach.

While observational studies suggest that specific components of CDM programs may improve care for CKD patients, further research is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of program components in CKD prevention and management. This includes conducting well-structured randomized trials and long-term follow-ups to assess changes in adverse health outcomes.

### Impact of estimated GFR reporting on patients, clinicians, and health-care systems: a systematic review [^114jtxST]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Many laboratories now report estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) when a serum creatinine measurement is ordered. A summary of the impact of eGFR reporting in health care systems around the world, where it has been adopted, is lacking.

- **Study design**: Systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, other major databases, and conference proceedings of major nephrology meetings.

- **Setting & population**: Any health care system in which eGFR reporting was introduced.

- **Selection criteria for studies**: Published studies or abstracts reporting patient, clinician, or health system outcomes of eGFR reporting.

- **Intervention**: eGFR reporting.

- **Outcomes**: Volume of referrals or consults seen by nephrologists, changes in characteristics of patients who were seen, and prescription rates of kidney-related medications.

- **Results**: 22 studies (10 full-text and 12 conference abstracts) were identified from 2004–2010 across 5 countries. Nephrologist referrals and consultations increased after eGFR reporting, ranging from 13%-270%. The greatest increases in referrals were seen for the elderly, females, and those with stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²). Change in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-blocking drug use ranged from increases of 0%-6%.

- **Limitations**: Studies were highly variable in the definition of outcomes. Reports were not available for many health care systems in which eGFR reporting was implemented.

Conclusions: eGFR reporting has been associated with greater identification of patients with decreased kidney function in most health care systems.

### Prediction equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate: An update [^112qvYey]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The level of glomerular filtration rate can be estimated from the serum creatinine concentration and other easily measured patient variables using prediction equations developed through multivariable regression techniques. Recently, a new equation has been developed from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study, which is more accurate than other equations and more accurate than the measurement of creatinine clearance. The authors recommend using prediction equations in clinical practice to estimate the level of glomerular filtration rate.

### Impact of reporting estimated glomerular filtration rate: It's not just about us [^1161qxp8]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

The reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a key component of a public-health strategy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Jain and colleagues demonstrate that eGFR reporting in Ontario increased referrals to nephrologists by 23 consults per year, equivalent to 2.9 additional consults per 100,000 population. In our view, a complete assessment requires a broader perspective. Most patients with CKD do not require referral to a nephrologist. Improving outcomes requires coordinated efforts from all physicians.

### Clinical practice guideline on management of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease stage 3b or higher (eGFR < 45 mL/min) [^115uaaDn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, the ERBP 2015 guidelines recommend advising patients with diabetes and CKD stage ≥ 3b (eGFR < 45 mL/min) to engage in additional physical exercise. This should be practiced at least three times a week, for 1/2 to 1 hour per session, to reduce fat mass and improve quality of life.

### Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate and outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^114FF5g6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is important in the diagnosis and prognostication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The standards for CKD progression in clinical trials are kidney failure and the doubling of serum creatinine (approximately 57% decline in eGFR). These endpoints have limitations as they are only applicable to patients with later stages of CKD and often require large sample sizes to achieve adequate power.

- **Recent findings**: Lesser declines in eGFR (30% and 40%) have been evaluated as potential endpoints in recent studies. These endpoints are more common and show a strong association with the risk of end-stage renal disease and mortality. These findings have been shown to be consistent across different causes of CKD and for different interventions. A particular limitation of reduced thresholds is an elevated risk of type I errors in the presence of acute treatment effects, particularly with a 30% eGFR decline cutoff.

- **Summary**: Surrogate endpoints for kidney failure and mortality are needed in clinical trials to allow for the reasonable management of timelines and resources, and the achievement of adequate sample sizes. Lesser eGFR decline thresholds should be considered to aid in the design and conduct of more randomized controlled trials in nephrology.

### Eligibility for pharmacological therapies in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: Implications of the new Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation for estimating glomerular filtration rate [^114bQ3tw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

The new Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation for estimating glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), based on serum creatinine and not incorporating race, may reclassify individuals from one eGFR category to another. This has implications for eligibility for treatments in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

- **Methods and results**: A total of 43,138 ambulatory patients with HFrEF from 12 clinical trials were included (mean age 64.3 years; 9,580 [22.2%] women). The mean eGFR was 67 (standard deviation [SD] 21) ml/min/1.73 m² and 70 (SD 21) ml/min/1.73 m² using the original and new CKD-EPI equations, respectively (mean difference 3.20 ml/min/1.73 m², 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.17–3.23, p < 0.001). Of the 935 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 4 or 5, identified using the original equation, 309 (33.0%) were reclassified to CKD stages 1–3 (eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m²) with the new equation. However, among the 2,521 Black patients (5.8%) included, the opposite was observed, with a reduction in mean eGFR from 75 to 68 ml/min/1.73 m² using the original and new equations, respectively (mean difference 6.94 ml/min/1.73 m², [95% CI 6.82–7.06], p < 0.001). The number of Black patients with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² increased from 49 (1.9%) using the original equation to 71 (2.8%) with the new equation.

- **Conclusions**: The new CKD-EPI creatinine equation reclassified CKD stage in a large proportion of patients with HFrEF enrolled in clinical trials. As eGFR is an essential determinant of eligibility for treatment, this reclassification has significant implications for patient management.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2024 [^1173uJHn]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, the ADA 2024 guidelines recommend optimizing glucose management to slow the progression of CKD.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2013 [^113X3kfP]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, it is important to optimize both glucose and blood pressure control (A).

- **Nephropathy screening**: Perform an annual test to assess urine albumin excretion in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetes for ≥ 5 years and in all type 2 diabetic patients starting at diagnosis (B). Measure serum creatinine at least annually in all adults with diabetes, regardless of the degree of urine albumin excretion. Use serum creatinine to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and stage the level of chronic kidney disease (CKD), if present (E).

- **Treatment recommendations**: In the treatment of nonpregnant patients with modestly elevated (30–299 mg/day) (C) or higher levels (≥ 300 mg/day) of urinary albumin excretion (A), either ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended. Reducing protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g/kg body weight per day in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD, and to 0.8 g/kg body weight per day in the later stages of CKD, may improve measures of renal function such as urine albumin excretion rate and GFR, and is recommended (C). When using ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics, it is necessary to monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for any development in increased creatinine or changes in potassium (E). Continued monitoring of urine albumin excretion to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is reasonable (E). When estimated GFR (eGFR) is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², it is advisable to evaluate and manage potential complications of CKD (E).

### GFR decline and subsequent risk of established kidney outcomes: A meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials [^113XhgUJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). High credibility.

The currently established endpoints for clinical trials of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are end-stage renal disease and doubling of serum creatinine level, which approximates a 57% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). There is increased interest in using alternative endpoints in clinical trials to shorten trial duration and reduce sample size. As part of an evaluation of using lesser declines in GFR as alternative endpoints, we examined the associations of various levels of eGFR decline with the subsequent development of established endpoints, and assessed the consistency of alternate levels of eGFR decline across varying clinical manifestations of kidney disease and interventions.

- **Study design**: Observational analysis of randomized controlled trials.

- **Setting & participants**: 9,488 participants in 37 randomized controlled trials in CKD.

- **Predictor**: Alternative endpoints, defined as 30% and 40% declines in eGFR from baseline to month 12. Effect modification by baseline eGFR, proteinuria, cause of disease, and interventions.

- **Outcomes**: Established endpoints, defined as end-stage renal disease, eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m², or doubling of serum creatinine level.

Results showed that from baseline to 12 months, 16.1% and 7.8% of participants had eGFR declines of ≥ 30% or ≥ 40%, respectively. Over a median follow-up of 2.0 (IQR, 1.2–3.1) years after the 12-month baseline period, 2,661 established endpoints were observed. A strong linear association was observed between eGFR decline and subsequent established endpoints.

### Glomerular filtration rate decline as a surrogate end point in kidney disease progression trials [^114QRosY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is strongly associated with increased risks of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and mortality. Clinical trials evaluating CKD progression commonly use a composite end point of death, ESKD, or serum creatinine doubling. However, due to low event rates, such trials require large sample sizes and long-term follow-up for adequate statistical power. As a result, very few interventions targeting CKD progression have been tested in randomized controlled trials. To overcome this problem, the National Kidney Foundation and the Food and Drug Administration conducted a series of analyses to determine whether an end point of a 30% or 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over 2–3 years can substitute for serum creatinine doubling in the composite end point.

These analyses demonstrated that these alternate kidney end points were significantly associated with subsequent risks of ESKD and death. However, the association between, and consistency of treatment effects on, eGFR decline and clinical end points were influenced by baseline eGFR, follow-up duration, and acute hemodynamic effects. The investigators concluded that a 40% eGFR decline is broadly acceptable as a kidney end point across a wide baseline eGFR range, and that a 30% eGFR decline may be acceptable in some situations. Although these alternate kidney end points could potentially allow investigators to conduct shorter duration clinical trials with smaller sample sizes, thereby generating evidence to guide clinical decision-making in a timely manner, it is uncertain whether the…

### Improving chronic kidney disease detection and treatment in the United States: The chronic kidney disease cascade of care (C) study protocol [^115kXe8a]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m² and/or a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) greater than or equal to 30 mg/g, is a major public health problem. Globally, nearly 10% of the adult population has a diagnosis of CKD, which is associated with substantially increased risks for cardiovascular events, progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis or transplant, in-hospital complications, and early death. The healthcare costs of CKD are substantial. In 2018, overall Medicare fee-for-service spending for patients with CKD exceeded $81 billion, representing 23% of total Medicare spending.

Most preventive guidelines recommend testing for CKD as part of the usual management of high-risk conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and established cardiovascular disease. The rationale for these recommendations is that detection and staging of CKD are critical for proper kidney and cardiovascular risk stratification, prompt referral to nephrology care, and the initiation of cardio-kidney preventive therapies. Collectively, these actions could vastly lower the adverse health consequences of CKD, but major evidence-to-care gaps exist in CKD detection, which is the necessary first step towards optimizing clinical management and outcomes. For instance, less than 50% of patients with diabetes undergo regular testing for CKD with eGFR and albuminuria. For patients with hypertension but without diabetes, testing for albuminuria is routinely conducted in less than 10% of patients.

### Impact of estimated glomerular filtration rate reporting on nephrology referrals: A review of the literature [^113Sxntc]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting has been implemented by laboratories and jurisdictions worldwide. This review aims to summarize recent literature evaluating the association between eGFR reporting and outcomes, specifically assessing its impact on nephrology referrals and the characteristics of the referred population.

Eight studies have evaluated the association between eGFR reporting and nephrology referrals, all published within the last six years. These studies consistently show an increase in referrals and referral rates following eGFR reporting. This increase in nephrology referrals was predominantly seen in women and the elderly. An increased referral rate and increased recognition of chronic kidney disease were noted among patients with stage 3 or higher kidney disease. However, whether eGFR reporting results in an increase in "inappropriate" referrals and increased resource use has been poorly studied.

In summary, reporting of eGFR is associated with an increase in nephrology referrals, particularly among women and the elderly. Whether eGFR reporting is associated with improved patient outcomes remains to be determined.

Diabetes is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) globally, and individuals with diabetes have a very high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. Trial data confirm that the progression to ESKD, CVD, and mortality in people with CKD due to type-2 diabetes can be effectively mitigated by both established and newer interventions. Recent studies demonstrate significant inadequacies and inequities in the management of diabetic CKD in the UK and elsewhere. The updated ABCD-UKKA guidelines incorporate all recent trial evidence, proposing a tiered approach to implementing recommendations, to promote holistic, individualized multiple-risk factor intervention.

### Effect of primary care physicians' use of estimated glomerular filtration rate on the timing of their subspecialty referral decisions [^1116iGTH]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary care providers' suboptimal recognition of the severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) may contribute to untimely referrals of patients with CKD to subspecialty care. It is unknown whether U.S. primary care physicians' use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) rather than serum creatinine to estimate CKD severity could improve the timeliness of their subspecialty referral decisions.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 154 United States primary care physicians to assess the effect of the use of eGFR (versus creatinine) on the timing of their subspecialty referrals. Primary care physicians completed a questionnaire featuring questions regarding a hypothetical White or African American patient with progressing CKD. We asked primary care physicians to identify the serum creatinine and eGFR levels at which they would recommend patients, like the hypothetical patient, be referred for subspecialty evaluation. We assessed significant improvement in the timing (from eGFR < 30 to ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) of their recommended referrals based on their use of creatinine versus eGFR.

- **Results**: Primary care physicians recommended subspecialty referrals later (CKD more advanced) when using creatinine versus eGFR to assess kidney function [median eGFR 32 versus 55 mL/min/1.73 m², p < 0.001]. Forty percent of primary care physicians significantly improved the timing of their referrals when basing their recommendations on eGFR. Improved timing occurred more frequently among primary care physicians practicing in academic (versus non-academic) practices.

### Higher estimated glomerular filtration rates may be associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes, especially with concomitant proteinuria [^115t5c1x]. Kidney International (2011). High credibility.

The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a powerful predictor of adverse outcomes, but most attention has focused on studies in the setting of reduced eGFR. Here we tested whether patients with an eGFR higher than 60–89.9 ml/min per 1.73 m² could also be at elevated risk of adverse outcomes. Further, we tested whether concomitant proteinuria further increases the risk of outcomes among individuals with an eGFR equal to or above 90 ml/min per 1.73 m², as it does for those with reduced eGFR.

Using data from a population-based outpatient laboratory data set of 1,526,437 patients, we measured adjusted associations between eGFR calculated by the modification of diet in renal disease equation, urine dipstick proteinuria, and adverse clinical outcomes. The adjusted risk of all-cause mortality was lowest at an eGFR of 60–74.9 ml/min per 1.73 m² (referent) and increased at both lower and higher levels of eGFR. Specifically, the hazard ratio of death was 3.7 and 1.8 among patients with an eGFR equal to or above 105 and 90–104.9 ml/min per 1.73 m², respectively, compared to the referent group.

Similar results were seen when the CKD-EPI equation was used to assess eGFR (sensitivity analyses). Higher levels of eGFR were not associated with the risk of kidney failure or myocardial infarction. Thus, the presence and severity of proteinuria was significantly associated with graded increases in the risk of clinical outcomes for both lower and higher eGFR. We do not know, however, whether the finding at higher eGFR could be due to inadequacies of the eGFR formula at low serum levels.

### A programme to spread eGFR graph surveillance for the early identification, support and treatment of people with progressive chronic kidney disease (ASSIST-CKD): protocol for the stepped wedge implementation and evaluation of an intervention to reduce late presentation for renal replacement therapy [^114MksYH]. BMC Nephrology (2017). High credibility.

It is planned that the eGFR graph intervention will be implemented in laboratories serving at least nineteen renal centres across the UK. All sites participating in this quality improvement programme will receive the intervention. However, implementation will proceed in a phased stepped wedge manner ("stepped wedge cluster randomised trial") to allow a robust outcome evaluation to be conducted. Without this design, evaluation of the overall project success may be overly optimistic due to the phenomenon of "early-adopters".

The unit of intervention in the project is the pathology laboratory. However, project outcome measures are aggregated at the level of the renal centre. Where more than one laboratory lies within the catchment of a main renal centre, where possible, the intervention will be implemented in all these laboratories simultaneously.

The intervention will be rolled out sequentially, with renal centre clusters (and their associated pathology laboratories) receiving the intervention at staggered time points. The plan is for four or five renal centres to begin implementation at each "step", with a six-month interval between steps. The time of intervention initiation will be randomised. Crossover is unidirectional (from control to intervention), so eventually all participating centres will implement the intervention.

### Recommendations for kidney disease guideline updating: a report by the KDIGO methods committee [^117JssVV]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Updating rather than de novo guideline development now accounts for the majority of guideline activities for many guideline development organizations, including Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), an international kidney disease guideline development entity that has produced guidelines on kidney diseases since 2008. Increasingly, guideline developers are moving away from updating at fixed intervals in favor of more flexible approaches that use periodic expert assessment of guideline currency (with or without an updated systematic review) to determine the need for updating. Determining the need for guideline updating in an efficient, transparent, and timely manner is challenging, and updating of systematic reviews and guidelines is labor intensive. Ideally, guidelines should be updated dynamically when new evidence indicates a need for a substantive change in the guideline based on a priori criteria. This dynamic updating (sometimes referred to as a living guideline model) can be facilitated with the use of integrated electronic platforms that allow updating of specific recommendations. This report summarizes consensus-based recommendations from a panel of guideline methodology professionals on how to keep KDIGO guidelines up to date.

### Improving chronic kidney disease detection and treatment in the United States: The chronic kidney disease cascade of care (C) study protocol [^115oLdaN]. BMC Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

The enormous public health burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is expected to worsen, with CKD projected to become the fifth leading global cause of death by 2040. Health systems must respond to this global public health challenge by implementing innovative strategies to bridge the significant detection and treatment gaps in CKD care. The overarching goal of the Chronic Kidney Disease Cascade of Care (C³) is to improve CKD detection and treatment in the VA healthcare system — one of the largest integrated health systems in the U.S. The first phase of C³ described in this protocol aims to achieve universal testing for CKD in high-risk patients across three large academic medical centers responsible for the care of a large racially and ethnically diverse patient population.

The focus of C³ is to improve early CKD detection in primary care. In real-world practice, primary care providers (PCPs) are at the frontlines of CKD detection and treatment. Yet, despite increasingly complex care required by patients with numerous comorbidities, the median primary care visit is only 15.7 minutes long. In C³, we aim to improve the CKD primary care detection gap by implementing two interventions that address the major barriers precluding adequate primary-care-based CKD care:

- **Educational intervention**: A comprehensive strategy responsive to the known knowledge and self-efficacy barriers for CKD testing in primary care.
- **Practice facilitation intervention**: This leverages healthcare informatic tools and addresses reported time and physical constraints for CKD detection and treatment in primary care.

Because the combined educational and facilitation approaches are designed to…

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^116WEbkw]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, it is crucial to optimize both glucose control and blood pressure control. Assess urine albumin excretion annually in type 1 diabetic patients with a diabetes duration of five years or more and in all type 2 diabetic patients starting from the time of diagnosis. Additionally, measure serum creatinine at least annually in all adults with diabetes, irrespective of urine albumin excretion levels, to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and stage the level of chronic kidney disease (CKD) if present.

- **Treatment for nonpregnant patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria**: Either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. Although there are no direct comparisons between ACE inhibitors and ARBs, clinical trials support their efficacy in certain cases:
	- In type 1 diabetes patients with hypertension and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay nephropathy progression.
	- In type 2 diabetes patients with hypertension and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been effective in delaying progression to macroalbuminuria.
	- In type 2 diabetes patients with hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay nephropathy progression.
	- If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted.

It's recommended to reduce protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g/kg body weight per day in individuals with diabetes.

### Effect of primary care physicians' use of estimated glomerular filtration rate on the timing of their subspecialty referral decisions [^11357sWG]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary care providers recommended patients for subspecialty care earlier when using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) compared to when they used serum creatinine to estimate kidney function.

- **Recommended referral levels**: The median serum creatinine level (interquartile range (IQR)) at which primary care physicians recommended subspecialty referral was 2.0 (1.8–2.3) mg/dL, corresponding to a median eGFR of 32 (26–36) mL/min/1.73 m², while the median eGFR level at which primary care physicians recommended subspecialty referral was 55 (45–72) mL/min/1.73 m² (p < 0.001). The median (IQR) absolute difference between eGFR and creatinine-based eGFR referral levels was 23 (12–40) mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Patient characteristics**: The improvement in timing of referrals with the use of eGFR was greater for physicians presented with a White hypothetical patient compared to physicians presented with an African American patient. There were no differences in the timing of referrals based on physicians' use of eGFR according to patients' presence or absence of diabetes.

Recommended serum creatinine and eGFR-based referral levels were provided by primary care providers in the clinical scenarios. Lines and bars in Figure 3 represent the range and interquartile range of selected values, respectively. Abbreviations used: eGFR.

- **Table and Figure References**:

- *Table 2* highlighted the recommended serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-based referral levels by characteristics of the hypothetical patient, indicating that the recommended median serum creatinine at referral for all versions of the clinical scenario was 2 mg/dL.

### Effect of primary care physicians' use of estimated glomerular filtration rate on the timing of their subspecialty referral decisions [^116rwgL8]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

There was substantial variation in the levels of eGFR at which U.S. primary care physicians recommended referral (ranging from eGFR of 15 to 100 mL/min/1.73 m²), suggesting that refinement of clinical practice guidelines to clarify the indications for referral may be needed. While very early referrals may be appropriate for patients with gross proteinuria or rapidly declining kidney function, such early referrals among some patients with a lower risk of progression (e.g. elderly persons with reduced but relatively stable kidney function) may be inappropriate in terms of resource utilization and availability of nephrologists. Clarification of clinical circumstances requiring more urgent referrals, as well as dissemination of these recommendations, may provide primary care physicians with greater confidence to care for the growing number of patients with CKD.

Differences in serum creatinine based on patient race and gender are well-established, with greater serum creatinine levels among men and African Americans. The extent to which our finding of physicians' greater improvement in the timing of referrals among Whites compared to African Americans reflects race-based inequities in care is unclear. Since we presented each physician with only one hypothetical patient scenario (featuring a patient of either White or African American race), we were unable to ascertain whether individual physicians' practice patterns would have changed if they saw patients of different races. It is highly possible that later referrals of Whites based on serum creatinine reflect primary care p

### Study protocol of the ALMA-CKD trial; an electronic triggering decision-support system to improve the detection, recognition, and management of patients with chronic kidney disease in primary care [^114nuf9m]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

The study endpoints are defined at the level of individual patients. The primary outcomes focus on creatinine and albuminuria screening within 12 months for those with an indication. Specifically, for each patient visiting one of the participating centers and meeting the indication for annual kidney function screening, we will evaluate and compare whether they received a screening test for these biomarkers. We will evaluate the testing of each filtration marker separately. According to guidelines, patients eligible for screening include those with a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or nephrectomy.

The secondary outcomes address subsequent processes of CKD care:

- **Re-testing of creatinine or albuminuria**: For each patient visiting one of the participating centers and who meets the indication for re-testing of creatinine or albuminuria, we will measure whether a re-test was performed within six months of their original test date. An indication for re-testing creatinine is having an eGFR ≥ 3 mg/mmol in the original test. This analysis will exclude participants already carrying a clinical diagnosis of CKD.

- **Clinical diagnoses of CKD**: For patients continuing to have an eGFR ≥ 3 mg/mmol at re-testing, we will measure the proportion of issued clinical diagnoses of CKD (by ICD-10th system) within six months.

### eGFR: Is it ready for early identification of CKD [^116rp1zq]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Reporting the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with serum creatinine simply provides the information for which the serum creatinine was originally ordered. The purpose of eGFR reporting is not for mass or universal screening. Furthermore, such mass screening does not seem justified. Testing high-risk groups with eGFR and urinary albumin is useful. Population estimates of the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the United States that use the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative staging system lead to disturbingly high estimates. Many of these individuals are elderly with marginally depressed GFRs and have no known therapeutic implications. However, an even more disturbing fraction of people with serious and progressive renal disease are not diagnosed, counseled, or treated.

Reporting of eGFR is only one tool in attempting to rectify this latter problem. Nephrologists need to educate patients and their primary care colleagues in the use of this tool.

### KDIGO 2012 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111BzKRJ]. KDIGO (2013). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for chronic kidney disease" serves as a clinical tool for identifying and diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate early detection of CKD, enabling timely intervention and management to slow disease progression and mitigate associated complications.

The diagnostic criteria for CKD incorporate a range of clinical and laboratory parameters. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a key component, with a GFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² indicating potential CKD. Markers of kidney damage are also integral to the diagnostic process. These include:

- **Albuminuria**: Defined as an albumin excretion rate of 30 mg/24 hours or more, or an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g or more.
- **Other markers**: Urine sediment abnormalities, electrolyte and other abnormalities due to tubular disorders, abnormalities detected by histology, structural abnormalities detected by imaging, and a history of kidney transplantation.

The diagnostic criteria for CKD are met if any one or more of these components are present, reflecting the multifactorial nature of this disease. Conversely, if none of these components are present, the diagnostic criteria for CKD are not met. This comprehensive approach ensures a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of CKD, supporting optimal patient care and management.

### Why we need clinical practice guidelines in chronic kidney disease [^117Hh12L]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have become an essential, useful, and integral part of the practice of medicine in general and for the care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in particular. The reasons why CPGs have proven useful are related to the needs of physicians, patients, and providers.

- **Physician needs**: These stem from the overwhelming amount of new information generated that requires systematic analysis, synthesis, and translation into specific clinically applicable recommendations.

- **Patient needs**: These arise from the desire of an increasingly well-informed public seeking evidence-based information in making joint decisions with their physicians.

- **Provider needs**: These derive from the necessity of appropriate criteria in assessing improved outcomes and in closing existing quality chasms in health care delivery.

In the one patient, one physician clinical encounter setting, guidelines are likely at their best in helping make appropriate decisions in each specific situation. All other uses of CPGs, no matter how meritorious, are secondary derivatives.

### Strategic plan for integrated care of patients with kidney failure [^116Gjyfo]. Kidney International (2020). Low credibility.

There is a significant gap between the number of patients worldwide who require care for kidney failure and those actually receiving safe, sustainable, and equitable treatment. To address this disparity, the International Society of Nephrology coordinated the development of a Strategic Plan for Integrated Care of Patients with Kidney Failure. Implementing this plan will require the engagement of the entire kidney community over the next 5–10 years.

### Grading evidence and recommendations for clinical practice guidelines in nephrology. A position statement from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) [^113urXR2]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Considerable variation in grading systems used to rate the strength of guideline recommendations and the quality of the supporting evidence in nephrology highlights the need for a uniform, internationally accepted, rigorous system. In 2004, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) commissioned a methods expert group to recommend an approach for grading in future nephrology guidelines. This position statement by KDIGO recommends adopting the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for the grading of evidence and guidelines on interventions.

The GRADE approach appraises systematic reviews of the benefits and harms of an intervention to determine its net health benefit. The system considers the design, quality, and quantity of studies as well as the consistency and directness of findings when grading the quality of evidence. The strength of the recommendation builds on the quality of the evidence and additional considerations, including costs. Adaptations of the GRADE approach are presented to address some issues pertinent to the field of nephrology, including:

- **The need to extrapolate from studies performed predominantly in patients without kidney disease**: This adaptation acknowledges the unique challenges in applying general clinical research findings to nephrology patients.

- **The need to use qualitative summaries of effects when it is not feasible to quantitatively summarize them**: This addresses situations where numerical data may not be available or applicable.

Further refinement of the system will be required for grading evidence on questions other than those related to intervention effects, such as diagnostic accuracy and prognosis.

### Primary care-based disease management of chronic kidney disease (CKD), based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, improves patient outcomes [^115saqeU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3–5 are managed within primary care. We describe the effects on patient outcomes of the introduction of an algorithm-based, primary care disease management program (DMP) for patients with CKD based on automated diagnosis using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting.

- **Methods**: Patients within West Lincolnshire Primary Care Trust, UK, population 223,287 with CKD stage 4 or 5 were enrolled within the DMP between March 2005 and October 2006. We have analyzed the performance against clinical targets, examining changes in renal function prior to and following enrollment in the DMP, and the proportion of patients achieving clinical targets for blood pressure control and lipid abnormalities.

- **Results**: Four hundred and eighty-three patients with CKD stage 4 or 5 were enrolled in the program. There were significant improvements in the following parameters, expressed as median values (interquartile range) after 9 months in the program, compared to baseline, and percentage values of patients achieving targets at 9 months: total cholesterol 4.2 (3.45–5.0) mmol/l versus 4.6 (3.9–5.4) mmol/l (P < 0.01), 75.0% versus 64.5% (P < 0.001); LDL 2.2 (1.6–2.8) mmol/l versus 2.5 (1.9–3.2) mmol/l (P < 0.01), 81.9% versus 69.2% (P < 0.05); systolic blood pressure 130 (125–145) mmHg versus 139 (124–154) mmHg (P < 0.05), 56.2% versus 37.1% (P < 0.05); and diastolic blood pressure 71 (65–79) mmHg versus 76 (69–84) mmHg (P < 0.01), 68.4% versus 90.3% (P < 0.01).

### Estimated glomerular filtration rate decline as a predictor of dialysis in kidney transplant recipients [^116CU1Sv]. American Journal of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

It is now common for individuals to require dialysis following the failure of a kidney transplant. Management of complications and preparation for dialysis are suboptimal in this group. To aid planning, it is desirable to estimate the time to dialysis requirement, and the rate of decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may be used for this purpose.

- **Methods**: This study compared the rate of eGFR decline prior to dialysis commencement between individuals with failing transplants and transplant-naïve patients. The rate of eGFR decline was also compared between transplant recipients with and without graft failure. eGFR was calculated using the four-variable MDRD equation, with the rate of decline calculated by least squares linear regression.

- **Results**: The annual rate of eGFR decline in incident dialysis patients with graft failure exceeded that of the transplant-naïve incident dialysis patients. In the transplant cohort, the mean annual rate of eGFR decline prior to graft failure was 7.3 ml/min/1.73 m² compared to 4.8 ml/min/1.73 m² in the transplant-naïve group (p < 0.001) and 0.35 ml/min/1.73 m² in recipients without graft failure (p < 0.001). Factors associated with eGFR decline were recipient age, decade of transplantation, HLA mismatch, and histological evidence of chronic immunological injury.

- **Conclusions**: Individuals with graft failure have a rapid decline in eGFR prior to dialysis commencement. To improve outcomes, dialysis planning and management of chronic kidney disease complications should be initiated earlier than in the transplant-naïve population.

### Effect of primary care physicians' use of estimated glomerular filtration rate on the timing of their subspecialty referral decisions [^115sM5Sd]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary care providers' suboptimal recognition of the severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) may contribute to untimely referrals of patients with CKD to subspecialty care. It is unknown whether U.S. primary care physicians' use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), rather than serum creatinine, to estimate CKD severity could improve the timeliness of their subspecialty referral decisions.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 154 United States primary care physicians to assess the effect of the use of eGFR (versus creatinine) on the timing of their subspecialty referrals. Primary care physicians completed a questionnaire featuring questions regarding a hypothetical White or African American patient with progressing CKD. We asked primary care physicians to identify the serum creatinine and eGFR levels at which they would recommend patients like the hypothetical patient be referred for subspecialty evaluation. We assessed significant improvement in the timing [from eGFR < 30 to ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²] of their recommended referrals based on their use of creatinine versus eGFR.

- **Results**: Primary care physicians recommended subspecialty referrals later (CKD more advanced) when using creatinine versus eGFR to assess kidney function [median eGFR 32 versus 55 mL/min/1.73 m², p < 0.001]. Forty percent of primary care physicians significantly improved the timing of their referrals when basing their recommendations on eGFR. Improved timing occurred more frequently among primary care physicians practicing in academic (versus non-academic) practices.

### Clinical practice guideline on management of older patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3b or higher (eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²): a summary document from the European Renal Best Practice Group [^1115UVxL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

The population of patients with moderate and severe CKD is growing, with frail and older patients comprising an increasing proportion. Many studies still exclude this group, so the evidence base is limited. In 2013, the advisory board of ERBP, in collaboration with the European Union of Geriatric Medicine Societies (EUGMS), initiated the development of a guideline on the management of older patients with CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m²). The full guideline has recently been published and is freely available online on the website of ERBP (www.european-renal-best-practice.org). This paper summarizes the main recommendations of the guideline and their underlying rationales.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^112vVf49]. BMC Nephrology (2018). High credibility.

- **Treatment of CKD-MBD targeted at lowering high serum phosphate and maintaining serum calcium**: In 2009, the KDIGO guideline suggested for patients with CKD stages 3–5 to maintain serum phosphorus in the normal range (2C). For patients with CKD stage 5D, it suggested lowering elevated phosphorus levels toward the normal range (2C).

The 2017 KDIGO update recommends that in patients with CKD G3a-G5D, treatments of CKD-MBD should be based on serial assessments of phosphate, calcium, and PTH levels, considered together (not graded). Specifically, it suggests lowering elevated phosphate levels toward the normal range (2C).

- **Rationale for section 4.1.1**: The revised KDIGO 2017 guidance emphasizes the importance of considering all variables together with acknowledgment of trends rather than specific values. This is a new recommendation for KDIGO, aligning with the previous RA guidance (2015), which also recommended making decisions based on the entire available dataset.

Previous targets for individual parameters were derived from observational data showing levels associated with the lowest risk of mortality and morbidity. Phosphate, calcium, and PTH each have levels that may be associated with poorer outcomes. However, treatment strategies addressing one of these often affect the others, leading to potential trade-offs between benefits and changes in the other variables. The interplay of different levels and their effects on outcomes has been explored to highlight the complexity involved in the treatment of CKD-MBD.

### The management of CKD: A look into the future [^114RU2Gb]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

The increasing global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease, along with the associated spiraling costs, has profound public health and economic implications. This has made slowing the progression of CKD a major healthcare priority. CKD is invariably characterized by progressive kidney fibrosis. At present, treatment aiming to slow the progression of CKD is limited to aggressive blood pressure control, with few therapies targeting the fibrotic process itself. In this review, we explore the potential of experimental therapeutic strategies based on preventing or reversing the pathophysiologic steps of kidney remodeling that lead to fibrosis.

- **T2DM**: Patients must have a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Albuminuria > 30 mg/g**: Elevated levels of albumin in the urine, greater than 30 mg per gram.

- **eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m²**: Estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25 mL per minute per 1.73 square meters or higher.

- **Potassium < 4.8 mEq/L**: Serum potassium levels below 4.8 milliequivalents per liter.

- **Symptoms or signs attributable to kidney failure**: This includes neurological signs and symptoms attributable to uremia, pericarditis, anorexia, medically resistant acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities, intractable pruritus, serositis, and acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities.

- **Inability to control volume status or blood pressure (BP)**.

- **Progressive deterioration in nutritional status**: This condition must be refractory to dietary intervention or associated with cognitive impairment.

### Canadian society of nephrology commentary on the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for CKD evaluation and management [^112yEMN8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

We congratulate the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) work group on their comprehensive work in a broad subject area and agree with many of the recommendations in their clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. We concur with the KDIGO definitions and classification of kidney disease and welcome the addition of albuminuria categories at all levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the terminology of G categories rather than stages to describe the level of GFR, the division of former stage 3 into new G categories 3a and 3b, and the addition of the underlying diagnosis.

We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant.

- **Blood pressure recommendations**: We recommend a target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

- **Dietary recommendations**: We recommend against routine protein restriction and do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to 3.3 g/d.

- **Anemia and hemoglobin targets**: We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and concur on the individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets.

### Meeting the challenges of the new K/DOQI guidelines [^114Y6ggm]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Substantial gains in the dialytic treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease have been made over the past several decades. However, inadequate attention has been given to the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a whole. CKD and its associated complications emerge years before patients develop kidney failure and become dialysis dependent.

It is now evident that to improve dialysis outcomes, it is essential for practitioners to recognize the earlier stages of CKD. This not only helps to slow disease progression but also allows for the prevention and treatment of its complications and comorbidities long before dialysis is needed. The recently published National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines identify the broad-based problem of CKD in the general population and introduce action plans applicable at different stages of CKD.

This article discusses the process behind the development of the CKD guidelines and highlights the disease evaluation, classification, and stratification system provided by the guidelines. It is hoped that widespread implementation of these recommendations will increase the understanding of CKD among both providers and patients. Such implementation could eliminate many of the obstacles nephrologists face in providing optimal care to dialysis patients in particular and to patients with CKD in general.
