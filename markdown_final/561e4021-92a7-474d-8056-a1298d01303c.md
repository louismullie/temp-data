## Question

My doctor prescribed statins for my heart but I get aches and pains when I take them - what should I do?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what to do when experiencing muscle aches and pains while taking statins for heart health. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing true pharmacologic statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) from nocebo or other etiologies. Then, I should verify contributing factors and risk modifiers. Next, I will consider initial management strategies, including dose reduction, statin switching, and intermittent dosing. After that, I need to evaluate when and how to rechallenge. Then, I should review non-statin options and their evidence base. Finally, I will integrate shared decision-making, monitoring, and follow-up, and I will double-check special scenarios like rhabdomyolysis and autoimmune myopathy before concluding with a practical algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions. True statin-associated muscle symptoms are typically bilateral, proximal, and temporally linked to statin initiation or dose escalation, often resolving with discontinuation. Importantly, most SAMS in practice are not due to direct pharmacologic effects, with randomized data suggesting only about 1–2% of cases are pharmacologic, whereas observational reports range 5–25% due to misattribution and nocebo effects, so I need to check for temporal patterns and prior musculoskeletal history before labeling this as statin causality [^116rNwHM] [^114WRvuh] [^112WpFcP] [^111CxHRy].

> Wait, let me verify the symptom profile and timing. Typical SAMS present within 4–6 weeks of starting or increasing a statin, involve large proximal muscle groups symmetrically, and improve or resolve after stopping the drug. I should also ask about functional impact, because mild symptoms that do not impair activities of daily living are managed differently than symptoms that meaningfully degrade quality of life, and I should document severity, distribution, and timing carefully to support subsequent rechallenge decisions [^113UzvxY] [^114ikdbV] [^116LJUy9].

> I need to check for alternative and contributing causes before attributing everything to the statin. Let me consider hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, recent vigorous exercise, drug–drug interactions via CYP3A4 or P-gp, and other medications that can cause myalgias. I should also review CK only if symptoms are severe, persistent, or accompanied by weakness, because routine CK testing is not indicated for mild myalgias, and I should remember that CK elevations less than 3× ULN are common and often benign in this context [^116rNwHM] [^111saCQb] [^117XaPPe].

> Hold on, I should verify the nocebo contribution and set expectations. Blinded n-of-1 trials show most patients with prior statin-associated muscle complaints do not have higher symptom scores on statin versus placebo, and many intend to restart statins after the trial, underscoring expectation effects; framing symptoms realistically, discussing the low absolute risk of true pharmacologic SAMS, and emphasizing the cardiovascular benefits of statins can mitigate nocebo and improve adherence and outcomes [^112WpFcP] [^111CxHRy] [^116xS3xK].

> Next, I should review initial management strategies. If symptoms are mild and not functionally limiting, continuation with supportive measures such as hydration, stretching, and sleep optimization is reasonable. If symptoms persist or are more bothersome, I should consider dose reduction to the lowest effective dose, switch to a different statin with different pharmacokinetics, or use intermittent dosing with longer half-life agents like atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, because these approaches improve tolerability in 60–80% of patients reporting SAMS [^115NvKJ7] [^115U79Cs] [^116Bfu6Q].

> Let me think about statin selection and pharmacology, and I should double-check my assumptions. Statins vary in lipophilicity, CYP3A4/P-gp dependence, and half-life; switching from a CYP3A4-metabolized, lipophilic statin like simvastatin or atorvastatin to a hydrophilic, non–CYP3A4 statin such as rosuvastatin or pravastatin can improve tolerability, and using lower milligram strengths or intermittent schedules can further reduce adverse effects while preserving much of the LDL-C lowering benefit [^112fhLwP] [^116YsQWr] [^115U79Cs].

> I will now examine intermittent dosing more closely. Alternate-day or three-times-weekly regimens with rosuvastatin or atorvastatin can achieve roughly 12–38% LDL-C reductions and are tolerated by many previously intolerant patients; I should specify a fixed schedule such as Monday/Wednesday/Friday rather than vague "every other day" to improve adherence and predictability, and I should reassess symptoms after 4–6 weeks to decide on further titration or combination therapy [^111Rja8b] [^112W1teT] [^115U79Cs].

> But wait, what if symptoms recur despite these changes? I should confirm statin intolerance using a structured rechallenge: discontinue the offending statin until symptoms resolve, then rechallenge with a different statin at the lowest approved dose, documenting recurrence and resolution patterns; most patients can ultimately tolerate some statin regimen, and guidelines support attempting at least two different statins, including one at the lowest dose, before declaring true intolerance [^115ycwqh] [^116Bfu6Q] [^113r8MLh].

> Next, I should review non-statin therapies for patients who fail statin rechallenge or cannot achieve LDL-C goals on submaximal statin dosing. Ezetimibe is first-line and reduces LDL-C by about 18–20% with excellent tolerability; bempedoic acid provides an additional 15–25% reduction and is particularly relevant for statin-intolerant patients, though uric acid and gout risk should be discussed; PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies lower LDL-C by 50–60% and reduce events, and inclisiran offers about 50% LDL-C lowering with twice-yearly dosing but lacks outcomes data in purely statin-intolerant populations, so selection should be risk- and cost-informed [^116DmXXe] [^111P71KK] [^116qUuzd].

> Hold on, I should verify combination strategies and sequencing. Adding ezetimibe to a low or moderate-intensity statin can achieve greater than 50% LDL-C reductions in many patients with fewer muscle symptoms than high-intensity statin monotherapy, and the RACING program demonstrated better persistence and LDL-C goal attainment with rosuvastatin 10 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg versus rosuvastatin 20 mg alone, supporting a combination-first approach when SAMS limit statin dose [^111Fv2Jw] [^115NvKJ7].

> I need to ensure shared decision-making is embedded throughout. Discussing absolute cardiovascular risk, the consequences of statin discontinuation including higher event rates and mortality, and the trade-offs of intermittent dosing versus non-statin therapy improves alignment. I should also acknowledge patient frustration with "trial-and-error", set realistic expectations about mild early symptoms that often resolve, and document decisions respectfully to support continuity and trust [^114SpxsA] [^11492wMy] [^113HLYWz].

> Let me reconsider monitoring and follow-up. I should check a lipid panel 4–12 weeks after any statin or non-statin change, reassess symptoms at each visit using a structured approach, and only obtain CK if symptoms are severe, persistent, or accompanied by weakness. If CK exceeds 3× ULN, I should hold the statin and investigate, and if CK exceeds 10× ULN without an alternative explanation, I should stop therapy and evaluate for rhabdomyolysis or autoimmune etiologies before any rechallenge [^113gkg8n] [^115FofgK] [^117XaPPe] [^1155P7Yg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated the role of vitamin D and CoQ10. I should confirm that routine supplementation is not guideline-endorsed for SAMS. While correcting vitamin D deficiency is reasonable for bone health and may theoretically help muscle symptoms, randomized evidence is lacking, and CoQ10 has not shown consistent benefit in trials, so I should avoid recommending these solely for SAMS mitigation outside of shared decision-making and individual circumstances [^116eMV9u] [^112ERkWf].

> I should double-check special scenarios. If there is severe pain with marked CK elevation and dark urine, I must suspect rhabdomyolysis, stop the statin immediately, provide hydration, and avoid rechallenge. If there is progressive weakness with persistent CK elevation and autoantibodies to HMG-CoA reductase, I should consider necrotizing autoimmune myopathy and refer to neuromuscular specialists, as this requires immunotherapy and indefinite statin avoidance [^115FofgK] [^1155P7Yg].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach to ensure nothing is missed. First, confirm the symptom phenotype and temporal relation, screen for secondary causes, and document baseline function. Second, if symptoms are mild, continue the statin with supportive care. Third, if symptoms persist, reduce dose, switch to a different statin with different pharmacokinetics, or implement intermittent dosing. Fourth, if symptoms recur, perform a structured rechallenge with at least two statins. Fifth, if intolerance persists or goals are unmet, add or transition to non-statin therapy based on risk and cost. Sixth, monitor lipids and symptoms at 4–12 weeks and adjust iteratively with shared decision-making and clear documentation [^115ycwqh] [^116Bfu6Q] [^115NvKJ7].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and ensure the evidence is aligned. Most patients reporting SAMS can ultimately tolerate some statin regimen through dose optimization, switching, or intermittent dosing, and the cardiovascular benefits of maintaining statin therapy or appropriate non-statin alternatives outweigh the risks of untreated dyslipidemia; preserving LDL-C lowering, ideally achieving at least a 30–50% reduction or guideline-directed absolute goals, remains the clinical priority while respecting patient preferences and tolerability constraints [^115NvKJ7] [^115BLpbC] [^114SpxsA].

If statins cause muscle aches, **try a lower dose or switch to another statin** (especially pravastatin or rosuvastatin) [^116YsQWr] [^112fhLwP], and consider **alternate-day dosing** [^111Rja8b] [^115U79Cs]. Most patients can tolerate some statin regimen [^115NvKJ7], and **statin discontinuation increases cardiovascular risk** [^114SpxsA] [^115HPb5C]. If symptoms persist, add or switch to non-statin therapies such as ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or bempedoic acid [^116qUuzd] [^111P71KK]. Evaluate for other causes (vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism, drug interactions) [^111saCQb] and use shared decision-making to balance benefits and tolerability [^116rNwHM] [^11492wMy].

## Clinical significance of muscle aches associated with statins

Muscle aches are the **most common side effect** of statins, with a reported prevalence of 5–20% in observational studies [^112VTK5P]; however, randomized controlled trials show a much lower incidence (~1–2%) [^114WRvuh] [^111qRnya], suggesting many cases are due to the nocebo effect or other factors [^112WpFcP] [^111CxHRy]. True statin-induced myopathy is rare (~0.1%) and rhabdomyolysis is extremely rare (~0.01%) [^117UHuFY] [^115BLpbC].

---

## Risk factors for statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)

Several factors **increase the risk** of SAMS:

- **High-dose statins**: Higher doses, especially of atorvastatin or simvastatin, increase risk [^111WJhXw].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, macrolides) raise risk [^113UzvxY].
- **Medical conditions**: Hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, renal impairment, and genetic polymorphisms increase susceptibility [^111saCQb] [^114XdBau].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Excessive alcohol intake and intense physical activity can exacerbate symptoms [^114XdBau].

---

## Management strategies for statin-induced muscle aches

### 1. Dose adjustment and statin switching

- **Lower dose**: Reduce to the lowest effective dose [^115U79Cs].
- **Switch statins**: Try pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or fluvastatin, which are less lipophilic and may be better tolerated [^116YsQWr] [^112fhLwP].
- **Alternate-day dosing**: Use long half-life statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin) for better tolerability [^111Rja8b] [^115U79Cs].

---

### 2. Non-statin lipid-lowering therapies

If statins remain intolerant, **consider**:

| **Medication** | **Ldl-c reduction** | **Cardiovascular benefit** |
|-|-|-|
| Ezetimibe | 15–25% | Yes |
| PCSK9 inhibitors | 50–60% | Yes |
| Bempedoic acid | 15–25% | Yes (CLEAR Outcomes) |
| Bile acid sequestrants | 15–30% | Limited |

---

### 3. Adjunctive therapies and lifestyle modifications

- **Coenzyme Q10**: Evidence is mixed; may help some patients [^112ERkWf] [^117XaPPe].
- **Vitamin D supplementation**: Correct deficiency if present [^116eMV9u].
- **Lifestyle changes**: Diet, exercise, and weight loss can reduce LDL-C and improve tolerance [^116xS3xK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**: confirm SAMS, adjust dose or switch statins, and use non-statin therapies if needed [^115ycwqh] [^116Bfu6Q]. Shared decision-making is essential to balance benefits and tolerability [^116rNwHM] [^11492wMy].

---

## Potential risks of statin discontinuation

Stopping statins increases **cardiovascular risk** [^114SpxsA], with higher rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality [^114SpxsA]. Maintaining some statin therapy is preferred when possible [^115NvKJ7].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing management decisions

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Higher risk patients may benefit from PCSK9 inhibitors or bempedoic acid [^117XaPPe] [^111P71KK].
- **Comorbidities**: Hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and genetic factors should be addressed [^111saCQb] [^114XdBau].
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making improves adherence and outcomes [^116xS3xK] [^114jGbC1].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should track symptoms, lipid levels, and adherence; **CK testing** is reserved for severe symptoms or suspected myopathy [^113nJwhd] [^113gkg8n].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Muscle aches from statins are common but often manageable. Use dose adjustment, statin switching, and non-statin therapies as needed, and address other causes. Avoiding **unnecessary statin discontinuation** is important to preserve cardiovascular benefit [^115BLpbC].

Strategies for accurate and respectful SAMS documentation: Rather than describing a patient as "non-compliant" or "non-adherent", be specific about the behaviors and/or reasoning; use "reported" or "described" instead of "complained of" when documenting SAMS as well as other patient-reported outcomes; and document medication treatment plans in sufficient and clear detail to inform other clinicians as well as patients who review their clinic notes.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline — risk discussion and assessment for statin therapy states that a clinician–patient risk discussion focused on indications, benefits, risks of statin-associated side effects, and patient concerns and preferences should precede initiation of statin treatment. The majority of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are subjective myalgia (pain, aches) in the absence of other findings; myalgia is more likely to be statin associated if it is bilateral, involves proximal muscles, has onset within weeks to months after initiation of statins, and resolves after discontinuation. A thorough assessment of symptoms is recommended, with evaluation for nonstatin etiologies, assessment of predisposing factors, and a physical exam; future encounters should address statin response, emphasize adherence, and reaffirm benefit.

View the guide. Why is it important to understand the benefits and risks of statins.

Most heart attacks and strokes are preventable by practicing a healthy lifestyle, and when necessary, taking medications to lower blood pressure or cholesterol or to help quit smoking. Statins, when used as indicated, can dramatically reduce a person's risk of having a heart attack or stroke, but millions of people are missing that opportunity. Some clinicians may miss prescribing a statin to a person who can benefit. Many times, individuals stop or do not start taking a statin due to concerns about side effects. The good news is that understanding your individual benefits and risks and working through your concerns with your clinician can help you prevent heart attacks and strokes and enjoy a longer, healthier life. What is a statin and how does it work. Statins are a class of medicines used to lower cholesterol. While some of the cholesterol in your blood comes from food, most is made by the liver.

Statins work by reducing the amount of cholesterol made by the liver and helping the liver remove cholesterol that is already in the blood. Statins may also reduce inflammation in the artery walls. This can lead to blockages that damage organs such as the heart and brain. What are the benefits of statins. Scientific studies and years of use all over the world have proven that statins, when used as indicated, reduce a person's chances of having a heart attack or stroke; needing surgery, angioplasty, or stenting to improve blood flow in an artery; and dying from a heart attack. The higher a person's risk of having a heart attack or stroke, the stronger the benefit of the statin. The benefit increases the longer the statin is taken. In general, taking a statin can cut a person's risk of a heart attack or stroke in half. What are the risks of a statin. Serious risks are rare.

Studies involving thousands of people show no differences in muscle aches, liver abnormalities, dementia, memory problems, or cancer between those taking a statin and those on an inactive pill. Despite these findings, just over one in four people taking a statin describes some symptom, most commonly muscle aches or weakness. It is important to note that muscle-related symptoms are also common with aging and in active adults who are not on statins. Very uncommon risks associated with statins including a type of stroke caused by bleeding, muscle damage that can usually be detected with a blood test, and increased blood sugar levels or new-onset diabetes in those who are prone to developing diabetes. The large benefit of taking statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes likely outweighs the small risk associated with an elevated blood sugar level. How can side effects be managed when taking a statin.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^111oD8yT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin intolerance and side effects — evaluation and management — notes that symptoms reported with statin use include mainly muscle-related complaints (myalgias), and observational studies have failed to find significant evidence for memory loss in those on longer-term statin therapy, despite anecdotal reports of short-term memory impairment. Because musculoskeletal complaints are common without statin therapy, an evaluation of such complaints to assess other possible causes should be undertaken before attributing symptoms to statins, and concomitant therapies may interact with statins, increasing the risk of muscle symptoms. For patients with statin intolerance, symptoms may improve when switched to a different statin; other strategies that may be used include limiting the daily dosage and modified regimens such as every other day or once weekly dosing with statins that have a long half-life. In some patients, it may be possible to switch to an alternative concomitant therapy to enhance statin tolerance, and for patients who cannot tolerate a statin within the previously discussed strategies, a nonstatin drug alone or in combination with another cholesterol-lowering agent may be considered. A modest increase in risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus has been observed with statin therapy in RCTs, and higher intensity statin therapy appears to increase risk to a greater extent than less-intensive regimens.

### Statin associated muscle symptoms: an update and review [^112EZDf9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy has been shown to have a significant effect on lowering of low-density lipoprotien cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. This subsequently results in cardiovascular (CV) benefit through reduction in major adverse CV disease (CVD) events and overall mortality. Although there is well proven clinical benefit, statin therapy may be discontinued in some patients, and the most common cause for discontinuation is concern for statin-associated muscle symptoms. However, the data on the true prevalence of these symptoms is mixed and continued studies are showing that the symptoms may be less prevalent than previously believed. With statin-associated muscle symptoms being the most common reason for a patient to not be on statin therapy, it is important for physicians to understand how to evaluate for and manage these symptoms. This manuscript provides an overview of statin associated muscle symptoms so that physicians may be able to better manage patients on statin therapy and continue to use these medications when indicated to best reduce future risk of CVD for patients.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^112uVZ1e]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Q: What are patients willing to tolerate with respect to muscle pain?

Stiffness in a pattern similar to that seen with arthritis does occur with statins, in opposition to a broad general opinion that it does not occur.

It may be detrimental to describe myalgia for patients with brochures and pamphlets, as it then becomes a self‐fulfilling prophecy.

There are reporting biases that emerge; when asked if they are experiencing aches and pains, most patients will respond in the affirmative.

Q: Should patients accept muscle pain from statin use?

Dr. Wong: Consider niacin, for example; if a patient experiences flushing on niacin, that means the drug is working. The question then becomes: At what level should muscle pains be considered intolerable if the patient is expecting them to occur?

It is important to differentiate between myalgia, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis; even if a patient has myalgia in the absence of CK elevations, if they simply cannot tolerate the statin, that is statin intolerance.

Q: If a patient is intolerant of one statin, is it appropriate to try another?

Often, many different statins must be tried before success is achieved, in opposition to the opinion that 2 to 3 is the maximum that should be tried.

The specific definition is the inability to tolerate ≥ 2 statins, 1 at the highest prescribed daily dose, and the second at any daily dose. That is the current regulatory and clinical‐trial definition. It is a problematic definition, because 2 iterations may not be enough, given the heterogeneity of response among individual patients.

The definition should require more than one re‐challenge and more than 1 product, barring extraordinary circumstances.

Most patients are able to tolerate some statin at some given dose.

### Interpretation of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of statin therapy [^115BLpbC]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

This Review is intended to help clinicians, patients, and the public make informed decisions about statin therapy for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It explains how the evidence that is available from randomised controlled trials yields reliable information about both the efficacy and safety of statin therapy. In addition, it discusses how claims that statins commonly cause adverse effects reflect a failure to recognise the limitations of other sources of evidence about the effects of treatment. Large-scale evidence from randomised trials shows that statin therapy reduces the risk of major vascular events (ie, coronary deaths or myocardial infarctions, strokes, and coronary revascularisation procedures) by about one-quarter for each mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol during each year (after the first) that it continues to be taken. The absolute benefits of statin therapy depend on an individual's absolute risk of occlusive vascular events and the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol that is achieved. For example, lowering LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L (77 mg/dL) with an effective low-cost statin regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, costing about £2 per month) for 5 years in 10000 patients would typically prevent major vascular events from occurring in about 1000 patients (ie, 10% absolute benefit) with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease (secondary prevention) and in 500 patients (ie, 5% absolute benefit) who are at increased risk but have not yet had a vascular event (primary prevention). Statin therapy has been shown to reduce vascular disease risk during each year it continues to be taken, so larger absolute benefits would accrue with more prolonged therapy, and these benefits persist long term. The only serious adverse events that have been shown to be caused by long-term statin therapy-ie, adverse effects of the statin-are myopathy (defined as muscle pain or weakness combined with large increases in blood concentrations of creatine kinase), new-onset diabetes mellitus, and, probably, haemorrhagic stroke. Typically, treatment of 10000 patients for 5 years with an effective regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily) would cause about 5 cases of myopathy (one of which might progress, if the statin therapy is not stopped, to the more severe condition of rhabdomyolysis), 50–100 new cases of diabetes, and 5–10 haemorrhagic strokes. However, any adverse impact of these side-effects on major vascular events has already been taken into account in the estimates of the absolute benefits. Statin therapy may cause symptomatic adverse events (eg, muscle pain or weakness) in up to about 50–100 patients (ie, 0·5–1·0% absolute harm) per 10000 treated for 5 years. However, placebo-controlled randomised trials have shown definitively that almost all of the symptomatic adverse events that are attributed to statin therapy in routine practice are not actually caused by it (ie, they represent misattribution). The large-scale evidence available from randomised trials also indicates that it is unlikely that large absolute excesses in other serious adverse events still await discovery. Consequently, any further findings that emerge about the effects of statin therapy would not be expected to alter materially the balance of benefits and harms. It is, therefore, of concern that exaggerated claims about side-effect rates with statin therapy may be responsible for its under-use among individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular events. For, whereas the rare cases of myopathy and any muscle-related symptoms that are attributed to statin therapy generally resolve rapidly when treatment is stopped, the heart attacks or strokes that may occur if statin therapy is stopped unnecessarily can be devastating.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^114VtFiu]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In this case, the patient's muscle symptoms are consistent with SAMS. A stepwise approach to statin rechallenge and dose de-escalation should be attempted. If statin intolerance persists, nonstatin therapies such as ezetimibe or bempedoic acid should be initiated to achieve appropriate LDL-C reduction. For primary prevention, a target LDL-C reduction of 30% or a level < 100 mg/dL is appropriate, while in secondary prevention, more aggressive targets would be required. Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to ensure efficacy and adherence to therapy. As noted earlier, this is consistent with the ACC ECDP. The ESC and CCS guidelines are more limited in discussion of statin intolerance and merely note that ezetimibe and PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are options for treatment depending on clinical situation and cost.

Patients with muscle symptoms and elevated serum creatine kinase levels (> 4× upper limit of normal)

For patients at low CVD risk who have symptoms with CK > 4× ULN, the statin should be stopped and the need for statin reassessed. If considered important, a lower dose of an alternative statin should be tried and CK monitored. For patients at high CVD risk with muscle symptoms and a CK of > 4× ULN (but < 10× ULN), statin therapy can be continued with concomitant monitoring of CK, but stopped (at least temporarily) if the levels exceed 10× ULN. In this case, that particular statin regimen should not be restarted. If CK levels decrease after stopping the statin, restarting at a lower statin dose with CK monitoring should be tried. If, however, CK elevation persists, there may be an underlying myopathy (e.g. hypothyroidism or a metabolic muscle disorder), and referral to a neuromuscular specialist should be considered.

In patients with a CK > 10× ULN for which no secondary cause (e.g. exercise) can be found, statin therapy should be stopped because of the potential risk of rhabdomyolysis. If the CK level subsequently returns to normal, re-challenge with a lower dose of an alternative statin and careful monitoring of symptoms and CK may be considered. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected, statin should not be reintroduced. Rhabdomyolysis should be considered if there is severe muscular pain, general weakness and signs of myoglobinaemia or myoglobinuria. These patients, and those with very high CK levels (e.g. > 40× ULN), should be referred for evaluation of renal damage (urinalysis, serum creatinine levels). Intravenous hydration and urine alkalinisation are recommended for the treatment of rhabdomyolyis depending on severity and the presence of kidney injury. If indicated, non-statin LDL-C lowering agents should be used (see below).

### Coronary artery calcium scoring in patients with statin associated muscle symptoms: prescribing statins for those most likely to benefit [^114ZTvgt]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). Medium credibility.

For primary prevention, statin therapy reduces the incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in adults with intermediate or high estimated 10-year risk using traditional population-based risk calculators. While a variety of reported symptoms may limit statin adherence, muscle complaints, whether typical or atypical of that associated with statin therapy, are the most common reported by patients. Because additional testing, alteration in the patient's medical regimen and subsequent medical visits are often required, an informed clinician-patient discussion and shared decision making are necessary to achieve the best outcomes. The authors provide support for the perspective that coronary calcium scoring, by individualizing estimated risk and helping to identify those most likely to benefit, plays a vital role in preventive therapy decision-making for the primary prevention patient with troublesome muscle complaints attributed to statin therapy.

### New insights into managing symptoms during statin therapy [^114EFKpq]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptoms during statin therapy are common and often attributed to statin intolerance. Recent data suggest few patients are truly intolerant to statins. Muscle symptoms are similar in statin and control groups in blinded treatment periods of clinical trials. The "nocebo" effect may occur during open-label statin treatment, when previously asymptomatic study participants report symptoms attributed to statin therapy, or during placebo-controlled trials. Most patients reporting statin intolerance can tolerate blinded moderate intensity statin therapy. In clinical practice the large majority of patients are willing to retry a statin, and of those who do, > 80–90% successfully remain on statin therapy long-term. Emerging evidence from brain imaging studies and contemporary approaches to pain management suggests that building trust and managing patient expectations can minimize the "nocebo" effect in statin-treated patients.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and nutraceuticals in statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — guidance: Use of CoQ10 is not supported by most guideline recommendations for mitigation of SAMS, and until a well-designed RCT is completed in those with SAMS and low levels of CoQ10, such a strategy cannot be currently recommended. Nutraceuticals should not be promoted to replace pharmaceutical grade, evidenced-based, lipid-lowering therapies; however, they may have a niche role as complementary to statins and non-statins in some statin intolerant patients.

Alternative statin selection for rechallenge after CYP3A4/P-gp exposure: If a patient had adverse drug reactions while taking both atorvastatin and simvastatin, which rely on CYP3A4 and P-gp for biotransformation and are lipophilic, an appropriate alternative for statin rechallenge may be rosuvastatin or pravastatin, which circumvent shared pharmacokinetic properties, metabolizing enzymes (avoid CYP3A4), and transporters (avoid P-gp) compared to atorvastatin and simvastatin.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^115U79Cs]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — statin dosing strategies to optimize tolerability include using a lower dose, switching to a different statin or biotransformation pathway, intermittent dosing with longer half-life statins, evidence-based selection, naturally derived options, choosing the lowest milligram strength, and temporary washout. Consider using the lowest daily dose which will provide the majority of the statin's low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering capacity; for example, a patient with SAMS on atorvastatin 80 mg daily may tolerate atorvastatin 10 mg daily. Intermittent dosing is reserved for more severe cases where patients cannot tolerate even the lowest daily dose, and utilizing statins with longer half-lives and greater potency (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) is recommended in this context, such as rosuvastatin 5 mg given three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for a patient with SAMS on atorvastatin 10–80 mg daily. Some patients may be more accepting of statins shown to have reduced rates of SAMS in clinical trials (e.g., consider fluvastatin-XL or pravastatin instead of simvastatin), may prefer a naturally derived statin (e.g., lovastatin is FDA-approved whereas red yeast rice is not), or may accept a drug with a lower milligram strength (e.g., pitavastatin 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg versus 10 to 80 mg for other statins). Some patients may benefit from a washout period or drug holiday, for example a patient taking rosuvastatin 20 mg daily who takes a 1–2 week drug holiday in preparation for a strenuous physical event, and holding the statin for a few days to a few weeks before restarting may improve persistence rates. Although the table emphasizes dosing strategies, optimizing dietary and lifestyle interventions is recommended for all patients.

Importance of Helping Patients Continue to Take Statins

Adherence markedly affects outcomes in high‐risk patients. In a recent study of guideline‐based treatment in peripheral vascular disease, 4 patients adhering to all 4 therapies had a nearly 40% reduction in major cardiovascular events and a 45% reduction in adverse limb events. Inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase (HMG‐CoA [statins]) markedly reduce cardiovascular risk, particularly in high‐risk patients. In a large meta‐analysis of clinical trials, each 1‐mmol/L reduction of low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduced cardiovascular events by just over 20% 5; importantly, this benefit was independent of the baseline LDL cholesterol. The authors concluded that "reduction of LDL cholesterol by 2 to 3 mmol/L would reduce occlusive vascular events by about 40% to 50%". Stopping a medication that reduces risk by half is equivalent to doubling risk; it is, therefore, an important problem that so many patients stop statins. Evidence now supports statin treatment in primary prevention, 6 and recent revision of guidelines on treatment of cholesterol 7 will result in statin treatment of many more patients, 8 so persistence with statin therapy is an issue that is increasing in importance. In discussion with patients who believe they are having adverse effects of statins, it is important to evaluate the likelihood that the symptoms are caused by statins or to some other cause. A history of probably causal adverse effects (myalgia, cramps, weakness), particularly with repeat occurrence of adverse effects after re‐trial of statin following a drug holiday or after a recent increase in dose or potency of statin, will be convincing evidence that the statin is causing the adverse effect; this may be supported by increased blood levels of creatine kinase. Less convincing will a history of symptoms attributed to statin that are unlikely to be causally related, as described later, particularly when the new symptoms arose after a long period of well‐tolerated statin.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^111WJhXw]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 5.
Approach to the patient with statin intolerance.

Some of the muscle symptoms reported with statins may be due to a nocebo effect, suggested by the findings of N-of-1 statin trials and by the lack of a signal for SAMS in blinded trials. Furthermore, most patients who are intolerant to 1 statin can successfully be switched to another statin.

Management of SAMS (Fig. 5) starts with a conversation with the individual patient about the indication for statin treatment and the expected benefit of continued therapy. Preference for continued statin therapy over alternatives should be stressed. For those patients with SAMS and elevation in CK < 5× ULN, options include continuation of the statin without discontinuation if symptoms are tolerable. If discontinuation is favored, symptoms should be reassessed after 2 to 4 weeks. If no improvement is noted, symptoms are likely unrelated to the statin and statin can be reinitiated. If symptoms improve, options include cautiously rechallenging with the original offending statin or switching to an alternative statin, at the usual starting doses. If symptoms recur with this challenge or CK was > 5× ULN at initial assessment, options include rechallenge of the original statin at a lower dose, trial of a lower intensity statin (ie, fluvastatin, pravastatin), or trial of a high-intensity statin with longer half-life (ie, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin) with modified dosing regimen (ie, alternate days, once, twice, or 3 times weekly). Of the available statins, simvastatin may be most associated with SAMS, and fluvastatin the least. Muscle symptoms seem to be dose dependent but unrelated to the degree of LDL lowering.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^1125981N]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). Medium credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are the most common form of statin intolerance and are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events that manifest from statin underutilization and discontinuation. The reported frequencies of SAMS are divergent in the literature. The writing group estimates the prevalence of SAMS, namely all muscle symptoms temporally related to statin use but without regard to causality, to be about 10% (range 5% to 25%), and the prevalence of pharmacological SAMS, specifically muscle symptoms resulting from pharmacological properties of the statin, to be about 1–2% (range 0.5% to 4%). In clinical practice, SAMS are likely to result from a combination of pharmacological and nonpharmacological effects, however this does not make the symptoms any less clinically relevant. Regardless of the etiology, SAMS need to be addressed in accordance with patients' preferences and experiences. This clinical perspective reviews the epidemiology and underlying pathophysiology of SAMS, and the cardiovascular consequences resulting from statin discontinuation. We present patient-centered clinical and communication strategies to mitigate SAMS and improve medication adherence and outcomes among statin users. Treatment strategies include 1) optimizing lifestyle interventions, 2) modulating risk factors that may contribute to muscle symptoms, 3) optimizing statin tolerability by dose reduction, decreased dosing frequency, or use of an alternate statin with more favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and 4) use of non-statins, emphasizing those with evidence for atherosclerotic risk reduction, either in combination with or in place of statin therapy depending on the patient's circumstances. The focus of this clinical perspective is sustainable lipoprotein goal achievement, which is important for cardiovascular risk reduction.

### Shared decisions: a qualitative study on clinician and patient perspectives on statin therapy and statin-associated side effects [^1131M71e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

In addition to time limitations, clinicians avoided providing patients with the entire list of potential SASEs as it could make patients more aware or " tuned in " and develop SASEs that may not be statin related. A clinician explained:

I think that an important part of prescribing statins is to understand what aches and pains the patient has before you begin, because once you mention that these drugs can or might cause symptoms, then people are going to be tuned in to whether they have changes.

Patients recalled learning little about SASEs or having more in‐depth discussions about SASEs with their clinicians. Muscle pain and gastrointestinal issues were the adverse effects patients recalled being told about by their clinicians most frequently. "It was mostly about muscle pain", recalled one patient, " they (ie, the clinician) didn't mention the memory [loss] at all". Print information on statins (eg, pamphlets) was not frequently provided to patients; a few patients also suggested that clinicians rely on the prescription insert as the sole information source on risks and benefits of any medication.

Both patient and clinician interviews described communication around reasons for statin initiation and how the benefits of statins outweigh the risks. For example, one patient was told that statins could cause adverse effects, but she/he was encouraged to try the statin for its health benefits:

She (clinician) knew how I feared about certain medicine, that's why she would always sit down and talk with me about things. And she told me that all medicine has side effects but… she said some patients never had a side effect. Then she told me try [the statin], and it was to help lower my cholesterol. And I would benefit from them.

Statin benefits were especially emphasized for patients for secondary prevention of ASCVD, as one pharmacist noted:

It's almost like you (ie, secondary prevention patients) really don't have a choice, and then the primary [prevention group] is like you may have a choice, but your better choice would be to take it.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^116LJUy9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

National Lipid Association — potential strategies for managing statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) outline a clinical algorithm beginning with risk assessment, where clinicians should address: "Estimate likelihood of pharmacological SAMS with clinical myalgia risk score", "Identify and modify risk factors (i.e. DDI, change in exercise, hypothyroidism, etc)", "Determine patient's level of discomfort", "Obtain thorough lipid-lowering drug history", and "Use communication strategies for shared decision-making (see box 1–3)". If "Impaired quality of life or functional status?" is "No", the pathway is to "Encourage continuation of treatment", "Reemphasize benefits of statin", and "Optimize diet/lifestyle, supportive care". If "Yes", clinicians should "De-escalate or discontinue statin" and "Re-evaluate sx", then determine "Symptom improvement with statin de-escalation or discontinuation?"; if "No", "Encourage statin continuation (with current or different statin)", "Reemphasize benefits of statin", "Optimize diet/lifestyle, supportive care", and "Evaluate other causes of muscle sx"; if "Yes", proceed to "Statin rechallenge (see table 10) – Lower dose – Different statin – Intermittent dosing", with "Optimize diet/lifestyle, supportive care", and "Reassess tolerability periodically". Supportive care is specified as "stretch, hydrate, sleep, consider washout / drug holiday".

### Statin-associated muscle disease: advances in diagnosis and management [^113Jk5KU]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Since the first approval of lovastatin in 1987, hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been effective and widely popular cholesterol-lowering agents with substantial benefits for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Not all patients can tolerate these drugs, however, and statin intolerance is most frequently associated with a range of side effects directed toward skeletal muscle, termed statin-associated muscle symptoms or SAMS. SAMS are particularly difficult to treat because there are no validated biomarkers or tests that can be used to confirm patient self-reports of SAMS, and a number of patients who report SAMS have non-specific muscle pain not attributable to statin therapy. This review summarizes the most recent evidence related to diagnosis and management of SAMS. First, the range of skeletal muscle side effects associated with statin therapy is described. Second, data regarding the incidence and prevalence of SAMS, the most frequently experienced muscle side effect, are presented. Third, the most promising new techniques to confirm diagnosis of SAMS are explored. Finally, the most effective strategies for the clinical management of SAMS are summarized. Better diagnostic and treatment strategies for SAMS will increase the number of patients using these life-saving statins, thereby increasing statin adherence and reducing the costs of avoidable cardiovascular events.

Statin rechallenge expectations in SAMS counseling emphasize that "it can be helpful to frame expectations regarding tolerability", because "Tolerability discussions provide a helpful perspective for the patient to reflect on functional status and quality of life rather than an expectation for completely symptom-free therapy". Patients should know that "An individual could experience mild tolerable muscle symptoms for the first 2–4 weeks, which later resolve", and that "statin rechallenge may not cause the same symptoms, particularly after a dose reduction or change to another statin", with the aim that "Setting the stage for positive but realistic expectations may facilitate improved patient outcomes".

Initial steps evaluate risk factors including age, race/ethnicity, vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and genetics; assess substance use and medication interactions; exclude recent strenuous exercise; and consider statin type and dose. Management includes correcting underlying contributors, considering rechallenge with another statin or a lower dose (including alternate-day dosing), and if statin rechallenge fails or LDL-C is not at goal, adding or starting non-statin therapy such as ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, PCSK9-based therapy and/or bile acid resins, using shared decision-making to discuss benefits and harms.

Non-statin based lipid-lowering therapy

If LDL-C remains above target despite maximally tolerated statin dosage, addition of an alternative LDL-C lowering agent should be considered in patients at high CVD risk to improve LDL-C reduction. Ezetimibe reduces LDL-C by 15–20%, is easy to take with few side effects, and has been shown to reduce CVD events. In patients with SAMS, the combination of ezetimibe plus fluvastatin XL reduced LDL-C by 46% and was as well tolerated as ezetimibe alone. Bile acid sequestrants can reduce LDL-C levels by 15–25% depending on the type and dose used, and may also improve glycaemia in patients with diabetes. Colesevelam is easier to take and better tolerated than earlier formulations. The combination of a bile acid sequestrant and ezetimibe can reduce LDL-C by ∼30–35%.

Fenofibrate can lower LDL-C by 15–20% in patients with high baseline levels who do not have concomitant hypertriglyceridaemia. This fibrate is easy to take, and has shown an excellent safety record in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes and Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes trials, although additional CVD benefit has not been demonstrated, and serum creatinine was reversibly increased during treatment. Unlike gemfibrozil, there is no increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when fenofibrate is added to a statin. Niacin also lowers LDL-C levels by 15–20%, but recent large randomized trials showed a significant excess of adverse effects and no significant CVD benefit when added to background statin treatment; therefore, niacin derivatives are no longer available for prescription in Europe.

Physicians and health care professionals should therefore consider the use of ezetimibe as first choice, potentially followed by bile acid sequestrants or fibrates in combination with ezetimibe, as needed to achieve LDL-C lowering consistent with guidelines.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms-managing the highly intolerant [^116v86s8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal symptoms are the most commonly reported adverse effects associated with statin therapy. Yet, certain data indicate that these symptoms often present in populations with underlying musculoskeletal complaints and are not likely statin related. Switching statins or using lower doses resolves muscle complaints in most patients. However, there is a growing population of individuals who experience intolerable musculoskeletal symptoms with multiple statins, regardless of the individual agent or prescribed dose. Recent randomized, placebo-controlled trials enrolling highly intolerant subjects provide significant insight regarding statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Notable findings include the inconsistency with reproducing muscle complaints, as approximately 40% of subjects report SAMS when taking a statin but not while receiving placebo, but a substantial cohort reports intolerable muscle symptoms with placebo but none when on a statin. These data validate SAMS for those likely experiencing true intolerance, but for others, suggest a psychosomatic component or misattribution of the source of pain and highlights the importance of differentiating from the musculoskeletal symptoms caused by concomitant factors. Managing the highly intolerant requires candid patient counseling, shared decision-making, eliminating contributing factors, careful clinical assessment and the use of a myalgia index score, and isolating potential muscle-related adverse events by gradually reintroducing drug therapy with the utilization of intermittent dosing of lipid-altering agents. We provide a review of recent data and therapeutic guidance involving a focused step-by-step approach for managing SAMS among the highly intolerant. Such strategies usually allow for clinically meaningful reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an overall lowering of cardiovascular risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112VTK5P]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin intolerance — NLA definition and management: Statin intolerance was defined by the panel as adverse symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities attributed by the patient (or provider) to the statin and in most cases perceived by the patient to interfere unacceptably with activities of daily living, leading to a decision to stop or reduce statin therapy; myalgia, defined as muscle aches, soreness, stiffness or tenderness, is the most frequently reported side effect of statin use with reports generally ranging from 1–5% in controlled clinical trials to 11–29% in observational studies. The NLA Statin Safety Panel stated that patients should be told that whether to continue taking the statin is their decision, but it is best guided by advice from their health care provider, and patients should be advised that before stopping a statin due to possible side effects, they should first speak to their health care provider. Even if statin intolerance is confirmed, in most cases the clinician and patient should attempt to maintain statin treatment in some form to reduce the patient's CVD event risk; options for continuing statin therapy include a lower daily dosage of the same statin, less than daily dosages of the same statin (optimally with a long-acting statin, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin), or use of an alternative statin, and patients who are initially intolerant to 1 statin can often tolerate a different statin. The highest tolerated dose of statin should be targeted, and other non-statin lipid-lowering drugs are options for patients with statin intolerance with consideration of their potential for side effects.

### The STatin adverse treatment experience survey: experience of patients reporting side effects of statin therapy [^113nsBDN]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Statin-associated symptoms and clinical impact — prevalence and risks are reported as follows: The number of U.S. adults for whom statin therapy is recommended increased to 56 million individuals, and during 2012 to 2013, an estimated 28% of adults aged ≥ 40 years (39.2 million individuals) were taking statins, with 43% of adults aged 60 to 74 years and 48% of adults aged ≥ 75 years receiving therapy during 2011 to 2012. In clinical practice and observational studies, approximately 10% to 29% of patients report statin-associated muscle symptoms, and these adverse experiences are a major factor for a change in statin therapy, nonadherence, or discontinuation. In the Understanding Statin Use in America and Gaps in Education (USAGE) survey, muscle-related side effects were more commonly reported in former statin users (60%) vs current statin users (25%). In a real-world clinical setting, approximately 17% of patients experienced a statin-related event. In a large Medicare population (N = 105,329) receiving statin therapy after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, those who experienced statin intolerance had a 50% higher risk for recurrent myocardial infarction and a 51% higher risk of being hospitalized for recurrent cardiovascular events.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^111Fv2Jw]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

National Lipid Association statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) management — many patients ultimately tolerate statins, and strategies include lower-dose statin, different statin, supplementation, and/or non-statins with defined low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) effects at specific doses and in combination therapy. The text states that approximately 60–80% of patients with SAMS are eventually able to tolerate some statin regimen and lists management strategies consisting of 1) same statin but lower dose, 2) different statin, 3) supplementation, and/or 4) non-statins. LDL-C lowering with statins is greatest at the lowest daily dose, which may achieve 2/3 of maximum effect with an additional 5–6% reduction from baseline with each doubling of dose; starting with atorvastatin 10 mg or rosuvastatin 5 mg offers a moderate intensity response that can result in a 33–45% reduction in LDL-C. Over 50% reduction in LDL-C can be achieved by adding ezetimibe or other non-statin pharmacotherapies to low to moderate-intensity statin treatment. In RACING, rosuvastatin 10 mg daily plus ezetimibe 10 mg daily versus rosuvastatin 20 mg daily was associated with lower drug discontinuation (4.8% vs 8.2%, p < 0.0001) and greater achievement of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL at years 1, 2, and 3 (73%, 75%, 72% vs 55%, 60%, 58%, all p < 0.0001). For persistent intolerance during low-dose therapy, intermittent (non-daily) dosing may be needed, and it is recommended to use statins with a longer half-life; there are accounts of 20–40% LDL-C lowering depending on dose and dosing interval.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated side effects (SASEs) — evaluation and statin rechallenge: The most-encountered SASE in clinical practice is statin-associated muscle symptoms, which may occur in 5% to 20% of patients, and in the SAMSON trial, 90% of the adverse symptom effects experienced with drug therapy can be attributed to what is seen with a blinded placebo; for patients with SASEs who meet evidence-based guideline criteria for statin therapy, avoiding complete discontinuation of statin treatment is strongly recommended. The approach to SASEs should include discontinuation of statin therapy until resolution of symptoms and subsequent rechallenge to verify recurrence of muscle-related symptoms, and most experts recommend documentation of unacceptable muscle-related symptoms that resolve and recur on at least 2 (and preferably 3) statins, with differing metabolic pathways/lipophilicity and one prescribed at the lowest approved dose. Although not studied in RCTs nor FDA approved, alternative statin regimens may include alternate-day dosing with a long half-life statin (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin), de-escalation dosing (reducing 40-mg daily dosing to alternating between a 40- and a 20-mg statin every other day), or a lower daily dose (from 40 mg daily to 20 mg daily), and the majority of patients who experience SASEs are able to tolerate statin rechallenge with an alternative statin or dose reduction with the same statin.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^115rZexD]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association dyslipidemia management — statin therapy counseling and shared decision-making notes that the role of health care providers begins with identifying the patient's problem, assessing the patient's level of understanding, and then providing necessary education including verbal explanations and written materials, and that shared decision-making is integral to the provider-patient encounter. When discussing therapeutic options, the provider will need to specifically relate the reason for prescribing medication to the patient's condition; for example, in a patient with post-MI, the need for a high-intensity statin is paramount and has been shown to reduce subsequent cardiovascular events and mortality. It is important to discuss the potential side effects of prescribed atherogenic cholesterol-lowering therapies, including statin therapy, with all patients, including the potential for muscle aches and how the muscle ache might feel on statins; the provider should reinforce that the provider/office staff needs to be contacted if the patient believes he/she is experiencing an adverse effect, and patients should be assured that safety labs are checked when their lipid panel is checked. The provider should also explain that although statins are 1 "class" of drugs, statins individually are very different drugs from one another — a problem with 1 does not usually mean that all statins need to be avoided. A statin prescription should not be an automatic recommendation for a patient with elevated cholesterol; it is critically important to engage the patient in a discussion, review benefit vs risk of statin therapy, discuss all treatment options, and consider patient preferences.

### Identification and management of patients with statin-associated symptoms in clinical practice: a clinician survey [^112rnPtv]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Discontinuation of statin therapy by patients with hypercholesterolemia because of the onset of side-effects (statin-associated symptoms [SAS]) increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We aimed to understand how patients with SAS, particularly those with statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), are identified and managed in the outpatient setting.

Methods

A web-based survey involving 60 clinicians in each of 12 countries and 90 clinicians in the US was conducted. Clinicians answered questions about the diagnostic criteria, estimated incidence of SAS, and choice of treatment for patients with SAS.

Results

Overall, 810 clinicians (78% cardiologists) completed the survey. An average of 72% of patients with potential SAS were reported to present with muscle-related symptoms (range across countries [RAC] 50–87%) that could be SAMS. Clinicians took a range of steps to confirm SAMS in these patients, including discontinuation of statin (average 59%; RAC 48–67%); re-challenge with ≥ 2 statins (average 74%; RAC 60–85%); modification of statin regimen (average 76%; RAC 65–85%); or a combination of these steps. Overall, 6% of patients with hypercholesterolemia were estimated to eventually have SAS (RAC 2–12%). In patients with SAS, on average 52% continued to receive a low-dose statin, usually with other lipid-lowering therapies (LLT). Of the remaining 49%, 38% received alternative LLT only; 11% did not receive any LLT.

Conclusion

There is some consistency and stringency in clinical practice for identifying patients with SAS; however, a structured work-up for identification, followed by a defined therapeutic algorithm, may improve their management.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^113BHb2Q]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Based on the evidence available from the Heart Protection Study, the small excess in risk appeared to be because of events that did not usually lead to treatment discontinuation (consistent with evidence from a previous review of tabular data from statin trials), and did not result in a clinically significant change in creatine kinase. This finding indicates that most of the episodes of muscle pain or weakness caused by a statin were clinically mild. This result also indicates that, since participants with muscle symptoms generally continued treatment, the absence of any significantly increased risk of repeat reports of muscle symptoms after year 1 is not explained by patients with symptoms stopping treatment after having muscle symptoms during the first year.

We were able to explore the generalisability of our findings in several ways. Since most excess risk appears in the period immediately after treatment commences, we restricted our analyses to the first year to increase their sensitivity. There was substantial variation in the methods used to record muscle symptoms, so the first-year rates among participants allocated to the placebo group in the 19 trials of statin versus placebo also varied substantially. Nevertheless, there was little evidence that the RR for muscle pain or weakness varied according to the cumulative frequency of muscle events at 1 year. It is not clear why this is so (other than the absence of statistical power) since it might be expected that the RR should tend towards unity in those trials with higher recorded rates because of a larger proportion of misclassified events (so-called noise). However, when taken together with the general absence of variation in the relative effects of statin therapy on muscle pain or weakness in the subgroups studied, one practical conclusion is that the overall RR might be broadly generalisable in different clinical circumstances. Likewise, the absence of a sex-related difference in the trials comparing more versus less intensive regimens does not support the finding of a higher RR in women than in men in the placebo-controlled trials.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — management and rechallenge are supported by randomized crossover trials that "support a management strategy of statin discontinuation until symptoms improve, followed by rechallenge with a reduced dose, alternative agent, or alternative dosing regimen while monitoring for recurrent symptoms". In higher ASCVD risk, "the goal should be to treat with the guideline-recommended maximally tolerated statin dose", and "Patients who experience rhabdomyolysis with statin therapy may need to discontinue statin use indefinitely, although reversible causes should be sought". When symptoms persist or recur despite reassess–rediscuss–rechallenge, "nonstatin therapy should be considered when there is net clinical benefit".

Table 5 ODYSSEY ALTERNATIVE in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia at moderate or high cardiovascular risk with statin intolerance was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel group study in which patients with no skeletal-muscle related adverse event (AE) on placebo were randomized to alirocumab, ezetimibe or atorvastatin 10 mg/d for 24 weeks; n = 314 subjects were randomized. Myalgia was the most common AE in all groups; of the 63 randomized to atorvastatin, 14% discontinued treatment due to statin-associated muscle symptoms. Skeletal muscle-related events were less frequent with alirocumab vs. atorvastatin (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38–0.88, p = 0.042), and the rate of study treatment discontinuation due to skeletal muscle-related AEs was not different for alirocumab vs. atorvastatin or vs. ezetimibe.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and myopathy criteria — The most common symptoms that result in statin intolerance or statin discontinuation are muscle-related; SAMS refers to all muscle symptoms temporally related to statin use but without regard to causality, while pharmacologic SAMS refers specifically to muscle symptoms that are caused by the statin. In statin clinical trials, an alternative myopathy definition requires adverse muscle symptoms with creatine kinase (CK) elevations ≥ 10 X upper limit of normal (ULN), under which statin-induced myopathy occurs with a frequency of 1/1000 in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Patient–clinician communication for statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — adherence requires a multi-faceted approach including assessment of illness perceptions, perceived need, background beliefs, affordability, and adverse effect concerns, and also considering contextual issues such as health literacy, past medication experiences, previous interactions with clinicians, and the impact of racism and other discrimination. Patient-level approaches include shared decision-making, discussing cardiovascular risk reduction, and reducing medication burden, while clinician-level approaches include multidisciplinary care with a clinically trained lipid specialist, strategies to recognize and address SAMS, and time to counsel about cardiovascular disease risk; the clinical lipid specialist may serve an important role. Shared decision-making is lauded and includes exchanging factual information, determining patient preferences, and agreeing on the optimal treatment strategy.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^114LH1xa]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Q: How stringent does the definition of statin intolerance need to be?

The meaning of statin intolerance is elusive and highly variable, and in the emerging era of patient‐centered medicine, statin intolerance should be redefined in that context, consistent with what is seen in the clinic.

It is also equally important to define what statin intolerance is not, because there are patients not receiving statins who might benefit from such therapy, but they have been branded as intolerant.

Q: Is statin intolerance absolute or does it exist on a spectrum?

Dr. Kopecky: There are 3 broad groups of statin‐intolerant patients:
The first group includes those who take a statin and experience symptoms; the symptoms go away when the drug is discontinued, but return when they restart another drug. This is the statin‐intolerant patient.
The second group of patients has every ache and pain in the world, regardless of the drug they are prescribed.
The third group includes the patient who will not even begin the statin because they do not want to be statin intolerant. This is the largest group of patients that needs to be addressed — those who refuse the statin outright. These patients are already well informed about possible side effects, so what must be taught are the benefits a statin might provide.

Q: Do you have a treatment algorithm in place?

The panel was in agreement that the Figure 1, as recently published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, 4 is representative of an appropriate algorithmic approach.

Figure 1
Algorithm for the evaluation of statin‐associated muscle injury, as described by Rosenson et al. 4 Abbreviations: CK, creatine kinase; EMG, electromyography; LDL‐C, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol; ULN, upper limit of normal.

In addition to this, every algorithm should have a question relating to statin response in family members, as there could be genetic determinants with a familial component, both in terms of response to statins and the potential for adverse events. Although there is not a specific test that can be ordered, heritability is an additional factor to consider.

N-of-1 trials for SAMS classification — investigators suggested that N-of-1 trial packs could be employed as practical clinical tools to enable patient decision-making on statin resumption, and a small, 73-patient trial concluded that N-of-1 experimentation enhances medication uptake, regardless of patient blinding. The authors state, "We estimate 1–2% of statin-treated patients have pharmacologic SAMS", noting that "A previous, widely cited estimate from a 2016 meta-analysis gave a frequency for pharmacologic SAMS no higher than 0.5% to 1.0% (Table 4)", and that these estimates are consistent with other reports which "surmise that a large majority of SAMS are not pharmacologically induced".

### A mechanism for statin-induced susceptibility to myopathy [^114XdBau]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Conditions in which increased SR Ca 2+ leak can be expected should be considered a risk factor when statins are prescribed. Identifying risk factors underlying statin-induced myopathy is important because recent modeling experiments have indicated that improving statin adherence by 50% (e.g. by preventing statin-induced myopathy) would prevent twice as many deaths as a 5% reduction in the cardiovascular risk threshold for statin prescription.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Up to one-third of patients report statin-associated muscle symptoms in observational studies. The incidence in randomized controlled trials is much less. In part, this difference may arise because those susceptible to myopathy or with indications of myopathy in the run-in phase are excluded from trials. However, the experience of muscle pain is subjective, and many patients are primed to expect this because of patient information leaflets and widespread reporting of side effects of statins in the press. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanism of statin myopathy and factors that make users more susceptible to overt muscle pain and weakness (even potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis) are essential. In this study, we demonstrated leaky RyRs in skeletal muscle following statin treatment. Although this by itself did not cause overt myopathy, it did provide a strong indicator of the populations who are at real risk of myopathy — those whose lifestyle or genotype predispose them to SR Ca 2+ leak. This includes patients who undertake regular high-intensity exercise or have mutations in the RyR1 associated with malignant hyperthermia. In these individuals, statins should be used cautiously with consideration of dose, alternative cholesterol-lowering strategies, and monitoring of serum creatine kinase levels. However, our data do support the view that moderate exercise should be actively encouraged in those who take statins. As well as the positive effects of exercise on cardiovascular health, this type of activity appears to limit potentially harmful effects of statins on skeletal muscle.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^111dXzRX]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are one of the principal reasons for statin non-adherence and/or discontinuation, contributing to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Panel overviews current understanding of the pathophysiology of statin-associated myopathy, and provides guidance for diagnosis and management of SAMS. Statin-associated myopathy, with significant elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK), is a rare but serious side effect of statins, affecting 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10 000 people on standard statin doses. Statin-associated muscle symptoms cover a broader range of clinical presentations, usually with normal or minimally elevated CK levels, with a prevalence of 7–29% in registries and observational studies. Preclinical studies show that statins decrease mitochondrial function, attenuate energy production, and alter muscle protein degradation, thereby providing a potential link between statins and muscle symptoms; controlled mechanistic and genetic studies in humans are necessary to further understanding. The Panel proposes to identify SAMS by symptoms typical of statin myalgia (i.e. muscle pain or aching) and their temporal association with discontinuation and response to repetitive statin re-challenge. In people with SAMS, the Panel recommends the use of a maximally tolerated statin dose combined with non-statin lipid-lowering therapies to attain recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The Panel recommends a structured work-up to identify individuals with clinically relevant SAMS generally to at least three different statins, so that they can be offered therapeutic regimens to satisfactorily address their cardiovascular risk. Further research into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms may offer future therapeutic potential.

Current therapy for patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms

Statin-based therapies

If symptoms/CK abnormalities resolve after discontinuation of statin, either treatment with the same statin at a lower dose or switching to an alternative statin should be considered. If tolerated, doses can be up-titrated to achieve LDL-C goal, or as much LDL-C reduction that can be achieved with minimal muscle complaints. If these strategies are not tolerated, alternate day or twice-weekly dosing can be considered to achieve the LDL-C goal. Despite methodological limitations (small size, retrospective, open label, or non-randomized design), studies have shown that either alternate day or twice-weekly dosing strategies can reduce LDL-C by 12–38%, and, importantly, are tolerated by ∼70% of previously intolerant patients. Generally, lower doses of a high intensity statin with a long half-life (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin) are more appropriate.

Q: Is there any interaction between statins and the natural decline of strength with aging?

In older patients, there is a natural decline in strength and agility, and concurrently, they are receiving statins; however, these patients are also at greatest risk for a heart attack.

The side‐effect profile in this older population will be different, however, as younger patients may tend to complain more about cognitive dysfunction; this is because they remain active in the workforce and can be very sensitive to their level of performance. Older patients are more prone to complaints of generalized aches and pains that are, for the most part, easier to manage.

Once they are beyond the age of 75 years, patients should be on statins to reduce the chances of myocardial infarction. 2

Dr. Sperling: The high prevalence of myopathies and myalgia is overemphasized, as most patients do not experience these symptoms. The message is not that 10% of patients experience these symptoms, but that 90% do not. Patients need to understand the typically favorable benefit‐to‐risk ratio, and as a whole, the messages for patients and physicians should focus on the positive.

Q: What effects do acute physical activities have on muscle complaints associated with statin use?

Following exercise, elevations in CK levels always seem to resolve quickly; but at the same time, it is prudent to see what the highest elevations look like, as there can be a great deal of variability with exercise.

As the older population becomes more active, it can become more difficult to advise them.

Both before and after a big run, or other strenuous activity, it may be appropriate for patients to withhold their statin for several days.

Under most circumstances, there are no measurable negative effects from statin withdrawal in the short term. The risks emerge over the long term, and for an at‐risk patient to be deprived of statin therapy, this can come with significant effects.

Q: Are there patients in whom statin‐induced myalgia may be cumulative, and perhaps even irreversible?

Statin use may hasten the muscle decline associated with aging, but this is believed to be reversible in the vast majority of instances, as muscles can train at any age.

In the rare circumstance of necrotizing autoimmune myositis (NAM), muscle damage can be prolonged or even permanent. This condition results from the inappropriate production of antibodies to the enzyme HMG‐CoA reductase.

Statin discontinuation — observational evidence indicates that statin nonadherence or early discontinuation is associated with increased cardiovascular events, with a risk ratio of 1.22 to 1.39 if patients who discontinued therapy within the first year of initiation are excluded, as reported in a systematic review of real-world observational studies assessing statin adherence and discontinuation on cardiovascular events and mortality. The relative mortality risk for statin nonadherence or withdrawal was greater than the risk of increased cardiovascular events, approaching or exceeding a 2-fold increase in various settings. In patients with SAMS, continuing statin therapy despite an adverse reaction was associated with significantly lower risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events and all-cause mortality compared to discontinuation, with benefit apparent within the first year and progressively increasing during up to 8 years of follow-up.

### Shared decisions: a qualitative study on clinician and patient perspectives on statin therapy and statin-associated side effects [^115eFMD6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Some patients were frustrated by this "trial and error" approach to SASE management. One patient said:

So I tried it (ie, the statin) with this new doctor, went through that whole process starting with the first statin, then going to the second statin. Did that whole process all over again, and I didn't like it.

Another patient explained how his/her clinician changed his/her statin dose, then changed the statin drug, until after the third medication change it was decided that the patient "wasn't able to take those type of medications". Patients also discussed self‐titration efforts to help with adverse effects, with several stopping the medication on their own when adverse effects became intolerable. Patients also discussed use of nonstatin alternatives, like ezetimibe, fenofibrate, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, niacin, vitamin supplements (eg, vitamins K and D), CoQ10, aspirin, fish, and flax seed oils. Physical activity and dietary changes were stated as additional alternatives to lowering cholesterol in place of the statin.

The Internet, Social Networks, and Other Media Sources Influence Patients' Perceptions of Statins

Our analyses in this domain revealed that although patients used a vast array of resources (internet, social media, and television) and social networks (friends, family members, and other patients) to inform their views and perception about statin therapy, clinicians worried about the authenticity of such sources. Patient reluctance and/or negative perceptions of statins were fueled, in part, by information they accessed outside of the clinical encounter. Patients reported using WebMD, Facebook, Epocrates, and search engines like Google and Yahoo to learn about statins and SASEs. Clinician interviews confirmed this patient behavior. A pharmacist said:

So most of my patients are scared of statins, I will say, especially I think it's more about being more well informed. A lot of them will go do online Google searches on WebMD and whatnot, so most of our patients have that preconception of statins are going to cause muscle pain or muscle cramps.

### Statin treatment and muscle symptoms: series of randomised, placebo controlled n-of-1 trials [^112WpFcP]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other literature

StatinWISE and the concurrent SAMSON trialare the first large series of n-of-1 trials to investigate the effect of statins on muscle symptoms. Our findings support the limited evidence from one small n-of-1 trial and large systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised trials that have not established a clear effect of statins on muscle symptoms in the absence of myopathy. Our data agree with the findings of the ODYSSEY ALTERNATIVE trialand the GAUSS-3 trial, which found that only a small proportion of patients intolerant to statins developed intolerable muscle symptoms when taking statins compared with placebo. Our data also agree with findings from a smaller cohort of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies whose myalgia was not aggravated by statins. An ongoing meta-analysisis investigating data on adverse events from blinded, randomised trials of statins. Our findings clearly indicated that most patients taking statins did not experience symptoms causally related to their statin, highlighting the importance of blinding when assessing adverse effects.

Observational studies have reported adverse effects on muscle, and the experience of muscle symptoms when taking statins in clinical practice causes patients to stop treatment. Various explanations have been offered: the nocebo effect, in which expectations of adverse effects might lead patients to attribute muscle symptoms during treatment with statins to the statins themselves. Also, muscle aches and pains are common among the age group taking statins and might occur coincidentally with the use of statins, leading patients and clinicians to erroneously attribute pain to statins. Lack of randomisation and blinding in observational studies imply that for a subjective symptom, such as muscle pain, an association with the use of statins might not be causal. The large proportion of our participants who intended to restart treatment with statins after their trial is in line with observational data showing that rechallenge with statins can be tolerated by most patients.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^117G7e77]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Lowering LDL-C with statin therapy reduces CVD risk by up to 40% in a wide range of patients. Given that the main reason for statin non-adherence/discontinuation relates to the onset of (perceived) side effects, it follows that the high prevalence of SAMS reported from observational studies is likely to adversely affect the CVD benefits of statins. Strategies to prevent the loss of effective statin therapy because of SAMS are still lacking. In the absence of a gold standard definition, this EAS Consensus Panel proposes to base the probability of SAMS being caused by statins on the nature of symptoms and their temporal relationship with statin initiation, statin discontinuation (or dechallenge), and repetitive re-challenge (Figure 2). Optimal therapy should combine a maximally tolerated, or even non-daily statin dose, together with non-statin-based lipid-lowering therapies in order to achieve LDL-C targets.

This Consensus Panel also highlights the need for further research into the pathophysiology of SAMS. Accumulating preclinical data show that statins decrease mitochondrial function, and alter muscle protein degradation, providing a possible pathophysiological link between statins and muscle symptoms. Studies in the clinical setting are a priority to further understanding of these mechanisms, and may offer therapeutic potential. In the absence of therapies to prevent these symptoms, this Consensus Panel recommends that the response of patients with SAMS to three or more statins should be considered for referral to specialized settings. By recognizing SAMS and adhering to a structured work-up, the Panel anticipates that individuals with clinically relevant SAMS will be offered alternative and/or novel therapeutic regimens that can satisfactorily address their CVD risk.

### Optimizing cholesterol treatment in patients with muscle complaints [^116uPHLm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Statins are highly effective for preventing cardiovascular events by reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, many patients taking statins report muscle-related symptoms that prevent the use of guideline recommended doses. Patients with reported intolerance to statins have a high risk of cardiovascular events. Clinical strategies that optimize cardiovascular risk reduction through LDL-C lowering need to be applied in patients experiencing intolerable side effects that they attribute to statins. In this paper, the authors review definitions of statin intolerance, propose algorithms to better define statin intolerance, and describe approaches to optimize cardiovascular risk reduction among individuals reporting statin-associated muscle symptoms.

### Survey of personal use of statins by prescribers [^116xmuML]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

A total of 829 physicians and advanced practice providers within a large, mostly primary care network were surveyed about their personal use of statins and their attitudes toward patient use of these medications. The 239 respondents included 60 clinicians who were current users, most for extended periods, and 15 who had stopped statin use. Nearly one-third of the clinicians over age 40 who took statins used them for primary prevention, compared with just 7.6% of the general adult US population. Half of the current statin users felt that their personal use had a positive effect on their likelihood of prescribing them to patients. More than 10% of users had discontinued statin use due to muscle effects, with virtually no other adverse effects mentioned among the survey respondents. The incidence of statin-associated muscle symptoms was high enough to suggest that as yet unmeasurable statin muscle pathology may be a real phenomenon that has been overlooked.

Follow-up visits — Box 2 strategies to engage patients during follow-up visits highlight respectful inquiry, positive verbal reinforcement, and shared decision-making; actions include "Offer direct inquiry into adherence and adverse effects with non-judgmental questioning. For example: 'Many people have trouble taking their medications every day. In the last two weeks, how many days have you missed taking your cholesterol pill? Was it because of forgetting or another reason?'" and, for statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), "If patients report SAMS, request description in specific terms (e.g., severity, frequency, duration, aggravating factors, impact on activities or functional status)". Positive reinforcement includes "Provide positive verbal reinforcement for honest disclosure of non-adherence" and "Provide positive verbal acknowledgement for positive heart-healthy behavioral changes made by the patient, no matter the size". Shared decision-making approaches include "When discussing options to change to a different statin, dosage, and/or dosing schedule, frame this as an opportunity to collaborate to determine the best approach. Consider asking, 'Can we try an experiment together?'" and reassurance that "the presence of muscle symptoms, regardless of etiology, does not automatically indicate that cessation of statin treatment is warranted". Follow-up planning includes "Determine an appropriate re-evaluation interval to assess statin tolerability to support patients and maintain clinical follow-up" and considering whether to "propose that patients take short (i.e., 1–2 week) 'drug holidays' if symptoms reach unacceptable levels", noting "It can be helpful for patients to notify clinicians when pausing therapy, and also when restarting, to clarify the specifics of symptoms and obtain an accurate timeline of symptom patterns".

Statin intolerance and non-adherence — US Internet survey: In a cross-sectional, self-administered Internet-based survey of 10,138 US adult statin users conducted from September to October, 2011, factors associated with adherence and reasons for switching medication or discontinuation were identified; among the survey participants, 82.5% were current statin users who adhered to their prescribed statins (defined as taking at least 80% of their current prescribed statin dose in the past month) and 12% were former statin users. Of the former statin users, 60% cited muscle aches as the primary reason for discontinuation, followed by cost (16%) and perceived lack of efficacy (13%); individuals who changed statins in the past, but were then adherent to their new statin, reported reasons for switching as muscle side effects (33%) and cost (32%). Results of the survey identified that lower income, muscle pain as a side effect, and taking other concurrent medications for CVD were predictors of statin non-adherence.

Approach to the patient with statin intolerance

Statin intolerance can be a significant barrier to optimal lipid management (Fig. 5). Adverse effects attributed to statins that can lead to discontinuation are numerous, and include those that affect the musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, neurocognitive, and nervous systems. The most prevalent of these are the statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). These can take the form of muscle pain, aches, stiffness, tenderness, or cramps and usually present without elevations in CK. There is no universally accepted definition for SAMS, although the National Lipid Association has proposed a clinical scoring system based on symptomatology and temporal associations. There is significant heterogeneity in SAMS presentation; most common is involvement of the proximal large muscle groups including the thighs, buttocks, calves, and back muscles, typically in a symmetrical pattern. These symptoms usually occur within the first 4 to 6 weeks after statin initiation but may occur after several years of treatment. SAMS with CK elevations > 10× ULN occurs in 1 in 10 000 and rhabdomyolysis in 1 in 100 000 individuals per year of statin treatment.

Key considerations

- Assessment of SAMS: The first step in managing suspected SAMS is assessing the likelihood of true statin intolerance using a validated tool, such as the National Lipid Association Statin Myalgia Clinic Index. Secondary causes of muscle symptoms should also be evaluated, including,: 1) Drug interactions: Medications that interfere with statin metabolism can increase the risk of SAMS. 2) Hypothyroidism: Although hypothyroidism can contribute to myalgias, thyroid function should be normal before assuming SAMS is the cause. 3) Vitamin D deficiency: Low vitamin D levels can cause muscle pain, but supplementation has not been definitively shown to affect SAMS. 4) Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation: While anecdotal evidence suggests CoQ10 may improve SAMS, data are discordant, and current guidelines do not recommend its routine use. However, patients may choose to try CoQ10 if they wish to continue statin therapy.
- Management of statin intolerance,: 1) Mild symptoms: If the patient's muscle symptoms are mild and do not impair function or quality of life, the statin can be continued, with supportive measures such as stretching, hydration, and sleep hygiene. If symptoms persist, de-escalation of the statin dose or temporary discontinuation with a rechallenge is a reasonable approach. 2) Severe symptoms: If symptoms significantly impact the patient's quality of life, discontinuation of the statin is appropriate. Rechallenge with a lower dose of the same or an alternative statin can be attempted after a 2- to 4-week washout period. Statins like pravastatin or fluvastatin may be better tolerated as they are less likely to cause muscle symptoms.
- **CK testing**: Routine CK testing is not indicated for mild SAMS, as most patients do not have elevated CK levels. However, CK testing is warranted if the patient experiences severe pain, objective muscle weakness, or if CK elevation is suspected. If CK levels exceed 3 × the upper limit of normal, the statin should be discontinued. CK elevations > 5–10× upper limit of normal require urgent evaluation for rhabdomyolysis.
- Pharmacologic alternatives to statins: If statin intolerance is confirmed, alternative LLTs should be considered. The 2022 ACC/AHA ECDP for nonstatin therapies outlines several options: 1) Ezetimibe: As a first-line nonstatin agent, ezetimibe reduces LDL-C by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in the intestine. It is well-tolerated and can be used alone or in combination with the lowest tolerable dose of a statin. 2) Bempedoic acid: The CLEAR Outcomes trial demonstrated that bempedoic acid is an effective option for statin-intolerant patients. Bempedoic acid, in combination with ezetimibe, has LDL-C-lowering efficacy comparable to moderate-intensity statins. This therapy is particularly useful for high-risk primary prevention patients, such as those with diabetes or elevated CAC scores. 3) Bile acid sequestrants: Although second-line agents, bile acid sequestrants can be considered if the patient is unable to tolerate both statins and ezetimibe. However, they may cause gastrointestinal side effects and have limited tolerability. 4) PCSK9 inhibitors: While PCSK9 inhibitors (eg, evolocumab, alirocumab) are not recommended for most primary prevention patients, they can be considered in very-high-risk individuals (eg, those with a CAC score > 1,000 AU or severe dyslipidemia). These agents are more frequently used in secondary prevention or patients with LDL-C > 190 mg/dL. 5) Inclisiran: Although inclisiran (a siRNA-based PCSK9 inhibitor) may offer long-term LDL-C reduction with less-frequent dosing, it lacks cardiovascular outcomes data in statin-intolerant patients and should be used cautiously.
- **Secondary prevention considerations**: If this patient were being treated for secondary prevention (ie, if he had known ASCVD or severe hyperlipidemia with LDL-C > 190 mg/dL), the need for LDL-C lowering would be more urgent. In such cases, more aggressive therapy with statins (if tolerable) or nonstatin agents like PCSK9 inhibitors would be warranted. The goal in secondary prevention is to achieve an LDL-C of < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline.

Vitamin D supplementation in statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) is discussed with proposed repletion targets but limited trial support, noting that higher doses (50,000–100,000 units per week) aim for on-treatment levels of 50–80 ng/mL; however, to date there has not been evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that vitamin D prevents SAMS or reduces symptom severity, and while it may be reasonable to check vitamin D levels and initiate supplementation if deficiency is identified, a well-designed RCT is still needed before any recommendations can be made about routine vitamin D measurement or treatment in those with SAMS and low vitamin D levels.

Switching statins in SAMS — tolerability considerations note that "All seven FDA-approved statins are pharmacologically unique, with differences in biotransformation pathways, half-life, elimination routes, and lipophilicity (Table 7)". "Switching to a statin that is metabolized by a different enzyme system, avoids various transporters, or is less lipophilic may improve drug tolerability". Evidence cited includes that "fluvastatin and pravastatin are better tolerated as compared to atorvastatin and simvastatin17, but this may be related in part to their lower LDL-C lowering efficacy". The statement also highlights that "The low milligram amount with pitavastatin dosing (1, 2, or 4 mg) may be more psychologically appealing to patients who prefer the "lowest milligram strength".

### Statin treatment and muscle symptoms: series of randomised, placebo controlled n-of-1 trials [^111CxHRy]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To establish the effect of statins on muscle symptoms in people who had previously reported muscle symptoms when taking statins.

Design

Series of randomised, placebo controlled n-of-1 trials.

Setting

Primary care across 50 sites in the United Kingdom, December 2016 to April 2018.

Participants

200 participants who had recently stopped or were considering stopping treatment with statins because of muscle symptoms.

Interventions

Participants were randomised to a sequence of six double blinded treatment periods (two months each) of atorvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo.

Main Outcome Measures

At the end of each treatment period, participants rated their muscle symptoms on a visual analogue scale (0–10). The primary analysis compared symptom scores in the statin and placebo periods.

Results

151 participants provided symptoms scores for at least one statin period and one placebo period and were included in the primary analysis. Overall, no difference in muscle symptom scores was found between the statin and placebo periods (mean difference statin minus placebo -0.11, 95% confidence interval -0.36 to 0.14; P = 0.40)). Withdrawals because of intolerable muscle symptoms were 18 participants (9%) during a statin period and 13 (7%) during a placebo period. Two thirds of those completing the trial reported restarting long term treatment with statins.

Conclusions

No overall effect of atorvastatin 20 mg on muscle symptoms compared with placebo was found in participants who had previously reported severe muscle symptoms when taking statins. Most people completing the trial intended to restart treatment with statins. N-of-1 trials can assess drug effects at the group level and guide individual treatment.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^114KPsy9]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Q: What are your thoughts on the findings of theTask Force on Statin Intolerance?

The NLA Statin Intolerance Task Force has similarly presented a pragmatic definition of statin intolerance: "Adverse symptoms, signs and/or laboratory abnormalities attributed by the patient and/or provider to a statin, and perceived by the patient to interfere with daily life activities". These include predominantly muscle‐related symptoms, with muscle aches being the most common, but also may include other symptoms, liver‐enzyme increases, and isolated muscle‐enzyme increases.

Importantly, the NLA has included the phrase "real or perceived" in further describing these symptoms.

The NLA provides practical, patient‐centered recommendations that serve as an important augmentation to the ACC/AHA Guidelines.

The NLA Task Force concluded that statin intolerance requires a patient‐centered approach in practice; reducing the dose of statin, switching to a different statin, and alternate regimens, such as every‐other‐day dosing, are recommended for patients with statin intolerance. For patients who cannot tolerate a statin using the above strategies, alternate agents alone or in combination may be considered; innovative approaches to research on statin intolerance are needed.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^112NwCoJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

In the Clinic

Q: What do you do when a patient tells you that they are experiencing muscle pain and associate it with their statin?

It is important to understand that many patients are not taking their statins; physicians may think all of their patients are adherent, but often they are not. Many patients discontinue their statin due to side effects, but they do not have the time or inclination to report this to their health care provider.

Part of the challenge is to identify intolerance when there are vastly different ways patients do, or do not, present with symptoms.

Patients are often misled by things they hear or have read on the Internet. When they initiate statin therapy, they often expect to experience symptoms, and this becomes a self‐fulfilling prophecy, which underscores the importance of a baseline assessment of symptoms.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^116xS3xK]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — Key take-home messages and conclusions state that "Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are the most common form of statin intolerance", and "The prevalence of SAMS, regardless of causality, is estimated to be about 10% (range 5% to 25%)". The prevalence of pharmacological SAMS "is estimated to be about 1–2% (range 0.5% to 4%)". The document notes that "Most SAMS are attributable to non-pharmacological factors (e.g., increased body aches from physical activity), not direct pharmacological effects of statin on muscle tissue, but are still clinically relevant because they may result in statin discontinuation", and that "Discontinuation of statin therapy in patients with SAMS is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and total mortality". It adds that "Most patients with SAMS can tolerate some dose of a statin through interventions that focus on lifestyle, risk factor modulation, and statin pharmacology optimization". Management guidance includes "Patient-centered clinical and communication strategies can help mitigate SAMS and improve medication adherence and outcomes among statin users", "The clinician should extend beyond tailoring patient expectations for adverse effects and informing them of the potential of nocebo effects, while emphasizing benefits and safety of statin therapy", plus "Modulation of risk factors for SAMS can improve statin tolerance" and "Optimization of dietary/lifestyle interventions can potentially minimize statin dosing intensity through improvement in cardiovascular/lipid risk".

### Update on statin-associated myopathy symptoms in the view of new clinical management strategies [^117NkUvS]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Purpose of this review is to highlight the recent findings in terms of clinical aspects, pathogenic mechanisms and managements of statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and focusing on the use of novel therapeutic alternatives in clinical practice.

Recent Findings

While extensive research has been conducted on SAMS, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Recent findings continue to explore various aspects, including potential risk factors, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies. Managing SAMS involves a careful assessment to confirm the diagnosis, a stepwise approach to treatment that may include dose adjustments, switching statins, considering alternate-day dosing, and exploring nonstatin therapies, all while prioritizing patient well being and cardiovascular risk reduction through shared decision-making and ongoing monitoring. In recent years, the therapeutic landscape has expanded with the introduction of several novel lipid-lowering agents, providing valuable alternatives for both statin-tolerant and statin-intolerant patients but their use in clinical practice is still limited because of high costs, regulatory limitations and type of administration.

Summary

Given the increasing use of both traditional and emerging lipid-lowering therapies, a clear understanding of their comparative safety, particularly regarding musculoskeletal adverse effects, is essential for guiding clinical decision-making.

Assessment and diagnosis of statin-associated muscle symptoms

While consensus groups including the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologyand the National Lipid Associationhave presented definitions of SAMS based on symptoms and the magnitude of CK elevation, less attention has been paid to clinical diagnostic criteria. Indeed, a definitive diagnosis of SAMS is difficult because symptoms are subjective and there is no 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Importantly, there is also no validated muscle symptom questionnaire, although the National Lipid Association has proposed a symptom scoring system based on the STOMP trial and the PRIMO survey (see). Consequently, we suggest that assessment of the probability of SAMS being due to a statin take account of the nature of the muscle symptoms, the elevation in CK levels and their temporal association with statin initiation, discontinuation, and re-challenge. Note that this is a clinical definition, which may not be appropriate for regulatory purposes.

In the absence of a standardized classification of SAMS, we propose to integrate all muscle-related complaints (e.g. pain, weakness, or cramps) as 'muscle symptoms', subdivided by the presence or absence of CK elevation (Table 1). Pain and weakness in typical SAMS are usually symmetrical and proximal, and generally affect large muscle groups including the thighs, buttocks, calves, and back muscles. Discomfort and weakness typically occur early (within 4–6 weeks after starting statin therapy), but may still occur after many years of treatment. Onset of new symptoms may occur with an increase in statin dose or initiation of an interacting drug. The symptoms appear to be more frequent in physically active individuals. Statin-associated muscle symptoms often appear more promptly when patients are re-exposed to the same statin.

Statin intolerance

A 59-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hyperlipidemia and well-controlled hypertension presents for his yearly exam. His fasting lipid panel shows:

- **LDL-C**: 145 mg/dL
- **HDL-C**: 36 mg/dL
- **Triglycerides**: 137 mg/dL
- **Total cholesterol**: 208 mg/dL

His blood pressure is 122/73 mm Hg on lisinopril 10 mg, and his hemoglobin A1c is 5.2%. He is a never-smoker, with no significant family history of premature CAD. His primary care physician calculates a 10-year ASCVD risk of 11.3% using the PCE (PREVENT 10-year risk of CVD 8.6%, ASCVD 5.5%). After discussing the risks and benefits of therapy, the patient was prescribed atorvastatin 20 mg, a moderate-intensity statin. Approximately 8 weeks later, he reports muscle aches in his thighs. Despite reducing the atorvastatin dose to 10 mg, his symptoms persist, and the statin is eventually discontinued, leading to symptom resolution. A trial of rosuvastatin 5 mg also results in muscle aches.

Discussion

This case highlights the challenge of managing statin intolerance, specifically SAMS, which is the most common side effect of statin therapy and the leading cause of discontinuation. SAMS refers to a spectrum of muscle symptoms, most commonly bilateral myalgias in large muscle groups, that are temporally related to statin therapy. Symptoms typically occur 4 to 12 weeks after initiation and resolve within 2 to 4 weeks of stopping the statin. The majority of SAMS cases do not involve creatine kinase (CK) elevation, and routine CK testing is not generally recommended, (Figure 4).

### Atorvastatin… [^114QGsG5]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Common side effects may include diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, muscle pain and, less frequently, joint pain. Muscle symptoms often occur during the first year and are commonly influenced by pre-existing health issues and the nocebo effect. Most patients can continue therapy with dose adjustment or statin switching. Cardiovascular disease
- Primary prevention of heart attack, stroke, and need for revascularization procedures in people who have risk factors such as age, smoking, high blood pressure, low HDL-C, and a family history of early heart disease, but have not yet developed evidence of coronary artery disease.
- Secondary prevention of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, major coronary events, ischaemic heart disease and revascularization in people with established coronary artery disease. The effect is dose-dependent and is amplified at higher doses. Close monitoring of liver function tests is required when high doses are used.
- Alongside other lifestyle changes in primary and secondary prevention of angina
- Myocardial infarction and stroke prevention in people with type 2 diabetes A 2014 meta-analysis showed high-dose statin therapy was significantly superior compared to moderate or low-intensity statin therapy in reducing plaque volume in people with acute coronary syndrome. The SATURN trial, which compared the effects of high-dose atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, also confirmed these findings. A meta-analysis of 21 RCTs confirmed that high dose atorvastatin therapy is more effective than regular dose or low dose statin therapy at preventing CI-AKI. Atorvastatin therapy can also help to prevent in-hospital dialysis post CM administration, however there is no evidence that it reduces all-cause mortality associated with CI-AKI. Overall, the evidence concludes that statin therapy, irrespective of the dose, is still more effective than no treatment or placebo at reducing the risk of CI-AKI.

Administration Statins have been evaluated in clinical trials in combination with fibrates to manage dyslipidemia in people who also have type 2 diabetes, and a high cardiovascular disease risk; however, there is limited clinical benefit noted for most cardiovascular outcomes. However, the only study included in the meta-analysis of atorvastatin in people with heart disease did not specifically investigate if morning or evening dosing was more effective for reducing LDL cholesterol. The trial did confirm that, irrespective of dosing time, atorvastatin is very effective at reducing total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increasing HDL cholesterol levels. Hence, atorvastatin should be taken at the same time each day, at a time that is most convenient for the patient, so it does not compromise compliance.
- **Hemodialysis**: Previous studies have demonstrated a lack of clear and significant clinical benefit of statins in reducing composite cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in adults on hemodialysis and/or diabetes), despite a reduction in total/ LDL cholesterol levels. The SHARP study suggested that the combination of a statin and ezetimibe is effective in reducing the risk of major atherosclerotic events in all CKD populations, including those on dialysis, but could not establish mortality benefit.
- Although limited studies have identified that statins may reduce all-cause mortality and composite cardiac events in hemodialysis patients with a higher baseline LDL-C level, findings are inconsistent and potentially misleading.

### A randomized trial of coenzyme Q10 in patients with statin myopathy: rationale and study design [^111cG624]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Statins are the most commonly prescribed and effective medications for reducing low-density lipoprotein levels. Some patients experience myopathic symptoms during statin treatment. The etiology is not known, but depletion of mevalonate pathway metabolites, including coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), has been suggested. Despite a lack of conclusive evidence supporting its utility, CoQ10 supplementation has been recommended to patients who experience myalgic symptoms.

Objective

The Co-Enzyme Q10 in Statin Myopathy study is designed to examine the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on the extent and intensity of muscle pain during treatment with simvastatin.

Methods

We will recruit patients with a documented history of myalgia during statin treatment. The presence of statin-related myalgia will be confirmed in a crossover run-in trial during which the presence and absence of symptoms will be documented during statin and placebo treatment, respectively. Individuals experience myalgic symptoms while taking statins but not placebo will be randomized to receive simvastatin 20 mg daily plus either 600 mg daily of CoQ10 or placebo. Muscle pain intensity will be documented during weekly phone calls via use of the Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form. Treatment will continue for 8 weeks or until muscle symptoms are reported continuously for 1 week or become intolerable, and then subjects will crossover to the alternative treatment (CoQ10 or placebo).

Results

This study is an ongoing clinical trial.

Conclusions

This study will determine the utility of CoQ10 for reducing pain intensity in myalgic patients and will provide guidance for clinicians treating patients with hypercholesterolemia who are intolerant to statins.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^114Su5kG]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — trial data and media influence are described with attention to nocebo considerations: Patients who had recently discontinued or planned to discontinue statins alternated between no treatment, blinded statin, or placebo for 12 months, and symptom intensity/severity of adverse effects did not differ between groups. In Danish initiators ≥ 40 years, exposure to negative statin-related news was associated with an odds ratio for early discontinuation of 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.12), and positive news with 0.92 (0.90–0.94); although statistically significant, the increase or decrease of discontinuation in association with media reports was less than 10%. Of the 1931 transcripts of statin-related news, 110 (< 6%) were negative, 731 (38%) positive, and 1090 (56%) neutral. The authors state that their goal is not to disprove a nocebo effect that likely contributes to SAMS for many patients and that the ultimate goal is to optimize lipid-lowering goal achievement and reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, so efforts to prove that patients have misinterpreted their symptoms may be counterproductive and unnecessary.

Statin intolerance — definition and alternatives: Statin intolerance is frequent in clinical practice and the most commonly reported cause is statin-associated muscle symptoms. To consider a patient as having statin intolerance, a minimum of 2 statins should be attempted, including at least 1 at the lowest approved daily dose. Options for complete or partial intolerance include ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor monoclonal antibodies, inclisiran, and bempedoic acid. Bempedoic acid reduces LDL-C levels by 15% to 25%, and a combination product with ezetimibe lowered LDL-C levels by approximately 35%. In CLEAR Outcomes, patients with ACS within 90 days prior to randomization were excluded; the mean LDL-C level was 139 mg/dL at enrollment and was reduced by 29 mg/dL with bempedoic acid compared with placebo. Bempedoic acid raised uric acid levels in a small subset of patients, and rates of abnormal liver function tests, gout, and gallstones were increased with its use in the trial.

### Statin therapy as primary prevention in exercising adults: best evidence for avoiding myalgia [^111Btzk9]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

This review aims to determine whether active adults who begin statins and develop myalgia reduce or stop activity to become less symptomatic. If this occurs, strategies to mitigate symptoms are explored. Should these strategies fail, the question of whether exercise is an adequate alternative to statin therapy is addressed.

Methods

PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Database were searched with keywords designed to retrieve information on statin myopathy in exercising adults.

Results

Statins are well tolerated by most people who exercise; however, caution is warranted in those who exercise at high levels, in the elderly, and in those receiving high-dose therapy. Several strategies improve statin tolerance while maintaining exercise levels, based on low-quality evidence. If statins are not tolerated, a continuing physical activity program can provide equivalent or superior cardiometabolic protection.

Conclusions

Statins may occasionally present a barrier to physical activity. A number of strategies exist that can reduce the risk of myopathy. If a choice between exercise and statins becomes necessary, exercise provides equal benefit in terms of cardiovascular protection and superior mortality reduction, with improved quality of life.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^115NFtLi]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis risk and nocebo considerations — clinical rhabdomyolysis can involve myoglobinuria and can cause acute renal injury and is estimated to occur in < 1/10,000 individuals treated with a statin over five years, with risk higher in patients with risk factors for SAMS. There is no biochemical test or clinical syndrome complex to determine whether muscle symptoms are directly attributable to statin use, and muscle symptoms ascribed to statins are at least 5-fold more frequent in observational studies than in RCTs; in contrast to the placebo effect, the nocebo effect is characterized by the expectation or anticipation of harm, with patients misattributing muscle discomfort to the statin instead of other etiologies such as increased body aches from physical activity.

### Statin intolerance: a literature review and management strategies [^116saeR9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Statin intolerance is a commonly encountered clinical problem for which useful management strategies exist. Although many patients report statin-related muscle symptoms, studies indicate that the majority of these patients can tolerate a statin upon re-challenge. Alternative statin dosing strategies are an effective way to modify and reintroduce statin therapy for patients reporting adverse symptoms. Correction of vitamin D deficiency and hypothyroidism may improve statin tolerability in some patients. CoQ10 supplementation has been found to be of no benefit for statin-related muscle symptoms in most recent clinical trials. PCSK9 inhibitors are a new therapeutic option that if confirmed as safe and effective by outcomes trials may be of substantial benefit to select patients at high ASCVD risk who are unable to achieve adequate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering on maximally tolerated statin therapy. Other available medications to lower LDL-C in statin intolerant patients include ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and fibrates.

### Screening and statin use in… [^112TjC8L]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

5 Statins are a class of lipid-lowering medications that function by inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, which is involved in the rate-limiting step in the production of cholesterol. Statins reduce levels of total cholesterol and LDL-C and, to a lesser extent, triglycerides, and probably have anti-inflammatory and plaque stabilization effects as well.
6. POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF STATIN USE The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a moderate amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater. POTENTIAL HARMS OF STATIN USE The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of low- to moderate-dose statin use in adults aged 40 to 75 years are small.

Randomized, clinical trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events have largely used low and moderate doses; under these conditions, statin use was not associated with serious adverse events such as cancer, severely elevated liver enzyme levels, or severe muscle-related harms. USPSTF ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit.

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10% has a small net benefit. The decision to initiate therapy in this population should reflect an assessment of patients' specific circumstances and their preference for a potential small benefit relative to the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a lifelong daily medication. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years and older without a history of CVD.

As such, the USPSTF does not recommend for or against the use of CRP alone as a risk factor in screening to prevent CVD events in asymptomatic adults without a history of CVD. 12 In JUPITER, most of the trial participants either also had hypertension or were smokers 10 — risk factors the USPSTF prioritized for determining potential suitability for statin therapy. In the recent HOPE-3 trial, there was no difference in the effects of statins among participants with or without elevated CRP levels.
8. Decisions about initiating statin use in this age group should be based on shared decision making between clinicians and patients about the potential benefits and harms. Specific recommendations from other organizations for such individuals are discussed in the "Recommendations of Others" section.

### Life-saving medications: the urgent need for guideline adherence and patient acceptance [^114g3nW2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Among the patients who declined statin therapy in the PALM registry, the reported number one reason was fear of side effects. 1 Patients are often unclear about the benefit versus risk of statins, and instead, focus on information obtained from the Internet or through communication with others. They fear that statins will cause muscle pain and weakness, liver damage, memory problems, and diabetes mellitus; however, the risk of serious adverse effects was very low (< 1%) in clinical trials. Before prescribing a statin medication, a thorough clinician–patient risk discussion must occur, which was introduced in the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline 2 and expanded in the 2018 multisociety cholesterol guideline. 3 The risk discussion begins with estimating a patient's 10‐year ASCVD risk in primary prevention or an explanation of a patient's high‐risk status in secondary prevention. This requires that the clinician be knowledgeable about clinical trial data and known risks and benefits of statin therapy, 14 and be able to communicate this information in a way that the patient will understand it. The risk discussion should also include factors that enhance a patient's risk but are not part of the 10‐year ASCVD risk estimation (eg, family history of premature ASCVD, metabolic syndrome, chronic inflammatory conditions, among others), and learning the patient's preferences, goals, and values in the context of shared decision making.

The clinician–patient risk discussion and the process of shared decision making can take significant time and is a challenge to thoroughly accomplish within a clinical encounter. However, a discussion about potential adverse effects of statins may help the clinician learn what the patient knows about risks or side effects and can correct any misinformation. 15 Over half of the participants in the PALM registry who discontinued statin therapy cited side effects as the reason. 1 It is often helpful at the initial conversation to inform patients that 7 statins are available and they have different pharmacological properties; if a patient has a side effect to 1 statin, often a different statin will be well tolerated. In fact, of the patients who discontinued or were never offered statin therapy in the PALM registry, ≈40% stated they would "very likely" retry or start statin therapy. 1 It is also helpful to state that muscle and joint problems occur for several reasons and to explain that statin‐associated muscle symptoms are usually bilateral and affect the large muscle groups close to the trunk. Finally, letting the patient know that the clinical team is available to discuss concerns by phone is enormously meaningful to patients.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^114jGbC1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient decisions: Patient-reported outcomes as defined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are "reports of the status of a patient's health condition that come directly from the patient, without interpretation of the patient's response by a clinician or anyone else". The STatin Adverse Treatment Experience (STATE) survey evaluated 1,500 patients who had taken a statin in the past 2 years and experienced ≥ 1 statin-associated symptom in the previous 6 months; 1,168 (78%) continued statins while 332 (22%) discontinued, with continuers citing avoidance of heart attack or stroke, lowering cholesterol, and doctor recommendation, and discontinuers most often citing tolerability issues; discontinuers reported higher symptom severity and impact than continuers. Among adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), higher shared decision-making scores were more likely to be associated with reported statin use. In an internet survey of over 10,000 current (88%) and former (12%) statin users, former users were less satisfied with physician-led discussions of cholesterol's importance for heart health (65% vs 83%) and more likely to report muscle-related symptoms (60% vs 25%). The text also notes that nocebo effects may contribute to and reinforce racial and ethnic inequities in clinical settings and outcomes.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^117KsXne]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin intolerance — non-statin therapy options and outcome evidence: Inability to tolerate low doses of 3–4 statins, or not achieving lipid goals on suboptimal statin dosing, is often sufficient to justify initiation of treatment with non-statin therapies. Other non-statin drugs have been proven to reduce cardiovascular events as either monotherapy (cholestyramine, niacin, gemfibrozil), and among these options, ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibiting monoclonal antibodies are proven to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. In addition, niacin monotherapy reduced ASCVD events in men with ASCVD, but not in combination with statins. The LDL-C-lowering efficacy is modest, but cholestyramine monotherapy is also proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In some patients treatment with fenofibrate may produce modest LDL-C lowering, but fibrates are primarily indicated for triglyceride-lowering and lack solid evidence of cardiovascular benefit. Management emphasizes achieving LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals while sequentially adding non-statin therapies, because the consequences of not achieving lipid goals are progression of ASCVD and occurrence of cardiovascular events.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^114VNko1]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

From a treatment viewpoint, Zhang et al.showed that 90% of patients reporting SAMS to one statin were able to tolerate an alternative statin with continued use after 12 months, suggesting that statin-attributed symptoms may have had other causes or were not generalizable to other statins. Similar results were reported by Mampuya et al. Furthermore, increased prescription of statins itself appears to be associated with increased non-adherence or discontinuation, as illustrated for Denmark over the period 1995–2010 (Figure 1). Different factors may have contributed to this finding. Increased media coverage of statins and their perceived side-effects, as well as wider prescription in primary prevention where the benefits may be less obvious to patients, may be contributing to greater non-adherence and discontinuation.

Figure 1
Trends in statin use (upper panel) and statin non-adherence/discontinuation (lower panel) in adults ≥ 40 years, in Denmark over the period 1995–2010. Statin use from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2010 was classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification of Drugs code C10AA, as registered in the national Danish Registry of Medicinal Products Statistics, recording information on all prescribed drugs dispensed at all Danish pharmacies from 1995 onwards (for details see references). The percentage of the Danish population aged ≥ 40 years on statins increased from < 1% in 1995 to 11% in 2010. Correspondingly, non-adherence or discontinuation (defined as the percentage of patients starting statins who only redeemed one prescription) increased from 2% in 1995 to 13% in 2010. Figure designed by Dr Sune F. Nielsen and Prof Børge G. Nordestgaard.

Here, this European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Panel provides an overview of the science underlying the pathophysiology of statin-induced myopathy, as well as guidance for clinicians on the diagnosis and management of SAMS. We have avoided the use of the term 'statin intolerance', as this is not specific for muscle symptoms. These recommendations can assist in improving the likelihood that patients experiencing SAMS receive optimal low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapy to minimize their risk for CVD.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^111X4z8C]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The main strength of our analyses is that they provide the first reliable estimates of the causal contribution of statins to muscle symptoms reported by a wide range of patients. The data are derived from large-scale, double-blind, randomised trials, which guarantees the avoidance of both moderate random errors and moderate biases. By contrast, non-randomised observational studies, in which outcomes are compared between individuals who received the treatment of interest and those who did not are (irrespective of their size) prone to moderate biases (especially where participants are aware of which drugs they are taking), which cannot be guaranteed to be removed through statistical adjustment (eg, propensity score matching).

However, there are some potential limitations to our analyses. Firstly, there was considerable heterogeneity in the methods used for the ascertainment of muscle symptoms, and definitions varied from trial to trial. Nonetheless, as noted above, the relative excesses appeared to be broadly consistent among the different trials and clinical circumstances. Secondly, although we sought adverse event data from all randomised, double-blind trials included in the CTT, some data were not available. However, the missing data represented less than 1% of all adverse events,(mainly because of data privacy concerns). Furthermore, data were not consistently available on whether muscle events led to the discontinuation of allocated treatment (and thus planned on-treatment analyses for rare events were not possible), and there was no reliable information on some relevant comorbid conditions (such as hypothyroidism) or concomitant medications that might affect the risk of having symptoms. Thirdly, most reports of muscle pain or weakness were not accompanied by a measurement of creatine kinase value, so we were unable to assess whether some symptoms were associated with large increases in creatine kinase concentrations. However, among the cases for which there were data available on creatine kinase concentrations, more than 96% were less than 3 times the ULN, and there was no evidence that (after removing myopathy cases) extreme creatine kinase values were more common among participants allocated to the statin groups. Finally, although all trials excluded anyone known to have had a previous serious adverse reaction to statin therapy, and many took steps to exclude those with a previous statin sensitivity or hypersensitivity, most of them did not seek to identify or exclude participants who might now be categorised as statin intolerant (most of the trials had completed enrolment before statins were in common use and well before they were available generically).

Incidence was similar to a survey of 7924 French patients taking high dosage statin therapy of 10.5%, with time to onset of ~1 month (35 ± 31 days in STOMP).

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2018 Cholesterol Clinical Practice Guidelines — SAMS assessment and rechallenge emphasize that before lipid-lowering therapy with a statin is initiated, a comprehensive evaluation of musculoskeletal symptoms (with documentation) is recommended, and several randomized crossover trials in patients with SAMS support statin discontinuation until symptoms improve followed by rechallenge with a reduced dose, alternative agent, or alternative dosing regimen while monitoring; if the approach of reassess, re-discuss, and rechallenge is used, a majority of patients will be able to be successfully treated with at least one or several statins, in patients at increased ASCVD risk the goal should be to treat with the guideline-recommended maximally tolerated statin dose, patients who experience rhabdomyolysis may need to discontinue statin use indefinitely, and clinicians should be aware of statin-associated autoimmune myopathy that requires statin cessation and additional therapy, with such patients benefiting from seeing a neurologist specializing in neuromuscular disorders.
