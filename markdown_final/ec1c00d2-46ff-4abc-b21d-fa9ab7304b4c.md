## Question

Patients who were treated for Hodgkin lymphoma are at risk for what other cancers

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which other cancers Hodgkin lymphoma survivors are at increased risk for. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the magnitude and time course of second malignant neoplasm (SMN) risk. Then, I should categorize the types of SMNs by pathobiology and organ system. Next, I will examine treatment-specific risk factors, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and combined-modality therapy. After that, I need to consider patient-level modifiers such as age at treatment, sex, smoking, and family history. Finally, I will translate this into practical screening recommendations and survivorship counseling, while verifying where modern therapy might have altered risk profiles [^115ZkiDr] [^11713mA7].

> Let me first confirm the overall risk signal and its persistence over time. Large cohort data show a roughly 2.4-fold increased overall risk of second cancers in HL survivors, with risk remaining elevated beyond 35 years and a 40-year cumulative incidence approaching 48–50% in some series, underscoring the need for lifelong surveillance planning [^115ZkiDr] [^114Hom6X]. Wait, let me verify the latency patterns: hematologic SMNs tend to emerge within 5–10 years, whereas solid tumors dominate after 10 years and continue to accrue for decades, which aligns with meta-analytic and cohort observations [^115nucJL] [^113auwb4].

> I will now examine hematologic secondary malignancies. Therapy-related AML and MDS are tightly linked to alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors, with intensified regimens like escalated BEACOPP increasing t-AML/MDS risk compared with standard-dose ABVD, and the time to onset typically within 4–10 years after treatment completion [^111LHBsS] [^115nucJL]. Hold on, I should verify the absolute risk framing: meta-analytic data suggest about 0.7% t-AML/MDS in pooled RCT cohorts, but this underestimates risk with higher alkylator exposure and longer follow-up, so counseling should reflect dose intensity and latency [^117XLJSa] [^111LHBsS]. Secondary NHL is also increased, with some cohorts showing a 13-fold elevation versus the general population, though pathology review reveals a subset may represent clonally related relapses rather than true second primaries, which tempers interpretation of incidence estimates [^116seum6] [^111E6CWW].

> Next, I should review solid tumors by organ system, starting with breast cancer. Female HL survivors treated with thoracic radiotherapy, especially mantle fields, have a markedly elevated risk with long median latencies around 17–22 years and relative risks commonly exceeding 3–8 fold depending on dose and age at exposure; importantly, risk does not appear to have declined in more recent treatment eras in some cohorts, which I need to keep in mind when counseling [^115ZkiDr] [^111PqcaE]. Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought procarbazine might increase breast cancer risk, but I should correct that — procarbazine-related gonadotoxicity and premature menopause are associated with a lower risk of radiation-related breast cancer, so the directionality is opposite to my first instinct [^115ZkiDr].

> Lung cancer follows a similar pattern of elevated risk with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy contributions, and smoking acts synergistically to multiply risk; latency is long, often peaking after 10–20 years, and prognosis is frequently poor unless detected early, which strengthens the rationale for risk-tailored screening in high-risk survivors [^112irUEu] [^1169teCg]. I should double-check that both alkylators and thoracic irradiation independently contribute and that risk remains elevated for decades, which is supported by cohort and meta-analytic data [^111CpmxB] [^112irUEu].

> Gastrointestinal cancers, particularly colorectal cancer, are increased after subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy and with higher cumulative procarbazine dose; dose–response relationships have been quantified, and the excess risk persists beyond 40 years, so age-appropriate colorectal screening must be integrated with treatment-exposure history [^112jcLNg] [^113auwb4]. Let me consider the broader GI spectrum: gastric, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers also show increased incidence with higher organ doses, reinforcing the need to minimize bowel exposure when planning radiotherapy fields [^1149r7VU] [^113auwb4].

> Thyroid cancer risk is increased after neck/mantle irradiation, with papillary carcinoma predominating and risk rising with higher thyroid doses; lifetime surveillance is prudent given persistent risk and the high prevalence of nodules in exposed populations [^11552JgP] [^113c4oxc]. I should confirm that dose–volume metrics correlate with hypothyroidism and second cancers, which supports using V25 and V30 constraints when feasible [^11552JgP] [^113c4oxc].

> Skin cancers, especially basal cell carcinoma, occur at substantially increased rates after radiotherapy, frequently within prior fields, and risk accrues with longer follow-up; survivors benefit from dermatologic surveillance and sun protection counseling [^111aP3Rm]. Hold on, I should verify that the excess is not solely attributable to detection bias — field predilection and elevated standardized incidence ratios support a true treatment-related effect [^111aP3Rm].

> Sarcomas, both bone and soft tissue, are a recognized late consequence of radiotherapy with long latencies; pediatric and adolescent cohorts show particularly high relative risks, and these cancers often arise within or at the margins of prior radiation fields, warranting vigilance for new masses or bone pain decades after treatment [^115kWPJd] [^117LkXUP]. I need to ensure I communicate that while rare, these tumors contribute meaningfully to absolute excess risk in younger survivors [^notfound].

> Let me consider other solid tumors with smaller but consistent signals: melanoma, bladder, and mesothelioma have been reported with increased incidence in HL cohorts, and mesothelioma in particular has been linked to prior thoracic irradiation, so symptom-triggered evaluation is reasonable when clinical features arise [^117FftLd] [^113auwb4]. I should confirm that these associations derive largely from observational cohorts and case series, so absolute risks are lower but still clinically relevant in long-term follow-up [^117FftLd].

> Now, I need to analyze treatment-specific risk factors. Combined-modality therapy generally confers higher solid tumor risk than chemotherapy alone, whereas adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy reduces relapse and thereby lowers the need for salvage radiotherapy, which itself carries SMN risk; meta-analytic data show more SMNs with combined-modality therapy versus chemotherapy alone, but fewer than with radiotherapy alone as initial treatment, highlighting a nuanced risk–benefit balance [^11713mA7] [^1145CSD5]. Wait, let me verify the directionality for breast cancer specifically: extended-field thoracic radiotherapy increases breast cancer risk compared with involved-field approaches, supporting modern field-reduction strategies [^114JQqog] [^11713mA7].

> Chemotherapy alone increases risks of lung cancer, secondary NHL, and leukemia, with risk profiles varying by regimen; intensified alkylator-based protocols improve progression-free survival but raise t-AML/MDS risk, whereas ABVD has a comparatively lower leukemogenic signal in pooled analyses, though absolute risks still rise with cumulative exposure and follow-up duration [^111LHBsS] [^111CpmxB]. I should confirm that contemporary dose-attenuated and response-adapted strategies may mitigate some risks, but long-term solid tumor data are still maturing [^115QG253] [^1175s4a6].

> Patient-level modifiers materially shift risk. Younger age at HL treatment, especially under 35, amplifies radiation-related solid tumor risks, particularly breast and lung cancers, and female sex elevates breast cancer risk; smoking multiplies lung cancer risk several-fold, and family history of cancer independently increases overall second-cancer risk with notable site-specific effects for lung, colorectal, and breast cancers [^115ZkiDr] [^114Hom6X]. Hold on, I should verify that these modifiers are consistently observed across populations and time periods, which they are in Nordic and other large registries [^114Hom6X] [^1159UcEK].

> Translating this into screening, I need to ensure recommendations align with guidelines and latency biology. For females treated with thoracic radiotherapy between ages 10–30, annual breast MRI alternating with mammography should begin 8 years after treatment or at age 25, whichever comes last, with clinical breast exams 1–2 times yearly; chemoprevention can be discussed in high-risk survivors, acknowledging limited direct evidence in this population [^1158N8U3]. For lung cancer, annual low-dose CT is reasonable for high-risk smokers with substantial thoracic radiation or alkylator exposure, ideally initiated about 10–12 years after treatment in the highest-risk phenotypes, recognizing cost-effectiveness trade-offs in never-smokers [^1151jvr5] [^112GqAJA]. Colonoscopy should start at age 45 or 10 years after pelvic/abdominal radiotherapy, whichever comes first, with earlier initiation for high procarbazine exposure; thyroid ultrasound is reserved for palpable nodules or high-risk features; and dermatologic skin exams are advised given the markedly elevated BCC risk after radiotherapy [^112jcLNg] [^113c4oxc] [^111aP3Rm]. I should confirm that these strategies are framed as risk-adapted and shared decision-making, which is emphasized in survivorship guidance [^117J1arF] [^115GUR1D].

> Finally, I need to ensure survivorship counseling captures evolving therapy. Modern involved-node/site techniques, lower radiation doses, omission of bleomycin in PET-negative advanced disease, and the integration of checkpoint inhibitors may reduce some late toxicities, but solid tumor latency means we cannot yet declare victory; ongoing follow-up and registry linkage remain essential to quantify benefits, and patients should receive a treatment summary with RT fields, organ-at-risk doses, and cumulative anthracycline exposure to guide surveillance [^1175s4a6] [^115PMguh] [^117J1arF] [^114iBeez]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite response-adapted strategies, population-level second-cancer risks have not uniformly declined in all cohorts, so individualized risk counseling and adherence to screening are critical pillars of care [^115ZkiDr] [^115GUR1D].

Patients treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have a **significantly increased risk of second cancers** [^115ZkiDr], with a 4–5-fold overall excess versus the general population and a 40-year cumulative incidence up to 48.5% [^115ZkiDr]. The highest risks are for **breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers** [^112jcLNg], especially with chest radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy [^113auwb4]. Secondary leukemias and non-Hodgkin lymphoma also occur, typically within 5–10 years of treatment [^115nucJL]. Risk persists for decades [^115ZkiDr] and is influenced by age at treatment, radiation field/dose, and chemotherapy type [^113auwb4]; modern regimens reduce but do not eliminate this risk [^11713mA7]. Lifelong surveillance and risk-adapted screening are essential [^113auwb4].

## Types of second cancers

### Solid tumors

- **Breast cancer**: Markedly elevated risk in females treated with chest radiotherapy [^11713mA7], particularly when exposed at a young age [^1158N8U3]; risk remains elevated for decades [^115ZkiDr].

- **Lung cancer**: Increased with chest radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy [^113auwb4]; smoking further multiplies risk [^112irUEu].

- **Gastrointestinal cancers**: Higher incidence of colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers [^112jcLNg], especially with subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy and procarbazine exposure [^112jcLNg].

- **Thyroid cancer**: Elevated risk after neck/mantle irradiation [^11552JgP]; papillary carcinoma predominates [^11552JgP].

- **Skin cancer**: Basal cell carcinoma risk is increased, particularly within radiation fields [^111aP3Rm].

- **Sarcomas**: Bone and soft-tissue sarcomas arise after high-dose radiotherapy [^notfound], often decades later [^117FftLd].

---

### Hematologic malignancies

- **Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: Linked to alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors [^115nucJL]; typically occur within 5–10 years [^115nucJL].

- **Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)**: Risk is increased up to 13-fold [^116seum6], likely reflecting treatment-related toxicity and immune dysregulation [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors influencing second cancer development

Several factors influence **second cancer risk** in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors:

| **Risk factor** | **Influence on second cancer risk** |
|-|-|
| Age at treatment | Younger age at treatment significantly increases risk, particularly for breast and lung cancers [^1158N8U3] [^113auwb4] |
| Radiation therapy | Chest and neck irradiation markedly increase risks of breast, lung, thyroid, and gastrointestinal cancers [^11713mA7] [^112jcLNg] |
| Chemotherapy | Alkylating agents (e.g. procarbazine) increase risks of AML, MDS, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers [^113auwb4] [^112jcLNg] |
| Smoking | Strongly amplifies radiation- and chemotherapy-related lung cancer risk [^112irUEu] [^113auwb4] |
| Family history | First-degree family history of cancer increases overall second cancer risk [^114Hom6X] |

---

## Temporal patterns of second cancer occurrence

Second cancers exhibit distinct **temporal patterns**:

- **Early onset (within 5–10 years)**: AML, MDS, and NHL typically occur within 5–10 years of treatment [^115nucJL].

- **Late onset (after 10 years)**: Solid tumors, particularly breast, lung, gastrointestinal, and thyroid cancers, emerge after 10 years and remain elevated for decades [^115ZkiDr] [^113auwb4].

- **Persistent risk**: Elevated risk persists for at least 40 years after treatment [^115ZkiDr].

---

## Impact of modern treatment modalities

Modern treatment refinements — including involved-field radiotherapy, dose reduction, and response-adapted chemotherapy — have reduced but not eliminated second cancer risk [^11713mA7] [^112W5GHp] [^115QG253]. Even with contemporary regimens, the risk remains **2–4 times higher** than in the general population [^113auwb4] [^115ZkiDr].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **lifelong surveillance and risk-adapted screening**:

- **Breast cancer screening**: Annual MRI and mammography for women treated with chest radiotherapy between ages 10–30, starting 8 years post-treatment or at age 25 (whichever is later) [^1158N8U3].

- **Lung cancer screening**: Consider low-dose CT for high-risk survivors, particularly smokers and those with chest irradiation [^1151jvr5].

- **Gastrointestinal screening**: Colonoscopy starting 10 years after treatment or at age 45, whichever is earlier, for those exposed to subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy or alkylating agents [^notfound].

- **Thyroid surveillance**: Annual thyroid examinations and ultrasound if nodules are detected [^11552JgP].

---

## Conclusion

Survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma face a **significantly increased risk of second cancers** [^115ZkiDr], including breast, lung, gastrointestinal, thyroid, skin, sarcomas, and hematologic malignancies [^117FftLd] [^113auwb4]. Risk is shaped by age at treatment, radiation field/dose, chemotherapy exposure, smoking, and family history [^114Hom6X], and remains elevated for decades [^115ZkiDr]. Modern therapies have reduced but not eliminated this risk [^11713mA7], making lifelong, risk-adapted surveillance essential [^115HYkSf].

### Secondary malignant neoplasms, progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated for Hodgkin lymphoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1141C9dx]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment intensification to maximize disease control and reduced intensity approaches to minimize the risk of late sequelae have been evaluated in newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. The influence of these interventions on the risk of secondary malignant neoplasms, progression-free survival and overall survival is reported in the meta-analysis herein, based on individual patient data from 9498 patients treated within 16 randomized controlled trials for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma between 1984 and 2007. Secondary malignant neoplasms were meta-analyzed using Peto's method as time-to-event outcomes. For progression-free and overall survival, hazard ratios derived from each trial using Cox regression were combined by inverse-variance weighting. Five study questions (combined-modality treatment vs. chemotherapy alone; more extended vs. involved-field radiotherapy; radiation at higher doses vs. radiation at 20 Gy; more vs. fewer cycles of the same chemotherapy protocol; standard-dose chemotherapy vs. intensified chemotherapy) were investigated. After a median follow-up of 7.4 years, dose-intensified chemotherapy resulted in better progression-free survival rates (P = 0.007) as compared with standard-dose chemotherapy, but was associated with an increased risk of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (P = 0.0028). No progression-free or overall survival differences were observed between combined-modality treatment and chemotherapy alone, but more secondary malignant neoplasms were seen after combined-modality treatment (P = 0.010). For the remaining three study questions, outcomes and secondary malignancy rates did not differ significantly between treatment strategies. The results of this meta-analysis help to weigh up efficacy and secondary malignancy risk for the choice of first-line treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma patients. However, final conclusions regarding secondary solid tumors require longer follow-up.

### State of the art in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma [^114CSiQ5]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has become one of the most easily curable malignancies in oncology. More than 80% of patients can be cured with risk-adapted treatment that includes chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This progress is mainly due to the development of multi-agent chemotherapy and improved radiation techniques; however, severe, life-threatening treatment-related side effects occur, which include organ toxicity and secondary malignancies. Thus, the treatment approaches must be carefully balanced between optimal disease control and the risk of long-term sequelae. Although this article is meant to provide an overview of the current treatment approaches for patients with HL, in many instances conflicting results from various clinical trials are available, and a personal judgment is inevitable. Here, we focus on evidence from large clinical trials with solid conclusions.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Hodgkin lymphoma, version 2.2022 [^114H7v7L]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

NCCN Hodgkin lymphoma — principles of RT dose constraints and secondary cancers note that patients with hematologic malignancies typically receive far lower RT doses than those with epithelial or mesenchymal malignancies, and more stringent dose constraints proportionally reduced from acceptable thresholds in other malignancies are recommended. Doses to organs at risk should follow principles of ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable), though in some scenarios target coverage may require dose constraints to be exceeded if the organ at risk is within or adjacent to the planning target volume. A relatively rare but serious late complication of RT is radiation-induced secondary cancers, and studies have reported that increasing RT dose without a safe threshold dose (linear no-threshold model) is associated with an increased risk; other contributing factors include age, environmental exposures, genetic risk factors, and radiation technique, and RT dose constraints recommended for organs at risk, especially heart, lung, and breast, are described below.

Hodgkin lymphoma — late effects and secondary cancers: Secondary cancers, cardiovascular disease, hypothyroidism, and fertility issues are the most significant late effects in long-term survivors of HL, with incidence increasing with longer follow-up, and risk possibly less with current treatment programs compared to those used > 10 years ago. Solid tumors are the most common secondary cancers and most develop > 10 years after completion of treatment; the risk of developing secondary cancers is highest when radiotherapy (RT) is used as a component of first-line treatment. Meta-analysis cited showed the risk of developing secondary cancers was lower with combined modality treatment (CMT) than with RT alone as the initial treatment and marginally higher with CMT compared with chemotherapy alone as initial treatment. No significant differences were seen with involved-field RT (IFRT) versus extended-field RT (EFRT), although the risk of developing breast cancer was substantially higher for EFRT; risks for secondary lung cancer, NHL, and leukemia were increased after chemotherapy alone, whereas CMT was associated with an increased risk for these and several other cancers.

### Late effects of treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma [^116K9Ez2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2006). Low credibility.

With advances in multimodality therapy, survival from Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) now exceeds 80%, resulting in a large cohort of survivors who are at risk for adverse long-term sequelae of therapy. This risk is complicated by possible endogenous predispositions to developing late effects, which relate to the patient's underlying susceptibility to HL. Finally, the impact of HL on the host can compromise organ function. This article reviews the possible dominant late effects for survivors of HL and strategies for monitoring and screening. As therapy for HL has changed and evolved, so has the spectrum of late effects. Mortality from HL has decreased, whereas delayed effects of therapy have increased. Refinements in therapy to decrease toxicity have occurred in response to the success in curing HL. Thus, modifications in therapeutic protocols using a risk-adapted strategy have reduced the use of alkylating agents, anthracyclines, and radiotherapy, which are associated with adverse long-term sequelae. The most clinically evident sequelae are those involving the endocrine and cardiovascular systems, and the most morbid are hematologic and solid second malignancies. Primary and secondary prevention strategies can be developed as knowledge of delayed effects of therapy increases.

Patient characteristics

IPD from 9498 patients treated within 16 randomized clinical trials for newly diagnosed HL were included. At the time of HL treatment, patients were aged between 14 and 75 according to inclusion criteria of the included studies (eight exceptions between ten and 87 years), median age was 33 years. During the course of follow-up, an SMN was reported for 438/9498 patients (4.6%), including 63 t-AML/MDS (0.7%), 86 secondary NHL (0.9%) and 276 (2.9%) secondary solid tumors. The sites most often affected were the breast (39/276), lung (35/276), skin (29/276) and bowel (colon, rectum) (23/276). In 13 patients (0.1%) diagnosed with an SMN, information on the tumor entity was lacking. Cumulative incidences of SMN at five, ten, 15 and 20 years (regarding death as a competing risk) were 2.4%, 5.8%, 13% and 23%, respectively.

### Secondary malignant neoplasms, progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated for Hodgkin lymphoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114Mec2K]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Searches for randomized clinical trials including patients with newly diagnosed HL that compared treatment approaches according to the mentioned study questions and published from 1984 onwards were performed in March 2010 using the electronic literature databases Medline and Cochrane Central. Reference lists of all relevant retrieved publications and previous meta-analyses were searched. All identified articles were screened independently by two authors. Trials had to have enrolled at least 50 patients per treatment group and to have finished recruitment before or during 2007, to avoid trials with inadequate follow-up. Searches were repeated in April 2015.

IPD were requested from the investigators of the eligible trials, including birth date, sex, HL diagnosis date, stage at diagnosis, presence of B symptoms, randomization date, allocated treatment, remission status after first-line treatment, relapse date, date and type of SMN, death date and last follow-up date concerning clinical outcome and vital status.

Statistical methods

For quality control, each trial included in the meta-analysis was initially analyzed separately, comparing the treatment arms with respect to recruitment times, patient characteristics, complete remission rates, follow-up duration, PFS, OS and time to SMN. Results were compared with previous trial publications and inconsistencies were queried. Risk of bias was assessed for each trial according to the Cochrane recommendations. To assess completeness of follow-up, the median observation time was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method with reverse censoring at death. The distribution of last information dates was quantified using the interquartile range of the dates of last information (IQR-DLI). This range includes the central 50% of last information dates and thus represents the extent to which patients in a given study are lost to follow up over a broad time interval. Large IQR-DLI values (absolute or relative to median follow-up) suggest poorer quality of follow up.

Hodgkin lymphoma — radiation therapy (RT) dose constraint guidelines for lymphoma (secondary malignancies): Dose recommendations (1.8–2 Gy/fraction) aim to minimize organ-at-risk volumes above specified thresholds linked with secondary cancers. Breast: minimize volume > 4 Gy (ideally < 10%) — breast cancer (adenocarcinoma); colon: minimize volume > 10 Gy — colon cancer; lung: minimize volume > 9 Gy — lung cancer; esophagus: minimize volume > 30 Gy — esophageal cancer; stomach: minimize volume > 25 Gy — gastric cancer; pancreas: minimize volume > 5–10 Gy — pancreatic cancer. The linear no-threshold model supports limiting RT dose to susceptible organs as low as reasonably achievable, and all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Introduction

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoid malignancy with an incidence of 3–4/100 000/year. Young adults are most often affected. At present, about 80% of patients achieve long-term remission after treatment with multi-agent chemotherapy optionally followed by radiotherapy (RT). Given the mostly young age at diagnosis and the excellent long-term prognosis, therapy-related late effects including secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN), cardiovascular disease and infertility have become increasingly important. – Several recent clinical trials evaluated the possibility of reducing toxicity by limiting chemotherapy and RT without compromising efficacy. Conversely, some studies for patients with newly diagnosed advanced HL investigated intensified chemotherapy protocols to improve the clinical outcome of high-risk patients.

SMN are divided into secondary hematological malignancies including therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (t-AML/MDS) and secondary non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and the heterogeneous group of secondary solid tumors. An association between the use of alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors and the development of t-AML/MDS has been demonstrated. – Both drug classes are included in first-line chemotherapy protocols such as adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD), bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone escalated (BEA-COPP) and vinblastine, doxorubicin, vincristine, bleomycin, mustard, etoposide, and prednisone (Stanford V). – For secondary NHL, such associations have not been identified. The time interval between HL treatment and the occurrence of secondary hematological malignancies is usually short, ranging between four and ten years in most cases. In contrast, the risk of secondary solid tumors remains significantly increased for up to 25 years and more.

### Second primary cancers: an overview [^117AMKGE]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Substantial improvements in the past few decades in cancer detection and supportive care along with advances in therapy have led to growing numbers of cancer survivors. In view of the prolongation of survival in increasing numbers of patients, identification and quantification of the late effects of cancer and its therapy have become critical. One of the most serious events experienced by cancer survivors is the diagnosis of a new cancer. The number of patients who have second or higher-order cancers is increasing, and solid tumors are a leading cause of mortality among several populations of long-term survivors, including patients who have Hodgkin lymphoma. The focus of this article is treatment-associated malignancies in survivors of selected adult cancers.

Results

Results of the search

A total of 3515 references (excluding duplicates) published after 1984 were identified in 2010 and reviewed for eligibility. The majority did not meet the predefined criteria and were excluded for the following reasons: 1419 references did not concern HL patients, 1162 did not report a clinical trial, 161 reported on patients in the second-line setting, 98 reported non-randomized trials, 97 were review articles, and 53 were duplicates. Hence, 578 references fulfilled the predefined general eligibility criteria and were reassessed concerning the exact treatment comparison. A total of 21 randomized clinical trials for the first-line treatment of HL were identified, which included at least 50 patients per study arm and compared treatment modalities that matched with at least one of the five study questions. Data were received for 16 trials conducted between 1984 and 2007 (Figure 1). – No data were received for four studies. – One additional trial first published in 2013 was only found in the 2015 search, so IPD were not sought. One trial was split for analysis since the participating centers could choose between two alternative intensified chemotherapy regimens.

Nonetheless, given the relevant proportion of HL patients that have already developed an SMN after a median observation of 7.4 years, the present report underscores the need for treatment approaches allowing a more accurate allocation to defined risk groups, in order to prevent overtreatment and reduce the risk of the development of potentially fatal SMN. At present, interim PET is considered the most promising tool to stratify treatment. Some mature results addressing this issue are already available and additional studies will be analyzed in the near future. The replacement of conventional chemotherapy by novel agents such as the CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin and antibodies targeting the programmed death cell protein 1 (PD-1) may also reduce the risk for the development of SMN.

### Risk of multiple primary malignancies following treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma [^111ZS3ZV]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

We assessed risk, localization, and timing of third malignancies in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors. In a cohort of 3122 5-year HL survivors diagnosed before the age of 51 years and treated between 1965 and 1995, we examined whether risk factors for second and third malignancies differ and whether the occurrence of a second malignancy affects the risk of subsequent malignancies, using recurrent event analyses. After a median follow-up of 22.6 years, 832 patients developed a second malignancy and 126 patients a third one. The risk of a second malignancy was 4.7-fold increased (95% confidence interval, 4.4–5.1) compared with risk in the general population; the risk for a third malignancy after a second malignancy was 5.4-fold (95% CI, 4.4–6.5) increased. The 10-year cumulative incidence of any third malignancy was 13.3%. Compared with patients still free of a second malignancy, patients with a second malignancy had a higher risk of developing subsequent malignancies. This risk depended on age, with hazard ratios of 2.2, 1.6, and 1.1 for patients aged < 25, 25 to 34, and 35 to 50 years at HL treatment, respectively. In HL survivors who had a second malignancy, treating physicians should be aware of the increased risk of subsequent malignancies.

### Second primary malignancies after treatment for malignant lymphoma [^113ESLTx]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Where an elevated risk of solid cancers has been demonstrated, it appears to remain significantly increased up to 20 years after lymphoma diagnosis.

While it is important to determine the incidence of second primary malignancies in survivors of both HL and NHL, it is more vital to define the risk factors for each type of malignancy, so that either these can be modified or patients at particular risk can be closely monitored.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Hodgkin lymphoma, version 2.2022 [^112uPZHB]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Hodgkin lymphoma radiation therapy dose-constraint principles — For hematologic malignancies, more stringent dose constraints, often proportionally reduced from other malignancies, are recommended, and doses to organs at risk (OARs) should follow principles of ALARA, though target coverage may require exceeding constraints if an OAR is within or adjacent to the planning target volume (PTV). Increasing dose is associated with increasing risk of secondary malignancies without a safe threshold dose (linear no-threshold model), so limiting dose to susceptible organs is vital. Cardiac and pulmonary complications after RT are highlighted as most concerning, and recommendations are noted as category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Incidence, risk factors, and pathogenesis of second malignancies in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma [^111Zmx5J]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2007). Low credibility.

Most Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients will survive their diagnosis. High dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, and radiation therapy have all been implicated as risk factors to secondary cancer development. Herein, we will review the molecular biology, examine the epidemiologic findings, discuss the impact of both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and focus on the special populations of pediatrics and high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation with regard to secondary cancer development.

### Secondary malignant neoplasms, progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated for Hodgkin lymphoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111LHBsS]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

In the meta-analysis herein, an increased t-AML/MDS rate was seen in patients receiving intensified chemotherapy compared with patients treated with standard-dose chemotherapy. This finding is consistent with other reports on t-AML/MDS after HL treatment. An analysis by the GHSG, including 11952 patients treated within prospective studies for newly diagnosed HL, demonstrated that patients receiving no BEACOPP or up to four cycles of escalated BEACOPP had significantly lower cumulative t-AML/MDS rates than patients treated with four or more cycles of escalated BEACOPP (0.3% vs. 0.7% vs. 1.7%; P < 0.0001).

For escalated BEACOPP, the increased t-AML/MDS risk contrasts with an improved clinical outcome. PFS (P < 0.00001) and OS (P = 0.0005) rates were better than those seen with standard-dose protocols, i.e. ABVD or COPP/ABVD. This is in line with the results of a network meta-analysis on the effect of the initial treatment strategy on the survival of patients with advanced HL. That analysis, which included a total of 9993 patients, revealed a survival advantage of 10% at five years for escalated BEA-COPP in comparison with ABVD.

Generally, this meta-analysis provides high-quality evidence on SMN, PFS and OS among patients treated for HL, as the used data are from participants of large randomized trials for the first-line treatment of HL. However, the analysis has some limitations. With a median overall follow-up of 7.4 years, valid estimates are only possible for secondary hematological malignancies, whilst final conclusions regarding secondary solid tumors that often occur more than ten years after HL cannot be drawn. The long-term data of HL patients treated within clinical trials are therefore necessary but often difficult to obtain due to different factors, including a limited duration of insurance for study participants and a lack of funding sources. There is also some uncertainty about the completeness of SMN reporting which is of particular importance due to the small number of SMN events. Finally, for certain outcomes and study questions there was a considerable heterogeneity of up to 89% between the included trials, which signifies that the overall meta-analytic results may not apply in all situations.

### Second malignancy risk associated with treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma: meta-analysis of the randomised trials [^114JQqog]. Annals of Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Despite several investigations, second malignancy risks (SMR) following radiotherapy alone (RT), chemotherapy alone (CT) and combined chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) remain controversial.

Patients and Methods

We sought individual patient data from randomised trials comparing RT versus CRT, CT versus CRT, RT versus CT or involved-field (IF) versus extended-field (EF) RT for untreated HL. Overall SMR (including effects of salvage treatment) were compared using Peto's method.

Results

Data for between 53% and 69% of patients were obtained for the four comparisons. (i) RT versus CRT (15 trials, 3343 patients): SMR were lower with CRT than with RT as initial treatment (odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.62–0.98 and P = 0.03). (ii) CT versus CRT (16 trials, 2861 patients): SMR were marginally higher with CRT than with CT as initial treatment (OR = 1.38, CI 1.00–1.89 and P = 0.05). (iii) IF-RT versus EF-RT (19 trials, 3221 patients): no significant difference in SMR (P = 0.28) although more breast cancers occurred with EF-RT (P = 0.04 and OR = 3.25).

Conclusions

Administration of CT in addition to RT as initial therapy for HL decreases overall SMR by reducing relapse and need for salvage therapy. Administration of RT additional to CT marginally increases overall SMR in advanced stages. Breast cancer risk (but not SMR in general) was substantially higher after EF-RT. Caution is needed in applying these findings to current therapies.

### Breast cancer after treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma: general review [^114Dyjqw]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2008). Low credibility.

The improved survival rates among patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma over the past few decades have come with increased incidence of second malignancies. One of the major concerns among female survivors is the significantly elevated risk of breast cancer that appears with extended follow-up. In this review, we include the published literature regarding the risk of breast cancer after irradiation for Hodgkin's lymphoma. We also present the possible long-term surveillance strategies and the optimal time to start screening these women. This could potentially help in early detection of secondary breast cancers and consequently improve outcomes. Furthermore, because of prior radiotherapy, the management of the breast cancer among this unique population has been controversial. We discuss the characteristics of breast cancer that occurs after Hodgkin's lymphoma and also treatment options that could be implemented.

### Late mortality, secondary malignancy and hospitalisation in teenage and young adult survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma: report of the childhood / adolescent / young adult cancer survivors research program and the BC cancer agency centre for lymphoid cancer [^113ip1Et]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Late complications affecting Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors are well described in paediatric and adult-based publications. This study determined the late morbidity and mortality risk for 442 teenage and young adult (TYAs) 5-year HL survivors, diagnosed at 15–24 years of age between 1970 and 1999, identified from the British Columbia Cancer Registry. Treatment details were abstracted from charts. Survivors and a matched comparison cohort were linked to provincial administrative health datasets until December 2006 and regression analysis was performed, providing risk ratios regarding mortality, secondary malignancy and morbidity causing hospitalisation. Sixty (13·6%) survivors experienced late mortality with excess deaths from secondary cancer [standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 18·6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 11–29·4] and non-malignant disease (SMR 3·6; 95% CI 2·2–5·5). Excess secondary cancers (standardised incidence ratio 7·8; 95% CI 5·6–10·5) were associated with radiotherapy [Hazard ratio (HR) 2·7; 95% CI 1–7·7] and female gender (HR 1·8; 95% CI 1–3·4). Of 281 survivors treated between 1981 and 1999, 143 (51%) had morbidity resulting in hospitalisation (relative risk 1·45; 95% CI 1·22–1·73). Hospitalisation significantly increased with combined modality therapy, chemotherapy alone and recent treatment era. TYA HL survivors have excess risk of mortality and secondary malignancy continuing 30 years from diagnosis. Radiotherapy is associated with secondary malignancy and current response-adapted protocols attempt to minimise exposure, but late morbidity causing hospitalisation remains significant.

### Second primary malignancies after treatment for malignant lymphoma [^115o9LxM]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

To determine the incidence and possible causes of second primary malignancies after treatment for Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL and NHL). A cohort of 3764 consecutive patients diagnosed with HL or NHL between January 1970 and July 2001 was identified using the Sheffield Lymphoma Group database. A search was undertaken for all patients diagnosed with a subsequent primary malignancy. Two matched controls were identified for each case. Odds ratios were calculated to detect and quantify any risk factors in the cases compared to their matched controls. Mean follow-up for the cohort was 5.2 years. A total of 68 patients who developed second cancers at least 6 months after their primary diagnosis were identified, giving a crude incidence of 1.89% overall: 3.21% among the patients treated for HL, 1.32% in those treated for NHL. Most common were bronchial, breast, colorectal and haematological malignancies. High stage at diagnosis almost reached statistical significance in the analysis of just the NHL patients (odds ratio = 3.48; P = 0.068) after adjustment for other factors. Treatment modality was not statistically significant in any analysis. High stage at diagnosis of NHL may be a risk factor for developing a second primary cancer.

### Second cancer risk up to 40 years after treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma [^115ZkiDr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma are at increased risk for treatment-related subsequent malignant neoplasms. The effect of less toxic treatments, introduced in the late 1980s, on the long-term risk of a second cancer remains unknown.

Methods

We enrolled 3905 persons in the Netherlands who had survived for at least 5 years after the initiation of treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients had received treatment between 1965 and 2000, when they were 15 to 50 years of age. We compared the risk of a second cancer among these patients with the risk that was expected on the basis of cancer incidence in the general population. Treatment-specific risks were compared within the cohort.

Results

With a median follow-up of 19.1 years, 1055 second cancers were diagnosed in 908 patients, resulting in a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 4.6 (95% confidence interval, 4.3 to 4.9) in the study cohort as compared with the general population. The risk was still elevated 35 years or more after treatment (SIR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.8 to 5.4), and the cumulative incidence of a second cancer in the study cohort at 40 years was 48.5% (95% CI, 45.4 to 51.5). The cumulative incidence of second solid cancers did not differ according to study period (1965–1976, 1977–1988, or 1989–2000) (P = 0.71 for heterogeneity). Although the risk of breast cancer was lower among patients who were treated with supradiaphragmatic-field radiotherapy not including the axilla than among those who were exposed to mantle-field irradiation (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.72), the risk of breast cancer was not lower among patients treated in the 1989–2000 study period than among those treated in the two earlier periods. A cumulative procarbazine dose of 4.3 g or more per square meter of body-surface area (which has been associated with premature menopause) was associated with a significantly lower risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio for the comparison with no chemotherapy, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.84) but a higher risk of gastrointestinal cancer (hazard ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.69 to 4.30).

Conclusions

The risk of second solid cancers did not appear to be lower among patients treated in the most recent calendar period studied (1989–2000) than among those treated in earlier periods. The awareness of an increased risk of second cancer remains crucial for survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma. (Funded by the Dutch Cancer Society.).

### Pathology review identifies frequent misdiagnoses in recurrent classic Hodgkin lymphoma in a nationwide cohort: implications for clinical and epidemiological studies [^116seum6]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Successes in the treatment of patients with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) have resulted in a high long-term survival rate. On the downside, these patients also have a high risk of developing treatment-related secondary cancers. As part of a large epidemiological cohort study, Schaapveld et al. showed that patients treated for CHL who survived for 5 years or longer had a 13-fold increased risk of secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A very recent study based on Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data further showed an increased bidirectional risk of NHL and CHL, especially between CHL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and between CHL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The increased risk of secondary NHL in CHL patients may be explained by (late) treatment-related toxicity, genetic predisposition, or coincidental (low-grade) NHL diagnosed due to routine long-term follow-up in these patients. More focus has been given to the complex differential diagnosis of CHL in the past few years, and evolving insights may have an impact on epidemiological aspects such as the risk of secondary cancer.

### Risk for second malignancies in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors: a meta-analysis [^115ijY87]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Late side-effects are becoming an important issue in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) survivors. We intended to estimate pooled relative risk (RR) of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs), to evaluate site-associated RR and the impact of different treatments.

Design

We carried out an electronic search of Medline and EMBASE seeking articles investigating the risk of SMNs and reporting RR measures. The studies were evaluated for heterogeneity before meta-analysis and for publication bias. Pooled RRs were estimated using fixed- and random-effects models.

Results

A total of 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. Pooled RRs of SMNs overall and for solid tumors were 1.88 and 1.32, respectively. We found an excess of risk for several specific cancer sites. Radiotherapy alone did not increase the risk for SMNs, while chemotherapy and combined treatments augmented the RR. Regression analyses revealed a positive significant association for all SMNs with total body irradiation, and for solid SMNs with younger age. No publication bias was observed.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that NHL patients experience a higher risk for SMNs than the general population and that various treatments have different impact on RR. More information will be necessary to evaluate possible interactions with genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure.

### Second primary malignancy risk after Hodgkin lymphoma treatment among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected survivors [^112Xc2Ep]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2022). Medium credibility.

We compared secondary primary malignancy risk (SPM) in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors. We used data from the California Cancer Registry on patients diagnosed with HL from 1990 to 2015 (all ages included), and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and multivariable competing risk models for analyses. Of 19,667 survivors, 735 were HIV-infected. Compared with the general population, the risk of SPM was increased by 2.66-fold in HIV-infected and 1.92-fold in HIV-uninfected survivors. Among HIV-infected survivors, median time to development of SPM was shorter (5.4years) than in HIV-uninfected patients (8.1years). Additionally, the highest risk of SPM was observed < 2years after diagnosis in HIV-infected survivors (SIR = 4.47), whereas risk was highest ≥ 20years after diagnosis (SIR = 2.39) in HIV-uninfected survivors. The risk of SPMs persisted for decades and was higher among HIV-infected survivors, suggesting that these patients should benefit from long-term surveillance and cancer prevention practices.

### Solid tumors in patients treated for Hodgkin's disease: a report from the German Hodgkin lymphoma study group [^114gyyj5]. Annals of Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term survivors of successfully treated Hodgkin's disease (HD) are at risk for late complications. Among these, secondary solid tumors are most serious because they are often fatal. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess the incidence, relative risk and risk factors of secondary solid tumors in HD patients registered in the database of the German Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group (GHSG).

Patients and Methods

From 1983 to 1998, the GHSG conducted three generations of clinical trials for early, intermediate and advanced stage HD (HD1-HD9) involving a total of 5367 patients. Data on incidence, risk factors and relative risk were updated in March 2003.

Results

A total of 127 patients with secondary solid tumors were identified. Among these, lung cancer (23.6%), colorectal cancer (20.5%) and breast cancer (10.2%) were the most frequent. After a median follow-up of 72 months the cumulative risk of developing a solid tumor was 2%, with an overall relative risk (RR) of 2.4 (lung cancer, 3.8; colorectal cancer, 3.2; breast cancer, 1.9). For most patients (n = 67; 52.8%) developing a secondary solid tumor, treatment modality consisted of chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy in extended field technique (RR = 3.3).

Conclusions

With a median follow-up of 72 months, there were 127 patients developing solid tumors out of a total of 5367 HD patients treated in the GHSG studies HD1-HD9. The cumulative risk of 2% is expected to increase over time due to the rather short median observation time and slow progression of solid malignancies.

### The importance of secondary cancer screening programs in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors [^113bqUbA]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the late 1960s, when combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy were introduced for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), survival has dramatically increased. Cure has come at a price, however, because the treatment of HL has been shown to significantly increase the risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms and other late effects. Although very high relative risks have been observed for secondary leukemias, especially in patients treated with alkylating agents, second solid cancers (e.g. lung cancer), which are primarily related to procarbazine or mustine alkylating chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, contribute most to the absolute excess risk of second cancers in long-term survivors of this disease. Survival rates of patients otherwise cured of their HL are still significantly lower than that of the general population adjusted for age and sex.

Undoubtedly, the establishment of screening programs in this patient population would favor the early detection of these secondary neoplasms, would allow the establishment of therapeutic strategies in early stages and, finally, not only improve the long-term survival of patients cured of their underlying disease but also have a significant impact on their quality of life as well as on the economic burden that the development of a secondary neoplasm has on society. In the ever-smoking general population, two large prospective randomized clinical trials established the role of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan screening as an adequate strategy for early detection of otherwise asymptomatic lung cancer; the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) that randomized a chest radiograph versus a LDCT scan of the thorax as a screening strategy for the ever-smoking population, was able to demonstrate a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality in the LDCT scan arm. In the NELSON (Netherlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek) randomized prospective clinical trial that included ever-smokers aged 50 to 75 years, the LDCT screening was associated with a reduction in lung cancer mortality of 24% in men and 33% in women.

### Care of the adult Hodgkin lymphoma survivor [^1133Ed6e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Of those individuals diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, 85% will survive and may be affected by residual effects of their cancer and its therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation). Hodgkin lymphoma survivors are at risk of developing secondary malignancies, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, thyroid disease, infertility, premature menopause, chronic fatigue, and psychosocial issues. These conditions usually have a long latency and therefore present years or decades after Hodgkin lymphoma treatment, when the patient's care is being managed by a primary care provider. This review summarizes these unique potential medical and psychologic sequelae of Hodgkin lymphoma, and provides screening and management recommendations.

### Current treatment and immunotherapy of Hodgkin's lymphoma [^114EWM7t]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

The treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma has changed significantly over the last decades, rendering this entity one of the most curable human cancers. To date, about 80% of patients achieve long-term disease-free survival. Current strategies in first-line treatment aim at further improving outcome and thereby preventing therapy-induced complications, such as infertility, cardiopulmonary toxicity, and secondary malignancies. Ongoing trials for patients in early stages are investigating lower radiation doses and smaller radiation fields and possible reductions in the doses or number of cycles of chemotherapy given. For patients in advanced stages, new drug combinations with higher dose density and intensity have been developed, and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Approaches for relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma comprise salvage radiotherapy, salvage chemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. In recent years, the introduction of effective salvage high-dose therapy and a better understanding of prognostic factors have remarkably improved the management of relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma. For multiple pretreated patients antibody-based agents that showed promising results in experimental models are being investigated in clinical trials. Radioimmunoconjugates and monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated some clinical efficacy. Here, we review new aspects in the treatment of primary and relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as recent immunotherapeutic approaches.

### Lung malignancies after Hodgkin lymphoma: disease characteristics, detection methods and clinical outcome [^1169teCg]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors have an increased risk of secondary malignancies. We analyzed outcomes in patients with lung cancers following HL treatment.

Patients and Methods

Cases of thoracic malignancies were retrospectively identified from a multi-institutional database of 1976 patients treated for HL from 1969 to 2007. Data regarding risk factors, disease characteristics and outcomes were obtained from medical records.

Results

Lung malignancies were identified in 55 patients a median of 19.5 years after initial HL therapy. Thirty-one patients (56%) had a > 10 pack-year history of tobacco use, 48 (87%) received thoracic irradiation and 26 (47%) received alkylating chemotherapy. Of the 42 patients with known stage at lung cancer diagnosis, 23 (55%) were stage IV and 5 (12%) were stage III. The method of lung cancer detection was known for 35 patients; of these, 12 (34%) were detected incidentally. Median survival time after diagnosis was 10 months for all 55 patients. Median survival time for patients with incidentally detected tumors has not been reached with a median follow-up of 39 months.

Conclusions

Lung malignancies diagnosed in patients successfully treated for HL generally have a dismal prognosis. However, a subset of patients diagnosed incidentally may have potentially curable disease.

### Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and combined modality for Hodgkin's disease, with emphasis on second cancer risk [^1145CSD5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Second malignancies (SM) are a major late effect of treatment for Hodgkin's disease (HD). Reliable comparisons of SM risk between alternative treatment strategies are lacking.

Objectives

Radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy (CT) and combined chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) for newly-diagnosed Hodgkin's disease are compared with respect to SM risk, overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survival. Further, involved-field (IF-)RT is compared to extended-field (EF-)RT.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PubMed, EMBASE, CancerLit, LILACS, relevant conference proceedings, trials lists and publications.

Selection Criteria

RCTs accruing 30+ patients and completing accrual before/during 2000, comparing at least two treatment modalities for newly-diagnosed HD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Individual patient data were collected and assessed for data quality. Trialists submitted additional information concerning methods and data quality. Peto Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for OS, PFS and SM-free survival. Secondary acute leukemia (AL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and solid tumours (ST) were also analysed separately.

Main Results

37 trials (9312 patients) were analysed: 15 (3343) for RT vs. CRT, 16 (2861) for CT vs. CRT, 3 (415) for RT vs. CT and 10 (3221) for IF-RT vs. EF-RT.CRT was superior to RT in terms of OS (OR = 0.76, CI = 0.66 to 0.89, p = 0.0004), PFS (OR = 0.49, CI = 0.43 to 0.56, p < 0.0001) and SM (OR = 0.78. CI = 0.62 to 0.98, p = 0.03). The superiority of CRT also applied to early and advanced stages (mainly IIIA) separately. Excess SM with RT is due mainly to ST and is apparently caused by greater need for salvage therapy after RT.CRT was superior to CT in terms of PFS (OR = 77, CI 0.68 to 0.77, p < 0.0001). OS was better with CRT for early stages only (OR = 0.62, CI 0.44 to 0.88, p = 0.006). SM risk was higher with CRT (OR = 1.38, CI 1.00 to 1.89, p = 0.05), although not significant for early stages alone. This effect, also seen in AL and ST separately, was due directly to first-line treatment. Data were insufficient to compare RT to CT.EF-RT was superior to IF-RT (each additional to CT in most trials) in terms of PFS (OR = 81, CI 0.68 to 0.95, p = 0.009) but not OS. No significant difference in SM was observed.

Authors' Conclusions

CRT seems to be optimal for most early stage (I-II) HD patients. For advanced stages (III-IV), CRT better prevents progression/relapse but CT alone seems to cause less SM. RT alone gives a higher overall SM risk than CRT due to increased need for salvage therapy. Reduced SM risk after IF-RT instead of EF-RT could not be demonstrated. Due to the large number of studies excluded because no IPD were received, to the inclusion of many outdated treatments and to the limited amount of long-term data, one must be cautious in applying these results to current therapies.

### The real risk of secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma following classical Hodgkin lymphoma [^111E6CWW]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) is a B-cell lineage lymphoid malignancy. The majority of the patients are diagnosed between 15 and 30 years of age, followed by another peak in adults aged ≥ 55 years. Most cases of CHL are curable by modern treatments. However, therapeutic modalities such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy used to achieve this high rate of cure have side effects in the long term, especially in young patients. The leading causes of long-term toxicity caused by therapy include cardiovascular disease and secondary malignancies such as breast cancer and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. In addition, case control and registry studies suggest that CHL patients may have familial predisposition and germline susceptibility to develop additional lymphoid malignancies. Previous studies, including a large cohort study with long-term and complete follow-up, showed that the risk of developing a secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was increased significantly up to 13-fold in CHL patients compared to that in the general population.

In this issue of Haematologica, Boot et al. re-assess this risk based on an in-depth pathology review of a nationwide cohort of patients with CHL in the Netherlands. The study was designed to review the accuracy of pathological diagnosis of NHL following CHL. The cohort was restricted to 2,669 patients with CHL diagnosed between 2006–2013 for whom the initial diagnosis of CHL could be confirmed by review of pathology reports. Fifty-four of these 2,669 cases of CHL (2%) had a subsequent diagnosis of NHL. The expert pathology review was restricted to the 54 cases for which both the original CHL diagnosis and subsequent NHL diagnosis were available.

The review confirmed the CHL diagnosis and subsequent NHL in 25 cases. Interestingly, six of the cases were biologically, and very likely clonally, related to the original CHL such as primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and mediastinal gray zone lymphoma, suggesting that these would be best considered relapses of the same neoplastic disorder rather that unrelated secondary neoplasms. Eighteen of the 19 remaining cases were different histologies of NHL, presumably representing true secondary malignancies.

### Long-term risk of secondary skin cancers after radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma [^111aP3Rm]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) are at risk of secondary tumors. We investigated the risk of secondary skin cancers after radiotherapy compared to treatment without radiation and to an age-matched population.

Material and Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 889 HL patients treated between 1965 and 2005. Data on secondary skin cancers and treatment fields were retrieved. Incidence rates were compared to observed rates in the Dutch population.

Results

318 skin cancers were diagnosed in 86 patients, showing significantly higher risks of skin cancers, the majority being BCC. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of BCC in HL survivors was significantly increased (SIR 5.2, 95% CI 4.0–6.6), especially in those aged < 35 years at diagnosis (SIR 8.0, 95% CI 5.8–10.7). SIR increased with longer follow-up to 15.9 (95% CI 9.1–25.9) after 35 years, with 626 excess cases per 10,000 patients per year. Most (57%) skin cancers developed within the radiation fields, with significantly increased risk in patients treated with radiotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (p = 0·047, HR 2·75, 95% CI 1·01–7.45).

Conclusion

Radiotherapy for HL is associated with a strongly increased long-term risk of secondary skin cancers, both compared to the general population and to treatment with chemotherapy alone.

### Secondary malignancies after treatment for indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: a 16-year follow-up study [^111Rxn9E]. Haematologica (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Relatively little information is available on the incidence of secondary cancer in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The aim of this long-term follow-up study was to determine the incidence, the time free of second tumors, and risk factors for developing secondary cancer in a homogeneous group of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Design and Methods

We evaluated a total of 563 patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma enrolled in Gruppo Italiano Studio Linfomi trials from 1988 to 2003.

Results

After a median follow-up of 62 months, 39 patients (6.9%) developed secondary cancer: 12 myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myeloid leukemia, and 27 solid tumors. The overall standardized incidence ratio of secondary malignancy in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was higher than the risk of malignancy in the general population. The standardized incidence ratio was elevated in male patients and in patients under 65 years old at first treatment. Overall, the cumulative incidence of secondary cancer at 12 years was 10.5%, after correction in a competing-risk model. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that older age at the time of diagnosis, male sex, and fludarabine-containing therapy had significant negative impacts on the time free of second tumors.

Conclusions

We have identified subgroups of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with increased standardized incidence ratios of secondary malignancy and variables that have a negative impact on the time free of second tumors. This information could help physicians to select the most appropriate treatments. Finally, taking into account the possible occurrence of secondary neoplasia, long-term monitoring must be considered.

### Long-term complications of lymphoma and its treatment [^113adQK7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

As a result of therapeutic advances, there is a growing population of survivors of both Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). A thorough understanding of the late effects of cancer and its treatment, including the risk of developing a second malignancy and non-neoplastic complications, most notably cardiac disease, is essential for the proper long-term follow-up care of these patients. For HL survivors cured in the past 5 decades, a large body of literature describes a range of long-term effects, many of which are related to extent of treatment. These studies form the basis for many of the follow-up recommendations developed for HL survivors. As HL therapy continues to evolve, however, with an emphasis toward treatment reduction, in particular for early-stage disease, it will be important to rigorously observe this new generation of patients long term to document and quantify late effects associated with modern treatments. Although data on late effects after NHL therapy have recently emerged, the formulation of structured follow-up plans for this heterogeneous group of survivors is challenging, given the highly variable natural history, treatments, and overall prognosis. However, the chemotherapy and radiation therapy approaches for some types of NHL are similar to that for HL; thus, some of the follow-up guidelines for patients with HL may also be transferrable to selected survivors of NHL. Additional work focused on treatment-related complications after NHL will facilitate the development of follow-up programs, as well as treatment refinements to minimize late effects in patients with various types of NHL.

### Evaluation of the risk of therapy-associated complications in survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma [^114Dn11k]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Given the improvements in survival of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in the last three decades, quantification of the late effects of successful treatment has become critical. Since the highest incidence rates of HL occur at ages 20 to 34 years, large numbers of patients remain at lifelong risk for the late effects of treatment. Deaths due to second cancers are now the most common cause of mortality among long-term survivors of HL, followed by cardiac disease. Risk measures of these and other late sequelae, however, can vary markedly between investigations, depending on the types of treatment, the rigor with which epidemiologic study designs are applied, ascertainment of events of interest, the duration and completeness of follow-up, and consideration of competing risks. Further, numerous influences apart from therapy can affect late effects, including patient age, sex, race, lifestyle factors (tobacco, alcohol, diet), comorbidities, and the underlying cancer process. In the future, it will become increasingly important for health-care providers to be able to critically evaluate the risk of late effects in HL survivors, which will include a working knowledge of various epidemiologic study designs and risk measures and an ability to judiciously review the medical literature. In this article, the methods, significance and caveats in calculating and reporting risks of complications of treatment for HL are reviewed.

### Current survivorship recommendations for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma: focus on late effects [^115sJYxc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Long-term survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are at an increased risk for a range of late complications, with subsequent malignant neoplasm and cardiovascular disease representing the 2 leading causes of death in these patients. Raising awareness, close follow-up, and adoption of selected early-detection and risk-reduction strategies may help to reduce the adverse impact of these late effects on patients. This chapter reviews known long-term complications of HL therapy, risk factors, and the timing of their occurrence. Where available, data on the efficacy of screening for selected late effects of HL are presented. Current evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations on follow-up of long-term HL survivors are also reviewed. As HL therapy evolves over time, late effects and implications on follow-up of patients treated in the contemporary era should be considered and opportunities for future research should be explored.

(5) Standard-dose chemotherapy (ABVD or cyclophosphamide vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (COPP)/ABVD) vs. intensified chemotherapy

A total of 2996 advanced-stage patients treated within a Gruppo Italiano Terapie Innovative nei Linfomi (GITIL)-Intergruppo Italiano Linfomi (IIL) trial, the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio dei Linfomi (GISL) HD2000 trial, the GHSG HD9 trial, the HD9601 trial from Italy and the British LY09 and ISRCTN64141244 trials were analyzed. The rates of RT were comparable in both treatment groups of the included studies with the exception of the ISRCTN64141244 and HD9601 trials, administering Stanford V as an intensified regimen. After a median follow-up of 6.7 years, 31/1305 patients (2.8%) who had received standard-dose chemotherapy (ABVD, COPP/ABVD) and 60/1691 patients (3.5%) treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols (escalated BEACOPP, Stanford V, ChlVPP/prednisolone, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, and etoposide (PABIOE), ChlVPP/etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin (EVA), MOPP/EBV/CAD, COPP/EBV/CAD) had developed an SMN. This difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15; Peto's OR: 1.37, 95%-CI: 0.89–2.10; Figures 4 and 5). When considering t-AML/MDS, secondary NHL and secondary solid tumors separately, an increased risk to develop t-AML/MDS was seen for patients treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols (P = 0.0028), whereas the incidence rates for secondary NHL and secondary solid tumors did not differ between the treatment groups (Table 3). Overall, tumor control was significantly better with intensified chemotherapy regimens as compared with standard-dose protocols (P = 0.007; HR: 0.82, 95%-CI: (0.70–0.95)) while there were no significant differences in OS (P = 0.12; HR: 0.85, 95%-CI: (0.70–1.04)). However, subgroup analyses revealed that patients aged ≤ 50, in particular, appear to benefit from more aggressive chemotherapy approaches as the improved PFS also translated into a better OS in these patients (P = 0.02). In contrast with patients older than 50 years, patients aged ≤ 50 also had a significantly greater SMN risk with intensified chemotherapy protocols than with standard-dose chemotherapy (interaction P = 0.02; treatment effect in younger subgroup: P = 0.01). Additional subgroup analyses revealed differences between the different intensified protocols for PFS (interaction P < 0.00001) and OS (interaction P = 0.006). Patients treated with escalated BEACOPP had superior PFS and OS rates in comparison with those receiving standard-dose chemotherapy. For Stanford V, PFS was worse than with standard-dose chemotherapy. No PFS and OS differences in comparison with standard-dose chemotherapy were observed for ChlVPP/PABIOE, ChlVPP/EVA, MOPP/EBV/CAD and COPP/EBV/CAD. For SMN no interaction in chemotherapy subgroups were found (interaction P = 0.06; Online Supplementary Table S3).

The long journey of understanding and intervening in the prevention of neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases secondary to the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma.

And last, but not least, there are some well-known barriers that can eventually hinder the effectiveness of second cancers in general and lung cancer in particular screening programs; lack of awareness - both survivors and healthcare providers may lack awareness of the potential increased risk of lung cancer and the importance of regular screening; in fact, early introduction of the concept of potential lung cancer screening strategies in long-surviving lung cancer patients by the responsible onco-hematologist and primary care physician may have increased the uptake in terms of responsive patients in the Broadbent pilot study; it is vitally important to work on improving the process. Access to care - geographic, financial, and logistical barriers can limit access to necessary screening services, particularly for those in underserved areas. Insurance coverage - inconsistent insurance coverage for screening tests can be a significant barrier. Advocacy for comprehensive insurance policies that cover necessary screenings is essential and, in those countries in which the health care system is public, all the economic considerations that repeated testing in a potential group of patients that might not need them can eventually have and, psychological barriers - fear of cancer recurrence and the emotional toll of undergoing regular screenings can deter survivors from participating in screening programs. Final considerations go to the false-positive and -negative rates, sensitivity and specificity of the process. In this pilot study, 88.2% of the LDCT results were negative, 9.8% indeterminate and only 2.0%, positive. Two 3-month surveillance scans were positive and of four positive scans, two patients were diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer and one, underwent curative surgery. These numbers are a clear example of the need to properly balance the potential pitfalls of these screening strategies, including the deleterious effects of unnecessary irradiation doses in the vast majority of patients, with the undoubted benefits of this approach. Additional thoughts should be given to the fact that first line treatment strategies in these patients have been optimized with the objective to increase effectiveness but to decrease early, mid- and long-term toxicities; screening programs should take into consideration this new reality.

In summary, the prospective pilot study presented by Broadbentand colleagues demonstrates the feasibility and medical importance of lung cancer screening strategies in patients with HL who are long survivors but, on the other hand, opens up a number of questions that will force us to improve them in the future (Figure 1).

Hodgkin lymphoma follow-up after completion of treatment — documentation and care coordination are specified as follows: Complete response (CR) should be documented including reversion of FDG-PET/CT to "negative" within 3 mo following completion of therapy. It is recommended that the patient be provided with a treatment summary at the completion of therapy, including details of RT, organs at risk (OARs), and cumulative anthracycline dosage given. Follow-up with an oncologist is recommended and should be coordinated with the primary care physician (PCP), especially during the first 5 y after treatment to detect recurrence, and then annually due to the risk of late complications including second cancers and cardiovascular disease. Late relapse or transformation to large cell lymphoma may occur in NLPHL. The frequency and types of tests may vary depending on clinical circumstances: age and stage at diagnosis, social habits, treatment modality, etc., and there are few data to support specific recommendations; these represent the range of practice at NCCN Member Institutions. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Hodgkin lymphoma — thyroid dose constraints and surveillance after radiotherapy (RT) emphasize persistent risk and dose–volume limits. The risk of developing hypothyroidism persists long after treatment has concluded, and lifetime screening is required. Dosimetric metrics have been associated with higher risk, and the Panel recommends limiting V25 Gy to < 63.5% and minimizing V30 Gy. For secondary thyroid cancer risk, with doses above 20 to 30 Gy, the risk may begin to decline, and given the ubiquity of nodules, most screening guidelines recommend ultrasound only if a nodule is palpable on exam.

### Association of radiation and procarbazine dose with risk of colorectal cancer among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma [^112jcLNg]. JAMA Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Advances in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treatment have yielded improvements in survival; 5-year disease-specific survival is now greater than 85%. However, survivors are at risk of treatment-related late adverse effects, including subsequent malignant neoplasms. We have previously shown that gastrointestinal malignant tumors are the third most common second cancers in HL survivors, after breast and lung cancer. Compared with the general population, HL survivors have a 2.8-fold higher rate of colorectal cancer, and the rate remains increased for more than 40 years. We also previously reported on associations of subdiaphragmatic RT and procarbazine with increased colorectal cancer rates among HL survivors. However, those results cannot be used to estimate colorectal cancer rates for patients treated more recently because radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy doses are now lower. Therefore, an understanding of the dose-response relationship is needed to quantify and estimate the risk of secondary cancers based on individual treatment exposures. These relationships have been demonstrated for secondary cancers of the breast, lung, stomach, pancreas, and esophagusafter treatment for HL, but not for the colon or rectum, to our knowledge. To quantify the colorectal cancer rate associated with radiation dose to the large bowel and cumulative procarbazine dose, we have conducted a nested case-control study using individual HL treatment data.

Breast — radiation therapy (RT) for thoracic lymphomas uses lower doses than epithelial breast cancer, and breast tissue exposure from lymphoma RT falls within acceptable dose constraints. Breast tissue radiation exposure results in an increased lifetime risk for secondary malignancies, with a minimum latency period of 8 years considered necessary before radiation induced cancers develop; after this latency, routine breast exams 1–2 times per year are indicated. Individuals assigned female at birth previously treated with thoracic RT between ages 10 and 30 should begin annual screening mammography and MRI (typically alternating every 6 months) 8 years after treatment (but not before age 25) or by age 40, whichever comes first. Chemoprevention with selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of breast cancer by 50%–60% in high-risk populations; trials did not include individuals with prior non-epithelial breast RT, and patients should consider discussion of chemoprevention with their oncologist or breast specialist. There is limited data on screening in individuals with increased risk AMAB. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Hodgkin's disease as a second malignant neoplasm in childhood: report of a case and review of the literature [^112U27Ls]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

There is a known association between lymphoid malignancy and Hodgkin's disease (HD), but the development of HD in children who have been treated for leukemia or lymphoma is very uncommon. Hodgkin's disease is, after retinoblastoma, the most common primary tumor that is associated with development of second malignant neoplasm. For reasons that remain to be determined, HD is very rare as a second malignancy [1, 2, 3]. We report the case of a eight-year-old girl who developed HD 6 years after treatment for common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This case prompted us to review the published literature for cases of secondary HD in childhood. Our experience suggests that we should follow strictly our patients with ALL and be ready to intervene with invasive diagnostic procedures at the least suspicion of a second or recurrent neoplasm. The most frequent causes of second tumors are radiotherapy, genetic susceptibility and prior treatment with certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as nitrogen mustards. It is likely that any type of immunodeficiency, even without symptoms, might play a role in the development of second tumors in childhood.

Thyroid effects of radiation in lymphoma survivors — Hypothyroidism predominates and develops in up to 40% of long-term lymphoma survivors, the risk persists long after treatment, and lifetime screening is required. Dosimetric metrics associated with higher risk include V25 ≥ 63.5%, mean dose > 28 Gy, and V30 ≥ 62.5%. For secondary thyroid cancer, risk is approximately linear with dose, but with doses above 20–30 Gy the risk may begin to decline; papillary thyroid cancers predominate. Most screening guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound only if a thyroid nodule is palpable on physical exam.

Discussion

Most HL survivors who were treated ≥ 20 years ago have experienced SAEs, particularly second malignancies and cardiovascular events. The OER for a second malignancy in our study was 3.6 (95% CI, 2.9–4.4; P < .001). Second malignancy has been reported by others as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among long-term survivors of HL. In fact, Oeffinger et al demonstrated that among a cohort of > 10,000 childhood cancer survivors, HL survivors developed the highest cumulative incidence of severe, life-threatening, and fatal complications (grades 3–5), particularly secondary malignant neoplasia and cardiac toxicity. Our results showed that the second malignancy rates at 20, 30, and 40 years were 17% (95% CI, 13%-22%), 34% (95% CI, 28%-41%), and 49% (95% CI, 39%-58%), respectively, with a median latency to first malignancy of 20 years (range, 1–49 years). As shown in prior SEER database studies, the median age at the time of the first malignancy is 67 years, but the median age at the time of the second malignancy in our series was 49 years, which suggests that chemotherapy and RT may not only increase the relative risk of secondary malignancy but also accelerate its onset.

Perhaps the most well-described topic in the literature is the significantly higher risk of breast cancer in female HL survivors. Most studies have demonstrated an increased risk of breast cancer starting 10 to 15 years after treatment. A recent meta-analysis of breast cancer in 24,505 female HL survivors found a median latency after RT of 17.7 years and a relative risk of 8.23. Others have reported mean latencies of 18 years and a 3.2-fold increased risk with RT doses that exceed 4 Gy to the breast. Breast cancer was the most common second malignancy in our series with 30 cases of invasive breast cancers and 5 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ in 26 patients with a median latency to the first diagnosis of breast cancer of 22 years (range, 11–40 years). Only 6 patients died of breast cancer; however, their prognosis is likely related to surveillance intensity.

### Second cancer risk after chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma: a collaborative British cohort study [^111CpmxB]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We investigated the long-term risk of second primary malignancy after chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) in a much larger cohort than any yet published, to our knowledge.

Patients and Methods

We followed 5,798 patients with HL treated with chemotherapy in Britain from 1963 to 2001 — of whom 3,432 also received radiotherapy — to assess second primary malignancy risks compared with general population-based expectations.

Results

Second malignancies occurred in 459 cohort members. Relative risk (RR) of second cancer was raised after chemotherapy alone (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.7 to 2.4) but was much lower than after combined modalities (RR, 3.9; 95% CI, 3.5 to 4.4). After chemotherapy alone, there were significantly raised risks of lung cancer, non-HL, and leukemia, each contributing approximately equal absolute excess risk. After combined modalities, there were raised risks of these and several other cancers. Second cancer risk peaked 5 to 9 years after chemotherapy alone, but it remained raised for 25 years and longer after combined modalities. Risk was raised after each common chemotherapy regimen except, based on limited numbers and follow-up, adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine. The age and time-course relations of lung cancer differed between chemotherapy alone and combined modalities.

Conclusion

Although chemotherapy alone leads to raised risk of second malignancy, this risk is lower and affects fewer anatomic sites than that after combined modalities, and it is slight if at all after 15 years follow-up. The mechanism of lung cancer etiology may differ between chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

### Comparing long-term toxicity and efficacy of combined modality treatment including extended-or involved-field radiotherapy in early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma [^115cDCVT]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate long-term toxicity and efficacy of a combined modality strategy including extended-field radiotherapy (EF-RT) or involved-field radiotherapy (IF-RT), the German Hodgkin Study Group carried out a follow-up analysis in patients with early unfavorable Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).

Patients and Methods

One thousand two hundred and four patients were randomized to four cycles of chemotherapy followed by either 30 Gy EF- or 30 Gy IF-RT (HD8 trial); 532 patients in each treatment arm were eligible.

Results

At 10 years, no arm differences were revealed with respect to freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) (79.8% versus 79.7%), progression-free survival (79.8% versus 80.0%), and overall survival (86.4% versus 87.3%). Non-inferiority of IF-RT was demonstrated for the primary end point FFTF (95% confidence interval for hazard ratio 0.72–1.25). Elderly patients had a poorer outcome when treated with EF-RT. So far, 15.0% of patients in arm A and 12.2% in arm B died, mostly due to secondary malignancies (5.3% versus 3.4%) or HL (3.2% versus 3.4%). After EF-RT, there were more secondary malignancies overall (58 versus 45), especially acute myeloid leukemias (11 versus 4).

Conclusion

Radiotherapy intensity reduction to IF-RT does not result in poorer long-term outcome but is associated with less acute toxicity and might be associated with less secondary malignancies.

### Family history of cancer as a risk factor for second malignancies after Hodgkin's lymphoma [^1116zF9i]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

A surveillance programme for women treated with radiotherapy for HL has proposed investigation with the same standard as other groups of women at higher risk for breast cancer. An increased risk of secondary lung cancer has been reported, while chemotherapy and radiotherapy were associated with an elevated risk of lung cancer as an SM further increased by smoking habits up to 20-fold. We also found lung cancer risk increasing from 10 years after treatment, seeming to increase continuously thereafter, particularly in men (Table 2). An environmental interaction of radiotherapy and smoking can be suspected. Increased risk in the first 10 years could be due to chemotherapy or the increased numbers of computed tomography (CT) scans for detecting smaller tumours during HL follow-up. There is no good evidence that screening with CT of the lung will have any cost benefit in nonsmokers, although larger studies are necessary to address this question. There is no obvious pattern of decreased SM risk after a certain number years except for breast cancer.

A drawback of the study is that the Swedish Cancer Register holds no therapy data, but studies have shown that up to 90% of patients were given radiotherapy during our study period. Many HL patients were probably diagnosed as nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), but because most of them were older patients with a short survival, this will not affect the present results, especially those with long follow-up that are compared with the general population. It might, however, influence overall survival as prognosis is generally poorer for NHL.

The high curability of HL has increased the number of long-term survivors. In our cohort of 2000 HL survivors, most were treated with extended radiation field. A Swedish pilot study (unpublished) indicates that only about 60% of these patients have regular clinic visits. Women over 40 years of age participate in the general mammography screening programme. The Swedish HL Group currently offers patients who are not participating in regular clinic visits a standardised surveillance programme. The goal is to find SM at an earlier stage and thereby raise the cure rate. Mammography and ultrasound will be offered to women treated before the age of 40 years. Patients with gastrointestinal or pulmonary symptoms will be offered a radiological examination. The importance of smoking cessation is stressed and patients will be offered referral to smoking cessation programmes.

Our study indicates that SM incidence is increased among the long-term HL survivors with a family history of cancer, young age of onset, and long latency, perhaps reflecting gene–environment interactions; this could be relevant in future surveillance programmes.

Second malignancies

Second malignancies are the leading cause of death in long-term survivors of HL. Risk factors depend on the type of second malignancy and include the radiation dose and field, chemotherapy agents and doses administered, history of smoking and sex and age of the patient. The maximum risk of a second cancer is at 5 to 9 years after chemotherapy alone, but after combined modalities the risk remains for 25 years or longer. Solid tumours account for more than 50% of second malignancies developing after 15 or more years of follow-up in patients treated for HL. Lung and breast cancers are the most common secondary cancers in patients with HL due to their proximity to the radiation portal (Fig. 10a). Other solid tumours that have an increased incidence among HL survivors include gastrointestinal cancers, bone and soft tissue tumours, thyroid cancers, malignant melanoma, bladder cancer and malignant mesothelioma. The risk of developing secondary cancer is lower with combined modality treatment than with radiotherapy alone as the initial treatment.

Relative and Absolute Risk Analysis of Secondary Malignancies

In Fig. 1, we showed the relative and absolute risks of developing a secondary malignancy for lymphoma survivors compared to the general US population. The SIR (4.42, 95% CI, 4.01–4.86) and ER (30.29 per 10 000 person-years) describe the relative and absolute risk of developing a secondary malignancy for adolescent lymphoma survivors, respectively, and these values were significantly higher than the general values. Females (SIR = 5.34, 95% CI, 4.73–5.99; ER = 50.58) exhibited a relatively higher SIR and ER than males (SIR = 3.28, 95% CI, 2.76–3.87; ER = 15.53). Blacks were at a higher risk than Caucasians or others. Adolescent Hodgkin lymphoma survivors exhibited a high relative risk and reported > 3 times higher absolute risk when compared to NHL survivors. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma survivors exhibited typically high SIR (13.13, 95% CI, 6–24.92) and ER (54.79) among all lymphoma types. In addition, lymphoma survivors who underwent radiotherapy, whether they received chemotherapy or not, had typically higher SIR and ER (both radiotherapy and chemotherapy: SIR 5.27, ER 34.72; radiotherapy only: SIR 5.19, ER 54.63) than those who did not receive it.

Figure 1.

Abbreviations: ER: excess risk; SIR: standard incidence ratio; CI: confidence interval; NLPHL: nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma; R: radiotherapy; NR: no/unknown radiotherapy; C: chemotherapy; NC: no/unknown chemotherapy.

In addition, we further analyzed the risk of developing a secondary malignancy among specific-type lymphoma survivors who received different treatment strategies (Table 2). Among the patients who received radiotherapy and chemotherapy, extranodal NHL was associated with higher SIR and ER. Survivors who were treated with combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy typically exhibited a higher relative risk when compared to those who adopted other treatment modalities, except for nodal NHL patients. Patients who received radiotherapy and no/unknown chemotherapy had a relatively higher absolute risk when compared to those receiving other treatment modalities, except for extranodal NHL. Nodal HL was associated with the highest risk in cohorts who have not received radiotherapy.

### Treatment-related peripheral small cell lung carcinoma in a Hodgkin lymphoma survivor [^115Kr9da]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors have an increased risk of developing subsequent treatment-related primary malignancies. In the last few decades, advances in knowledge, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation have led to the transformation of lethal malignancy into highly curable malignancy, thereby improving outcomes. With prolonged survival, the risk of developing subsequent treatment-related late adverse effects, such as malignancies, steadily increases over time. Herein, we present the first case of a treatment-related second primary stage IV peripheral small cell lung carcinoma in a female HL survivor who was also diagnosed with right breast cancer 13 years after HL treatment and 1year before her lung cancer diagnosis.

### Subsequent malignant neoplasms among children with Hodgkin lymphoma: a report from the children's oncology group [^115QG253]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) have an increased risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs). Response-adapted treatment may decrease this risk by reducing exposure to therapy associated with SMN risk. The Children's Oncology Group study AHOD0031 evaluated response-adapted therapy for children and adolescents with intermediate-risk HL. We report the SMNs among 1711 patients enrolled in AHOD0031. Patients were treated with 4 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide with or without involved-field radiation therapy (RT). Patients with a slow early response to initial chemotherapy were randomized to 2 additional cycles of dexamethasone, etoposide, cisplatin and cytarabine or no additional chemotherapy, and all received RT. At a median follow-up of 7.3 years, an analysis of SMNs was performed. The 10-year cumulative incidence of SMN was 1.3% (95% confidence interval, 0.6–2.0). SMNs included 3 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 11 with solid tumors, and 3 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Sixteen of 17 patients with an SMN had received combined modality therapy. The standardized incidence ratio for SMN was 9.5 (95% CI, 4.5–15.2) with an excess absolute risk of 1.2 per 1000 person-years. The cumulative incidence of SMNs was higher among patients who received RT (P = .037). In multivariate analysis, RT, B symptoms, and race were associated with SMN risk. Given the latency from exposure, we have likely captured all cases of secondary leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Longer follow-up is needed to determine the risk of solid tumors. Avoidance of RT without sacrificing disease control should remain a goal for future therapeutic approaches. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00025259.

### Long-term risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms among childhood and adolescent lymphoma survivors (1975–2013): a population-based predictive nomogram [^111RnWL3]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Life expectancy is significantly shorter among individuals who survived childhood cancer. Recent advancements in therapeutic modalities have optimally increased the overall 5-year survival rate to 80% among individuals suffering from pediatric cancers. Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common cancer diagnosed in children and adolescents. It has been reported that lymphoma survivors may experience a 1.6 to 4.3 times higher incidence of second malignancies compared to pediatric patients who had solid tumors and were cured. A study in the Netherlands reported the incidence risk of secondary cancers in Hodgkin lymphoma patients diagnosed at the age of 15–50 years and survived for at least 5 years to be 13.9% at 30 years. Moreover, previous studies have reported the significant influence of radiotherapy or chemotherapy in the development of second malignancies among adolescents who were treated for Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Nowadays, the incidence of secondary malignancies remains a major problem in long-term lymphoma survivors, hence risk factors related to incidence should be identified to develop a suitable screening strategy.

Furthermore, studies demonstrated that adolescent cancer survivors had a higher absolute risk of secondary malignancies compared to younger or older cancer survivors. Nomograms could be used to explore prognostic strategies by ascertaining the patient's overall survival information. There is no reported predictive nomogram evaluating the risk of secondary malignancies for childhood and adolescent lymphoma survivors. The current study analyzed the risk of developing secondary malignancies among childhood and adolescent lymphoma survivors depending on factors such as gender, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, incidence site, histological type, and treatment exposure data. Such a nomogram could benefit clinicians and oncologists to guide the ongoing surveillance of high-risk survivors.

### Second primary malignancies after treatment for malignant lymphoma [^1166vZ3j]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

There can be no doubt that the long-term survivors of malignant lymphoma are at increased risk of developing second cancers and that this risk results mainly from the oncogenic sequelae of cytotoxic and/or radiation therapy. It was surprising that we could not replicate these results, although due to the low numbers (four cases, seven controls) in the minimal treatment (no chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) group the reference category for the analyses of treatment was generally taken as those patients having radiotherapy alone. It is quite difficult to assess the actual risks but is likely that incidence of leukaemia in the first 10 years after chemotherapy for HL is in the order of 5–10% (with a relative risk exceeding 10, compared with a matched reference population). Similar relative risks are seen for secondary NHL 5–15 years post-treatment. However, these conditions have a low natural incidence so the actual number of cases is small. More seriously, for both HL and NHL, the incidence of second solid tumours approaches 20% after two decades (with a relative risk of only between 1.5 and 2.5, but accounting for larger number of cases). Many of the earlier reports were from specialist centres or clinical trial collaboratives leading inevitably to patient selection. Our study deals with a relatively nonselected series of consecutive patients seen at a provincial lymphoma centre.

All lymphomas

Of the 68 SPMs identified in this study, bronchial and breast carcinomas were most frequent, and solid cancers overall were much more common than haematological malignancies. This is supported by similar findings in a 1990 study of second malignancy risk after lymphoma treatment.

Conditional logistic regression analysis showed a nonstatistically significant increase in the risk of developing an SPM for those with higher stage tumours. The observed increase in the risk of developing an SPM for those diagnosed in the decade 1970–1979 compared with those diagnosed in 1980–1989 and 1990–2001 is almost certainly an artefact of the design with matching having been performed on length of follow-up. The patients first diagnosed in 1970–1979 had a longer follow-up time in which to develop a second primary compared to the later decades, and are likely to have had more controls diagnosed in the later periods. This is therefore of no particular interest.

### Long-term risk of second malignancy and cardiovascular disease after Hodgkin lymphoma treatment [^113auwb4]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) experience several late adverse effects of treatment, with second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) being the leading causes of death in these patients. Other late effects have also been identified, such as pulmonary dysfunction, endocrinopathies (thyroid dysfunction, infertility), neck muscle atrophy, and persistent fatigue. HL survivors have two- to fourfold increased risks to develop SMNs and CVD compared with the general population. With respect to SMNs, radiotherapy is associated with 1.5- to 15-fold increased risk of solid malignancies. The relative risk (RR) of solid tumors increases steadily with increasing follow-up time from 5 to 15 years since radiotherapy, and remains elevated for at least 40 years. The RR of solid SMNs increases strongly with younger age at first treatment. Risks of lung, breast, and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers increase with higher radiation dose. Alkylating agent chemotherapy, especially procarbazine, does not only increase risk of leukemia but also of solid malignancies, in particular, cancers of the lung and GI tract. In contrast, gonadotoxic chemotherapy decreases the risk of radiation-associated breast cancer, through induction of premature menopause. Smoking appears to multiply the radiation- and chemotherapy-associated risks of lung cancer. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for HL may cause cardiovascular toxicity. Radiotherapy increases the risk of coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure (HF), and pericarditis, whereas anthracycline-containing chemotherapy increases the risks of HF and valvular heart disease. Cardiovascular toxicity following radiotherapy is usually observed from 5 to at least 35 years after therapy, whereas anthracycline-related toxicity is already observed during treatment, up to at least 25 years. The joint effects of anthracyclines, radiotherapy, and conventional cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, smoking, and physical inactivity) appear to be additive rather than multiplicative. HL survivors need lifelong risk-based screening for selected SMNs and CVDs. Furthermore, preventive strategies should include lifestyle and drug-based interventions to minimize exposure to conventional risk factors for cancer and CVD.

Table 2.
The relative and absolute risks of developing secondary malignancies among type-specific lymphoma survivors accepted different treatment strategies.

In Table 3, we have analyzed the risk of secondary malignancies between different types of secondary malignancies based on two categorical variables: gender and lymphoma types. Adolescent lymphoma survivors were associated with the highest relative risk of developing secondary soft tissue neoplasm (SIR: 12.27, 95% CI, 7.59–18.76), followed by secondary bone and joint neoplasms (SIR: 11.07, 95% CI, 5.52–19.81). Soft tissue neoplasms exhibited the highest SIR among Hodgkin lymphoma survivors, while bone and joint neoplasms showed the highest SIR among NHL survivors. However, the highest absolute risk appeared for breast cancer (ER = 10.09) among Hodgkin and NHL survivors.

Table 3.
The relative and absolute risks of site-specific secondary malignancies based on gender and lymphoma types among childhood and adolescent lymphoma patients.

To elucidate the characteristics of secondary malignancies associated with the duration of lymphoma, the distribution of time intervals between the diagnosis of lymphoma and secondary malignancies and the results of the risk analysis were shown in Fig. 2. The median age of diagnosis for secondary malignancies was 36 years, and the median interval time between the diagnosis of two malignancies was 23 years. Among them, two groups (interval 1–5 years, 16–20 years) were associated with significantly high SIR. ER in various interval groups increased with the length of the interval and ranged from less than 11 to over 147 per 10 000 person-years at risk. Cumulative incidence rate vs. months from initial diagnosis was analyzed by different treatment methods Supplementary Figure 1 but no statistically significant difference was observed (Fig. 2C). The relative and absolute risks of lymphoma survivors who received various treatment modalities in different lymphoma diagnostic year segments were shown in Supplementary Table 1. Their absolute risk was decreasing as the year of diagnosis increased.

### Late morbidity and mortality in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma treated during adulthood [^116ocV3N]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) treated as adults are at risk for late effects of therapy. However, the burden of late morbidity and mortality among adults treated for HL remains incompletely characterized.

Methods

Vital status and, for deceased, cause of death were determined for 746 adults treated on a first-line trial at a single center from 1975 to 2000. Survivors completed a detailed survey describing their physical and mental health. A severity score (grades 1–4, ranging from mild to life-threatening or disabling) was assigned to self-reported conditions.

Results

At a median follow-up of 22 years, 227 of patients (30.4%) had died, 107 (47.1%) from HL, 120 (52.9%) from other causes, including second primary malignancies (SPMs) (n = 52) and cardiovascular disease (n = 27). Across the duration of follow-up, all-cause and SPM-specific risk of death remained higher than predicted by normative data. Among survivors, late morbidity survey data are available for 238 patients (45.9%). Ninety-four-point-one percent of respondents reported at least one morbidity, and 47.5% reported at least one grade 3 or 4 morbidity; 20.2% reported two or more grade 3 morbidities. Commonly reported morbidities included cardiovascular (54.6%), endocrine (68.5%), pulmonary disease (21.4%), and nonfatal second malignancy (23.1%). Anxiety, depression, and fear of recurrence were frequently reported.

Conclusions

Among a large cohort of patients treated for HL with extensive follow-up, risk of late mortality from causes other than HL and prevalence of late medical morbidity are high. Guidelines for prevention, screening, and management of late effects in adult survivors of HL are needed.

### Second primary malignancies after treatment for malignant lymphoma [^114Moo7d]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

In this study of all patients treated in one provincial Centre, having high stage disease at presentation, especially for NHL patients, was only marginally nonsignificant. This may be a significant risk factor in a larger study. Other individual factors may be important for different SPMs and only with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up can these be elucidated.

### Risk of second cancer in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors and influence of family history [^114Hom6X]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although advances in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treatment have led to improved disease-free survival, this has been accompanied by an increased risk of second cancers. We sought to quantify the second cancer risks and to investigate the impact of family history.

Patients and Methods

Using the Swedish Family-Cancer Project Database, we identified 9,522 individuals with primary HL diagnosed between 1965 and 2012. We calculated standardized incidence ratios and cumulative incidence of second cancer in HL survivors and compared the standardized incidence ratios of lung, breast, colorectal, and all second cancers in HL survivors with and without a site-specific family history of cancer. Interactions between family history of cancer and HL treatment were evaluated under additive and multiplicative models.

Results

Overall, the risk of a second cancer in HL survivors was increased 2.39-fold (95% CI, 2.29 to 2.53). The 30-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer in women diagnosed with HL at younger than 35 years of age was 13.8%. We observed no significant difference in cancer risk over successive time periods. The risk of all second cancers was 1.3-fold higher for HL survivors with a first-degree relative with cancer (P < .001), with 3.3-fold, 2.1-fold, and 1.8-fold differences shown for lung, colorectal, and breast cancers, respectively. Moreover, a greater than additive interaction between family history of lung cancer and HL treatment was shown (P = .03).

Conclusion

HL survivorship is associated with a substantive risk of a second cancer. Notably, the risk is higher in individuals with a family history of cancer. This information should be used to inform risk-adapted therapy and to assist in screening to reduce long-term morbidity and mortality in patients with HL.

### The importance of secondary cancer screening programs in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors [^1151jvr5]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

We do have other examples in the literature that highlight the impact of screening strategies not only because of the early detection of lung cancer but because of a concomitant and parallel increase in quality-adjusted life year (QALY); Wattson et al. developed a Markov decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness model to estimate the merits of annual LDCT screening among HL survivors. In this specific analysis, annual LDCT screening was cost effective for all smokers. A male smoker treated with mantle radiotherapy at age 25 achieved maximum QALY by initiating screening 12 years post-HL, with a life expectancy benefit of 2.1 months and an incremental cost of $34,841/QALY. Among non-smokers, annual screening produced a QALY benefit in some cases, but the incremental cost was not below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold for any patient subsets. With this prospective pilot study, we have opened the door; there is no doubt that secondary cancer screening programs are essential for several reasons: early detection, tailored surveillance, improved survival, quality of life and reduced health care costs. But, on the other side, for secondary cancer screening programs to be effective, they must encompass several key components: risk assessment evaluating the survivor's treatment history, genetic predispositions, and other risk factors; evidence-based guidelines that would provide valuable frameworks; multidisciplinary approach including clinical hemato-oncologists, radiologists, primary care physicians, and other specialists, is essential for comprehensive care; regular follow-up and patient education and support: educating survivors about their risks and the importance of screening empowers them to participate actively in their healthcare. Support services, including counseling and survivorship programs, can also provide emotional and psychological assistance.

### A real-world study of combined modality therapy for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma: too little treatment impacts outcome [^115PMguh]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessing treatment-related complications, we observed a high degree of BPT and hospital admissions. The degree of BPT (26%) observed within our study was comparable to the previously reported rate of 37% in a retrospective study assessing 126 ABVD-treated patients with HL. No survival differences among those affected by BPT were seen in our study, but a previous retrospective study found that BPT was associated with a lower median 5-year OS compared with those unaffected. The RATHL (Response Adapted Therapy in Advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma) trial showed that for patients with PET2-negative disease, exclusion of bleomycin resulted in reduced pulmonary toxicity and good outcomes. Although we did not have the statistical power to compare the efficacy and toxicity associated with response-adapted bleomycin exclusion, this approach should be considered given the high prevalence of BPT and associated hospitalizations observed within our cohort. Regarding long-term toxicity, we observed no cases of secondary malignancies within our follow-up period. Previous reports of historically treated cohorts have identified the significant associations between RT and cardiac toxicity and secondary malignancies, especially breast and lung cancer. These toxicities certainly remain an important consideration during the selection of therapy; however, more recent data have suggested that modern RT techniques and targeting are associated with a lower burden of toxicity.

### Chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy plus radiotherapy for adults with early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma [^1136jJZc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma in adults is commonly treated with combined modality treatment of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The role of radiotherapy has been questioned due to potential long-term adverse effects.

Objectives

To assess the effects of chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Search Methods

We updated all previous searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, MEDLINE and Embase, in trial registries and in relevant conference proceedings until November 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma and excluded trials with more than 20% of participants with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma. We considered immunotherapy in addition to chemotherapy eligible if both were applied similarly in the comparator groups, but did not identify such trials. For our comparisons, we separated RCTs with the same number of chemotherapy cycles in both arms and RCTs with a different number of cycles, when the chemotherapy regimens were the same. We separated RCTs which compared participants with a favourable, mixed or unfavourable risk profile.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed the quality of included trials. A third review author resolved discrepancies. We analysed time-to-event outcomes (overall survival, progression-free survival) as hazard ratios (HR) and binary outcomes (adverse events) as risk ratios (RR). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included nine comparisons of eight RCTs involving 3840 participants in this updated review. Same number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial arms Favourable disease For overall survival in individuals with favourable Hodgkin's lymphoma, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 7.92; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low-certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). Additional radiotherapy to chemotherapy is likely to improve progression-free survival (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.68; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; moderate-certainty evidence due to study limitations). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for second-cancer-related mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.01 to 74.24; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low-certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and substantial imprecision) and suggests little to no difference in cardiac disease-related mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.16; 1 RCT, 667 participants; low-certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection-related mortality or infertility. Mixed population For a population of mixed risk profile, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.80; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; very low-certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). It indicates that additional radiotherapy may lead to an improvement in progression-free survival (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; low-certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection-related mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 10.87; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) and second-cancer-related mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.98; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) (both very low-certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but suggests that additional radiotherapy may increase cardiac disease-related mortality (RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.92; 1 RCT, 420 participants; low-certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility. Unfavourable disease For individuals with unfavourable disease, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.44; 2 RCTs, 688 participants; very low-certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but additional radiotherapy probably improves progression-free survival (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.60; 1 RCT, 651 participants; moderate-certainty evidence due to imprecision). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for cardiac disease-related mortality (RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.12 to 65.74; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low-certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection-related mortality, second-cancer related mortality or infertility. Different number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial arms Favourable disease The evidence for overall survival in individuals with favourable disease treated with different numbers of chemotherapy cycles in both arms is uncertain and inclusive (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.38; 1 RCT, 357 participants; very low-certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), yet it suggests a likely improvement in progression-free survival with additional radiotherapy (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 RCT, 357 participants; moderate-certainty evidence due to study limitations). For second-cancer-related mortality, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.34; 1 RCT, 465 participants; very low-certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection-related mortality and infertility and data for cardiac disease-related mortality were not estimable (no events in either group). Unfavourable disease For individuals with an unfavourable risk profile, additional radiotherapy may decrease overall survival slightly (HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.90; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low-certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision), but may slightly improve progression-free survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low-certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection-related mortality (RR 6.90, 95% CI 0.36 to 132.34; 1 RCT, 276 participants), second-cancer-related mortality (RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.77 to 6.19; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) and cardiac disease-related mortality (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 8.22; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility.

Authors' Conclusions

The chemotherapy regimens in the trials differed and data for regimens commonly used today were limited. Additional radiotherapy may slightly improve progression-free survival. The available data for overall survival and adverse events were of low and very low certainty, and we were unable to draw conclusions about the effects of additional radiotherapy on these outcomes. No studies evaluated infertility. High-quality, longer-term follow-up data are required and data on fertility are needed.

### Family history of cancer as a risk factor for second malignancies after Hodgkin's lymphoma [^1159UcEK]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

This study estimated the risk of second primary malignancies after Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) in relation to family history of cancer, age at diagnosis and latency, among 6946 patients treated for HL in Sweden in 1965–1995 identified through the Swedish Cancer Register (SCR). First-degree relatives (FDRs) to the HL patients and their malignancies were then ascertained together with their malignancies through the Multi-Generation Registry and SCR. The HL patient cohort was stratified on the number of FDRs with cancer, and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) of developing SM were analysed. In the HL cohort, 781 SM were observed 1 year or longer after HL diagnosis. The risk for developing SM increased with the number of FDRs with cancer, SIRs being 2.26, 3.01, and 3.45 with 0, 1, or ≥ 2 FDRs with cancer, respectively. Hodgkin's lymphoma long-term survivors treated at a young age with a family history of cancer carry an increased risk for developing SM and may represent a subgroup where standardised screening for the most common cancer sites could be offered in a stringent surveillance programme.

### Long-term risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms among childhood and adolescent lymphoma survivors (1975–2013): a population-based predictive nomogram [^112q1fbM]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies are needed to assess risk factors pertinent to the incidence of secondary malignancies among childhood and adolescent lymphoma survivors. We aimed to identify risk factors pertinent to the incidence of secondary malignancies and subsequently establish a clinically practical predictive nomogram.

Methods

A total of 5561 patients who were diagnosed with primary lymphoma below the age of 20 years between 1975 and 2013 and survived for at least 5 years were identified. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and excess risk (ER) analysis were performed by sex, age, and year when primary lymphoma was diagnosed, sites and types of primary lymphoma, and therapy strategies. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify independent risk factors for adolescent and childhood lymphoma-related secondary malignancies. Based on 5 factors (age, time from lymphoma diagnosis, gender, lymphoma type, and therapy), a nomogram for predicting the risk of a secondary malignancy for patients with childhood and adolescent primary lymphoma was established.

Results

Among 5561 lymphoma survivors, 424 developed a secondary malignancy. Females (SIR = 5.34, 95% CI, 4.73–5.99; ER = 50.58) exhibited a higher SIR and ER than males (SIR = 3.28, 95% CI, 2.76–3.87; ER = 15.53). Blacks were at a higher risk than Caucasians or others. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma survivors exhibited typically high SIR (13.13, 95% CI, 6–24.92) and ER (54.79) among all lymphoma classifications. Lymphoma survivors who underwent radiotherapy, whether they received chemotherapy or not, had typically higher SIR and ER. Among all types of secondary malignancies, "bone and joint neoplasms" (SIR = 11.07, 95% CI, 5.52–19.81) and "soft tissue neoplasms" (SIR = 12.27, 95% CI, 7.59–18.76) presented significantly high SIR whereas "breast cancer" and "endocrine cancer" associated with higher ER. The median diagnosis age of secondary malignancies was 36 years old, and the median time interval between the diagnosis of two malignancies was 23 years. A nomogram was constructed to predict the risk of secondary malignancies in patients diagnosed with primary lymphoma before 20 years of age. After internal validation, the AUC and C-index of the nomogram are 0.804 and 0.804, respectively.

Conclusion and Relevance

The established nomogram provides a convenient and reliable tool for predicting the risk of a secondary malignancy among childhood and adolescent lymphoma survivors, concluding significant concern for lymphoma survivors with high-risk estimates.

Background

Studies are needed to assess risk factors pertinent to the incidence of secondary malignancies among childhood and adolescent lymphoma survivors. We aimed to identify risk factors pertinent to the incidence of secondary malignancies and subsequently establish a clinically practical predictive nomogram.

Methods

A total of 5561 patients who were diagnosed with primary lymphoma below the age of 20 years between 1975 and 2013 and survived for at least 5 years were identified. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and excess risk (ER) analysis were performed by sex, age, and year when primary lymphoma was diagnosed, sites and types of primary lymphoma, and therapy strategies. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify independent risk factors for adolescent and childhood lymphoma-related secondary malignancies. Based on 5 factors (age, time from lymphoma diagnosis, gender, lymphoma type, and therapy), a nomogram for predicting the risk of a secondary malignancy for patients with childhood and adolescent primary lymphoma was established.

Results

Among 5561 lymphoma survivors, 424 developed a secondary malignancy. Females (SIR = 5.34, 95% CI, 4.73–5.99; ER = 50.58) exhibited a higher SIR and ER than males (SIR = 3.28, 95% CI, 2.76–3.87; ER = 15.53). Blacks were at a higher risk than Caucasians or others. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma survivors exhibited typically high SIR (13.13, 95% CI, 6–24.92) and ER (54.79) among all lymphoma classifications. Lymphoma survivors who underwent radiotherapy, whether they received chemotherapy or not, had typically higher SIR and ER. Among all types of secondary malignancies, "bone and joint neoplasms" (SIR = 11.07, 95% CI, 5.52–19.81) and "soft tissue neoplasms" (SIR = 12.27, 95% CI, 7.59–18.76) presented significantly high SIR whereas "breast cancer" and "endocrine cancer" associated with higher ER. The median diagnosis age of secondary malignancies was 36 years old, and the median time interval between the diagnosis of two malignancies was 23 years. A nomogram was constructed to predict the risk of secondary malignancies in patients diagnosed with primary lymphoma before 20 years of age. After internal validation, the AUC and C-index of the nomogram are 0.804 and 0.804, respectively.

Conclusion and Relevance

The established nomogram provides a convenient and reliable tool for predicting the risk of a secondary malignancy among childhood and adolescent lymphoma survivors, concluding significant concern for lymphoma survivors with high-risk estimates.

### Combination chemoradiotherapy in early Hodgkin lymphoma [^114Eois5]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Combination chemoradiotherapy achieves excellent results for the treatment of localized Hodgkin lymphoma. However, late toxic effects occur, mostly related to the radiotherapy administered after the standard adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy. The most serious sequelae are radiation-induced secondary cancers. Reducing radiotherapy has not yet prevented late malignancies. However, when radiotherapy was omitted, tumor control was inferior, with more relapses necessitating rescue treatment including high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support. Early fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography performed after a few cycles of ABVD is evaluated in several randomized trials to identify patients who might be safely treated with chemotherapy alone.

### Long-term risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms among childhood and adolescent lymphoma survivors (1975–2013): a population-based predictive nomogram [^111Uh95z]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A previous study reported the cumulative incidence risk of subsequent neoplasms was 26.3% at 30 years after Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis among 1380 childhood patients diagnosed between 1955 and 1986. A few reports also described the risk of secondary malignancies such as lung cancer and thyroid cancer among childhood Hodgkin lymphoma survivors. But, most of these studies only focused on patients of one specific lymphoma type and all age groups, and there were no studies that precisely predicted the risk of secondary malignancies in childhood lymphoma survivors. We selected lymphoma patients diagnosed below 20 years of age who had survived for at least 5 years because the proportion of such survivors has been increasing, and there is a need to unravel their health status after treatment. The current study is a large and comprehensive study that compares the relative and absolute risk of secondary malignancies for childhood and adolescent lymphoma patients in different clinical conditions and identifies risk factors to build a clinically applied predictive nomogram.

### Long-term cause-specific mortality in Hodgkin lymphoma patients [^1125MJF9]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

HL treatment substantially reduces life expectancy of cured HL patients. Increased mortality from adverse events of HL treatment persists for at least 40 years. Optimal selection of patients for primary CT is crucial because salvage treatment is not always successful and is associated with high mortality from causes other than HL. Therefore, weighing risks of HL relapse and long-term toxicity is of paramount importance.

The prognosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) has markedly improved as management strategies evolved. In the modern era, less than 15% of patients with early-stage, non-bulky HL will relapse, and less than one third of those with advanced disease will relapse. As therapy for HL intensified, and as disease-related outcomes improved, the impact of the late effects of therapy has become increasingly important. There is a growing body of literature describing the late morbidity experienced by survivors of HL, including risks of second primary malignancy, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, and endocrine dysfunction. Additionally, the impact of disease and treatment on psychosocial function and quality of life has been a subject of investigation, with survivors often suffering from impairment. An understanding of these risks and the management implications inherent to them is central to the care of survivors of HL.

### Lung cancer after treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma: a systematic review [^112irUEu]. The Lancet: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Developments in modern chemotherapy and radiotherapy mean that most patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma can now be cured. However, the long-term effects of anticancer treatment include an increased risk of a second malignant disease. We have done a systematic review of studies reporting long-term complications of the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma published in English since 1985. These studies show that risk of lung cancer is significantly increased in patients treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma, with a reported mean relative risk of 2.6–7.0 and a significantly increased absolute excess risk. The absolute excess risk increases with time from treatment, for as long as 20–25 years, and is highest in patients treated at age 45 years or older. Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy contribute to the risk, and evidence suggests that the effects are additive. Cigarette smoking seems to multiply the risk associated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In the high-risk group of patients, 50–150 patients per 1000 are expected to develop lung cancer by 10–20 years after treatment. The role of screening in this group of patients has not yet been assessed, but an international study combining CT with genomic and proteomic assessment is planned.

### Consolidative proton therapy after chemotherapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma [^112W5GHp]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy provides the best relapse-free survival among patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Unfortunately, survivors of HL are at high risk of developing late side-effects with ∼50% of survivors developing a grade 3 or higher toxicity within 30 years of treatment. These late side-effects are mostly due to cardiovascular complications and secondary malignancies.

A well-established linear relationship has been observed between radiation dose to most organs and subsequent toxicity. By reducing the dose, treatment volumes, or a combination of both, radiation oncologists can modify their radiation treatment to reduce late effects while maintaining the best chances of cure. Indeed, field reduction from the larger mantle field to the smaller involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) was associated with reduced secondary breast cancer risk. More recently, lower prescription radiation doses and additional field reductions with involved-node radiation therapy and involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT) have been implemented to further reduce late toxicity.

Another important approach in the reduction of radiation morbidity is the use of more conformal radiation techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy (PT). These treatments are included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for HL and non-HL and are allowed to be used on current International collaborative HL studies [Children's Oncology Group (COG) study AHOD 1331 (NCT02166463) and Euronet-PHL-C2 (NCT02684708)].

Yet these newer treatments, which can help reduce the radiation dose to different organs, are more expensive and not widely available. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential increased risk of relapse due to the steeper dose gradient.

Utilizing prospective academic and community registry data, we report current patterns-of-care and early outcomes among patients with HL receiving PT.

### Polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes and markers of genotoxicity to identify patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma at risk of treatment-related complications [^111p7e3H]. Annals of Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Survivors of childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) have an increased risk of developing treatment-related complications, especially second malignant neoplasms, as a result of treatment regimens incorporating chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Second cancers include leukemias that generally occur in the first two decades after therapy, and adult-type solid tumors that generally exhibit continued increasing incidence throughout subsequent follow-up. Identified clinical risk factors for second cancers include age at the time of treatment and intensity and type of therapy, with particularly strong associations between the use of radiotherapy and subsequent breast cancer, and alkylator chemotherapy dose-intensity and risk of secondary leukemia. However, second cancers affect a minority of patients, and there is probably great variability in individual susceptibility for this complication. Common genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes that result in impaired detoxification of chemotherapy or inefficient repair of drug- or radiation-induced genetic damage may lead to increased risk of a second cancer. Studies of the potential role of polymorphisms in the genes encoding the glutathione S-transferases, cytochrome P450 3A4, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase and myeloperoxidase in the etiology of treatment-related complications are reviewed. Biological markers of drug- and radiation-induced genetic damage may also identify patients at higher risk of immediate and delayed side effects of therapy. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) is examining the roles of polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes and biological markers of genotoxicity in predicting the treatment-related outcomes of patients with HL. These investigations may ultimately allow the use of pharmacogenetically guided therapy to improve the outcome of HL therapy and reduce the risk of therapy-related complications, especially secondary malignancies.

### High incidence of late effects found in Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors, following recall for breast cancer screening [^113qtBGZ]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In a cohort of HL women, mean age 40 years, previously treated with mantle radiotherapy, 9.2% had died a nonlymphoma-related death and we found a high incidence of undiagnosed medical problems in survivors. Impressively, no patient had died of HL. At a mean of 17 years post-treatment, 72% of women had a medical problem that could relate to their previous treatment. In addition to radiotherapy, chemotherapy had also been received by 72% of patients and it should be recognised that this may contribute to some late effects. In addition, it is possible that there is a genetic risk for both HL and late effects, although to date there is no evidence to support an underlying association between the two.

We found a 9.9% cumulative incidence of secondary malignancy. This incidence is similar to the 10.6% reported at 20 years post-treatment in adult survivors of childhood HL, although lower than 21.9% at 25 years in a population of 32 591 survivors of HL. The most common cancer was breast cancer, as reported previously. Increasing age over 50 years is associated with a greater cancer burden and one of our patients aged 57 years was diagnosed and died from oesophageal cancer during the course of our study. None of this cohort developed leukaemia. The risk of leukaemia in patients treated for HL has been estimated at 0.3% after radiotherapy alone, 2.8% after chemotherapy alone and 5.4% in combined modality therapy. A more recent study estimated the incidence of second primary malignancies in patients treated for HL, including the risk of haematological malignancy. This risk was low at only 0.55% and this is consistent with our findings.

### Second primary cancers among 109 000 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [^115oCtRa]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our results show a 47% (95% CI 43–51%) overall increase in the risk of primary cancer after NHL. The different patterns of risk for the 18 cancers with an overall increased incidence are summarised in Table 6. This analysis of second primary cancers after NHL suffers from several limitations. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is really a cluster of separate cancers and the lack of information on subtypes of NHL removes the possibility of identifying more specific relationships. We could not attempt any extensive analysis by subtype due to the differing amount of subtype information in individual registries, as well as the likely differing quality of subtype information both between registries and over time. We also have not included in this analysis any information on treatment, because of the very limited and heterogeneous amount of information available in all of the cancer registries. Particular care was taken to standardise cancer site definitions between registries and over time, although some heterogeneity among results in the 13 registries may have occurred due to differences in treatment and exposure, as well as specific cancer registry characteristics. The latter source of heterogeneity was minimised by ensuring a common protocol across the registries for reporting second primaries, detailed comparison of results to identify discrepancies and the dropping of two registries due to apparent under-reporting in one and over-reporting in the other that could not be easily explained.

At a median follow up of 44.6 (95% CI, 27.6–61.6) months, the 3-year PFS was 91.2% (95% CI, 74.9%-97.1%) and OS was 97.0% (95% CI, 80.4%-99.6%). The median PFS and OS were not reached. Two relapses occurred; 1 patient relapsed 2.1 years after RT, in field, at an initial disease site, and the second relapse occurred 3.5 months after RT outside of the field. A patient in their 70s died, unrelated to HL.

Overall treatment was well tolerated with no grade 4 or 5 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxic effects. Only 1 grade 3 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxic effect occurred in a patient who experienced a myocardial infarction after the first cycle of ABVD. No secondary malignant neoplasms occurred in the follow-up period.

### Second malignant neoplasms in survivors of pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with low-dose radiation and chemotherapy [^117LkXUP]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Survivors of childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) are at risk for second malignant neoplasms (SMNs). It is theorized that this risk may be attenuated in patients treated with lower doses of radiation. We report the first long-term outcomes of a cohort of pediatric survivors of HL treated with chemotherapy and low-dose radiation.

Patients and Methods

Pediatric patients with HL (n = 112) treated at Stanford from 1970 to 1990 on two combined modality treatment protocols were identified. Treatment included six cycles of chemotherapy with 15 to 25.5 Gy involved-field radiation with optional 10 Gy boosts to bulky sites. Follow-up through September 1, 2007, was obtained from retrospective chart review and patient questionnaires.

Results

One hundred ten children completed HL therapy; median follow-up was 20.6 years. Eighteen patients developed one or more SMNs, including four leukemias, five thyroid carcinomas, six breast carcinomas, and four sarcomas. Cumulative incidence of first SMN was 17% (95% CI, 10.5 to 26.7) at 20 years after HL diagnosis. The standard incidence ratio for any SMN was 22.9 (95% CI, 14.2 to 35) with an absolute excess risk of 93.7 cases per 10,000 person-years. All four secondary leukemias were fatal. For those with second solid tumors, the mean (± SE) 5-year disease-free and overall survival were 76% ± 12% and 85% ± 10% with median follow-up 5 years from SMN diagnosis.

Conclusion

Despite treatment with low-dose radiation, children treated for HL remain at significant risk for SMN. Sarcomas, breast and thyroid carcinomas occurred with similar frequency and latency as found in studies of children with HL who received high-dose radiation.

Hodgkin lymphoma — GHSG NIVAHL (early-stage unfavorable CHL): In this phase II trial of nivolumab-AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and DTIC) in newly diagnosed patients (n = 109; age range: 18–60 years), patients were randomized to 4 cycles of concomitant nivolumab-AVD versus a sequential regimen (4 nivolumab, then 2 nivolumab-AVD, then 2 AVD), with all receiving ISRT 30 Gy. After 2 cycles of nivolumab-AVD, the concomitant arm had 100% objective response and 67% CR versus 96% and 51% in the sequential arm; post-therapy CR was 90% versus 94%. With a median follow-up 41 months, OS was 100% in both arms, with PFS 100% in the concomitant arm and 98% in the sequential arm. Immune-mediated AEs included hypothyroidism requiring medication support in 15% without corticosteroid-requiring immune AEs, and no secondary malignancies were noted.

### Risk of second cancer in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors and influence of family history [^1143m8TF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Advances in the management of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) over the past 40 years have led to improved disease-free survival in patients. However, this comes at the cost of an increased risk of second cancers, cardiovascular disease, and other treatment-related complications. - The risk of second cancers in HL survivors, which persists for many decades after treatment, has been reported to be influenced by various factors, including age at treatment, site and dose of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and smoking. The use of treatment regimens based on a reduction in the field and dose of radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy has been introduced to reduce rates of long-term complications while maintaining a high cure rate. Despite such modifications, a recent study from the Netherlands showed that this has not affected the risk of second cancers in patients with HL.

A family history of breast cancer was first suggested to be a risk factor for second cancer in HL nearly 20 years ago, and it has long been postulated that a subset of patients with cancer display a high sensitivity to mutational agents because of a genetic predisposition. Evidence for such an assertion in the context of HL is provided by an analysis of a Swedish cohort of patients with HL, but the power of the study did not allow the impact of family history to be studied in detail. Moreover, the analysis included HL survivors with a prior history of cancer other than HL, which potentially biased the conclusions.

To gain insight into the risk of second cancer after a diagnosis of HL and its relationship to temporal changes in treatment regimens, we analyzed data on a cohort of 9,522 Swedish patients. In addition, through the use of the Swedish Family-Cancer Project Database, we performed an updated analysis of the influence of family history, as a surrogate for genetic susceptibility, on the risk of second cancer in patients with HL.
