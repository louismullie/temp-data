## Question

What would you treat pediatric ent patient with who has sensineural hearing loss in one ear at birth and is now four months old to treat possible fluid in the ear before a repeat ABR test

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a 4-month-old infant with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) at birth who now has suspected middle ear fluid, specifically what to do before repeating the ABR to clarify the hearing status. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the presence and laterality of middle ear effusion. Then, I should verify the timing and rationale for intervention versus observation. Next, I will consider the role of tympanostomy tubes in infants and how to time hearing testing. After that, I need to ensure we are not missing a persistent SNHL component and plan for amplification if needed. Finally, I will integrate counseling, follow-up, and documentation requirements to align with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis of middle ear effusion (OME) and its laterality, because management hinges on accurate identification of fluid and its impact on hearing. Pneumatic otoscopy is the primary recommended method to document effusion, and if uncertain, tympanometry can be used to corroborate middle ear status, recognizing that tympanometry complements but does not replace otoscopy in infants [^3c25d4f5] [^6ae0f829].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and thresholds for intervention in a 4-month-old with suspected OME superimposed on known unilateral SNHL. Guidelines emphasize that for otherwise healthy children, observation for 3 months from diagnosis is appropriate; however, infants with documented hearing loss or at-risk status warrant earlier hearing assessment and may be considered for tympanostomy tubes sooner, particularly when effusion is likely to persist or when accurate audiologic diagnosis is obstructed by fluid [^3c25d4f5] [^b6e4ec45] [^664a6760].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medical therapy for OME. I should confirm that routine antibiotics, antihistamines, and decongestants are not recommended for OME because they do not improve long-term outcomes and carry risks; thus, if intervention is pursued, it should be surgical drainage rather than medication, reserving antibiotics only for acute otitis media when indicated [^3c25d4f5] [^156260fe].

> I will now examine the role of tympanostomy tubes in this infant. Tubes can rapidly resolve conductive components from effusion, facilitate accurate ABR testing by clearing fluid, and in some infants with failed newborn screens and effusion, reveal normal underlying hearing once the conductive overlay is removed; however, I need to ensure shared decision-making with caregivers given anesthesia risks and the possibility that effusion could resolve spontaneously [^047e879a] [^4f673f61] [^b6e4ec45].

> Let me think about the timing of hearing testing relative to tube placement. Ideally, I should obtain an age-appropriate hearing evaluation after the effusion is cleared to distinguish residual conductive loss from underlying SNHL; if tubes are placed, postoperative ABR or behavioral audiometry can be performed several weeks later to confirm thresholds, and if tubes are deferred, surveillance with repeat ABR in 3 to 6 months is reasonable while monitoring for spontaneous resolution [^05717b89] [^a1bb0729] [^3c25d4f5].

> But wait, what if the "SNHL at birth" was actually a conductive failure from neonatal effusion rather than true SNHL? I should double-check that neonatal ABR failures commonly reflect OME, and a meaningful fraction normalize after fluid clears; nonetheless, given the report of unilateral SNHL, I must plan for both possibilities and ensure timely amplification if a persistent sensorineural component is confirmed, since early intervention before 6 months improves developmental outcomes [^c261a0f0] [^d12a114a] [^bff52157].

> Next, I should review counseling and follow-up elements that are explicitly recommended. Families should be counseled that effusion often resolves spontaneously, that follow-up hearing testing is essential to exclude underlying SNHL, and that documentation of effusion duration, laterality, and hearing status should be maintained; if tubes are placed, perioperative education and scheduled ear exams until extrusion are advised [^c261a0f0] [^4598aa8c] [^714b4b04].

> Let me synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant plan. Confirm effusion with pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry if needed; given known unilateral SNHL and the need for accurate thresholds, discuss early tympanostomy tube placement to clear fluid and enable definitive ABR testing, while acknowledging that observation for a short interval may be reasonable if effusion is very recent and the infant is otherwise at low risk; avoid antibiotics or decongestants for OME; after tubes or after spontaneous resolution, obtain age-appropriate audiometry to quantify any residual SNHL and proceed with amplification and early intervention if indicated; schedule ENT follow-up every 3 to 6 months until effusion resolves and hearing stabilizes, documenting outcomes at each visit [^3c25d4f5] [^b6e4ec45] [^f7be3331] [^bff52157].

For a 4-month-old with unilateral congenital SNHL and suspected middle ear fluid, **do not use antibiotics, decongestants, or antihistamines** [^3c25d4f5] because they do not treat OME and are not recommended [^156260fe]. The priority is to **confirm effusion with pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry** [^6ae0f829] and to **obtain an age-appropriate hearing test** (ABR or VRA) to distinguish conductive from sensorineural components [^25f2ede2]. If effusion persists for 3 months or hearing loss is moderate or greater, refer to ENT for tympanostomy tube consideration [^f7be3331]; if effusion is recent, observe and reassess in 6–12 weeks. Early intervention for confirmed SNHL should begin by 6 months [^bff52157].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Confirm middle ear effusion

Use **pneumatic otoscopy** as the primary method to confirm effusion; if uncertain, obtain tympanometry to support the diagnosis [^3c25d4f5] [^6ae0f829].

---

### Hearing assessment

Perform an **age-appropriate hearing test** (ABR or visual reinforcement audiometry) to quantify the degree and type of hearing loss and to distinguish conductive from sensorineural components [^25f2ede2] [^e5a114a9].

---

## Management of middle ear fluid

### Observation and monitoring

If effusion is recent or of uncertain duration, **observe for 6–12 weeks** with reassessment of the middle ear and hearing status [^75f89a9e]. Most effusions resolve spontaneously within 3 months [^75f89a9e].

---

### Indications for intervention

Intervention is indicated if any of the following are present:

- **Persistent effusion**: ≥ 3 months duration [^f7be3331].
- **Significant hearing loss**: Moderate or greater (> 40 dB HL) [^f7be3331].
- **At-risk child**: Developmental delays, craniofacial anomalies, or other risk factors [^7f861f28].

---

### Surgical intervention

Tympanostomy tubes are the **preferred intervention** for persistent effusion with significant hearing loss or at-risk status [^f7be3331] [^88818c3d]. Tubes improve hearing and facilitate accurate assessment of underlying sensorineural hearing loss [^f7be3331].

---

## Medical management considerations

### Medications not recommended

Routine use of the following is **not recommended** for OME:

- **Antibiotics**: No long-term benefit; reserve for acute otitis media [^3c25d4f5] [^156260fe].
- **Antihistamines and decongestants**: Ineffective and not recommended [^3c25d4f5] [^156260fe].
- **Corticosteroids**: Not recommended due to limited efficacy and potential adverse effects [^3c25d4f5].

---

## Early intervention for sensorineural hearing loss

If sensorineural hearing loss is confirmed, **early intervention** should begin by 6 months of age [^bff52157], including:

- **Amplification**: Hearing aids or assistive devices as appropriate [^a033853f].
- **Early intervention services**: Speech-language therapy and developmental support [^bff52157].
- **Genetic counseling**: Consider if etiology is unknown or if family history suggests genetic factors [^51ac3acb].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor effusion resolution, hearing status, and developmental progress. Re-evaluate every **3–6 months** until effusion resolves and hearing stabilizes [^13835775] [^5922f91f].

On the basis of strong research, universal newborn screening should be performed before age 1 month with repeat or follow-up testing for those who do not pass performed before age 3 months and intervention started before age 6 months. On the basis of strong research and consensus statement, tympanostomy tubes should be considered for individuals with bilateral persistent middle ear effusion for 3 months or greater and a documented conductive hearing loss. On the basis of consensus statement, all children with suspected hearing loss should have an age appropriate hearing test. On the basis of strong research, the most common form of congenital hearing loss is genetic. Most of this is nonsyndromic hearing loss.

### Ear problems in children… [^d0cff530]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Two common ear conditions may affect children. Acute otitis media is an infection that usually involves fever, pain, and evidence of middle ear inflammation with effusion. Otitis media with effusion is fluid in the middle ear without signs of infection. The eustachian tubes drain fluid from the ears to the back of the throat. When these tubes are swollen or clogged, fluid can build up in the ear, causing these conditions. Risk factors for AOM or OME include exposure to cigarette smoke, allergies, respiratory infections, and drinking while lying on one's back. Avoiding these risks may help prevent these problems. The pneumococcal vaccine prevents one of the most common types of ear and respiratory infections.

Diagnosis The diagnosis of AOM or OME requires a physical examination by a health care professional who will look inside the ear to find fluid or inflammation. Making the diagnosis can be difficult because children's ear canals are small and are sometimes obstructed by wax. Treatment. Pain: Treat pain with analgesic eardrops or an over-the-counter medication such as acetaminophen. Otitis media with effusion: Routine use of antihistamines, decongestants, and antibiotics is not recommended. Children should have a hearing test if OME lasts longer than 3 months or when there are suspected hearing, language, or learning problems. Acute otitis media: Antibiotics are given to children younger than 6 months because these children have immature immune systems and are less able to fight infections. Between ages 6 months and 2 years, children may be given antibiotics depending on age, certainty of diagnosis, and severity of the infection.

Children with nonsevere illness and an uncertain diagnosis may be watched for 48 to 72 hours without antibiotics. Most children do well, but if they do not improve in 48 to 72 hours, they may be given antibiotics. Tympanostomy tubes are inserted when OME lasts longer than 3 months, there is recurrent AOM, or there is significant hearing loss. Fluid may remain in the middle ear even after an infection resolves. Fluid can also develop without any signs of infection. Children with OME may have no symptoms and do not usually look sick, and most episodes resolve on their own. Even if fluid is present for several months, most otherwise healthy children have no long-term hearing damage or problems with language development. Children with medical problems such as developmental disorders, memory or thinking problems, or speech or motor issues may need early treatment.

### Diagnostic evaluation of children with sensorineural hearing loss [^51ac3acb]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The cause of pediatric sensorineural hearing loss is diverse, comprising genetic, acquired, and idiopathic conditions. Identifying the specific cause requires that children undergo thorough otolaryngologic and audiometric evaluations, which generally include laboratory tests and temporal bone imaging studies. Clinical genetics and ophthalmologic consultations are also frequently warranted. A sequential diagnostic approach has been shown to be both prudent and cost-effective. Although a definitive cause is being established, amplification and a comprehensive treatment strategy should be initiated to ensure that developmental, auditory, and speech and language delays are minimized.

### An evidence based protocol for managing neonatal middle ear effusions in babies who fail newborn hearing screening [^047e879a]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the prevalence of middle ear disease in infants referred for failed newborn hearing screening (NBHS) and to review patient outcomes after intervention in order to propose an evidence-based protocol for management of newborns with otitis media with effusion (OME) who fail NBHS.

Methods

85 infants with suspected middle ear pathology were retrospectively reviewed after referral for failed NBHS. All subjects underwent a diagnostic microscopic exam with myringotomy with or without placement of a ventilation tube in the presence of a middle ear effusion and had intra-operative auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing or testing at a later date.

Results

At the initial office visit, a normal middle ear space bilaterally was documented in 5 babies (6%), 29/85 (34%) had an equivocal exam while 51/85 (60%) had at least a unilateral OME. Myringotomy with or without tube placement due to presence of an effusion was performed on 65/85 (76%) neonates. Normal hearing was established in 17/85 (20%) after intervention, avoiding the need for any further audiologic workup. Bilateral or unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) or mixed hearing loss was noted in 54/85 (64%) and these children were referred for amplification. Initially observation with follow up outpatient visits was initiated in 27/85 (32%) however, only 3/27 (11%) resolved with watchful waiting and 24/27 (89%) ultimately required at least unilateral tube placement due to OME and 14/24 (59%) were found to have at least a unilateral mixed or SNHL.

Conclusions

An effective initial management plan for children with suspected middle ear pathology and failed NBHS is diagnostic operative microscopy with placement of a ventilation tube in the presence of a MEE along with either intra-operative ABR or close follow-up ABR. This allows for the identification and treatment of babies with a conductive component due to OME, accurate diagnosing of an underlying SNHL component and for prompt aural rehabilitation.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^b6e4ec45]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Failed newborn hearing screen with suspected otitis media with effusion (OME) — follow-up considerations include that referral to an otolaryngologist is appropriate for all infants with documented persistent hearing loss after a failed newborn hearing screen, even if the cause is presumed to be secondary to OME; for infants aged ≥ 6 months with documented bilateral OME for ≥ 3 months and documented hearing difficulties, clinicians should offer tympanostomy tubes; insertion of tympanostomy tubes to resolve effusion and facilitate better assessment of hearing status may also be appropriate on an individualized basis for children with severe hearing loss, a history of congenital SNHL in the immediate family, or an at-risk status as defined in Table 3; the decision of whether or not to insert tympanostomy tubes should be shared with, and explained to, patients and their families; and the Table 8 FAQ can be distributed to parents and caregivers to fulfill counseling about follow-up to ensure hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying SNHL.

### Management of conductive hearing loss in children [^b8827346]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Conductive hearing loss (CHL), far more common than sensorineural hearing loss in children, can be acquired or congenital, can range from mild to moderately severe, and can be caused by a simple cerumen impaction, middle ear fluid, or complex middle ear abnormalities with or without the absence of the ear canal (congenital aural atresia). This article presents evidence-based recommendations for the evaluation and management of the child with both acquired and congenital CHL.

Otitis media with effusion — surveillance of chronic OME: Clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-mo intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected (Recommendation).

---

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^f7be3331]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — hearing thresholds, monitoring, and tympanostomy tube decisions are tied to audiologic findings and effusion duration. If a child with OME has hearing levels in the normal range (< 15 dB HL), the clinician should assess for signs or symptoms of OME that would make tube insertion an option, and if watchful waiting is continued a repeat hearing test should be performed in 3 to 6 months if OME persists. If a child with OME has mild hearing loss (16–40 dB HL) and bilateral effusions for 3 months or longer (chronic), the clinician should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion; if mild hearing loss (16–40 dB HL) occurs with a unilateral effusion or with bilateral effusions for less than 3 months, the clinician should assess for signs or symptoms of OME that would make tube insertion an option. If a child with OME has moderate hearing loss (> 40 dB HL), tympanostomy tube insertion should be recommended. Reevaluation at 3- to 6-month intervals should include otologic examination, with audiologic assessment as needed, and any child with evidence of hearing loss on screening or hearing testing should be referred for comprehensive audiologic evaluation by a licensed audiologist in a sound-treated booth. One systematic review showed early improvement in hearing levels after tympanostomy tube placement at postoperative 1–3 months, but by 12 to 24 months hearing outcomes were equivalent to watchful waiting, and randomized trials suggest that otherwise healthy children with persistent OME who do not have any of the at-risk criteria in Table 2 can be safely observed for 6 to 12 months without developmental sequelae or reduced overall QOL. Ongoing surveillance is mandatory because the incidence of structural damage increases with effusion duration.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^3c25d4f5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

### Otitis media with effusion [^fe6a496b]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children 1 to 3 years old with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced-practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media. The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should 1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME, 2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk, and 3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that 4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME, 5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected, and 6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate (tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure). Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that 1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children, and 2) because antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME, they should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that 1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and 2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery) and provide additional relevant information such as history of acute otitis media and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for 1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME, based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy, or 2) allergy management as a treatment for OME, based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children more than 12 years old, because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child-development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^aeb3e1f6]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Childhood hearing screening — otitis media with effusion (OME) diagnosis and natural history are characterized by the statement that the diagnosis of OME is a medical rather than an audiological prerogative and that the asymptomatic nature of the disease contributes to diagnostic difficulty; in 40–60% of cases of OME neither children nor their parents report significant complaints, and parent report is highly inaccurate in identifying non-acute OME; OME often remits but approximately 30–40% of children have recurrent OME and 5–10% of episodes last one year or longer; in one study, 55% of children with OME improved by three months, one third relapsed within the subsequent three months; and if middle ear effusion is present longer than three months, there will be little chance of recovery without medical treatment.

Statement 2A. Prompt audiologic examination — tinnitus evaluation and timing are specified as follows: Clinicians should obtain a comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, associated with hearing difficulties, or persistent (≥ 6 months). The policy level is Recommendation, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C based on observational studies and level of confidence in the evidence Moderate, and the benefit-harm assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit. The term prompt is used to emphasize ordering a timely test and ensuring that it is done within 4 weeks of assessment, preferably; supporting text states audiologic examination is ideally obtained within 4 weeks of initial patient presentation, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) warrants audiologic testing preferably at the time of presentation, or otherwise no later than 2 weeks after presentation. Risks, harms, costs include direct cost of examination, access to testing, and time.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — failed newborn hearing screen follow-up: Clinicians should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn hearing screen regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Intentional vagueness states that the method and specifics of follow-up are at the discretion of the clinician but should seek resolution of OME within 3 months of onset or, if not known, diagnosis. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C; Level of confidence in evidence: Medium; Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit, with benefits including more prompt diagnosis of SNHL, earlier intervention for hearing loss, reduced loss to follow-up, and reassurance for parents, and risks including time spent in counseling and parental anxiety from increased focus on child hearing issues. Supporting data report that among screening failures referred for further testing, 55% of children had OME, of which 23% had spontaneous resolution; in remaining infants after tympanocentesis or placement of ventilation tubes, 69% had immediate return and 31% had delayed return in hearing with a median of 4.8 months; a cohort study found that 11% had SNHL in addition to the transient conductive hearing loss from the effusion.

Early identification, treatment, and medical evaluation of childhood hearing loss are essential to promoting language and social development, regardless of their age of presentation. Evaluation of hearing loss in children should prioritize reversible and treatable causes. Multiple algorithms have been established to address the changing prevalence of genetic or infectious contributions to hearing loss and include recommendations on laboratory testing, imaging, and genetic testing. Despite these recommendations, significant practice variation remains on assessing the etiology of hearing loss in children.

Turner syndrome — otologic screening and treatment recommendations: We recommend otoscopy evaluation for detection of middle ear disease, including infection, in children with symptoms. We recommend newborn hearing screening be completed, and if this is normal, age-appropriate behavioral audiometric evaluation be conducted every 2–3 years in childhood and adolescence starting as soon as developmentally able (1–2 years of age), every 5 years in adults, and any time decreased hearing is suspected. We recommend annual tympanometry up to 5 years of age where clinically available. We recommend antibiotic treatment should be administered for acute bacterial otitis media per local treatment guidelines (as for a high-risk population) and a repeat examination should be done to ensure resolution. We suggest placement of tympanostomy tubes at the early stages of chronic or recurrent middle ear disease in childhood (as for a high-risk population). We recommend prompt intervention with tympanostomy tube insertion or hearing aids for conductive hearing loss due to middle ear disease in childhood. We recommend rehabilitation with hearing aids or cochlear implantation for sensorineural hearing loss.

Key points
- No single treatment or intervention for hearing loss is the answer for every child or family.
- Intervention plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and any changes needed along the way.
- There are many different options for children with hearing loss and their families. Treatment and intervention overview Treatment and intervention options for hearing loss in children include
- Working with a professional who can help a child and family learn to communicate.
- Getting a hearing device, such as a hearing aid.
- Joining support groups.
- Taking advantage of other resources available to children with a hearing loss and their families. Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Programs Every state has an EHDI program. EHDI works to identify infants and children with hearing loss. EHDI also promotes timely follow-up testing and intervention services for any family whose child has a hearing loss.

Important tip Treatment and intervention types Intervention Services Early Intervention Hearing loss can affect a child's ability to develop speech, language, and social skills. The earlier a child who is deaf or hard-of-hearing starts getting services, the more likely the child's communication and social skills will reach their full potential. Early intervention program services help young children with hearing loss learn communication and other important skills. Research shows that early intervention services can greatly improve a child's development. Babies who are diagnosed with hearing loss should begin to get intervention services as soon as possible, but no later than 6 months of age. There are many services available through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act 2004. Services for children from birth through 36 months of age are called Early Intervention or Part C services.

Even if your child has not been diagnosed with a hearing loss, he or she may be eligible for early intervention treatment services. The IDEA 2004 says that children under the age of 3 years who are at risk of having developmental delays may be eligible for services. These services are provided through an early intervention system in your state. Through this system, you can ask for an evaluation. Assistive Technology Many people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing have some hearing. The amount of hearing a deaf or hard-of-hearing person has is called "residual hearing. " Technology does not "cure" hearing loss but may help a child with hearing loss to make the most of their residual hearing. For those parents who choose to have their child use technology, there are many options, including
- Hearing aids
- Cochlear or brainstem implants
- Bone-anchored hearing aids
- Other assistive devices. Hearing Aids Hearing aids make sounds louder.

They can be worn by people of any age, including infants. Babies with hearing loss may understand sounds better using hearing aids. This may give them the chance to learn speech skills at a young age. There are many styles of hearing aids. They can help many types of hearing losses. A young child is usually fitted with behind-the-ear style hearing aids because they are better suited to growing ears. Cochlear and Auditory Brainstem Implants A cochlear implant may help many children with severe to profound hearing loss — even very young children. It gives that child a way to hear when a hearing aid is not enough. Unlike a hearing aid, cochlear implants do not make sounds louder. A cochlear implant sends sound signals directly to the hearing nerve. Persons with severe to profound hearing loss due to an absent or very small hearing nerve or severely abnormal inner ear, may not benefit from a hearing aid or cochlear implant.

### Pediatric sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^1f081c66]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is defined as sudden unilateral or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with at least 30dB decrease in threshold in 3 contiguous test frequencies occurring over 72hours or less. It is rare among children. The mechanism of the process and prognosis of the disorder remains unclear. The current incidence of sudden sensorineural hearing loss among pediatric population is unknown. The authors carried out a retrospective chart analysis of patients under 15 years of age from 2004 to 2015, who consulted to the Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Department of Inonu University Medical Faculty. Age, sex, number of affected ear and side, audiometric evaluations, medical follow-up, treatment method, duration of treatment recovery, associated complaints; tinnitus and/or vertigo, presence of mumps disease were recorded for each patient. A 4-frequency pure-tone average (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000Hz) was calculated for each ear. Complete recovery, defined as some hearing level compared with the nonaffected ear, was observed in 3 patients (21.4%) and there was no partial hearing recovery. The hearing loss of 11 patient remained unchanged after prednisolone treatment. Two of the 11 patients had bilaterally total sensorineural hearing loss and evaluated as appropriate for cochlear implantation. Sex of patient and laterality of hearing loss were not correlated with hearing recovery. Sensorineural hearing loss among pediatrics has been the issue of otolaryngologists. The incidence, etiology, and treatment methods should be more studied.

Chronic OME — hearing surveillance and audiologic thresholds: Periodic assessment of hearing status is an important aspect of surveillance, and hearing loss has been defined by conventional audiometry as a loss > 20-dB HL at ≥ 1 frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) and requires a comprehensive audiologic evaluation; if hearing levels are in the normal range (HL ≤ 20 dB), a repeat hearing test should be performed in 3 to 6 months if OME persists, whereas for mild hearing loss (HL, 21–39 dB) or moderate (or greater) hearing loss (HL ≥ 40 dB), a comprehensive audiologic evaluation is indicated if one has not already been done; in addition, all children with specified tympanic membrane conditions, regardless of OME duration, should have a comprehensive audiologic evaluation typically including air and bone conduction thresholds and speech audiometry.

Recommended assessments

Visual system

Annual eye examinations are recommended in MPS IVA and should include slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the cornea, measurement of intraocular pressure, assessment of refractive error, and examination of the posterior segment. Older patients may undergo electroretinography to detect the rod-cone retinal dystrophy that has been reported. If vision is reduced, evaluation with low-vision aids should be considered. When glaucoma is detected, or keratoplasty or cataract surgery is required, more frequent examinations may be necessary.

Auditory system

Annual auditory assessments are recommended from birth (or diagnosis). Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) can be used to ascertain outer hair cell function, however, due to the likely presence of middle ear effusions, OAEs are unlikely to be recordable, so assessment using ABR is recommended as an appropriate neonatal test. If hearing impairment is discovered, management is dependent on the severity and type of hearing loss. A conductive hearing loss for instance can be treated either with ventilation tubes if the cause is middle ear fluid, or to avoid surgery, a bone conduction hearing aid can be used, if this is fitted onto a soft band, which can be particularly good for young babies and infants.

Beyond infancy, regular audio behavioral testing should be carried out annually due to the progressive nature of the hearing impairment, both to check for any conductive elements and also because the risk of developing a sensorineural loss increases with age. From around 8 months to the age of 2.5 years, the child should be able to perform behavioral testing such as visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA), although this requires the child to be able to sit supported around the waist and have good head control. Full ear specific testing with bone conduction is possible when performing VRA at this age and is highly recommended. Once the child is 3 years of age, conventional hearing checks such as play audiometry should take place at least annually and more regularly if hearing aids have been issued.

Ear fluid and newborn hearing screening — parent counseling from Table 8 notes that only a very small number of babies who fail will have permanent hearing loss, with only about 2 or 3 of every 1000 children in the US born deaf or hard of hearing; middle ear fluid is a very common cause of a failed newborn hearing screen and is found in about 6 of every 10 children who fail; the newborn hearing screen cannot determine the cause, and about 90% of the time hearing loss goes away when the fluid does, but 10% of children may still have hearing loss that needs further medical attention; after tubes, for about 70% of children hearing loss caused by fluid will go away right after the tubes are in place, however, for about 30% of children it could take up to several months before hearing improves; middle ear fluid is more common in children with an abnormal roof of the mouth (cleft palate) or certain inherited problems; and because parent assessment of child hearing is not always accurate, only a professional hearing test that checks each ear separately can accurately tell how a child hears.

Methods for assessing hearing in children — The preferred method of hearing assessment is age-appropriate audiologic testing through conventional audiometry or comprehensive audiologic assessment. Children aged 4 years or older are usually able to reliably respond to conventional audiometry, which in primary care can use a fail criterion of > 20 dB HL at 1 or more frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) in either ear. Comprehensive audiologic evaluation by an audiologist is recommended for children aged 6 months to 4 years and for any child who fails conventional audiometry; age-specific methods include visual reinforcement audiometry for 6 months to 2.5 years and play audiometry for 2.5 to 4 years. Ear-specific audiologic testing is recommended whenever possible, using insert earphones to detect unilateral or asymmetrical hearing loss.

### The role of intraoperative auditory brainstem response testing for infants and difficult-to-test children [^a1bb0729]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the validity of intraoperative auditory brainstem response in infants and difficult-to-treat older children.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Tertiary-level children's hospital.

Subjects and Methods

Twenty-six patients were identified (mean age, 20 ± 18 months) who underwent both intraoperative auditory brainstem response (ioABR) testing and a follow-up hearing evaluation at five (standard deviation 4) months. Ears were analyzed separately for mean threshold change, and a sub-analysis was performed accounting for the presence or absence of fluid at the time of surgery.

Results

A paired t test analysis indicated a statistically significant difference at 1 kHz. There was not a statistically significant difference between the two groups with click or 4-kHz testing. Fifteen ears (58%) at 1 kHz and 17 ears (49%) at 4 kHz frequencies, however, improved by 10 dB or more; 67 percent and 65 percent of these ears, respectively, had middle ear fluid intraoperatively. Eight ears (35%) in the click ABR group had a similar improvement, four of which had fluid at the time of surgery. Four ears in the 1-kHz (11.5%), in the 4-kHz (11.4%), and in the click ABR group (17.4%) demonstrated a 10-dB or worse threshold. The range of the discrepancy varied from a worsening in thresholds up to 20 dB and improvement in thresholds up to 45 dB.

Conclusions

We observed a significant discrepancy between ioABR and follow-up hearing thresholds. If ioABR indicates a hearing loss, audiologic testing should be performed at least several weeks later to confirm the results.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion [^7e471e8d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children aged 1 to 3 years with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media (AOM). The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should (1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME; (2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk; and (3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known), or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that (4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer, or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME; (5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; and (6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate, tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure. Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy, with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that (1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children and (2) antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME and should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that (1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and (2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery), and provide additional relevant information such as history of AOM and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for (1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy and (2) allergy management as a treatment for OME based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children older than 12 years because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion executive summary (update) [^ffbdcd0a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 18 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy, identification of children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from otitis media with effusion, and education of clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most otitis media with effusion and the lack of efficacy for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^25f2ede2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Hearing assessment methods in OME — preferred approaches and age thresholds indicate that the preferred method of hearing assessment is age-appropriate audiologic testing through conventional audiometry, comprehensive audiologic assessment, and frequency-specific auditory-evoked potentials. Typically developing children aged ≥ 4 years may be sufficiently mature for conventional audiometry, which can be done in the primary care setting with a fail criterion > 20-dB HL at ≥ 1 frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) in either ear. Comprehensive audiologic evaluation by a licensed audiologist is recommended for children aged 6 months to 4 years and for any child who fails conventional audiometry in a primary care setting. Visual reinforcement audiometry is typically used for hearing assessment in children aged 8 months to 2.5 years, and has been shown to provide reliable results in infants as young as 6 months when performed by audiologists. Hearing testing by an audiologist is needed to determine the degree, type, and laterality of hearing loss to assess the functional impact of OME on a child's hearing, yet hearing testing is infrequently performed for children with OME in primary care settings.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^cab9ea70]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Physiologic hearing tests (OAE and ABR) in OME — Evoked otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) may be used when behavioral audiometry is not feasible or as a cross-check measure; OAEs provide objective assessment of inner ear functioning, are sensitive to OME and other peripheral causes, and may be absent if effusion prevents recording, though they can be done by trained paraprofessionals and are highly sensitive to mild or greater conductive and sensorineural loss. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing is another physiologic measure that might be useful when behavioral audiometry is not feasible; unlike OAEs, ABR validity is not affected by OME beyond conductive loss, but some children with OME have worse ABR thresholds following tube insertion, so results must be interpreted with caution and decisions should be based on shared decisions with the clinician, family, and audiologist.

### Fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss in children [^d77eda91]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Childhood sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that fluctuates or is progressive enhances parental concern and complicates medical management, hearing aid selection, and individualized educational planning for the affected child. Despite intensive multidisciplinary evaluation and intervention, continued threshold fluctuation or a gradual decline in auditory acuity may proceed unabated in a significant percentage of these youngsters. With the adoption of universal newborn hearing screening mandates by an increasing number of states, any challenges to the accurate determination of auditory thresholds must be addressed within the first few months of life.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^c66a018d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — key term definitions specify that OME is the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection, and chronic OME is OME persisting for ≥ 3 mo from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Acute otitis media (AOM) is the rapid onset of signs and symptoms of inflammation of the middle ear, and middle ear effusion is fluid in the middle ear from any cause that is present with both OME and AOM and may persist for weeks or months after AOM resolves. Hearing assessment gathers information about a child's hearing status via caregiver report or formal testing and does not include use of noisemakers or other nonstandardized methods. Pneumatic otoscopy examines middle ear mobility by changing ear canal pressure, with a normal eardrum moving briskly but becoming minimal or sluggish with fluid. A tympanogram objectively measures tympanic membrane vibration and pressure; with fluid the tracing is flat or nearly flat, and with air at abnormal pressure the peak shifts left if negative or right if positive. Conductive hearing loss reflects impaired sound transmission often associated with effusion, whereas sensorineural hearing loss results from abnormal transmission of sound from the sensory cells of the inner ear to the brain.

Otitis media with effusion — management of hearing loss: Knowledge of hearing levels in each ear will influence management for unilateral OME, including listening strategies, preferential seating in the classroom, and monitoring for an increase in hearing loss or involvement of the better ear over time, and hearing levels are also important in assessing tube candidacy and in decision making during OME surveillance.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^5d3506a1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Natural history and rationale — Once OME has persisted in both ears for 3 months or longer, the chance of spontaneous resolution is low: approximately 20% within 3 months, 25% after 6 months, and only 30% after 1 year of additional observation. Therefore, most children diagnosed with chronic bilateral OME will fail to improve in a timely fashion, even with prolonged observation. This low probability of resolution creates a need to assess the impact of persistent effusion on a child's QOL and functional health status.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children [^81bac93f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States. Tympanostomy tubes are most often inserted because of persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. Despite the frequency of tympanostomy tube insertion, there are currently no clinical practice guidelines in the United States that address specific indications for surgery. This guideline is intended for any clinician involved in managing children, aged 6 months to 12 years, with tympanostomy tubes or being considered for tympanostomy tubes in any care setting, as an intervention for otitis media of any type.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and surgical indications for and management of tympanostomy tubes in children. The development group broadly discussed indications for tube placement, perioperative management, care of children with indwelling tubes, and outcomes of tympanostomy tube surgery. Given the lack of current published guidance on surgical indications, the group focused on situations in which tube insertion would be optional, recommended, or not recommended. Additional emphasis was placed on opportunities for quality improvement, particularly regarding shared decision making and care of children with existing tubes. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic eardrops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. The panel made recommendations that (1) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) of less than 3 months' duration; (2) clinicians should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) or prior to surgery when a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion; (3) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and documented hearing difficulties; (4) clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who did not receive tympanostomy tubes until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected; (5) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who do not have middle ear effusion in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (6) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (7) clinicians should determine if a child with recurrent AOM or with OME of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from otitis media because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (8) in the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications; (9) clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs, headbands; avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. The development group provided the following options: (1) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and symptoms that are likely attributable to OME including, but not limited to, vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life and (2) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is unlikely to resolve quickly as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or persistence of effusion for 3 months or longer (chronic OME).

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^6d0ec8ba]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) natural history and observation thresholds are described as follows: Short-term natural history shows rates of spontaneous resolution or improvement ranging from 28% to 52% within 3 or 4 months of diagnosis. Most studies of tympanostomy tube efficacy required documented bilateral OME for at least 3 months before entry into the study, and one group enrolled children with at least 2 months of bilateral OME. Because of these restrictions, there are no data to support tympanostomy tube insertion in children with OME of brief duration (less than 2 to 3 months), and observation until the OME has been documented for at least 3 months can avoid unnecessary surgery. Children with OME who are at risk for developmental delays or disorders are excluded from this recommendation and should therefore be managed on an individual basis when OME is diagnosed.

### Sudden hearing loss in children [^2510768a]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) is defined as a unilateral or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with at least 30 dB decrease in threshold in 3 contiguous test frequencies occurring over 72 hours or less. It is very rare in children. Sudden hearing loss is a symptom that suggests that there is a problem in the inner ear, surrounding structures, or the whole organism. The etiology and development of this disorder are still not fully understood. The literature contains numerous models of the pathogenesis of SSHL, with childhood SSHL having certain peculiarities. In practical terms, the multifactorial nature of SSHL is important in the choice of diagnostic methods and treatment methods. It is important to determine the cause and effect relationship between the underlying disease and hearing loss.

### Otitis media with effusion: an underestimated cause of hearing loss in infants [^4f673f61]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the major reason for failure of neonatal hearing screening. However, little is known about the impact on hearing status of OME in infants during the first months of life.

Patients

Infants who failed universal newborn hearing screening.

Methods

Prospective evaluation for the presence of OME, the degree of hearing loss and the disease evolution.

Results

Between 2007 and 2008, approximately 152 infants were referred because of unilateral or bilateral failure on universal newborn hearing screening with an automated auditory brainstem response device. Eighty-four (55.3%) had OME, 20 of them were lost to follow-up. The remainder 64 infants comprised 37 boys and 27 girls, with a median age of 49 days (range, 40–65 d) at admission. Auditory brainstem response thresholds were 50 dB nHL (range, 40–60) in both ears. A spontaneous resolution of OME was documented in 15 infants. In the remaining, hearing normalized after tympanocentesis or placement of ventilation tubes. Normal hearing could be ascertained in all children at a median age of 4.8 months (range, 3.3–7.8 mo). In the group of infants analyzed, no permanent hearing loss could be detected.

Conclusion

OME is an important cause of transient, moderately severe hearing loss during the first months of life — a critical period for development of the auditory system. Active treatment should be considered if spontaneous resolution does not occur to prevent any delay in language acquisition and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^78925a57]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy tubes in children — research needs emphasize diagnostic prediction and testing strategies, including whether we can "identify clinical factors that predict persistence of MEE" and define "the ideal timing of audiologic testing for a child being considered for tubes — before surgery, after surgery, or both", and how "abnormal tympanometry at the initial clinical encounter" relates to persistence of otitis media with effusion (OME). Questions address evaluation and risk prediction in recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), such as the "best time to evaluate children referred for possible surgical treatment of recurrent AOM with relation to the last episode of AOM" and whether the "presence of middle ear fluid in one or both ears" predicts more AOM episodes in children with recurrent AOM. For at‑risk populations, the guideline asks about the "benefits of tympanostomy tube placement on frequency of AOM, prevalence of OME, and speech and language development", whether surgery presents "unique risks or greater complications", the "actual frequency of AOM and prevalence of OME", and the potential for "underdiagnosis of OME because of attention to other conditions or overdiagnosis of OME because of greater clinical exposure for some of the at-risk populations". Indicators for repeated intervention are prioritized, including "the clinical indicators that best predict the need for repeated tympanostomy tube placement" and the "role of allergy testing" and management for children with "recurrent tube otorrhea" or repeated placement. Device and adjunct decisions are highlighted by asking whether certain "types of long-term tubes" are more often linked to complications and "which subgroups of children should be considered for adenoidectomy at the time of the first set of tubes or when younger than age 4 years". Communication and postoperative care topics include how "face-to-face" counseling and educational resources "facilitate shared surgical decision making", indications to prescribe "postoperative ototopical antibiotics", whether limiting routine drop use changes "the incidence of postoperative otorrhea" and microbiology, predictors of failure of "ototopical therapy as initial treatment for TTO", identifying children at risk for otorrhea and criteria for "posttympanostomy water precautions", whether child water‑precaution recommendations can be "generalized to adults with tympanostomy tubes", and the "ideal follow-up schedule" for patients with tubes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of otitis media [^1ec2db64]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media include rapid onset of symptoms, middle ear effusion, and signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial isolates from the middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media. Fever, otalgia, headache, irritability, cough, rhinitis, listlessness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and pulling at the ears are common, but nonspecific symptoms. Detection of middle ear effusion by pneumatic otoscopy is key in establishing the diagnosis. Observation is an acceptable option in healthy children with mild symptoms. Antibiotics are recommended in all children younger than six months, in those between six months and two years if the diagnosis is certain, and in children with severe infection. High-dosage amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is recommended as first-line therapy. Macrolide antibiotics, clindamycin, and cephalosporins are alternatives in penicillin-sensitive children and in those with resistant infections. Patients who do not respond to treatment should be reassessed. Hearing and language testing is recommended in children with suspected hearing loss or persistent effusion for at least three months, and in those with developmental problems.

### Nonsurgical home treatment of middle ear effusion and associated hearing loss in children. part I: clinical trial [^ecf9fdc5]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2005). Low credibility.

We conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of treatment of persistent middle ear effusion (MEE) and associated hearing loss with a modified Politzer device used in the home setting over a 7-week period. Efficacy was determined by comparing pre-and posttherapy air-conduction thresholds, tympanometric peak pressures, and otoscopic findings. The study group was made up of 94 children (174 ears), aged 4 to 11 years, who had at least a 2-month history of MEE and associated hearing loss. At study's end, patients in the treatment group experienced statistically significant improvements in all measured outcomes; no significant improvements were seen in the control group in all measured outcomes. At study's end, the hearing sensitivity of 73.9% of the treated ears was within normal limits, compared with only 26.7% of the control ears. These findings demonstrate that home treatment of children with persistent MEE and associated hearing loss with the modified Politzer device is highly efficacious.

### Nonsurgical home treatment of middle ear effusion and associated hearing loss in children. part II: validation study [^4bf6c74c]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2005). Low credibility.

In this prospective follow-up investigation, we examined the efficacy of a modified Politzer device in the home treatment of persistent middle ear effusion (MEE) and associated hearing loss in children who had previously participated in a similar clinical trial. Our study group was made up of 38 patients who had been either (1) untreated control participants in the previous study whose hearing in one or both ears had not returned to normal within 11 weeks of their initial audiologic pretest ("former control group"; n = 30), or (2) active-treatment participants in the previous study whose hearing sensitivity in at least one ear had not improved to within normal limits after treatment and who elected to undergo a continuation of treatment ("extended-treatment group"; n = 8). Treatment efficacy was determined by comparing differences in pre- and posttreatment air-conduction thresholds and otoscopic findings. Following treatment, the former control group experienced significant improvements in hearing sensitivity at all frequencies; at the posttreatment test, hearing sensitivity was within normal limits in 43 of 60 ears (71.7%), and normal or moderate tympanic membrane mobility was observed in 30 of 34 otoscopically examined ears (88.2%). In the extended-treatment group, hearing sensitivity returned to within normal limits in 9 of 10 impaired ears (90.0%). These findings further substantiate the efficacy of our modified Politzer device in improving middle ear function and hearing sensitivity in children with MEE, and they support the reliability of the findings reported in our previous study. These results also indicate that many patients in whom initial treatment is not successful may benefit from extended treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^cdba6edc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — definition and diagnostic criteria: SSNHL is a subset of sudden hearing loss (SHL) that is sensorineural in nature, occurs within a 72-hour window, and meets audiometric criteria; the most frequently used audiometric criterion is a decrease in hearing of ≥ 30 decibels affecting at least 3 consecutive frequencies, and this guideline uses ≥ 30-dB SNHL at 3 consecutive frequencies. Idiopathic SSNHL (ISSNHL) is defined as SSNHL with no identifiable cause despite adequate investigation and is the situation in 90% of patients with SSNHL; in this document, the use of SSNHL is equivalent to ISSNHL after the appropriate workup in Key Action Statement 1 and KAS 2. SHL is defined as a rapid-onset subjective sensation of hearing impairment in one or both ears, and physical examination and tuning fork testing help distinguish conductive hearing loss (CHL) from sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) by identifying obstructing cerumen, foreign body, tympanic membrane perforation, or middle-ear fluid so the SSNHL pathway can be triggered; SSNHL is often but not always accompanied by tinnitus and/or vertigo, and tinnitus may persist and be disturbing to the patient.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^72f304e1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Safety assessments

Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, otoscopy for presence of bilateral effusion, tube occlusion assessment, audiometric testing, tympanometry, physical examination, and vital sign measurement. Adverse events were classified with standard terminology (ie, system organ class and preferred term) according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 16.1).

Patients, if able, completed audiometric testing (typically ≥ 4 years of age) at screening and days 15 and 29; the audiologist determined the most appropriate test method (visual reinforcement audiometry, conditioned play audiometry, or conventional). The degree of hearing loss was calculated through the pure tone average (PTA; the sum of the threshold levels in decibels obtained for 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, divided by the number of thresholds obtained) was used to calculate the degree of hearing loss and to categorize it as normal hearing (0–15 dB), slight hearing loss (16–25 dB), mild hearing loss (26–40 dB), moderate hearing loss (41–55 dB), moderate-severe hearing loss (56–70 dB), severe hearing loss (71–90 dB), and profound hearing loss (> 90 dB). Shifts from screening in PTA for air conduction, bone conduction, and the air-bone gap — depicting shifts in air-bone gap ≤ 10 vs > 10 dB — were calculated for each ear, each frequency, and each treatment group at each postbaseline measurement. Shifts were also noted from baseline to day 15 and to day 29 for the type of tympanogram (A, B [small/normal/large canal volume], or C), with ears as the unit of analysis.

Statistical Analysis

The cumulative proportion of treatment failures at each time point through day 29 was analyzed via the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by age (6 months to 2 years and > 2 years), to determine whether the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was equal to 1.0 (ie, no association between treatment and outcome) at the 2-tailed 0.05 alpha level for the full analysis set. Estimates of the strength of association were provided with the adjusted relative risk (RR) and adjusted OR with associated 95% confidence intervals. The cumulative proportions presented were not adjusted for age.

### About hearing loss in children… [^5e6795cb]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Hearing loss can affect a child's ability to develop speech, language, and social skills.
- The earlier that children with hearing loss start getting services, the more likely they are to reach their full potential.
- If you think that a child might have hearing loss, ask the child's doctor for a hearing screening as soon as possible. Don't wait. What it is A hearing loss can happen when any part of the ear is not working in the usual way. This includes the outer ear, middle ear, inner ear, hearing nerve, and auditory systemB. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of hearing loss are different for each child. If you think that your child might have hearing loss, ask the child's doctor for a hearing screening as soon as possible. Don't wait. Even if a child has passed a hearing screening before, it is important to look for the following signs. Signs in babies
- Does not startle at loud noises.
- Does not turn to the source of a sound after 6 months of age.
- Does not say single words, such as "dada" or "mama" by 1 year of age.
- Turns head when he or she sees you but not if you only call out his or her name. This sometimes is mistaken for not paying attention or just ignoring, but could be the result of a partial or complete hearing loss.
- Seems to hear some sounds but not others. Signs in children
- Speech is delayed.
- Speech is not clear.
- Does not follow directions. This sometimes is mistaken for not paying attention or just ignoring, but could be the result of a partial or complete hearing loss.
- Often says, "Huh. "
- Turns the TV or radio volume up too high. Babies and children should reach milestones in how they play, learn, communicate, and act. Causes Hearing loss can happen any time during life — from before birth to adulthood.

The following are some of the things that can increase the chance a child will have hearing loss: A genetic cause: About 1 out of 2 cases of hearing loss in babies is due to genetic causes. Some babies with a genetic cause for their hearing loss might have family members who also have a hearing loss. About 1 out of 3 babies with genetic hearing loss have a "syndrome. " This means they have other conditions in addition to the hearing loss, such as Down syndrome or Usher syndrome. Keep Reading: Types of Hearing Loss 1 out of 4 cases of hearing loss in babies is due to maternal infections during pregnancy, complications after birth, and head trauma. For example, the child:

- Was exposed to infection, such as before birth.
- Spent 5 days or more in a hospital neonatal intensive care unit or had complications while in the NICU.
- Needed a special procedure such as a blood transfusion to treat bad jaundice.
- Has head, face or ears shaped or formed in a different way than usual.
- Has a condition like a neurological disorder that may be associated with hearing loss.
- Had an infection around the brain and spinal cord called meningitis.
- Received a bad injury to the head that required a hospital stay. Prevention The following are tips for parents to help prevent hearing loss in their children:

- Have a healthy pregnancy.
- Make sure your child gets all the childhood vaccines regularly.
- Keep your child away from high noise levels, such as from very loud toys. Visit the National Institutes of Health's website to learn more about preventing noise-induced hearing loss. Screening and diagnosis Hearing screening can tell if a child might have hearing loss. Hearing screening is easy and is not painful. In fact, babies are often asleep while being screened. It takes a very short time — usually only a few minutes. Babies All babies should have a hearing screening no later than 1 month of age.

When the duration of OME is unknown, physicians must use whatever evidence is available and make a reasonable estimate, and hearing screening by school systems with rescreening or monitoring of hearing and tympanometry over a 2–3 month period can provide the medical community with important information on the duration of OME so that appropriate management options can be determined.

Achondroplasia — ear, nose and throat (ENT) care and hearing: Children "should have a comprehensive audiological assessment at birth, as indicated by signs and symptoms or in any case no later than 5 years of age", and those with "speech delay, hearing difficulties, and/or signs and symptoms of middle ear effusion should be referred to an ENT specialist". Adults and children "frequently have hearing loss and middle ear disease", so clinicians "should evaluate eardrums and ask about hearing difficulties as part of regular health maintenance to guide appropriate referrals". For chronic eustachian tube dysfunction with middle ear effusions and conductive hearing loss, tympanostomy tube placement "can be recommended when middle ear effusions are present for 3 or more months and hearing loss is documented". "Amplification with hearing aids can be offered" for hearing loss, including conductive loss from middle ear disease. Because high jugular bulb in the middle ear is more common, clinicians should check for otoscopic signs of high jugular bulb before myringotomy or other otological procedures are performed.

Considerations

As of 2006, all newborns in the Netherlands are screened for hearing problems through the neonatal hearing screening program (OAE/OAE/Algo through child and adolescent health care and Algo/Algo on NICUs). Screening is scheduled to be performed in the first 2 weeks of life, on NICUs sometimes, a bit later. The screening can reveal both conductive and perceptive losses. After an abnormal screening result for 1 or both ears, the children will be referred to a dedicated regional audiological center. In the audiological center, the child will be further tested until the nature of the loss and the therapeutic possibilities are clear. The goal is to start with an appropriate intervention (hearing aids) before the age of 6 months.

Any congenital losses (perceptive and conductive) are most likely identified in the neonatal hearing screening. One should be alert to problems that may occur later in life, especially OME. Persistent conductive losses after treatment of OME require attention, especially monitoring by imaging. An early CT scan of the petrous part of the temporal bone is useful to predict hearing problems and to decide whether treatment should consist of a hearing aid or a tympanostomy tube.

Recommendations

In the first 4 years of life an annual hearing test is indicated, with tympanometry and otoacoustic emissions, and, if possible, a pure-tone audiogram (from the age of 4 years, or somewhat earlier depending on the level of development and the capacity to follow instructions). After an unclear result, ABR and/or free field testing are performed, which can take place at the local audiological center.

The first skull-CT should include adequate sections of the petrous parts of the temporal bone, so that any structural abnormalities in the outer/middle and inner ear are identified at an early stage and appropriate therapy can be chosen without delay.

The therapy depends on the type of hearing loss (conform otolaryngology guidelines) and may consist of tympanostomy tubes, hearing aids (conventional, BAHA), or cochlear implant. Treatment is performed by the audiologist, either local or at the center. Reconstructive surgery for congenital middle ear abnormalities can take place at a later age.

Speech/language monitoring commences at the age of 2 years with standard speech and language assessment tests.

Otitis media with effusion — at-risk infants and children: At-risk children with OME require more frequent hearing assessment and prompt management to prevent additional impact on developmental outcomes. This category includes children with speech-language or academic delay and those with developmental disability of any cause, especially Down syndrome and other craniofacial anomalies in which OME is very common and persistent. Children in these categories should receive otologic and hearing screening or assessment when speech-language delay is identified to allow prompt treatment for OME, and hearing should be reassessed following medical or surgical treatment, at ongoing intervals (at least annually), or as recommended in relevant clinical practice guidelines.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^75f89a9e]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Childhood hearing screening — timing of rescreening and spontaneous resolution of otitis media with effusion (OME) reports that the prevalence of middle ear effusion within the preschool population is extremely high but often resolves spontaneously without treatment, with Bluestone (2004) finding that 80 percent resolved on its own in two months, Fielalu-Nikolajsen (1983) finding 36 percent resolved in four weeks with an additional 23 percent in eight weeks and 9 percent more after another four weeks, and Tos (1980) finding 50 percent of a population of 2 year olds resolved in three months without treatment. In order to reduce the high over-referral rates, the ASHA (1997) guidelines revised the time between the initial screen and the rescreen to 6–8 weeks, the American Academy of Pediatrics (2004) recommended watchful waiting of the child with OME for 3 months before providing treatment, and additional reports show rescreen intervals ranging from 2 weeks in Head Start programs to 16 weeks in a New Zealand program. Program experience included 34,979 children in the Long Island Hearing Screening Program with 18 percent medically referred after the initial screen and no rescreens performed, and in a North Carolina Head Start of 1,462 preschoolers, 29 percent referred following the initial screen with 8.5 percent still abnormal on a rescreen two weeks later (a 71% reduction).

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) key points on pediatric hearing screening — applicable to children evaluated for OME — state that any parental concern about hearing loss should be taken seriously and requires an objective hearing screening of the patient. All providers of pediatric health care should be proficient with pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry; however, neither method assesses hearing. Developmental abnormalities, level of functioning, and behavioral problems may preclude accurate results on routine audiometric screening and testing, and in this situation, referral to an otolaryngologist and audiologist should be made. The results of abnormal screening should be explained carefully to parents, and the child's medical record should be flagged to facilitate tracking and follow-up. Any abnormal objective screening result requires audiology referral and definitive testing.

### Antibiotics for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^156260fe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. When persistent, it may lead to developmental delay, social difficulty and poor quality of life. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, autoinflation, medical and surgical treatment. Antibiotics are sometimes used to treat any bacteria present in the effusion, or associated biofilms.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of oral antibiotics for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies to 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared oral antibiotics with either placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise and were: 1) hearing, 2) otitis media-specific quality of life and 3) anaphylaxis. Secondary outcomes were: 1) persistence of OME, 2) adverse effects, 3) receptive language skills, 4) speech development, 5) cognitive development, 6) psychosocial skills, 7) listening skills, 8) generic health-related quality of life, 9) parental stress, 10) vestibular function and 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We identified 19 completed studies that met our inclusion criteria (2581 participants). They assessed a variety of oral antibiotics (including penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides and trimethoprim), with most studies using a 10- to 14-day treatment course. We had some concerns about the risk of bias in all studies included in this review. Here we report our primary outcomes and main secondary outcome, at the longest reported follow-up time. Antibiotics versus placebo We included 11 studies for this comparison, but none reported all of our outcomes of interest and limited meta-analysis was possible. Hearing One study found that more children may return to normal hearing by two months (resolution of the air-bone gap) after receiving antibiotics as compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (Peto odds ratio (OR) 9.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.51 to 26.18; 20/49 children who received antibiotics returned to normal hearing versus 0/37 who received placebo; 1 study, 86 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Disease-specific quality of life No studies assessed this outcome. Presence/persistence of OME At 6 to 12 months of follow-up, the use of antibiotics compared with placebo may slightly reduce the number of children with persistent OME, but the confidence intervals were wide, and the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.17; 48% versus 54%; number needed to treat (NNT) 17; 2 studies, 324 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse event: anaphylaxis No studies provided specific data on anaphylaxis. Three of the included studies (448 children) did report adverse events in sufficient detail to assume that no anaphylactic reactions occurred, but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics versus no treatment We included eight studies for this comparison, but very limited meta-analysis was possible. Hearing One study found that the use of antibiotics compared to no treatment may result in little to no difference in final hearing threshold at three months (mean difference (MD) -5.38 dB HL, 95% CI -9.12 to -1.64; 1 study, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence). The only data identified on the return to normal hearing were reported at 10 days of follow-up, which we considered to be too short to accurately reflect the efficacy of antibiotics. Disease-specific quality of life No studies assessed this outcome. Presence/persistence of OME Antibiotics may reduce the proportion of children who have persistent OME at up to three months of follow-up, when compared with no treatment (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.80; 6 studies, 542 participants; low-certainty evidence). Adverse event: anaphylaxis No studies provided specific data on anaphylaxis. Two of the included studies (180 children) did report adverse events in sufficient detail to assume that no anaphylactic reactions occurred, but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the use of antibiotics for OME is of low to very low certainty. Although the use of antibiotics compared to no treatment may have a slight beneficial effect on the resolution of OME at up to three months, the overall impact on hearing is very uncertain. The long-term effects of antibiotics are unclear and few of the studies included in this review reported on potential harms. These important endpoints should be considered when weighing up the potential short- and long-term benefits and harms of antibiotic treatment in a condition with a high spontaneous resolution rate.

### Repeated audiometry after bacterial meningitis: consequences for future management [^221cd100]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Course of Hearing Loss

Of 110 patients with repeated audiometry in Cohort 3, 82 (75%, 95% CI 66–82%) had normal hearing at the first assessment. Follow-up audiometry in these 82 patients did not reveal deterioration of hearing, although in 6 patients only data for one ear was available. In 19 of the 28 patients with diagnosed hearing loss after meningitis (20 unilateral, 8 bilateral) audiometry results remained stable, although in one patient only data for one ear was available (Fig. 2). Nine patients showed changes in hearing over time (Fig. 2). For six of them the hearing improved: in four patients even from mild hearing loss to normal hearing. One had a unilateral profound hearing loss after an infection with an unknown pathogen around birth, which showed fluctuations to a severe unilateral hearing loss. Two had a unilateral hearing loss (one moderate, one profound) with deterioration of the normal hearing ear to a moderate hearing loss in both, progressing to bilateral hearing loss.

FIG. 2
Course of hearing capacity after meningitis.

Both patients who developed a hearing loss in the other ear had neonatal meningitis; in one patient due to an infection of a group B streptococcus and in the other due to E. coli infection. The patient with a group B streptococcus infection initially had a normal response on the ABR in one ear, including a normal I-V interval although both I and V-latency were lengthened, and otoacoustic emissions were present. However, after 70 days, the otoacoustic emissions had disappeared while the tympanogram was normal. The ABR result 15 days later showed a hearing loss of 60 dB HL and a delayed I-V interval. The patient with an infection due to E. coli had delayed latencies at the first ABR, which took place 61 days after the meningitis, and the otoacoustic emissions were present in some frequency bands for both ears. In follow-up assessments (246 and 402 days after meningitis) the latencies were almost conform age. From pure-tone audiometry, taken at older ages, the hearing loss seemed stable at 60 to 65 dB in both ears.

Onset

In the two patients from Cohort 3 who developed hearing loss in the contralateral ear, results of the audiological test at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively, after meningitis were normal, and deterioration was detected at 3 and 8.5 months, respectively.

### Causes of pediatric sensorineural hearing loss… [^5c348a10]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Sensorineural hearing loss is fairly common in children. Extensive workups, often without clear direction, should be reconsidered based on the children with SNHL who otolaryngologists are now seeing. Infant screening programs, although identifying many children earlier, will also provide the opportunity to fine-tune the evaluation, increasing the diagnostic yield. Particular attention was paid to identifying those children with known syndromes, birth factors, or maternal factors that may contribute to hearing loss and with acquired factors. Abnormalities noted on results of computed tomographic scanning were documented. Finally, method of rehabilitation for the hearing loss, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, or no treatment, was recorded.

The most common associated medical problems encountered were a history of recurrent otitis media and neurologic abnormalities. A known syndrome was identified in 12. 0% of patients, and
7. 0% had assorted craniofacial anomalies. Twenty-four patients had a history of premature birth, often requiring a stay in a neonatal intensive care unit. Twenty patients with fluctuating hearing loss or widened vestibular aqueducts underwent middle ear exploration. Perilymph leakage from the round and/or oval window was noted in 11. Computed tomgraphic scanning was performed in
51. 8% of patients as part of their workup; 7. 6% of patients had abnormal CT findings. Birth factors including prematurity, prolonged NICU stay, and elevated bilirubin levels were the most common etiologic factors for SNHL, followed by acquired factors, including meningitis, ECMO, and cisplatin chemotherapy. Known syndromes were identified in 12. 3%. These patients had the highest rate of abnormalities identified on results of CT scanning, including dilated vestibular aqueducts and Mondini malformations. Most patients underwent rehabilitation with hearing aids, and 18 children underwent cochlear implantation. The definite or probable causes of SNHL were identified in 75. 4%. Determining a cause becomes important for those treatable causes of SNHL or can allow the physician to stop potentially cochleotoxic drug therapy, such as cisplatin chemotherapy or aminoglycoside therapy. Knowing a diagnosis is helpful in allowing the family to cope with the child's SNHL and allows genetic counseling. The test with the highest yield of a diagnosis in that report was high-resolution CT scanning.

In our study, 51. 8% of patients underwent CT scanning. Of these, an abnormality was found in 7. 6%. Additional diagnostic tests were tailored to the individual patient, and many times depended on physician preference. Of primary importance is observing the child in hopes that the diagnosis may become apparent in time. Comparing our data with those of several earlier studies suggests that the ability to determine a cause of SNHL has improved for those children with bilateral severe to profound SNHL. 2, 5, 6 The primary reason for the small increase appears to reflect earlier detection of and screening for SNHL in the NICU. Of 211 patients, 40 had a history of a neonatal insult, including prematurity and/or low birth weight, prolonged NICU stay, and elevated bilirubin levels.

THE CURRENT NBHS: STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

The prevalence of permanent deafness identified by state-based Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) programs and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is 1.7 per 1000 births. This prevalence makes deafness the most common sensory deficit in humans. Universal NBHS is widely implemented in the United States, with 98.2% of newborns undergoing screening. From this perspective, the physiologic NBHS has been tremendously successful in regard to universal implementation and in its primary goal of decreasing the average age of identification of children with deafness.

The goal of universal NBHS is to identify all newborns with permanent deafness. Both detecting and establishing an etiologic diagnosis for deafness in children are challenging because of the large number of possible causes and the wide clinical variability in presentation (Table 1). Hearing loss is described as slight (16–25 decibel hearing level, dB HL), mild (26–40 dB HL), moderate (41–55 dB HL), moderately severe (56–70 dB HL), severe (71–90 dB HL), or profound (> 90 dB HL); can be unilateral or bilateral; and is either asymmetric or symmetric (Fig. 2). Select frequencies can be affected that can give an audiogram a specific shape or profile associated with specific genetic forms of deafness (for example, downsloping if high frequencies are impacted more than low frequencies, or upsloping if the reverse is true; Fig. 2). Deafness can also be defined by the site of impairment in the auditory system. A conductive hearing loss (CHL, see a list of definitions in Box 1) implies that transmission of sound through the external ear canal or middle ear is impaired, as in the case of a middle ear effusion, stenosis of the ear canal, or fixation of the ossicular chain. A sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), in comparison, reflects compromised transmission of the neural signal along the auditory pathway, be it in the cochlea, the auditory nerve, or more proximally in the brainstem and cortex. In the United States and other developed countries, most permanent congenital deafness is SNHL and the majority of SNHL (~70%) is due to a genetic cause (Table S1). Environmental causes of SNHL, such as infections, hypoxia, and trauma, are a significant but smaller contributor to congenital deafness compared with genetic causes.

Sensorineural hearing loss — vestibular loss is associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) but not universal, and vestibular loss is more likely with greater hearing loss severity, specific etiologies, and sudden SNHL; the primary outcome parameter is presence or absence of VEMP responses, and because cVEMP responses can be completed in newborns, cVEMPs are beginning to be used to screen for vestibular loss in children with hearing loss, with bone conduction cVEMPs used due to the high incidence of middle ear disease.

### Medical and surgical solutions | Parent's guide to hearing loss | CDC… [^5af6ae78]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Medical and Surgical Solutions Medications or surgery may also help make the most of a child's hearing. This is especially true for a outer or conductive hearing loss, or one that involves a part of the outer or middle ear that is not working in the usual way. One type of conductive hearing loss can be caused by a chronic ear infection. A chronic ear infection is a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum in the middle ear space. Ear infections are common for all children, including children who have a hearing loss. Even young infants can get them. If you think your child has an ear infection, it is important to take him or her to your child's doctor. For a child with a hearing loss, an ear infection can lessen the hearing even more. Please talk about this with your child's doctor, and your team. Most ear infections can be treated with medication or with careful observation.

If your child's doctor finds an ear infection, he or she may prescribe one or more medications for your child to take. Infections that don't go away with medication can be treated with a simple surgery that involves putting a tiny tube into the child's eardrum to drain the fluid out. Another type of conductive hearing loss is caused by a part of the outer or middle ear that did not form correctly while the baby was growing in the mother's womb. There are several parts of the outer and middle ear that need to work together to send sound to the inner ear. If any of these parts did not form correctly, there might be a hearing loss in that ear. This problem can be improved and perhaps even corrected with surgery. An ear, nose, and throat doctor is the health care professional who usually takes care of this problem. Placing a cochlear implant is also a type of surgery. Please go to the cochlear implants section for more information.
