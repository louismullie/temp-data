## Question

treatment of corneal abresion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of corneal abrasion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the evidence for topical antibiotics and how it differs by risk groups. Next, I will examine pain control options, including NSAIDs, cycloplegics, and the controversial topic of topical anesthetics. After that, I need to check the role of patching and bandage contact lenses. Then, I will review supportive care and follow-up. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, evidence-based algorithm with explicit uncertainties and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classify risk, because management hinges on both. I should stain with fluorescein and examine with a slit lamp to confirm the epithelial defect and measure size, document visual acuity, and screen for retained foreign body or rust ring, since retained material changes management and increases infection risk [^117KxVfQ]. I need to check for contact lens wear, immunocompromise, large defects, or contaminated exposures, as these factors elevate risk and shift antibiotic choices toward antipseudomonal coverage and closer follow-up [^117YXGr9] [^115HiSHQ]. Hold on, I should verify that small, uncomplicated abrasions in otherwise healthy patients may not require routine follow-up if symptoms resolve and vision is normal, but larger defects or high-risk features warrant reassessment at 24 hours [^117KxVfQ].

> Now, antibiotics. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before I overstate anything. The most recent Cochrane review concludes that evidence for routine antibiotic prophylaxis in traumatic corneal abrasion is very low certainty, so I cannot claim definitive benefit from antibiotics alone in all-comers, and one analysis even suggested a possible increase in infection with antibiotics versus placebo, though that finding is imprecise and likely biased [^113b32d2]. But hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; guideline bodies still recommend antibiotics in practice because of plausible infection prevention and the low risk of harm, especially in higher-risk groups, so I should reconcile this by aligning choices with risk and stewardship principles [^114psjwz] [^116aj8GN].

> For low-risk, small abrasions without contact lens use, I should consider a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic such as erythromycin ointment or chloramphenicol, acknowledging that the net benefit is uncertain but commonly recommended in primary care and ophthalmology guidance, and balance this with shared decision-making and follow-up plans [^114psjwz] [^116aj8GN]. For contact lens wearers or higher-risk exposures, I need to ensure antipseudomonal coverage with a fluoroquinolone like ciprofloxacin or moxifloxacin, or an aminoglycoside like tobramycin, and I should explicitly advise no contact lens wear during treatment to reduce keratitis risk [^117YXGr9] [^115Dz9G4] [^115HiSHQ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought tobramycin alone would suffice for all high-risk cases, but I should double-check that many guidelines prefer a fluoroquinolone monotherapy for convenience and spectrum, reserving fortified regimens for evolving ulcers rather than simple abrasions, so I will correct toward a quinolone-first approach in typical high-risk abrasions unless there are specific concerns warranting fortified therapy [^115HiSHQ].

> Next, pain control. Let me consider NSAIDs first because the signal is strongest. Multiple systematic reviews and guidelines support topical NSAIDs for analgesia in the first 24–48 hours, with reduced pain scores and decreased need for oral analgesics, and without clear evidence of delayed healing in simple abrasions, so I should offer diclofenac or ketorolac when available and appropriate [^1151F6x3] [^113a1F3T] [^114eNWey]. I should confirm that patients with corneal melting risk, neurotrophic corneas, or known NSAID hypersensitivity are exceptions where caution is warranted, even though high-quality exclusion data are limited [^1151F6x3].

> Cycloplegics are trickier. I need to check whether they help pain in uncomplicated abrasions. Evidence and guidelines suggest cycloplegics do not improve pain in simple abrasions, so I should avoid them routinely, but I will consider a short course of cyclopentolate for large abrasions or when there is concurrent traumatic iritis or significant photophobia and ciliary spasm, aligning with specialty guidance [^117KxVfQ] [^112ESrny] [^111Z5jen]. Hold on, I should verify that wilderness guidance sometimes recommends cycloplegics broadly; yes, WMS 2024 does, but I will interpret that as permissive rather than mandatory, tailoring use to clinical signs of ciliary spasm or iritis rather than applying it indiscriminately [^11785W4r].

> Topical anesthetics are the most controversial. My initial instinct is to avoid outpatient anesthetics due to epithelial toxicity and abuse risk, and traditional ophthalmology guidance advises against prescribing them for home use, which I should respect in routine practice [^113cuxwL]. But wait, let me reconsider the newer emergency medicine perspective: recent consensus from ACEP allows carefully restricted outpatient use, for example, 1.5–2 mL total of dilute tetracaine or proparacaine for up to 24 hours with strict return precautions and discard-after-use instructions, acknowledging that evidence quality is low and that close follow-up is essential [^112vBqST]. I should also note that Cochrane reviews find very low certainty for efficacy and safety of outpatient anesthetics, with signals of possible increased non-healing in trauma populations, so if I do dispense them, it must be with explicit counseling, limited quantity, and assured follow-up, and I should avoid use in patients at risk of misuse or with poor reliability [^115JGSoc] [^114yiuCv] [^116omwNB].

> Patching is a classic question. I should confirm that multiple randomized trials and Cochrane reviews show no benefit and possible harm from patching in simple abrasions, including delayed healing and loss of binocular vision, so I should not patch routine cases [^114psjwz] [^1174HynG] [^117KxVfQ]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions: in large abrasions, some guidelines suggest considering a therapeutic bandage contact lens with antibiotic coverage and short-duration use, but I need to ensure there is no retained foreign body and arrange close follow-up, and I should avoid patching in contact lens wearers due to increased keratitis risk [^117D2ENF] [^11785W4r] [^115BdaDc]. Let me double-check that wilderness guidance aligns with avoiding patching; yes, WMS 2024 also recommends against patching in corneal abrasion [^116f7jY2].

> Supportive care matters. I should recommend frequent preservative-free artificial tears during the day and a lubricating ointment at bedtime to reduce lid friction and discomfort, and advise sunglasses for photophobia, while emphasizing strict avoidance of eye rubbing and contact lens use during healing, which are practical steps that improve comfort without delaying healing [^111eGzb1] [^111ctqst] [^117H55N6]. I need to ensure patients understand activity restrictions and protective eyewear counseling to prevent recurrence, especially in occupational or high-exposure settings [^116EDHrW].

> Follow-up and red flags are critical. For small abrasions under 4 mm with normal vision and improving symptoms, follow-up may not be necessary if reliable, but I should arrange a 24-hour recheck for larger defects, high-risk features, or persistent pain, and instruct patients to return urgently for worsening pain, vision loss, purulent discharge, or corneal infiltrate, which could herald infection or ulceration [^117KxVfQ]. I should confirm that early presentation and treatment reduce progression to ulceration and improve outcomes, reinforcing the importance of timely reassessment and escalation if not improving as expected [^114jf4aV] [^114xTAbQ].

> Special populations require tailored decisions. In children, I should avoid patching because it interferes with activities and does not improve healing, using the same analgesic and antibiotic principles with weight-appropriate dosing and careful follow-up [^112TfJFK]. In perioperative patients, anesthesiology-led protocols using topical antibiotics, NSAIDs, cycloplegics, and lubrication can expedite care when ophthalmology is not immediately available, but I should verify that these are institutional pathways with defined referral triggers and safety checks [^116p12Mb] [^113ULyjw]. In resource-limited settings, early treatment at primary vision centers with antibiotics and lubrication reduces progression to ulceration and is cost-effective, so I should advocate for rapid access and telemedicine support where feasible [^113zw9Rs] [^113jyUdi].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I will double-check each step against the evidence as I go. Confirm the diagnosis with fluorescein and slit lamp, remove any foreign body, and stratify risk based on size, contact lens use, contamination, and immune status; for low-risk abrasions, offer a topical NSAID, consider a simple broad-spectrum antibiotic such as erythromycin ointment, provide lubricants and sunglasses, and arrange 24-hour follow-up if the defect is larger than 4 mm or symptoms persist; for high-risk or contact lens–related abrasions, use an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone, add a topical NSAID, consider a cycloplegic if there is ciliary spasm or iritis, avoid patching, and ensure close follow-up within 24 hours; reserve therapeutic bandage contact lenses for select large abrasions without retained material, with antibiotics and short-duration use only, and with explicit safety netting and follow-up [^117KxVfQ] [^1151F6x3] [^117YXGr9] [^111Z5jen] [^117D2ENF] [^11785W4r].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and communicate them clearly. The evidence base for antibiotic prophylaxis is low to very low certainty, so shared decision-making is important, especially in patients concerned about medication use; topical anesthetics remain controversial with conflicting guidance and very low certainty evidence, so if used at all, they should be limited in dose and duration with guaranteed follow-up; and while most simple abrasions heal within 24–72 hours, complications can occur, so explicit return precautions and timely reassessment are essential parts of safe care [^113b32d2] [^115JGSoc] [^112vBqST] [^117KxVfQ].

The cornerstone of corneal abrasion care is **topical antibiotics** to prevent infection, with **NSAIDs for pain** and strict avoidance of patching [^115HiSHQ] [^117KxVfQ]. Most abrasions heal within 24–72 hours; **follow-up in 24–48 hours** is essential for larger defects or contact lens wearers [^117KxVfQ]. Contact lens users need **antipseudomonal coverage** (e.g. fluoroquinolone) and must stop lens wear until fully healed [^115Dz9G4] [^117YXGr9]. Topical anesthetics are for diagnostic use only and should not be prescribed for home use due to toxicity and delayed healing risks [^113cuxwL] [^113mMCin]. Educate on strict hygiene, avoid eye rubbing, and use sunglasses for photophobia; refer urgently for **vision loss, corneal opacities, or non-healing defects** [^111ctqst] [^117KxVfQ].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Slit-lamp examination**: Confirm the diagnosis and assess abrasion size, depth, and location [^116GWqKv].

- **Fluorescein staining**: Identify epithelial defects and guide management [^117KxVfQ].

- **Foreign body assessment**: Remove any retained foreign material to prevent ongoing injury and infection [^117KxVfQ].

---

## Medical management

### Topical antibiotics

- **Routine prophylaxis**: Prescribe broad-spectrum topical antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin ointment, chloramphenicol) to prevent secondary bacterial infection [^116aj8GN] [^114psjwz].

- **Contact lens wearers**: Use antipseudomonal agents (e.g. fluoroquinolones) due to higher risk of Pseudomonas infection [^115Dz9G4] [^117KxVfQ].

- **Duration**: Typically 5–7 days, adjusted based on clinical response and healing [^notfound].

---

### Pain management

- **Topical NSAIDs**: Effective for pain relief and reduction of oral analgesic use (e.g. diclofenac, ketorolac) [^1151F6x3] [^113a1F3T].

- **Oral analgesics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for additional pain control if needed [^115RT9S7].

- **Cycloplegic agents**: Consider cyclopentolate for large abrasions or significant photophobia to reduce ciliary spasm [^111Z5jen].

---

### Avoidance of eye patching

Evidence shows **patching does not improve healing or pain** and may delay healing; therefore, it is not recommended [^116vTb33] [^112gDtHV].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

- **Lubricating eye drops**: Frequent use of preservative-free artificial tears to promote comfort and healing [^111eGzb1].

- **Sunglasses**: Reduce photophobia and discomfort [^11785W4r].

- **Eye protection**: Counsel on protective eyewear to prevent recurrence [^116EDHrW].

---

## Follow-up care

Arrange **re-evaluation within 24–48 hours** for larger abrasions (> 4 mm), contact lens wearers, or persistent symptoms [^notfound]. Most abrasions heal within 24–72 hours; persistent defects beyond this require further evaluation [^115N6v4o]. Educate patients on hygiene, avoidance of eye rubbing, and adherence to prescribed medications [^notfound].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Large or deep abrasions**: Involving the corneal stroma or with significant visual impairment [^117KxVfQ].

- **Non-healing defects**: Persistent epithelial defects beyond 72 hours [^notfound].

- **Corneal opacities or infiltrates**: Suggestive of infection or inflammation [^117KxVfQ].

- **Contact lens-related abrasions**: Due to higher risk of Pseudomonas infection [^117KxVfQ].

---

## Potential complications

- **Infection**: Corneal ulceration and keratitis, particularly in contact lens wearers [^117YXGr9].

- **Recurrent corneal erosion**: Repeated epithelial breakdown episodes [^notfound].

- **Vision loss**: Rare but possible with severe or untreated abrasions [^117KxVfQ].

---

## Special considerations

Contact lens wearers require **antipseudomonal antibiotics** and must discontinue lens use until complete healing [^115Dz9G4] [^117YXGr9]. Pediatric patients generally follow adult protocols, with careful attention to medication dosing and follow-up [^notfound]. Perioperative abrasions are managed with topical antibiotics, NSAIDs, and lubrication, with close monitoring [^112BU6vo].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Prevention focuses on **protective eyewear** during high-risk activities to reduce recurrence [^116EDHrW]. Reinforce strict adherence to prescribed medications and follow-up appointments [^117KxVfQ]. Educate patients to recognize and promptly report worsening symptoms or vision changes [^117KxVfQ].

---

Effective management of corneal abrasion centers on **topical antibiotics, NSAIDs, and avoidance of patching**, with close follow-up and patient education to prevent complications and recurrence.

Rationale

Corneal abrasion is a condition frequently treated by eye care professionals, emergency physicians, and primary care physicians. Topical ophthalmic antibiotics are the most common therapy for corneal abrasion. However, there has been no comprehensive summary and synthesis of the evidence regarding antibiotic prophylaxis in traumatic corneal abrasion. In this review update, we evaluated the current evidence regarding the benefits and harms of antibiotic treatment for this relatively common emergency condition. This is an update of a review published in 2022.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of topical antibiotic prophylaxis for corneal abrasion.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase.com, two other databases, and two trials registries together with reference checking to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was 28 March 2025.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an antibiotic with another antibiotic or with placebo in children and adults with corneal abrasion(s).

Outcomes

Outcomes included the following: risk of any ocular infection up to one month following corneal abrasion, proportion of eyes healed within 48 hours, participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 50% or more at 24 hours, loss of one or more lines of best-corrected visual acuity at one month, change in pain interference from baseline to 24 hours, complications of corneal abrasion, and treatment-related adverse events at the longest follow-up.

Risk Of Bias

Using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 2 tool, we assessed the RoB for the three reported outcomes.

Synthesis Methods

We synthesized results for each outcome using meta-analysis by calculating risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes where possible; otherwise, we summarized the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for prespecified outcomes.

Included Studies

We included four RCTs enrolling a total of 998 participants, ranging from 20 to 437 participants. The included studies were published from 1975 to 1998, and conducted in Denmark (1), the Republic of Korea (1), and the UK (2). The length of follow-up was 24 hours to four weeks, or unspecified in two studies. Two studies had industry support. Participants had a mean age of 35 years (range 5 to 80 years) in one study, while the other three studies reported age ranges from 15 to 64 years. Most participants had traumatic corneal abrasions, commonly following foreign body removal. Two studies compared topical antibiotics with placebo (vehicle ointment or sodium hyaluronic acid drops), while three studies compared chloramphenicol ointment with antibiotics from other classes. One study was a three-arm study that compared two antibiotic regimens and one vehicle control. We judged the risk of bias from one study as raising some concerns about two efficacy outcomes, and three studies as having a high risk of overall bias across three outcomes.

Synthesis Of Results

We classified study interventions into two comparisons: 1) antibiotics versus placebo, and 2) chloramphenicol versus other classes of antibiotics. Overall, we judged the certainty of evidence as very low for all outcomes due to imprecision, indirectness, and risk of bias. Two studies compared antibiotics with placebo. For one study, we combined the data for the sulfacetamide sodium and chloramphenicol ointment groups and compared them with a vehicle control group in a three-arm study. This study suggested that antibiotics may increase the risk of ocular infection (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.70; 1 study, 320 participants). The same study found little to no difference in healing within 48 hours (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00). Another study compared tobramycin with sodium hyaluronic acid and reported complete healing in most eyes by 48 hours, with no incidence of infection; however, the study was not included in the meta-analysis because of unit-of-analysis issues. One study reported severe allergic reactions to medication or other adverse events leading to participant withdrawal. The analysis showed no evidence of a difference in treatment-related adverse events between antibiotics and placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.47; 1 study, 437 participants). Another study reported no adverse events in both arms but was not included in the analysis because it was unclear how the outcomes were measured. Three studies compared chloramphenicol with other classes of antibiotics (fusidic acid or sulfacetamide sodium). The pooled analysis showed little to no difference in the risk of ocular infection within one month (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31; 3 studies, 651 participants). One study reported no positive cultures in either group, although minor inflammatory signs (e.g. conjunctival hyperemia) were noted in the chloramphenicol arm. For corneal healing within 48 hours, three studies assessed cure rates within 24 hours using slightly different definitions, but the pooled analysis again showed no clinically meaningful difference between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; 3 studies, 651 participants). Two studies found no evidence of a difference in the incidence of treatment-related adverse events between groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.17; 2 studies, 677 participants). Another study reported that one-third of participants in both groups experienced discomfort or itching, although these outcomes were not reported separately by each treatment arm. For both comparisons, none of the included studies reported the following prespecified outcomes: participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 50% or more at 24 hours, loss of one or more lines of best-corrected visual acuity at one month, change in pain interference from baseline to 24 hours, and complications of corneal abrasion up to the longest follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

Given that the evidence supporting antibiotic use in corneal abrasion is of very low certainty, we are not able to support a specific antibiotic regimen or draw conclusions about the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing ocular infection or accelerating epithelial healing. Future research could explore adequately powered RCTs or alternative approaches, such as target trial emulation, while focusing on high-risk populations and antibiotic formulations.

### Perioperative corneal abrasion: updated guidelines for prevention and management [^112BU6vo]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Corneal abrasion is the most common ocular complication in surgery. Treatment requires pain control, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and close monitoring. Pain improves significantly after 24 hours and should be resolved by 48 hours. Persistent, worsening, or new symptoms warrant immediate specialist consultation. The authors review the pathophysiology of perioperative corneal abrasion, and propose updated evidence-based guidelines for improved patient care.

### Patching for corneal abrasion [^116vTb33]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Published audits have demonstrated that corneal abrasions are a common presenting eye complaint. Eye patches are often recommended for treating corneal abrasions despite the lack of evidence for their use. This systematic review was conducted to determine the effects of the eye patch when used to treat corneal abrasions.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of patching for corneal abrasion on healing and pain relief.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to May 2016), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to May 2016), System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey) (January 1995 to May 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 9 May 2016. We also searched the reference lists of included studies, unpublished 'grey' literature and conference proceedings and contacted pharmaceutical companies for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared patching the eye with no patching to treat simple corneal abrasions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Investigators were contacted for further information regarding the quality of trials. The primary outcome was healing at 24, 48 and 72 hours while secondary outcomes included measures of pain, quality of life and adverse effects. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 12 trials which randomised a total of 1080 participants in the review. Four trials were conducted in the United Kingdom, another four in the United States of America, two in Canada, one in Brazil and one in Switzerland. Seven trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains and one trial was judged to be low risk of bias in all domains. The rest were a combination of low risk or unclear. People receiving a patch may be less likely to have a healed corneal abrasion after 24 hours compared to those not receiving a patch (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.00, 7 trials, 531 participants, low certainty evidence). Similar numbers of people in the patch and no-patch groups were healed by 48 hours (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02, 6 trials, 497 participants, moderate certainty evidence) and 72 hours (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05, 4 trials, 430 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Participants receiving a patch took slightly longer to heal but the difference was small and probably unimportant (mean difference (MD) 0.14 days longer, 95% CI 0 to 0.27 days longer, 6 trials, 642 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Ten trials reported pain scores. Most studies reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS). It was not possible to pool the data because it was skewed. In general, similar pain ratings were seen between patch and no-patch groups. Data from two trials reporting presence or absence of pain at 24 hours was inconclusive. There was a higher risk of reported pain in the patch group but wide confidence intervals compatible with higher or lower risk of pain (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.65, 2 trials, 193 participants, low certainty evidence). Five trials compared analgesic use between the patch and no-patch groups. Data from three of these trials could be combined and suggested similar analgesic use in the patch and no-patch groups but with some uncertainty (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.32, 256 participants, low certainty evidence). Frequently reported symptoms included photophobia, lacrimation, foreign body sensation and blurred vision but there was little evidence to suggest any difference in these symptoms in people with or without a patch. Activities of daily living (ADL) were assessed in one study involving children. There was little difference in ADL with the exception of walking which was reported to be more difficult with a patch on: VAS 1.7 cm (SD 2.1) versus 0.3 cm (SD 0.7). Complication rates were low across studies and there is uncertainty about the relative effects of patching or not patching with respect to these (RR 3.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 12.05, 8 trials, 660 participants, low certainty evidence). Three trials reporting rates of compliance to treatment found that 22% of participants did not have their eye patches during follow-up. No-patch groups generally received more adjuvant treatment with antibiotics or cycloplegics, or both, than the patch group. There were limited data on the effect of patching on abrasions greater than 10 mm² in size.

Authors' Conclusions

Trials included in this review suggest that treating simple corneal abrasions with a patch may not improve healing or reduce pain. It must be noted that, in these trials, participants who did not receive a patch were more likely to receive additional treatment, for example with antibiotics. Overall we judged the certainty of evidence to be moderate to low. Further research should focus on designing and implementing better quality trials and examining the effectiveness of patching for large abrasions.

### Evaluation and management of corneal abrasions [^117KxVfQ]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Corneal abrasions are commonly encountered in primary care. Patients typically present with a history of trauma and symptoms of foreign body sensation, tearing, and sensitivity to light. History and physical examination should exclude serious causes of eye pain, including penetrating injury, infective keratitis, and corneal ulcers. After fluorescein staining of the cornea, an abrasion will appear yellow under normal light and green in cobalt blue light. Physicians should carefully examine for foreign bodies and remove them, if present. The goals of treatment include pain control, prevention of infection, and healing. Pain relief may be achieved with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral analgesics. Evidence does not support the use of topical cycloplegics for uncomplicated corneal abrasions. Patching is not recommended because it does not improve pain and has the potential to delay healing. Although evidence is lacking, topical antibiotics are commonly prescribed to prevent bacterial superinfection. Contact lens-related abrasions should be treated with antipseudomonal topical antibiotics. Follow-up may not be necessary for patients with small (4 mm or less), uncomplicated abrasions; normal vision; and resolving symptoms. All other patients should be reevaluated in 24 hours. Referral is indicated for any patient with symptoms that do not improve or that worsen, a corneal infiltrate or ulcer, significant vision loss, or a penetrating eye injury.

### Patching for corneal abrasion [^1174HynG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Recent audits show that corneal abrasion is a common presenting eye complaint. Eye patches are often recommended for treating corneal abrasions despite the lack of evidence for their use. This systematic review was conducted to determine the effects of the eye patch when used to treat corneal abrasions.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to test the hypothesis that patching an eye following a corneal abrasion improves healing or provides pain relief.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) on The Cochrane Library (2005, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1980 to April 2005), LILACS (13 April 2005), NRR (2005, Issue 2) and SIGLE (December 2004). There were no language or date restrictions in the searches. We also searched the reference lists of included studies, unpublished 'grey' literature and conference proceedings and contacted pharmaceutical companies for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared patching the eye with no patching to treat simple corneal abrasions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted investigators for further information regarding quality of trials. The primary outcome was healing of the corneal epithelium and secondary outcomes were related to pain.

Main Results

Eleven trials, which randomised a total of 1014 participants, were included in the review. Meta-analysis of seven studies with dichotomous healing outcomes favoured no patching on the first day of healing (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.79 to 0.99). For days two and three there was no significant difference between the two groups. Of the nine trials that measured pain scores two favoured no patching and none favoured patching. Complication rates were low and no differences were noted in these between the two groups. No-patch groups generally received more adjuvant treatment with antibiotics and/or cycloplegics than the patch group which is an important confounding factor.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating simple corneal abrasions with a patch does not improve healing rates on the first day post-injury and does not reduce pain. In addition, use of patches results in a loss of binocular vision. Therefore it is recommended that patches should not be used for simple corneal abrasions. Further research should focus on large (greater than 10 mm²) abrasions.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^114jf4aV]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Early treatment of corneal abrasions is crucial in prevention of ulceration and thereby the cascade of the management of the corneal ulcer in patients and the cost borne by them, as proven by both prospective and retrospective analysis as well as scenario modelling. Increasing awareness with campaigns so that patients will act promptly when they develop corneal abrasions by accessing the local healthcare with early treatment, may help in prevention of ulcerations and improve clinical outcome at low cost and will avoid complex and expensive treatment thus preserving sight and reducing corneal blindness.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for corneal abrasion [^115hFczy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Corneal abrasion is a common disorder frequently faced by ophthalmologists, emergency physicians, and primary care physicians. Ocular antibiotics are one of the management options for corneal abrasion. A comprehensive summary and synthesis of the evidence on antibiotic prophylaxis in traumatic corneal abrasion is thus far unavailable, therefore we conducted this review to evaluate the current evidence regarding this important issue.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of topical antibiotic prophylaxis following corneal abrasion. Our objectives were 1) to investigate the incidence of infection with antibiotics versus placebo or alternative antibiotics in people with corneal abrasion; and 2) to investigate time to clinical cure, defined as complete healing (re-epithelialization) of the epithelium, with antibiotics versus placebo or alternative antibiotics in people with corneal abrasion.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (LILACS), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 25 April 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic with another antibiotic or placebo in children and adults with corneal abrasion due to any cause.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for the prespecified outcomes using the GRADE classification.

Main Results

Our search of the electronic databases yielded 8661 records. We screened 7690 titles and abstracts after removal of duplicates. We retrieved 32 full-text reports for further review. We included two studies that randomized a total of 527 eyes of 527 participants in the review. One study was conducted in Denmark, and one was conducted in India. The two studies did not examine most of our prespecified primary and secondary outcomes. The first study was a parallel-group RCT comparing chloramphenicol ocular ointment with fusidic acid ocular gels (frequency was not clearly reported). This study enrolled 153 participants older than 5 years of age with corneal abrasion in Denmark with a one-day follow-up duration. No participants had secondary infection in the fusidic acid group, whereas three (4.1%) participants in the chloramphenicol group had a slight reaction (risk ratio [RR] 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 2.79; 144 participants; very low certainty evidence). Thirty-one (44.3%) participants in the fusidic acid arm and 34 (46.6%) participants in the chloramphenicol arm were cured (defined as the area of abrasion zero and no infection) at day 1 (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.34; 144 participants; very low certainty evidence). Without providing specific data, the study reported that the degree of pain was not affected by the interventions received. The most common adverse events reported were itching and discomfort of the eye, which occurred in approximately one-third of participants in each group (low certainty evidence). A second multicenter, two-arm RCT conducted in India enrolled 374 participants older than 5 years of age with corneal abrasion who presented within 48 hours after injury. This study investigated the effect of a three-day course of either ocular ointment combinations of chloramphenicol-clotrimazole or chloramphenicol-placebo (all three times daily). At day 3, 169 (100%) participants in the chloramphenicol-clotrimazole arm and 203 (99%) out of 205 participants in the chloramphenicol-placebo arm were cured without any complication, defined as complete epithelialization of the cornea without evidence of infection (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.03; 374 participants; very low certainty evidence). Four participants assigned to the chloramphenicol-placebo arm experienced mild adverse events: two participants (1%) had mild chemosis and irritation, and two (1%) had small single sterile corneal infiltrates (low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Given the low to very low certainty of the available evidence, any beneficial effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing ocular infection or accelerating epithelial healing following a corneal abrasion remain unclear. Moreover, the current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. There is a need for a well-designed RCT assessing the efficacy and safety of ocular antibiotics in the treatment of corneal abrasion with a particular focus on high-risk populations and formulation of interventions.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^113zw9Rs]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Background

In low-and-middle income countries, corneal abrasions and ulcers are common and not always well managed. Previous studies showed better clinical outcomes with early presentation and treatment of minor abrasions, however, there have been no formal studies estimating the financial impact of early treatment of abrasions and ulcers compared to delayed treatment.

Methods

We used the LV Prasad Eye Institute's (LVPEI's) electronic health record system (eyeSmart) to estimate the impact of early presentation on clinical outcomes associated with abrasions and ulcers. 861 patients with corneal abrasion and 1821 patients with corneal ulcers were studied retrospectively, and 134 patients with corneal abrasion prospectively. A health economic model was constructed based on LVPEI cost data for a range of patient scenarios (from early presentation with abrasion to late presentation with ulcer).

Findings

Our findings suggest that delayed presentation of corneal abrasion results in poor clinical and economic outcomes due to increased risk of ulceration requiring more extensive surgical management, increasing associated costs to patients and the healthcare system. However, excellent results at low cost can be achieved by treatment of patients with early presentation of abrasions at village level health care centres.

Interpretation

Treatment of early minor corneal abrasions, particularly using local delivery of treatment, is effective clinically and economically. Future investment in making patients aware of the need to react promptly to corneal abrasions by accessing local healthcare resources (coupled with a campaign to prevent ulcerations occurring) will continue to improve clinical outcomes for patients at low cost and avoid complex and more expensive treatment to preserve sight.

Data collection and risk of bias

Authors independently extracted the following data from included studies: trial characteristics, methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, and source of funding. Two review authors independently applied the Cochrane's Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB2) toolto assess risk of bias in the efficacy outcome (pain control by 48 h) and the safety outcome (complications at the longest follow-up time). We judged each study that reported either outcome to have been at "low risk", "high risk" or raising some concerns for risk of bias. An overall Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) assessment of the certainty level of evidence was performed based on four main criteria: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision. We judged the certainty of evidence to be "high", "moderate", "low", or "very low" for the review outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by discussion within the author team.

Data analysis and synthesis

For the continuous outcome of pain assessment, we estimated the mean difference i (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous outcomes, we estimated the risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI. We estimated the risk difference (RD) with 95% CI for trials reporting no events in either treatment group.

To determine whether results could be combined in meta-analyses, we assessed the trials for clinical and methodological heterogeneity in trial design, eligibility of trial participants, intervention and comparator differences, and outcome definitions. We evaluated the amount of statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic outlined in the Cochrane Handbook.

Institutional review board approval was not required for this systematic review.

### Topical pain control for corneal abrasions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151F6x3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Corneal abrasions are common ophthalmic presentations to emergency departments. Among emergency physicians and ophthalmologists, there are highly variable practice patterns with regard to management of resultant pain and discomfort. The goal of this study was to review and analyze the efficacy and safety of topical pain therapies for corneal abrasions, including topical anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cycloplegics, steroids, pressure patching, and the use of a bandage contact lens (BCL).

Methods

The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was established a priori and published on PROSPERO (CRD42020201288). MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched until December 31, 2020. Primary studies comparing topical pain therapies to another therapy or control were included. Primary outcomes included percentage of corneal abrasions healed at 24, 48, and 72 hours, as well as pain control at 24 and 48 hours. Secondary outcomes included use of oral analgesia and incidence of complications. Risk of bias was assessed using validated tools. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology.

Results

Overall, 33 studies (31 randomized controlled trials [RCTs], two cohort studies) comprising 4,167 patients with corneal abrasions were analyzed. Only the data for topical NSAIDs were of adequate evidence from which to draw conclusions; topical NSAIDs demonstrated significantly reduced pain scores at 24 hours (standardized mean differences [SMD] -0.69, 95% CI = -0.98 to -0.41) and 48 hours (SMD = -0.56, 95% CI = -1.02 to -0.10) as well as 53% (95% CI = 34% to 67%) lower oral analgesia use compared to control. Based on available data, topical anesthetics, cycloplegics, patching, and the use of a BCL did not result in any significant difference in pain scores or use of oral analgesia, while no studies examined topical steroids. No interventions resulted in healing delays or significantly higher rates of complications compared to controls.

Conclusions

There was strong evidence to support that topical NSAIDs reduce pain associated with corneal abrasions in the first 48 hours and the need for oral analgesia. The existing evidence was insufficient to support or refute the use of topical anesthetics, cycloplegics, steroids, or BCL for pain control in corneal abrasions. Pressure patching was ineffective at pain reduction and may increase the risk of complications. Delays in healing or other complications were not significantly different between any intervention or control for simple, uncomplicated corneal abrasions; however, larger RCTs are required to identify any differences in rare complications.

Methods

Eligibility criteria for studies and outcomes of interest

We examined only randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Eligible trials compare topical ophthalmic anesthetics (amide or ester class) with a control group (placebo, non-treatment, or alternative treatment). Trials in which topical anesthetics with an NSAID were compared with a control group were eligible. We considered trials that enrolled participants of all ages with corneal abrasions within 48 h of presentation from accidental trauma or ophthalmic surgery.

The primary review outcomes were (1) mean reduction in self-reported pain on a visual analog scale (VAS), where smaller numbers represent less pain, at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment initiation; (2) the proportion of participants without complete resolution of epithelial defects by 24–72 h; and (3) the proportion of participants with adverse events (e.g. microbial keratitis or stromal infiltration, corneal stromal thinning, corneal perforation, surgical interventions) reported at the longest follow-up time of the study. For secondary outcomes, we considered treatment failure (the proportion of participants who required rescue oral analgesics by 72 h after treatment initiation) and quality of life assessed by a validated instrument at the longest follow-up time of the study. Trials were not excluded on the basis of outcome reporting.

Search methods for identifying studies

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase.com, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to identify potentially eligible RCTs for this review. We did not impose restrictions on the search date or language of publication. The last date of search was February 10, 2023.

Study selection

Pairs of review authors worked independently to review titles and abstracts as well as full-text records against the eligibility criteria; disagreements were resolved by discussion.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yiuCv]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite potential benefit, outpatient use of topical ophthalmic anesthetics can result in poor healing, infection, scar, and blindness. An unbiased analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is needed to examine their effectiveness and safety compared with placebo or other treatments for corneal abrasions.

Methods

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase.com, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched on February 10, 2023, without restriction on language or publication date. The published review protocol served as registration.

Results

Systematic review and meta-analysis of nine RCTs describing 314 participants with post-traumatic abrasions and 242 participants with post-surgical abrasions, with a median study length of 7 days (interquartile range, 7–14), show no evidence of a difference in pain control between anesthetics and placebo at 24 h in post-trauma cases. Self-reported pain at 24 h is reduced with anesthetics plus topical nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug in post-surgical participants (mean difference [MD], −5.72 on a 10-point scale; 95% CI, −7.35 to −4.09; 1 RCT; 30 participants) and at 48 h with anesthetics alone in post-trauma participants (MD, −5.68; 95% CI, −6.38 to −4.98; 1 RCT; 111 participants). Anesthetics are associated with 37% increased risk of non-healing defects (risk ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.78 to 2.42; 3 RCTs; 221 post-trauma participants). All evidence is of very low certainty. Over 50% of trials have an overall high risk of bias.

Conclusions

Available evidence is insufficient to support outpatient use of topical anesthetics for corneal abrasions with respect to pain, re-epithelialization, and complication risk.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^114T8LpU]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Corneal ulceration, which is easily countered by early diagnosis and treatment in the Western world, is considered a "silent epidemic" in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). The main cause of corneal ulcers varies with geographical locations: in developed countries it is typically associated with contact lens wear while in developing countries, corneal ulcers are often due to injury which primarily afflicts labourers involved in agriculture, manufacturing and domestic sectors.,

There is a growing body of published literature showing that treatment of early-stage corneal abrasions leads to good clinical results. If treatment is delayed, the abrasion can be infected (by bacteria, fungi, or parasites) and lead to corneal ulceration. Once the cornea is ulcerated, it develops corneal opacity that adversely affects vision. Delayed presentation of corneal ulcers can result in extensive damage to corneas with consequent loss of vision or loss of the eye.

Patients in LMIC face significant barriers in accessing eye care and infections are often treated only after severe delays, with unintended consequences. The health infrastructure is often poor or entirely lacking, and patients resort to using homemade remedies or traditional healers, thereby delaying the appropriate treatment, As a result, simple corneal abrasions rapidly progress into corneal infections. The patients affected suffer from pain, red and watery eyes and are therefore unable to work resulting in huge financial implications due to lost livelihood and treatment costs.

The LVPEI model of eye care comprises of a centre of excellence in Hyderabad located at the apex of a treatment pyramid. The next level has three tertiary eye care centres (TCs), each serving a population of 5m people (Figure 1). The third tier has twenty-two secondary centres (SCs) located in towns and smaller cities (within 350 km of a TC) predominantly providing basic surgical and diagnostic care, each serving a population of approximately 500,000 patients. A fourth layer of the pyramid consists of 217 primary vision centres (VCs) managed by a 'vision technician' and these are located in the village clusters, each serving approximately 50,000 people. These VCs are supported by the fifth layer, a network of 'vision guardians' (trained eye care volunteers who monitor the eye health of their community members).

### Use of topical anesthetics in the management of patients with simple corneal abrasions: consensus guidelines from the American College of Emergency Physicians [^112vBqST]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of corneal abrasions has largely excluded dispensing topical local anesthetics for home use due to concern for corneal toxicity. We have reviewed and critically appraised the available literature evidence regarding the use of topical anesthetics in patients with simple corneal abrasions. Using sequential Delphi review, we have developed these clinical guidelines. Herein are evidentiary summaries and consensus recommendations for 8 specific relevant questions. Our key observation is that for only simple corneal abrasions, as diagnosed and treated in accordance with the full protocol described herein, it appears safe to prescribe or otherwise provide a commercial topical anesthetic (ie, proparacaine, tetracaine, oxybuprocaine) for use up to every 30 minutes as needed during the first 24 hours after presentation, as long as no more than 1.5 to 2 mL total (an expected 24-hour supply) is dispensed and any remainder is discarded after 24 hours. Importantly, although published findings suggest absent harm for short courses, more rigorous studies with a greater cumulative sample size and ophthalmologic follow-up are needed.

### Evidence-based emergency medicine. update: do ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the pain associated with simple corneal abrasion without delaying healing? [^116zYjxq]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Some studies have suggested that ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease the pain associated with corneal abrasions without impairing healing. This evidence-based emergency medicine (EBEM) critical appraisal reviews the literature, including additional studies appearing since the publication of an earlier EBEM review in 1999.

Methods

The updated search for randomized controlled trials from 1999 to 2002 complemented the previous 1966 to 1999 search. The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed. Qualitative methods were used to summarize the study results.

Results

The search identified 3 studies not included in the previously published review of ophthalmic NSAIDs, yielding a total of 5 blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving NSAIDs for corneal abrasions. The methodologic quality of the new studies was somewhat higher than that of the 2 original studies and was rated as "good" to "strong". The qualitative summary indicates that NSAIDs provide greater pain relief and improvement of other subjective symptoms when compared with placebo. However, whether the reduction of pain, as measured by visual analog pain scales, exceeds the minimal clinically significant difference is equivocal. The use of ophthalmic NSAIDs may decrease the need for sedating analgesics.

Conclusion

Ophthalmic NSAIDs appear to be useful for decreasing pain in patients with corneal abrasions who can afford the medication and who must return to work immediately, particularly where potential opioid-induced sedation is intolerable.

Methods and data

Corneal abrasion and ulcer pathway

Pathways for management of corneal abrasions and corneal ulcers were developed to identify the key outcomes and cost data that needed to be captured from LVPEI. A detailed pathway for disease progression of corneal abrasion was developed in consultation with clinical experts and this detailed pathway was then consolidated to streamline the outcomes and treatment regimens. Figure 2 shows a simplified overview of outcomes identified in the management of corneal abrasions and ulcers.

Figure 2
Corneal abrasion and ulcer pathway. Healing of corneal abrasion with medical management only, on worsening to corneal ulcer which either heals with medical management only or may need in addition to the medical management, Tissue adhesive and bandage contact lens application (TABCL), or therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK), or evisceration.

All patients with abrasions could either heal with topical treatment or worsen to corneal ulcers, which could also heal with topical treatment. The current practice for management of patients presenting with abrasion is to use topical antibiotics and with corneal ulcers is to use topical antibiotics and antifungal treatments (which include topical ciprofloxacin, fortified cefazolin, atropine, natamycin and oral ketoconazole), with the dosage and duration depending on the stage of the disease as outlined in the Appendix. Patients with corneal ulcers which do not heal need surgical procedures such as tissue adhesive and bandage contact lenses (TABCL) for treating thinning of the cornea or small perforations, therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK) for treating large perforations or larger ulcers, or even evisceration if the infection is too widespread in the eye and the eye is not salvageable.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^111p4NSs]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Corneal ulceration is a disease that begins as a simple minor trauma or abrasion but can finally end up with unnecessary and often prolonged physical and financial suffering and is of concern in the population that has limited resources to take care of this problem. Corneal infection in developing nations is estimated to be 10 times more than in developed nations. This being a major and large unmet global health need, WHO has estimated 1.5–2.0 million new cases of unilateral blindness each year worldwide. Despite the high incidence and the poor outcomes, preventative strategies are not common. Whilst use of eye protection during labour is recommended, it is typically not used in India and LMICs, so early diagnosis and treatment is currently the most effective strategy. The underlying objective is to prevent corneal abrasions becoming ulcers, identifying abrasions and initiating appropriate treatment can prevent infection and further referrals to distant higher centres. Also, liberal use of antibiotics is known to cause the rise of anti-microbial resistance and may make future treatment challenging.

With the extensive patient population managed through the LVPEI pyramidal model which has invested in training of village-based eye care workers then the cost is spread across a large patient population. This improves affordability, whereas the costs would be higher in sparsely populated settings or if the incidence of corneal abrasions were lower. In other words, this model of investing in training of low-skilled technical staff distributed to be village based, developed in response to perceived clinical need, is working both clinically and economically.

The LVPEI pyramidal model suggests that patients being treated at the early abrasion stage minimises the costs and achieves good health outcomes. However, delayed treatment, due to some not seeking health care until abrasions become ulcers, results in substantial financial implications with potentially serious health consequences. As the VCs are equipped with teleconsultations facilities, unnecessary travel and loss of income for patients and their families is prevented. The important role played by vision guardians and community health workers with relatively little training is highlighted in this study. They can also play a crucial role to increase awareness among such patients, where the incidence of corneal abrasions in the population is high, other LMICs can follow the LVPEI model and reach out to patients in their local settings.

### Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for analgesia in traumatic corneal abrasions [^117Jxk2f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic corneal abrasions are relatively common and there is a lack of consensus about analgesia in their management. It is therefore important to document the clinical efficacy and safety profile of topical ophthalmic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the management of traumatic corneal abrasions.

Objectives

To identify and evaluate all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of topical NSAIDs with placebo or any alternative analgesic interventions in adults with traumatic corneal abrasions (including corneal abrasions arising from foreign body removal), to reduce pain, and its effects on healing time.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 30 March 2017), Embase Ovid (1947 to 30 March 2017), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (1982 to 30 March 2017), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/); searched 30 March 2017, ZETOC (1993 to 30 March 2017), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 30 March 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 30 March 2017 and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 30 March 2017. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We checked the reference lists of identified trials to search for further potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing topical NSAIDs to placebo or any alternative analgesic interventions in adults with traumatic corneal abrasions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed risks of bias in the included studies. We rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included nine studies that met the inclusion criteria, reporting data on 637 participants. The studies took place in the UK, USA, Israel, Italy, France and Portugal. These studies compared five types of topical NSAIDs (0.1% indomethacin, 0.03% flurbiprofen, 0.5% ketorolac, 1% indomethacin, 0.1% diclofenac) to control (consisting of standard care and in four studies used placebo eye drops). Overall, the studies were at an unclear or high risk of bias (particularly selection and reporting bias). None of the included studies reported the primary outcome measures of this review, namely participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 30% or more or 50% or more at 24 hours. Four trials, that included data on 481 participants receiving NSAIDs or control (placebo/standard care), reported on the use of 'rescue' analgesia at 24 hours as a proxy measure of pain control. Topical NSAIDs were associated with a reduction in the need for oral analgesia compared with control (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.61; low-certainty evidence). Approximately 4 out of 10 people in the control group used rescue analgesia at 24 hours. No data were available on the use of analgesia at 48 or 72 hours. One trial (28 participants) reported on the proportion of abrasions healed after 24 and 48 hours. These outcomes were similar in both arms of the trial. (at 24 hours RR 1.00 (0.81 to 1.23); at 48 hours RR 1.00 (0.88 to 1.14); low-certainty evidence). In the control group nine out of 10 abrasions were healed within 24 hours and all were healed by 48 hours. Complications of corneal abrasions were reported in 6 studies (609 participants) and were infrequently reported (4 complications, 1 in NSAID groups (recurrent corneal erosion) and 3 in control groups (2 recurrent corneal erosions and 1 corneal abscess), very low-certainty evidence). Possible drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in two trials (163 participants), with the number of adverse events low (4 AEs, 3 in NSAID group, including discomfort/photophobia on instillation, conjunctival hyperaemia and urticaria, and 1 in the control group, corneal abscess) very low-certainty evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of the included studies do not provide strong evidence to support the use of topical NSAIDs in traumatic corneal abrasions. This is important, since NSAIDs are associated with a higher cost compared to oral analgesics. None of the trials addressed our primary outcome measure of participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 30% or more or 50% or more at 24 hours.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128Sczb]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasions, loss of the corneal epithelium, can occur from trauma, ocular surgery, dryness, and exposure. They account for 13% of eye-related emergency department visits in the US, with an annual incidence of 3 per 1000 persons and a higher male prevalence –. Traumatic abrasions present with symptoms like pain, photophobia, redness, and tearing. As the cornea is one of the most highly innervated tissues in the body, corneal nociceptors, especially mechanoreceptors, contribute to intense eye pain until healing occurs. Although most small to medium-sized corneal abrasions heal within a few days, complications like corneal erosions and infection may require medical or surgical intervention. In contrast, post-surgical corneal epithelial defects benefit from a sterile field and controlled wound construction.

In medicine, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anesthetic drugs are used for localized analgesia with limited systemic effects. However, numerous case reports describe ophthalmic complications from use of high concentrations of topical anesthetics, at excessive frequency, or for prolonged periods of time, including corneal infiltrate, stromal keratolysis ("melt"), endothelial injury, and perforation – – all of which can lead to vision loss. Recent emergency department studies have deemed outpatient use of prescribed topical anesthetics as safe and effective for corneal abrasions –. This assessment contrasts with the experience of ophthalmologists –, leading to renewed questions about outpatient anesthetic use. The lack of consensus guidelines may account for variations in practice within and across specialties –.

The main objective of this summary of our Cochrane systematic review is to report the comparative effectiveness and safety of topical ophthalmic anesthetics compared with placebo or other treatments for corneal abrasions of any etiology, based on the best available evidence. The published review protocol served as registration (Available at: 10.1002/14651858.CD015091).

In nine eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) describing 556 participants with corneal abrasions from traumatic or surgical origin, we find insufficient evidence to support outpatient use of topical ophthalmic anesthetics compared with placebo for reducing pain, improving re-epithelialization, or reducing complication risk in corneal abrasions.

### Management of corneal abrasions [^115N6v4o]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Corneal abrasions result from cutting, scratching, or abrading the thin, protective, clear coat of the exposed anterior portion of the ocular epithelium. These injuries cause pain, tearing, photophobia, foreign body sensation, and a gritty feeling. Symptoms can be worsened by exposure to light, blinking, and rubbing the injured surface against the inside of the eyelid. Visualizing the cornea under cobalt-blue filtered light after the application of fluorescein can confirm the diagnosis. Most corneal abrasions heal in 24 to 72 hours and rarely progress to corneal erosion or infection. Although eye patching traditionally has been recommended in the treatment of corneal abrasions, multiple well-designed studies show that patching does not help and may hinder healing. Topical mydriatics also are not beneficial. Initial treatment should be symptomatic, consisting of foreign body removal and analgesia with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral analgesics; topical antibiotics also may be used. Corneal abrasions can be avoided through the use of protective eyewear.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^116p12Mb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasions (CAs) are the most common ocular injuries in the perioperative period, occurring at an incidence typically between 0.013% and 0.17% of non-ocular surgeries.–Although most are minor and involve only the surface epithelium, they still produce considerable discomfort. Generally, symptoms of CA are recognized between 1 hour and 3 hours following the conclusion of anesthesia, at which point an ophthalmologist is consulted to care for the injury. At community hospitals where ophthalmologists are not readily available, patients have to wait before receiving treatment. Undoubtedly, this prolonged waiting period may lead to unnecessary suffering and dissatisfaction.

For most patients, a combination of eye drops is the most effective method for healing CAs. Given this regimen's simplicity, requiring that patients wait to see a specialist for the care of CAs seems especially unnecessary. Hence, to lessen the time between symptom onset and treatment – and in turn patient suffering and dissatisfaction – an anesthesiology-based protocol for the management of minor CAs identified in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) was developed with input from ophthalmology (Figure 1). This protocol became the standard approach at our institution. The current study sought to assess the effectiveness of this anesthesiology-based protocol, as well as clarify the incidence of CA and examine some of its associated risk factors.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^11114msJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, our data support the concept that anesthesiologists, with minimal training in examining the cornea, can safely and effectively manage simple CAs in the perioperative period, so long as they use proper selection criteria to refer difficult problems early and employ persistent follow-up. In an operative setting where ophthalmologists are generally not immediately available, the anesthesiology-led protocol we devised provides for early diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Having our protocol in place also obviates the need to have an ophthalmologist see the patients, reducing cost of care. Hence, this program, in conjunction with ophthalmology support, has allowed for timely and effective care to the small portion of individuals exhibiting symptoms of CA within our institution.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^112EuSeE]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Four studies analyze abrasions of traumatic etiology in 314 participants (314 eyes). Most abrasions involve corneal foreign bodies (47%; 148 eyes) or direct trauma (19%; 61 eyes). Five studies describe 242 participants (256 eyes) with post-surgical corneal defects, four from photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), and one from pterygium surgery. Overall, the median study length is 7 days (IQR, 7–14 days) with a median of 11 days (IQR, 7–18 days) for post-trauma trials and 7 days (IQR, 3–7 days) for post-surgical trials. Overall, the median treatment duration is 24 h (IQR, 24–168 h) with a median of 36 h (IQR, 24–78 h) for post-trauma trials and 24 h (IQR, 24–168 h) for post-surgical trials.

Two (67%) of the three trials describing ocular pain results have an overall high risk of bias. Five (71%) of the seven trials describing ocular complications have an overall high risk of bias, primarily from missing outcome data and selective reporting of results.

### Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for corneal abrasions: meta-analysis of randomized trials [^112U9GCf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in traumatic corneal abrasions.

Methods

This was a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966–2004), EMBASE (1980–2004), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Systematic Reviews (first quarter 2004). The structured search strategy included a RCT filter and the terms "cornea", "wounds and injuries", "trauma", "corneal diseases", "eye injuries", "anti-inflammatory agents, nonsteroidal" and specific trade names of topical NSAIDs. In addition, four journals in ophthalmology and emergency medicine were hand searched. Two authors independently reviewed citations from the literature searches. To be included, studies had to be RCTs evaluating topical NSAIDs in traumatic corneal abrasions. Trials were included regardless of language or whether they were unpublished or published. Exclusion criteria were corneal ulcers, nonrandomized studies, animal studies, or perioperative setting. Outcomes were pain scale scores at 24 hours and adverse effects. Two independent reviewers assessed four trial quality components: randomization, double blinding, reporting of withdrawals, and concealment of allocation. Weighted mean difference, using a random effects model, was calculated.

Results

Of the 200 citations identified, 11 RCTs met inclusion criteria. Eight trials were identified from the MEDLINE search, two from the EMBASE search, and one from conference proceedings. Seven trials enrolled fewer than 100 patients, and more than half of the studies were conducted in Europe. Five trials reported suitable data for analysis. The overall weighted mean difference for 459 patients was a reduction in pain by 1.30 points (95% confidence interval = -1.56 to -1.03) on the pain scale. Five of the trials met criteria for good quality. Transient stinging was a commonly noted adverse effect.

Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs are effective analgesics for traumatic corneal abrasions.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^112xxMTs]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show the costs and outcomes of early management of corneal abrasions and to show the increasing cost and the complexity of the management as the delay increases. We developed a de novo model to estimate the costs and clinical outcomes of different scenarios for diagnosis and treatment of corneal ulcer. The model is based on robust prospective and retrospective data from a large representative sample of LVPEI patients in different treatment settings. Furthermore, cost data was based on bottom-up costing for the different health care and patient costs, based on the type of treatment and the treatment setting. Data analysis suggested that the clinical outcomes are better when patients present early, and when the ulcers are small. Scenario modelling showed clearly that the best outcomes and lowest costs are when patients present early at the abrasion stage and the costs when patients present with ulcers are substantially higher along with poorer outcomes, especially when presenting late with large ulcers at TCs.

Our study confirms previous findings that patients who present early with small abrasions experience a better clinical outcome than those presenting late with infected ulcers. Upadhyay et al. performed a two-year study on 34,902 individuals in Nepal and reported that prophylactic antibiotics after corneal abrasion can help avoid corneal ulceration (with only 4% of the patients developing ulcers which is similar to the rates observed in our study), with earlier treatment associated with better clinical outcomes similar to the findings in our study. Getshen et al. have reported no cases of ulceration in Bhutan, when the abrasions were treated within 48 hours with antibiotics. Similar findings were reported from Burma when topical antifungal and antibacterial were combined and no ulcers were reported. Srinivasan et al. have reported a similar regimen used in South India looking at topical antibiotics and a placebo group and compared with topical antibiotics and antifungals and reported healing in 98.5% of patients with few having adverse events and two developed infiltrates in the placebo group which were microbiologically sterile and managed with Natamycin eye drops. Recent studies by Srinivasan et al. and O'Brien et al. did not find any difference in the reduction of the incidence of corneal ulceration in community-based corneal ulcer prevention programme. Whilst our study was not randomized, given the sample size in our study and the broad catchment area (LVPEI covers fours states of India and has patients reporting from all over the country), we believe LVPEI is representative of the general population in India.

### Interventions for recurrent corneal erosions [^115pp2st]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent corneal erosion is a common cause of disabling ocular symptoms and predisposes the cornea to infection. It may follow corneal trauma. Measures to prevent the development of recurrent corneal erosion following corneal trauma have not been firmly established. Once recurrent corneal erosion develops simple medical therapy (standard treatment) may lead to resolution of the episode. However some patients continue to suffer when such therapy fails and once resolved further episodes of recurrent erosion may occur. A number of treatment and prophylactic options are then available but there is no agreement as to the best option.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic and treatment regimens for recurrent corneal erosion.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS in June 2007. The NRR was searched in April 2005. We also contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared a prophylactic or treatment regimen with another prophylaxis/ treatment or no prophylaxis/ treatment for patients with recurrent corneal erosion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

Five randomised and one quasi-randomised controlled trial were included in the review. The trials were heterogenous and of poor quality. Safety data presented were incomplete. For the treatment of recurrent corneal erosion there was limited evidence that oral tetracycline 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks or topical prednisolone 0.5% four times daily for one week or both in addition to standard treatment; and excimer laser ablation in addition to mechanical debridement may be effective. Therapeutic contact lens wear was inferior to lubricant drops and ointment in abolishing the symptoms of recurrent corneal erosion and had a high complication rate. For prophylaxis of further episodes of recurrent corneal erosion there was no difference in the occurrence of objective signs of recurrent erosion between hypertonic saline ointment versus tetracycline ointment or lubricating ointment. Lubricating ointment at night in addition to standard treatment following traumatic corneal abrasion (erosion) caused by fingernail injury to prevent recurrence led to increased symptoms of recurrent corneal erosion compared to standard therapy alone.

Authors' Conclusions

Well-designed masked randomised controlled trials using standardised methods are needed to establish the benefits of new and existing prophylactic and treatment regimes for recurrent corneal erosion.

### Perioperative corneal abrasions after nonocular surgery: a systematic review [^116jqats]. Cornea (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To perform a systematic review of the international literature evaluating the risk factors, preventative steps, and treatments for perioperative corneal injuries for nonocular surgery.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews databases were searched on April 13, 2018. Two hundred four articles were identified with 16 meeting the inclusion criteria. All studies were evaluated for quality and level of evidence. Two types of studies were included. The first were primary epidemiological studies that looked at the rates of perioperative corneal injuries after nonocular surgery and the second were trials that either studied preventative steps or treatments.

Results

A statistical analysis was completed to reveal trends in perioperative corneal abrasions. Rates ranged from 0.01% to 59% with a cumulative rate of 0.64% (95% confidence interval 0.36%-1.35%). Primary risk factors were identified as longer procedures, general anesthesia, and advanced age. The most commonly associated ocular injuries were found to include chemical injury, conjunctivitis, blurred vision, and conjunctival congestion. Treatment strategies for corneal abrasion in the literature recommended erythromycin ointment and ample ocular lubrication for the fastest recovery. Education interventions alone, as studied in 2 of the 16 articles, demonstrated a significant decrease in the rate of corneal abrasions.

Conclusions

Standardized ocular protection, reporting, and education initiatives were found to maximally decrease rates of perioperative corneal abrasions after nonocular surgery. However, no gold standard currently exists for intraoperative ocular protection. More research needs to be conducted on specific prevention strategies and content of educational initiatives in hopes of standard development across facilities nationwide.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^1163zNrw]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Corneal abrasions from trauma or epithelial defects created during ophthalmic surgery occur commonly. In this review of nine RCTs in which a total of 556 participants with corneal abrasions are analyzed, we compare the safety and efficacy of topical ophthalmic anesthetic with or without NSAID versus placebo or NSAID. The evidence is of very low certainty for any difference between topical anesthetic and placebo in pain control, healing, or outcomes suggestive of anesthetic abuse. The main reasons for this level of certainty are small sample sizes and an overall high risk of bias. Use of anesthetic eye drops without close monitoring or attention to the amount dispensed (in one trial, 40 mL was prescribed for outpatient use)creates a potential for serious ocular complications. Such sequelae may not be observed in trials with short follow-up or with high participant drop-out, characteristics of several trials in this review.

Given the number of abrasions evaluated in emergency departments (EDs) each year, investigators should plan for larger sample sizes and a longer duration of follow-up, perhaps having a follow-up ophthalmic examination to confirm lack of recurrent erosion or contact lens-related keratitis. These two conditions also present with disruption of the corneal epithelium but require ophthalmic care. Because most abrasions heal within a few days with just a topical antibiotic, high participant attrition in any such trial is anticipated, yet the dangers of anesthetic use increase with lack of monitoring, longer duration of use, higher concentration, or more frequent dosing than prescribed. For a self-limited condition, the risk of blindness from corneal melt, infection, or perforation — all findings of topical anesthetic abuse — must be weighed against any possible benefit.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^11785W4r]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corneal abrasion — field management emphasizes topical therapy, pain control, and avoiding patching, with graded recommendations provided. Corneal abrasions in the wilderness should be treated with topical antibiotics (such as erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment 1 cm every 8 h), cycloplegics (such as atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 h), NSAIDs (such as ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 6 h), and frequent use of artificial tears; sunglasses may help reduce photophobia, but there is no evidence to support eye patching, and bandage soft contact lenses should be used only if there is no retained corneal foreign body, they are used with a prophylactic topical antibiotic drop, and they are removed within 24 to 48 h. Topical anesthetic eye drops provide acute relief but prolonged use should be avoided because they are potentially toxic to the corneal epithelium; a recent randomized trial of tetracaine versus saline for uncomplicated abrasions concluded there was no significant difference in corneal healing with an overall patient perception of improved pain control. Recommendation grades include: Topical antibiotics — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Cycloplegics — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; NSAIDs — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Artificial tears — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Sunglasses — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Avoidance of patching — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Emergent evacuation for open globe or deep epithelial defects — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions [^115JGSoc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite potential analgesic benefits from topical ophthalmic amides and esters, their outpatient use has become of concern because of the potential for abuse and ophthalmic complications.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of topical ophthalmic anesthetics compared with placebo or other treatments in persons with corneal abrasions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase.com; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), without restriction on language or year of publication. The search was performed on 10 February 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of topical ophthalmic anesthetics alone or in combination with another treatment (e.g. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) versus a non-anesthetic control group (e.g. placebo, non-treatment, or alternative treatment). We included trials that enrolled participants of all ages who had corneal abrasions within 48 hours of presentation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We included nine parallel-group RCTs with a total of 556 participants (median number of participants per study: 45, interquartile range (IQR) 44 to 74), conducted in eight countries: Australia, Canada, France, South Korea, Turkey, New Zealand, UK, and USA. Study characteristics and risk of bias Four RCTs (314 participants) investigated post-traumatic corneal abrasions diagnosed in the emergency department setting. Five trials described 242 participants from ophthalmology surgery centers with post-surgical corneal defects: four from photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and one from pterygium surgery. Study duration ranged from two days to six months, the most common being one week (four RCTs). Treatment duration ranged from three hours to one week (nine RCTs); the majority were between 24 and 48 hours (five RCTs). The age of participants was reported in eight studies, ranging from 17 to 74 years of age. Only one participant in one trial was under 18 years of age. Of four studies that reported funding sources, none was industry-sponsored. We judged a high risk of bias in one trial with respect to the outcome pain control by 48 hours, and in five of seven trials with respect to the outcome complications at the furthest time point. The domain for which we assessed studies to be at the highest risk of bias was missing or selective reporting of outcome data. Findings The treatments investigated included topical anesthetics compared with placebo, topical anesthetic compared with NSAID (post-surgical cases), and topical anesthetics plus NSAID compared with placebo (post-surgical cases). Pain control by 24 hours In all studies, self-reported pain outcomes were on a 10-point scale, where lower numbers represent less pain. In post-surgical trials, topical anesthetics provided a moderate reduction in self-reported pain at 24 hours compared with placebo of 1.28 points on a 10-point scale (mean difference (MD) -1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.76 to -0.80; 3 RCTs, 119 participants). In the post-trauma participants, there may be little or no difference in effect (MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.02; 1 RCT, 76 participants). Compared with NSAID in post-surgical participants, topical anesthetics resulted in a slight increase in pain at 24 hours (MD 0.82, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.63; 1 RCT, 74 participants). One RCT compared topical anesthetics plus NSAID to placebo. There may be a large reduction in pain at 24 hours with topical anesthetics plus NSAID in post-surgical participants, but the evidence to support this large effect is very uncertain (MD -5.72, 95% CI -7.35 to -4.09; 1 RCT, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Pain control by 48 hours Compared with placebo, topical anesthetics reduced post-trauma pain substantially by 48 hours (MD -5.68, 95% CI -6.38 to -4.98; 1 RCT, 111 participants) but had little to no effect on post-surgical pain (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.45 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 44 participants), although the evidence is very uncertain. Pain control by 72 hours One post-surgical RCT showed little or no effect of topical anesthetics compared with placebo by 72 hours (MD 0.49, 95% CI -0.06 to 1.04; 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Proportion of participants with unresolved epithelial defects When compared with placebo or NSAID, topical anesthetics increased the number of participants without complete resolution of defects in trials of post-trauma participants (risk ratio (RR) 1.37, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.42; 3 RCTs, 221 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The proportion of placebo-treated post-surgical participants with unresolved epithelial defects at 24 to 72 hours was lower when compared with those assigned to topical anesthetics (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.55; 1 RCT, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or topical anesthetics plus NSAID (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.85; 1 RCT, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Proportion of participants with complications at the longest follow-up When compared with placebo or NSAID, topical anesthetics resulted in a higher proportion of post-trauma participants with complications at up to two weeks (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.23 to 5.46; 3 RCTs, 242 participants) and post-surgical participants with complications at up to one week (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 128.02; 1 RCT, 44 participants). When topical anesthetic plus NSAID was compared with placebo, no complications were reported in either treatment arm up to one week post-surgery (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.12; 1 RCT, 30 participants). The evidence is very uncertain for safety outcomes. Quality of life None of the included trials assessed quality of life outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite topical anesthetics providing excellent pain control in the intraoperative setting, the currently available evidence provides little or no certainty about their efficacy for reducing ocular pain in the initial 24 to 72 hours after a corneal abrasion, whether from unintentional trauma or surgery. We have very low confidence in this evidence as a basis to recommend topical anesthetics as an efficacious treatment modality to relieve pain from corneal abrasions. We also found no evidence of a substantial effect on epithelial healing up to 72 hours or a reduction in ocular complications when we compared anesthetics alone or with NSAIDs versus placebo.

### An audit of corneal abrasion management following the introduction of local guidelines in an accident and emergency department [^116ekUui]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Corneal abrasions are a common presentation to accident and emergency (A&E) departments. Patients can be treated and discharged by A&E staff without the need for an ophthalmologist's attention; complicated cases, however, should be recognised and referred. Inexperience and limited training in ophthalmology may lead to suboptimal patient care and inappropriate use of ophthalmology outpatient clinics. Issues of poor documentation may also arise. The purpose of this audit was to assess the effect of guidelines on the management of corneal abrasion by A&E staff.

Methods

A retrospective case note audit was performed to assess current management of corneal abrasions. Guidelines for management of corneal abrasions were formulated following a literature search and collaboration between A&E and ophthalmology staff. A prospective case note audit was undertaken to assess management after introduction of the guidelines.

Results

A total of 51 cases were audited before the introduction of the guidelines and 57 cases after. Following the introduction of the guidelines documentation of visual acuity increased to 93% and specific enquiry into contact lens wear rose from 35.3% to 71.9%. A&E staff stopped giving out local anaesthetic eye drops. The follow up profile also improved; appropriate patient discharges increased by 40% whereas inappropriate referrals to eye clinic dropped by 75%. More patients were given abrasion advice (a 101% increase).

Conclusions

A&E staff members are capable of managing corneal abrasions if they are given guidance and some training. This audit identified shortcomings in current management and showed that guidelines can significantly improve clinical practice.

Topical anesthetics are used in the emergency department (ED) to relieve eye pain and allow eye examinations in patients with corneal abrasions. There is concern for delayed corneal healing, which is associated with the long-term use of topical anesthetics, so outpatient use is not recommended.

Objectives

We sought to systematically study the effectiveness and complications associated with the short-term use of topical anesthetics (≤ 72 hours) in the management of patients presenting to EDs with corneal abrasions.

Methods

Four electronic databases were searched from inception of the database until April 2014. We included studies of patients > 16 years of age who were using topical anesthetics for < 72 hours. Postoperative cases were not included.

Results

A total of 140 patients (68 in the intervention group and 72 in the control group) from 2 randomized trials were included in the analysis. Comparing control patients who did not use topical anesthetics to study patients who did use topical anesthetics, this meta-analysis found no significant difference in pain scores (standardized mean difference -1.01 [95% confidence interval {CI} -2.39 to 0.38), corneal healing (OR 1.31 [95% CI 0.53–3.27), or persistent symptoms (OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.06–16.69). The 2 trials reported no adverse effects.

Conclusion

There were no differences regarding pain, persistent symptoms, or corneal healing when comparing short-term use of topical anesthetics to placebo in the treatment of corneal abrasion. Data on safety are sparse, and the use of this treatment is currently not supported by evidence.

### The safety of topical anesthetics in the treatment of corneal abrasions: a review [^113v6fAv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the fact that topical anesthetics provide superb analgesia to the painful eye, they are not prescribed routinely to patients when they are discharged from the emergency department because of concerns for delayed healing and corneal erosion.

Objective

To summarize the evidence for the safety of topical proparacaine and tetracaine for pain relief in patients with corneal abrasions.

Methods

This is a systematic review looking at the use of topical anesthetic agents in the treatment of corneal abrasions in the emergency department.

Results

Our literature search produced two emergency department-based, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled studies on human patients with corneal abrasions. Additionally, we found four studies that investigated the application of topical anesthetics in patients who underwent photorefractive keratectomy. All six studies demonstrated that a short course of dilute topical anesthetic provided efficacious analgesia without adverse effects or delayed epithelial healing.

Conclusion

Limited available data suggests that the use of dilute topical ophthalmologic proparacaine or tetracaine for a short duration of time is effective, though their safety for outpatient use is inconclusive.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^113mMCin]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A smaller systematic review of topical anesthetics for traumatic abrasions that includes 2 trials in this current review similarly concludes that topical anesthetic use is "currently not supported by evidence". One summary (not a systematic review) of interventions for post-PRK pain recommends against the long-term use of topical anesthetics. Authors of another summary (not a systematic review) state topical anesthetics do not delay epithelial healing. A third highlights the need for careful monitoring. The small reviewexcludes a trial we had included, and all three exclude two non-English language trials that we had included. The American Academy of Ophthalmology's 2022 Refractive Surgery Preferred Practice Pattern ® states "small quantities of dilute topical anesthetic are sometimes used but warrant close supervision". Treatment guidelines and point-of-care resources generally cite case reports and series when recommending against the use of topical anesthetics for pain control. In the United Kingdom, authors of the Clinical Knowledge Summary by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) state that topical anesthetic can be used to aid examination but "repeat doses should be avoided as they can cause corneal epithelium toxicity and impair healing". The indications approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration do not include pain for corneal abrasion. Instead, labeling for proparacaine and tetracaine specify they are approved for diagnostic and surgical indications, can cause permanent corneal damage, and are not intended for patient self-administration.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^112PbETQ]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A few years ago, the American Academy of Ophthalmology invited the American College of Emergency Physicians to issue joint guidelines regarding use of topical anesthetics for corneal abrasions because of concerns of potential harm. A joint working group from both organizations convened and reviewed the peer-reviewed literature. Unfortunately, the ophthalmologists and emergency room physicians could not find consensus on clinical recommendations, and the final report had no ophthalmologists as authors. The emergency physician guidelines endorse dispensing 1.5–2 mL topical anesthetics (q30 minutes for 24 h) for corneal abrasions in the emergency department setting. This amount (60–80 drops) actually would last 30–40 h, although the guidelines state patients would be asked to discard drops after 24 h. Guideline authors question the emphasis our Cochrane Systematic Review places on RCTs although clinicians, methodologists, and biostatisticians identify, appraise, and synthesize the empirical evidence in a methodologically rigorous process. Therefore, our review is not written "written solely" by ophthalmologists. The authors also claim an "existing practice pattern of ophthalmologists prescribing topical anesthetics for photorefractive keratectomy postoperative analgesia". In truth, topical anesthetic use is exceedingly rare after PRK. At least three papers the emergency physician authors cite to support post-PRK anesthetic use actually describe complications or increased postoperative pain.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^112BzxJW]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal abrasion prophylaxis — Topical antibiotics should be prescribed to prevent acute infection in patients with a corneal abrasion who wear contact lenses or suffered trauma, and in these patients, patching the eye early on is not advised because these increase the risk of secondary bacterial keratitis.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^11658MwC]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The current review cannot address whether the numerous case reports of anesthetic complications describe outliers since most trials do not assess safety outcomes beyond 1–2 weeks. The case literature suggests certain patient populations may be at risk for topical anesthetic abuse –. These characteristics include a history of psychiatric illness, depression, dry eye, or drug abuse; certain occupations like manual labor that might prioritize return to work over close follow-up or recovery; or a medical or veterinary background that provides access to topical anesthetics. There are ethical concerns with enrolling participants at higher risk for anesthetic abuse.

In any future trial, sample size assumptions (effect size, power) should be justified, and efficacy outcomes should include a more complete understanding and documentation of pain. Baseline and follow-up pain levels, function, and quality of life as well as complete demographic data would aid interpretation of applicability. Some trials record the baseline pain level in participants; others do not. A high proportion of participant drop-out is noted in one trial of post-traumatic abrasions. This same trial employs a mixed-model approach for the multiple, repeated self-reported pain measurements from individuals that are "adjusted for pain on arrival, and allowing for individuals with different pain levels and pain reducing at different rates". No other included trial utilizes this method. Future trials should engage both emergency physicians and ophthalmologists. Trial quality could be improved and publication bias be averted. Additionally, reliance on self-reported pain intensity following surgery can result in an overestimation of the needed intervention. Lessons gained from the current opioid epidemic include the need for better understanding of pain, use of other treatment modalities, and focus on returning patients to normal function. Given that topical anesthetic use also can be habit-forming, the same considerations may apply to pain control in corneal abrasion.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^112GRpbu]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

We present analysis of nine RCTs (21 study reports) after a literature search yielded 7641 unique titles and abstracts that were screened, of which we reviewed 39 potentially relevant full-text publications (Fig. 1). Our quantitative analysis includes 8 of the 9 RCTs. One trial does not report data in a manner amenable to analysis for our specified outcomes.

Fig. 1
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) flow diagram showing identification and selection of randomized controlled trials that compare different topical anesthetics with or without co-interventions to placebo or active control for corneal abrasions.

All included trials are parallel-group, 2-arm RCTs, except for one 7-arm trial. The trials span across eight countries from 1994 to 2021. The four post-traumatic abrasion trials were conducted in emergency departments. Four trials did not receive industry funding; funding information is unknown for five trials –.

The included trials report data from 626 eligible participants who were randomized. After selecting the appropriate 3 arms from a 7-arm trial, we analyzed 556 participants with a median of 45 participants per trial (interquartile range [IQR], 44–74; 9 RCTs). A higher proportion of women are enrolled in surgical trials (60%; 166/278 participants; 4 RCTs) than in post-trauma settings (21%; 65/314 participants; 4 RCTs).

The following topical anesthetics are compared with placebo (Supplementary Data): tetracaine 1% (2 RCTs), 0.5% (1 RCT), and 0.4% (1 RCT); proparacaine 0.05% (3 RCTs); and lidocaine 2% (1 RCT). One multi-arm trial compares proparacaine 0.05% and proparacaine 0.05% with topical diclofenac 0.1% against placebo. One trial has an NSAID active control (diclofenac 0.1%). When reported, the total amount of topical anesthetic dispensed by emergency departments ranges from 1.5 mL to 40 mL (~30–800 drops).

### Tetanus prophylaxis in superficial corneal abrasions [^111vWjUH]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether tetanus prophylaxis is indicated after non-penetrating corneal abrasion. Altogether 30 papers were found using the reported search, of which one presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of this best paper are tabulated. A clinical bottom line is stated.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^113AMHRk]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Only four trials in the current review report specific adverse events; most do not report events beyond 1 week. This short follow-up may lead to an inaccurately low estimate of adverse event rates. Topical anesthetic abuse is usually described in the literature at time points well beyond those of the trials in this review. In Turkey, where topical anesthetics were sold over the counter until 2012, one study found that median duration of use was 28 days (range, 10–112 days; 7 patients) before amniotic membrane transplantation was needed for corneal melt. In a case series of patients with toxic keratopathy from topical anesthetic abuse, epithelial healing took a median of 17 days (range, 6–50 days; 19 patients).

The time from trauma to participant randomization is longer than for surgical participants by 24–36 h. Post-trauma trials vary in whether patients with rust rings are included, which has implications for potential risk of bias and applicability of findings. In one post-trauma abrasion trial, abrasion size was not assessed; two trials excluded participants with large abrasions, referring them to ophthalmology. With enough participants, trial investigators could consider stratifying traumatic abrasions by size or only enrolling abrasions of a prespecified size range. Abrasion size in post-trauma trials varies, whereas the epithelial defect is more uniformly created in surgical procedures. Therefore, the baseline risk for slow epithelial healing and adverse events such as infection may differ systematically by setting. Because of different baseline risks, combining post-trauma and post-surgical subgroups when examining for complications does not make clinical sense and therefore is not done.

In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence that topical anesthetics are more safe or effective than placebo for pain or healing of corneal abrasions of either surgical or traumatic origin. Trials with larger sample sizes, means to minimize attrition of trial participants, efficacy outcomes that reflect a better understanding and measurement of pain, and differentiation of abrasions (e.g. uncomplicated abrasions vs. ones with retained foreign material [or rust rings]) would reduce bias and increase certainty of evidence. Future trials and systematic reviews should include core outcome sets, comprised of multistakeholder consensus of measurable, reported standardized outcomes to improve consistency across studies and facilitate comparison of interventions –. Given that most abrasions are self-limited, trial participants should receive appropriate quantities of topical anesthetic to reduce the risk of complication and vision loss. Lessons learned from the opioid epidemic can apply to analgesia for corneal abrasion.

### Cochrane corner: topical anaesthetics for pain control following corneal abrasions [^116omwNB]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Topical anaesthetics had little or no effect in reducing self-reported pain for traumatic or surgically created abrasions from baseline to 24 h compared to an inactive control. However, based on low certainty evidence from one trial of participants with traumatic abrasions, anaesthetics may lower pain scores at 24–48 h. Only one post-surgical RCT reported on pain control up to 72 h and found that the intervention had little or no effect on post-surgical pain. Overall, for the trials included in the quantitative analysis, there was no significant reduction in resolution of epithelial defects between anaesthetic and control groups, nor in the proportion of eyes with complications, although the certainty of the evidence is very low for all safety outcomes mostly because of risk of bias and small sample sizes.

In recent years, Cochrane Eyes and Vision have produced a suite of reviews that have examined the management of corneal abrasions. The findings of this latest review are unlikely to change practice and convince the eye care community of the safety of supplying topical anaesthetics for pain relief, even if provided in limited dose-vials and used for short periods. The review authors acknowledge that they had very low confidence in the efficacy data. Furthermore, the effect sizes for pain reduction were generally small and typically less than two units lower with anaesthetic on a 10-point VAS pain scale. Studies in emergency settings have attempted to define the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for acute pain severity by measuring the change in VAS score associated with adequate pain control. A mean reduction in VAS of at least 30% was found to represent a clinically important difference in pain severity that corresponded to patients' perception of adequate pain control.

Although there were no safety concerns arising from the included trials, the review authors do not discount the potential for ocular morbidity, particularly in a 'real world' setting where patients are not as closely monitored as in the experimental studies. The growing opioid crisis in the United States has created an impetus for opioid-sparing pain management and this may explain the desire to seek alternative methods to control pain arising from corneal-abrasion associated pain in the emergency department. However, further research is still needed, with larger, better-quality trials and longer follow up times to provide the evidence base needed to justify a change in practice.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^114xTAbQ]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Results

Data on patients with corneal abrasions

Prospective data included 134 patients with corneal abrasions (88 from VCs, 46 from SCs) while retrospective data comprised of 861 patients with corneal abrasions managed in SCs. Figure 3 shows the comparison of prospective and retrospective data for patients with corneal abrasions, and more detailed results are presented in the Appendix 1.

Figure 3
Outcomes of patients presenting with corneal abrasions presented as prospective and retrospective data, and early vs late presenters.

Early presenters in both prospective and retrospective study had lesser number of patients developing corneal ulcer compared to delayed presentation in both prospective and retrospective study. (SC – Secondary Centre, TC Tertiary Centre, CI: Confidence Interval).

Results of the prospective data analysis suggested that of the total 134 patients who had corneal abrasions, five of those patients receiving treatment at VCs/SCs developed ulceration 3.7% (5/134; CI 1.222, 8.493). However, only 2.2% (2/91; CI 0.267, 7.715) of early presenters (who presented within two days of getting injured) developed ulcers but 7% (3/43; CI, 1.463, 19.061) of late presenters (who presented after two days of injury) developed ulcers. The P value was statistically significant (P value < 0.001).

Results of the retrospective data analysis substantiated these findings. Corneal ulcers developed in 27/861 patients (3.7%), with corneal ulcers developing in 2.2% (9/409; CI 1.011, 4.136) of those who presented early within two days and in 4.2% (19/452; CI, 2.549. 6.487) of the late presenters who presented after two days. The P value was statistically significant (P value < 0.001).

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness [^1116vYAa]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Corneal abrasion — treatment and indications for evacuation: Prompt removal of evident corneal foreign body is recommended, and if open globe is suspected or deep corneal epithelial defects are apparent, then evacuation is emergent. Treatment includes topical antibiotics (erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment 1 cm every 8 hours), cycloplegics (atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 hours), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 8 hours), and frequent artificial tears. Sunglasses may help photophobia, but there is no evidence to support eye patching. Bandage soft contact lenses should be used only when no retained corneal foreign body is present, they are paired with a prophylactic topical antibiotic drop, and they are removed within 24 to 48 hours. Topical anesthetic eye drops provide diagnostic and acute pain relief but should not be used chronically due to corneal epithelial toxicity. Recommendation categories are Topical antibiotics: 1A; Cycloplegics: 1A; NSAIDs: 1A; Artificial tears: 1C; Sunglasses: 1C.

### Preventing corneal abrasions in critically ill children receiving neuromuscular blockade: a randomized, controlled trial [^111fMA8Z]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the incidence of corneal abrasions in critically ill children requiring neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and to determine whether a moisture chamber over the eye is more effective in preventing corneal abrasions compared with standard therapy.

Design

Randomized controlled clinical trial.

Setting

Three pediatric intensive care units at two free-standing, university-affiliated children's hospitals.

Patients

Consecutive intubated, mechanically ventilated patients receiving NMB < 36 hours, 2 weeks to 18 years of age.

Intervention

After confirming the absence of a corneal abrasion, patients' eyes were randomized to either control (Q6H lubrication and eye closure) or treatment (Q6H lubrication, eyelid closure and moisture chamber). Eyes were examined daily for 3 days then every other day until NMB was discontinued, a corneal abrasion developed, or on study day 9. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Measurements and Main Results

Two hundred thirty-seven patients were enrolled. Thirty patients exited the study before randomization (17 upon confirmation of a corneal abrasion on initial examination [7%; 95% confidence interval 4%-11%]; 12 upon discontinuation of NMB; 1 patient death). The remaining 207 patients were randomized and evaluated twice (median; interquartile range [IQR] 1–4 observations). Twenty-one patients developed a corneal abrasion over the course of the study (10%; 95%confidence interval 6%-15%). Median time from enrollment to abrasion was 2 days (IQR 1–3 days). The incidence of corneal abrasion was not different between the patient's control and treatment eyes; specifically, eight corneal abrasions developed in the control eye, five corneal abrasions in the treatment eye, and eight corneal abrasions in both eyes (McNemar's test; p = 0.58).

Conclusions

The occurrence of corneal abrasions in critically ill children receiving NMB is not trivial. The additional use of a moisture chamber over the eye was no more effective than Q6H lubrication and eye closure alone in preventing corneal abrasions in this at-risk patient group.

Though this approach brings treatment closer to the patients, there have been no formal studies looking at whether this approach actually delivers improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with corneal abrasion and ulceration or whether it reduces the financial burden in eye care among poor rural communities. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and financial impact of early treatment of abrasions and ulcers compared to delayed treatment. To do this, we analysed both prospective and retrospective data collected at LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI) and performed modelling to estimate the cost impacts and health outcomes of different scenarios.

### Fingernail-induced corneal abrasions: case series from an ophthalmology emergency department [^114Zen4H]. Cornea (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Fingernail-induced corneal abrasions are one of the most common eye injuries that present to the emergency department, and yet there is little literature available to offer guidelines for management. We analyzed the treatment used in cases of fingernail-induced corneal abrasions that presented to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Emergency Department and studied its relationship to the development of complications such as recurrent erosion syndrome and infection.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 99 patients who presented to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Emergency Department with fingernail-induced corneal abrasions between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009. We followed the patients for 12 months and documented demographics, nature of the injury, treatment, and complications.

Results

The average age was 29.4 (range, 2–89) years. Forty-four percent (n = 44) were female and 56% (n = 55) were male. Of the 99 subjects, 39 had a full 12 month follow-up, and 7 developed a complication from the injury. Compared with the 32 subjects without complications, there was no difference in age or gender. However, there was a significant difference in that adults scratched by another adult were more highly represented in the group with complications (43%, n = 3/7 vs. 3%, n = 1/32; P = 0.0017). There was no significant difference in outcome by treatment used.

Conclusions

This is the largest fingernail-induced corneal abrasion study completed to date. Patients are at risk of developing complications, but there is scant evidenced-based literature available for treating this common injury. Prospective trials should be performed to better optimize and standardize treatments.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^115HiSHQ]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis prophylaxis in corneal abrasion — Topical antibiotics should be prescribed for contact lens wearers with corneal abrasion, and a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is recommended after traumatic abrasion; prophylactic topical antibiotics following abrasion have been shown to prevent ulceration when started within 24 hours of the abrasion (A+, Moderate, Strong). Prophylactic antibiotics can be considered for chronic epithelial defects but routine use is described as controversial given that efficacy has not been established and chronic use may promote resistant organisms. In contact-lens associated abrasion, patching the eye or using a therapeutic contact lens is not advised due to increased risk of secondary bacterial keratitis.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^113qMfQX]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain control from baseline to 24 h after treatment initiation

The combined estimate for pain scores reported by post-surgical participants, suggests that when compared with placebo, topical anesthetics reduce pain by 1.28 on a 10-point VAS (MD, −1.28; 95% CI, −1.76 to −0.80; 3 RCTs; 119 participants; Fig. 2). In contrast, one post-PRK trial reports 0.82 higher pain scores on a 10-point VAS with tetracaine compared with NSAID (MD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.01 to 1.63; 74 participants; Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Forest plot showing mean differences with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for self-reported pain at 24 h.

Compared with placebo, topical anesthetics are associated with a moderate reduction in self-reported pain at 24 h in post-surgical trials but show little or no difference in effect in post-trauma participants. However, compared with NSAIDs in post-surgical participants, self-reported pain is increased in the topical anesthetic group compared with the NSAID group. CI confidence interval, IV inverse variance, SD standard deviation, VAS visual analog scale.

No evidence of a difference in pain control (MD, −0.04; 95% CI, −0.10 to 0.02) is found in a trial using a mixed-model to account for multiple measurements, to which 76 (62%) of 122 of post-trauma participants contributed data.

One post-surgical trial compares an anesthetic plus an NSAID with placebo. The estimated difference in means in reduction in pain scores (i.e. the "mean difference" or MD) from this study indicates anesthetic plus NSAID reduces pain scores at 24 h when compared with placebo (MD, −5.72 on a 10-point scale; 95% CI, −7.35 to −4.09; 30 participants).

The certainty of evidence for all effect estimates is very low because of potential risk of bias and imprecision.

### Efficacy of eye patching for traumatic corneal abrasions: a controlled clinical trial [^116GWqKv]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We sought to evaluate the efficacy of eye patching in the treatment of traumatic corneal abrasions in terms of time to healing and reduction in pain and discomfort.

Methods

One hundred sixty-three patients presenting at the emergency department of a large university-affiliated hospital with traumatic corneal abrasions were included in this single-blind prospective controlled trial. Eligible patients were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment regimens: topical antibiotic ointment and occlusive patch over the affected eye (n = 82) or topical antibiotic ointment 4 times a day without an occlusive patch (n = 81). Patients were reexamined every 24 hours until corneal healing occurred. Healing evaluation was performed by the emergency physician, using a slit lamp with fluorescein staining, without knowledge of the patient's assignment to a treatment group. The degree of discomfort was assessed at each visit by using a visual analog scale.

Results

Both treatment groups were similar regarding size of the corneal lesions, delay from trauma to first ED visit, presence of foreign body or siderosis, initial degree of discomfort, and presence of specific symptoms (irritation, foreign body sensation, photophobia, redness, and pain). In the patched group, cumulative incidences of healing were 51%, 78%, and 92% after 1, 2, and 3 days, respectively, compared with 60%, 83%, and 88% in the nonpatched group. In the patched group, symptoms of initial discomfort decreased by 4.8, 4.1, and 5.5 cm after 1, 2, and 3 days, respectively, compared with 3.3, 5.1, and 6.5 cm in the nonpatched group.

Conclusion

Eye patching does not appear to be beneficial in the treatment of traumatic corneal abrasions compared with topical antibiotic ointment.

### Topical tetracaine used for 24 hours is safe and rated highly effective by patients for the treatment of pain caused by corneal abrasions: a double-blind, randomized clinical trial [^115tbhpW]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that topical tetracaine would be safe to use for 24 hours and would not affect corneal healing, that patients would experience more pain relief, and that patients would perceive tetracaine to be more effective than saline eye drops for the treatment of pain caused by corneal abrasions.

Methods

The study was a 12-month, prospective, double-blind, randomized trial of tetracaine versus saline set in the emergency department (ED) of a regional tertiary care teaching hospital. A total of 116 patients presenting with uncomplicated corneal abrasions were included in this study. The intervention was either undiluted, preservative-free, topical tetracaine hydrochloride 1% or saline, applied up to every 30 minutes while awake for 24 hours. Main safety outcome measures were repeat ED examinations at 48 hours with fluorescein staining and slit-lamp examination, 1-week and 1-month telephone interviews with additional examinations as needed, and monitoring of charts for complications. Secondary outcome measures were 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores recorded every 2 hours while awake for 48 hours and patient-perceived overall effectiveness using a numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10 obtained during telephone interviews.

Results

At least one follow-up encounter was completed on each of the 116 patients. No complications specifically attributed to topical anesthetic use occurred in the 59 patients in the tetracaine group, and the binomial probability confidence interval (CI) of this occurring is 0 to 6.1. There was no significant difference in corneal healing as measured by the percentage of patients with persistent fluorescein uptake at 48 hours between the two groups (23.9% vs. 21.3%, difference = 2.6%, 95% CI = -14% to 20%, p = 0.761) or persistent symptoms at 48 hours (21.7% vs. 21.3%, difference = 0.4%, 95% CI = -16% to 17%, p = 0.957). There was no clinical difference in VAS pain scores between the groups. Patients in the tetracaine group rated the study drugs' overall effectiveness significantly higher on the NRS (7.7 vs. 3.9) compared to patients in the saline group (difference = 3.9, 95% CI = 2.4 to 5.3, p < 0.0005).

Conclusions

Topical tetracaine used for 24 hours is safe, and while there was no significant difference in patient VAS pain ratings over time, patient surveys on overall effectiveness showed that patients perceived tetracaine to be significantly more effective than saline.

### Management of corneal abrasion in children: a randomized clinical trial [^112TfJFK]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We compare percentage of healing, comfort, and complications in children with corneal abrasions treated with an eye patch versus no eye patch.

Methods

We performed a randomized clinical trial of patients aged 3 to 17 years who were diagnosed with isolated corneal abrasion. Patients were randomly assigned to an eye patch or no patch group. Abrasion size was documented with digital photographs and/or an eye template diagram at presentation and at 20- to 24-hour follow-up examination. A reviewer masked to treatment group determined percent healing by measuring presentation and follow-up abrasion sizes on the photographs/template. At follow-up, interference with activities of daily living (ADL) was measured with a visual analog scale and the number of pain medication doses taken since presentation was recorded.

Results

A total of 37 patients were enrolled: 17 with an eye patch and 18 with no eye patch. The mean patient age was 10 years, and two thirds of the patients were male. The majority (86%) of patients had 95% or more healing at follow-up, and there was no significant difference in percent healing between the 2 groups, even when adjusted for age and initial abrasion size (95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference in means -11 to 8 and -13 to 5, respectively). There was no difference between groups for number of pain medication doses required. Among measurements of interference with ADL, only the difficulty walking score was found to be significantly different between groups (patch mean 1.7 cm [SD 2.1 cm] versus no patch mean 0.3 cm [SD 0.7 cm]; 95% CI for the difference in means 0.3 to 2.5).

Conclusion

This study suggests that eye patching in children with corneal abrasions makes no difference in the rate of healing. There was no difference in discomfort and interference with ADL, other than greater difficulty walking in the patch group, and there were no complications in either group.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^113ULyjw]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasions (CAs) are the most prevalent ocular injuries in the perioperative period. Previously, patients at our community hospital would wait for an ophthalmologist to be available to manage these minor injuries. To decrease this waiting period – and thereby increase patient satisfaction – we developed an anesthesiology-based protocol to manage minor CAs arising in the recovery room. The current study sought to assess this protocol's efficacy as well as further establish the incidence and some risk factors of CA.

Methods

This was a hospital-based, observational study. As per protocol, anesthesiologists saw and diagnosed any patient exhibiting symptoms of CA, after which they initiated a preestablished treatment regimen. To examine the efficacy of this protocol between March 2007 and December 2011, the number of CAs anesthesiologists managed and time to treatment were recorded. Additionally, the frequency of CAs was established along with some of their risk factors.

Results

Throughout the study period, there were 91,064 surgical cases, with 118 CAs (0.13% incidence). Anesthesiology alone managed 110 (93.22%) of these cases. The median time between the end of anesthesia to the time of prescribed ophthalmic medication was 156 minutes (first–third interquartile range: 108–219). All patients experienced resolution of symptoms by the morning following their complaint. Compared to the general surgical population, CA patients were older (P < 0.01) and underwent longer surgeries (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Minor CAs can be safely and effectively managed using an anesthesiology-based approach. Advanced age and longer surgery are confirmed as risk factors for these injuries.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^11464swe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

This was a medical record review approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board has full Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Program, Inc Accreditation and has approved this research examining perioperative CAs for the Department of Anesthesiology.

Each case of perioperative eye complaint was documented as it arose. Patients presenting with such complaints were treated in accordance with the guidelines of an anesthesiology-led protocol. The efficacy of this protocol is what we sought to evaluate in this study. After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval from the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, for research protocol: Perioperative Corneal Abrasions: A Systematic Approach to Diagnosis and Management (University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board # PRO14030717), medical records were examined from March 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011 of all patients who complained of eye pain or discomfort following non-ocular surgery (barring pediatric and obstetric). Additionally, medical records of patients diagnosed with perioperative CA between 2002 and 2006 were reviewed to determine the amount of time these patients waited to receive treatment.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^1168rQnR]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Delayed treatment involves patient costs for travel (to SCs and TCs) and lost wages, resulting in substantial financial impact and physical suffering for patients. While there are other studies looking at cost outcomes associated with early treatment of abrasions or ulcers, there is no study (as far as we know) that has developed comprehensive scenarios to model the potential cost and clinical impact of treating patients earlier at VCs/SCs. A recent study by Komal et al. presented the economic benefits associated with the use of a teleophthalmology vision centre in treating corneal disorders in southern India. The study reported reduced travel costs for the patients and reported that a patient can save approximately a minimum of INR 1200 (USD 16) by being treated closer to home than requiring travel to a hospital. However, this study did not model the clinical outcomes in details and did not incorporate the impact of delayed treatment on the outcomes and the costs.

There were certain assumptions used to estimate the costs, which may not always hold true, but they represent our best knowledge about the treatment practices at LVPEI in India. For example, the costs of topical treatments used in the model are estimated on the assumption of the use of a 'cocktail' therapy of both anti-fungal and anti-bacterial treatments as fungi and bacteria are the most common pathogens in India associated with corneal infections. While it is possible to target the most appropriate therapy (i.e. fungal, or bacterial) based on results of diagnostic testing, these facilities are not always available in each setting. Also, we have not included the costs for any side effects to the medications (e.g. allergic reactions) due to the low likelihood of such side effects. Further, the costs used in the model such as the surgery costs and hospital stay costs (and the patient costs) may not be completely transferable to other settings. The costs used in the study are based on the data available at LVPEI and reflect the patient journeys with corneal abrasions and ulcers. Other limitations of the study include the prospective study being carried out during the recent pandemic and travel cost of patients' attendants not being considered. Furthermore, as the focus was to estimate clinical and cost impact of different scenarios at a population level, none of the analyses were adjusted for populations characteristics and other risk factors.

Complications reported as having occurred by the longest follow-up time

Seven trials report the proportion of individuals with this outcome. The longest follow-up time is 2 weeks; the shortest is 48 h. Three of the seven trials report no events of complication in either trial arm. In the comparison of topical anesthetics versus placebo or NSAID, topical anesthetics are associated with a higher proportion of complications in post-trauma participants at up to 2 weeks (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.23 to 5.46; 3 RCTs; 242 participants; Supplementary Figure). For post-surgery participants at up to 1 week, the risk of complications also is higher with topical anesthetics (RR, 7.00; 95% CI, 0.38–128.02; 1 RCT; 44 participants; Supplementary Figure). We also estimate risk differences (RDs) and find no evidence of differences in absolute risks for complications up to 1 week in both the post-surgery trials (RD, 0.03; 95% CI, −0.06 to 0.11; 3 RCTs; 119 participants; Fig. 4) – and post-trauma trials (RD, 0.00; 95% CI, −0.06 to 0.06; 4 RCTs; 275 participants; Fig. 4). In one post-trauma trial, patients' self-reported pain level is collected by telephone interview at the 2-week mark.

Fig. 4
Forest plot showing estimated risk difference with 95% CI, for complications.

There is no evidence of a difference in absolute risk with topical anesthetic use versus placebo or NSAID. CI confidence interval; M-H Mantel-Haenszel.

In the single study comparing anesthetic plus NSAID versus placebo, proparacaine 0.05% plus diclofenac 0.1% versus placebo, the authors report no adverse events in either treatment arm up to 1 week post-surgery (RD, 0.00; 95% CI, −0.12 to 0.12; 30 participants).

For both comparisons, the certainty of evidence is very low because of potential risk of bias and imprecision.

Important outcomes

In the one study that reports treatment failure by 72 h after treatment initiation, no oral analgesic use is used in either arm from 24 h to 2 weeks. The evidence of a difference between topical anesthetics and placebo is of very low certainty because of a potential risk of bias and imprecision. No study assesses quality of life.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^112HZuKa]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

CAs occurring perioperatively can arise from multiple factors, including trauma, chemical injury, and corneal edema. Although there is still debate on the frequency with which patients develop CAs, the American Society of Anesthesiologists closed-claims analysis found that CA was the most common ocular injury, accounting for 35% of all such injuries. At our hospital, the overall incidence of CA over the study period was 0.13%, which falls within the range of that observed in other studies.–Year-to-year incidence over the study period was fairly constant, ranging from 0.12% to 0.15%.

In addition to evaluating the efficacy of an anesthesiology-led protocol for managing perioperative CAs and determining their incidence at our hospital, our study sought to further explore the risk factors associated with these injuries. Consistent with previous studies, we confirmed corneal injury to be associated with advanced age and longer surgeries.

Limitations and future studies

Despite collecting the data on CAs in a prospective fashion, this study is observational and faces all of the same limitations associated with a retrospective design. Consequently, findings from this study do not have the strength of those resulting from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, and certain data – such as the specific treatment prescribed and the time to treatment – were unavailable for a handful of patients. Furthermore, the study's retrospective design did not allow for certain data to be readily examined, such as the exact time patients exhibited symptoms of CA. To more accurately determine the time between symptom onset and treatment initiation under an anesthesiology-led protocol for the management of CAs, future studies could document the time patients complain of eye pain prospectively. Having patient complaint serve as the primary mechanism by which perioperative CAs are identified can in itself be somewhat of a limitation, as those patients who do indeed develop CAs but do not experience acute pain in the recovery room will have their treatment delayed. Additionally, because this study was conducted only at one institution without an ophthalmologist readily available, some of its findings may not be generalizable to other sites. Finally, despite the fact that our database included over 90,000 patients, the number of CAs recorded was too small to perform more complex etiology-based analysis.

Pain control from baseline to 48 h after treatment initiation

Using a 10-point VAS, post-surgical participants of one trial report little pain control relative to placebo (MD, 0.41; 95% CI, −0.45 to 1.27; 44 participants). Post-trauma participants in one trial report 5.68 lower pain scores with tetracaine 0.5% than placebo (MD, −5.68; 95% CI, −6.38 to −4.98; 111 participants). One post-trauma trial is excluded from this analysis because 57% of 124 randomized participants are lost to follow up. The overall certainty of evidence is very low because of a high risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency across studies.

No trial records pain control from baseline to 72 h after treatment initiation.

Epithelial healing by 24–72 h

In three post-trauma trials, the risk of persistent epithelial defects assessed at 24 to 72 h is 37% higher with varying concentrations of tetracaine compared with placebo (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.78–2.42; 3 RCTs; 221 participants; I² = 0%; Fig. 3). However, a decrease in the proportion of participants with persistent defects is found in a trial of 30 post-surgical participants using proparacaine 0.05% (RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01–2.55; Fig. 3) and proparacaine 0.05% plus diclofenac 0.1% (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.04–2.85), compared with placebo.

Fig. 3
Forest plot showing estimated risk ratios (RR) with their 95% CI, for proportions of participants with persistent epithelial defects.

The proportion of post-trauma participants with persistent epithelial defects is higher with topical anesthetics than with placebo or NSAID. However, in post-surgical participants, the proportion of unresolved epithelial defects is higher with placebo than with topical anesthetics. CI confidence interval, M-H Mantel-Haenszel.

Overall, there is no evidence of differences although the evidence is of very low certainty because of a high risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision.

### Corneal abrasions in space: current therapeutics and future directions [^114dzTmW]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment

On Earth, foreign bodies in the conjunctiva or cornea can be removed by irrigation with saline or for larger corneal foreign bodies with the use of sterile corneal spuds. Particles of space dust may be particularly challenging to visualize without the use of slit lamp biomicroscopy (not currently available on the space station). Moreover, more serious ocular infections including conjunctivitis and microbial keratitis can be mission threatening on the International Space Station (ISS). On ISS, current protocols for treatment include first line therapy with topical antibiotic (e.g. polytrim (polymyxin B/ trimethoprim) solution) and if no improvement is seen, then therapy is advanced to topical ciprofloxacin (1 drop in the affected eye, every 6 h). Early recognition and treatment of ocular infections is vital during spaceflight, particularly due to alterations in virulence and enhanced microbial growth that is generally seen in space. Immunosuppression has also been reported in astronauts due to a multitude of stressors encountered in spaceflight, which further emphasizes the danger posed by eye infections in space.

Further research will be essential to mitigate the risk of corneal abrasions in spaceflight. Artificial tears can potentially be used daily by astronauts to ensure that the ocular surface remains adequately lubricated. Omega 3 fatty acid supplementation has also previously been investigated for dry eye disease, and may be useful for astronauts to minimize ocular surface irritation. Additionally, further vision testing is required to ensure that any astronaut vision decrements are detected early, to minimize ophthalmic risks.

### Corneal abrasions in total joint arthroplasty [^111aGzq6]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasion (CA) is a condition where the epithelial layer of the cornea is removed from the underlying basement membrane, leading to a defect in the corneal epithelial surface. Although most corneal abrasions heal without significant long-term complications, the patient can experience intense discomfort, tearing, photophobia, and blurred vision in the affected eye. Although rare, CA may result in ocular complications such as persistent corneal defect, corneal infection, and recurrent erosions.CA is the most common ophthalmic complication to occur under general anesthesia (GA). - In a time where enhanced recovery after anesthesia (ERAS) protocols are employed to expedite recovery, this can potentially limit early mobilization. Current literature reports the incidence of CA to range between 0.013% and 0.17% for nonocular surgeries.- The American Society of Anesthesiologists closed-claims analysis found that perioperative CA was the single most common of all perioperative ophthalmic injuries. While relatively benign, injuries such as this may lead to delays in discharge from the hospital due to the need for ophthalmology consultation and management and a halt in ERAS protocols and increased treatment costs. It can also result in a decrease in patient satisfaction surrounding the hospital stay.

Lateral and prone positioning in surgery have been previously implicated in corneal abrasion events. The literature reports incidents of corneal abrasions in nonocular surgeries, specifically spine and cardiac surgeries. There is a paucity of literature on the incidence of CA in orthopedic surgery, specifically total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Here, we present a report of two patients who sustained perioperative CA injury during TJA surgeries performed in the lateral decubitus position. We also sought to review the literature on eye CA and other important injuries during joint replacement to give surgeons guidance to prevent these injuries.

### Cochrane corner: topical anaesthetics for pain control following corneal abrasions [^113vgZfN]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic corneal abrasions, causing a disruption of superficial corneal epithelial integrity, are a common presentation in both general and ophthalmic emergency departments. Corneal epithelial defects can also occur following commonly performed ophthalmic surgical procedures, such as photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), alcohol delamination and corneal cross-linking. The high density of nociceptors in the cornea means that corneal abrasions are associated with significant pain, which is most intense at initial presentation and during the subsequent 24 to 48 h. The current NICE Clinical Knowledge Summary on corneal superficial injury, providing an evidence-based clinical guideline for UK primary care professionals, recommends simple oral analgesia such as paracetamol, with the addition of lubricating eye drops or ointment for additional pain relief. Whilst established dogma within ophthalmology advocates that topical anaesthetics should not be prescribed for corneal-abrasion-related pain due to safety concerns and the potential for abuse, this view has recently been challenged by emergency physicians. By contrast, surveys of eyecare professionals conducted in the United States reported almost universal opposition to this practice. The publication of the Cochrane Review by Sulewski et al. on 'Topical ophthalmic anaesthetics for corneal abrasions' is, therefore, very timely.

The review, which included nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting 556 adult participants investigated the effectiveness and safety of self-administered topical anaesthetics for the relief of pain compared to a non-anaesthetic control group (placebo or other treatment). Four RCTs (314 participants) analysed individuals with traumatic abrasions presenting in an emergency department setting and five trials (242 participants) investigated post-surgical epithelial defects. Participants were supplied with one of the commonly used topical ophthalmic anaesthetics, specifically, tetracaine (used in 5 RCTs), proparacaine (3 trials) or lidocaine (1 RCT). Adjunctive oral analgesia was also used in all but one study, either using a designated dosing regime or 'as required'. Pain intensity was evaluated using visual analogue scales (VAS) or numerical scales, where higher scores represented higher pain intensities. The effect of treatment on epithelial healing rates was also evaluated by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and the proportion of participants with adverse events was reported at the longest follow up time.

### The evaluation and management of corneal penetrating and perforating injuries during long-duration spaceflight [^114beHjy]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk factors

Corneal penetrating and perforating injuries can result from traumatic impact or conditions that cause corneal melting (e.g. microbial keratitis). Severe or poorly managed corneal abrasions, ulcers, and thermal burns are subject to infections that can progress to corneal perforations. In the setting of microgravity, airborne particulates remain suspended (rather than falling to the floor on Earth) and can enter crewmembers' eyes. With NASA's aim to return to the Moon and to travel to Mars, celestial debris will be an additional risk to ocular health. Lunar and Martian windstorms increase the likelihood of higher-velocity particles causing severe penetrating corneal injuries. Recent literature has described 70 corneal abrasions, 6 chemical burns and 5 ocular infections in a review of NASA Space Shuttle and ISS missions. These were superficial corneal injuries that were successfully treated with topical antibiotics. In contrast, future longer-duration crewed missions to Mars and beyond might require more innovative and novel technology-driven platforms to address the risks for corneal perforation. We review the literature and propose potential countermeasures to prepare for such contingencies for future long term space exploration.

### Cochrane briefs… [^112ZHLQa]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Patching for Corneal Abrasions. Clinical Question Is patching an effective treatment for simple corneal abrasions. Evidence-Based Answer Patching is not beneficial for the treatment of simple corneal abrasions as measured by time to healing, complete healing rates at 24 to 48 hours, or pain. Practice Pointers Corneal abrasions are superficial defects of the corneal epithelium that most commonly result from mechanical injuries to the cornea. Experts have long recommended patching for the treatment of simple abrasions; however, recent studies have questioned this traditional guidance. 1 Eleven prospective randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials were identified that studied the effectiveness of patching as measured by corneal healing in children and adults with corneal abrasion.

All trials had two treatment groups with participants randomized to wear a patch for 24 hours or no patch; both treatment groups received variable dosing regimens of topical medications, including topical antibiotics, steroids, and cycloplegic eye drops. Five trials measured the number of participants with complete healing on each day of follow-up; two trials measured mean time to healing; and six trials measured percentage of healing or abrasion dimension sizes at each day of follow-up. Secondary outcomes measured in the trials included pain scores, analgesia use, treatment compliance, and ability to complete activities of daily living. Three trials mentioned short-term adverse events, and four trials reported long-term complications and follow-up two to seven months after the corneal abrasion.

Overall, the studies were rated as being of poor quality because of uncertain adequacy of randomization, lack of intention-to-treat analyses, and high drop-out rates. Meta-analysis of seven trials reporting complete healing rates on the first day of follow-up showed that more participants in the no-patch group had complete healing. When the two quasi-randomized trials were excluded from the pooled analysis, the difference in complete healing rates between the groups was nonsignificant. Pooled analysis of studies reporting complete healing rates at day 2 and day 3 of follow-up showed no significant difference between the patch and no-patch groups. Analysis of six studies showed no significant difference between the patch and no-patch groups in the mean number of days to healing.
