## Question

what is the best treatment for joint pain from arthritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the best treatment is for joint pain from arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the type of arthritis because treatment differs fundamentally between osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis. Then, I should verify the overarching principles that guide best practice, including treat-to-target strategies and multimodal care. Next, I will examine first-line nonpharmacologic options and their evidence. After that, I need to review pharmacologic choices by arthritis type, including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, DMARDs, and intra-articular therapies. Finally, I should consider special populations, when surgery is appropriate, and how to integrate shared decision-making and monitoring into a practical plan.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework, because "arthritis" is not a single entity and the best treatment depends on whether we are dealing with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or other inflammatory arthritides. Osteoarthritis is primarily a degenerative, pain-driven condition without a disease-modifying drug, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disease where early, aggressive disease control changes outcomes, so I need to keep these distinctions front and center as I proceed [^113S1kXC] [^112rZbQM].

> Next, I should review the universal principles that apply across types. Wait, let me verify the consensus: contemporary guidelines converge on a multimodal, patient-centered approach with shared decision-making, beginning with nonpharmacologic measures and escalating to pharmacologic therapy based on response and comorbidities. For inflammatory arthritis, a treat-to-target strategy with regular disease activity assessment and escalation to achieve remission or low disease activity is standard, and for osteoarthritis, care should start with education, exercise, and weight management before medications are added [^111VCW9t] [^1136BFKv] [^11432LrE].

> I will now examine first-line nonpharmacologic care, since this is foundational for both OA and IA. Exercise therapy — particularly supervised land-based strengthening and aerobic programs — improves pain and function in knee OA with low to moderate certainty, and benefits are amplified when combined with education or weight loss. Importantly, exercise effects are comparable to NSAIDs in some analyses, which reinforces its primacy, and I should also remember that adherence and supervision improve outcomes, so I need to ensure programs are accessible and tailored [^112AjDBn] [^113jVXbH]. Weight loss for those with overweight/obesity reduces joint load and pain, and self-management education plus CBT-based approaches address pain catastrophizing and coping, which meaningfully improve quality of life and function, so I should not underuse these modalities [^11432LrE] [^116BmFq1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications in OA. I should confirm the pharmacologic hierarchy. Topical NSAIDs are strongly recommended as first-line pharmacotherapy for hand and knee OA due to efficacy and favorable safety, with diclofenac gel or patches showing consistent benefit and low systemic risk. If topical therapy is insufficient, oral NSAIDs are effective but require careful selection and monitoring for GI, CV, and renal risks, and acetaminophen remains a reasonable alternative when NSAIDs are contraindicated or not tolerated, though its analgesic effect is modest compared with NSAIDs [^111oSURj] [^115yBWuL] [^116DqX4k] [^113BDPMv]. I should double-check the opioid stance: multiple high-quality sources advise against routine opioids for OA due to lack of sustained benefit and meaningful harms, so opioids, including tramadol, are reserved for refractory cases after shared decision-making and close monitoring [^115CFWDJ] [^112ULLew] [^117REtmr].

> For inflammatory arthritis, I need to ensure I prioritize disease control because pain often tracks with inflammation. Conventional synthetic DMARDs, with methotrexate as first-line, are initiated early and titrated to reach remission or low disease activity using a treat-to-target approach. Short-course glucocorticoids can bridge symptoms while DMARDs take effect, and escalation to biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs is indicated for inadequate responders, which consistently improves pain alongside disease activity [^1136BFKv] [^112rZbQM] [^116a9iyJ]. But wait, what if pain persists despite inflammatory control? I should consider noninflammatory pain mechanisms and layer nonpharmacologic strategies such as exercise, psychological therapies, and careful use of analgesics, recognizing that evidence for chronic analgesics in RA is limited and that guidelines increasingly emphasize nonpharmacologic pain management in this scenario [^1137nMkn] [^113DmWoS].

> Let me consider intra-articular therapies and when they fit. For localized OA flares, particularly in the knee, corticosteroid injections can provide short-term pain relief and improve function, and they are endorsed by multiple guidelines as part of a multimodal plan. Hyaluronic acid has mixed evidence and is generally not recommended as first-line, while PRP shows promise in some meta-analyses but remains controversial due to heterogeneity and low methodological quality, so I should frame PRP as investigational or selectively considered after shared decision-making [^114wK7F3] [^114EFPBy].

> I should confirm the role of surgery so I do not overmedicalize. Total joint arthroplasty is highly effective for end-stage hip and knee OA that remains symptomatic despite optimized conservative care, with durable pain relief and functional gains. However, I need to ensure patients have exhausted guideline-concordant nonsurgical options and that expectations, timing, and rehabilitation are aligned before referral [^112RZNW2] [^113dFZ4r].

> Next, I should review special populations and comorbidity-driven adjustments. In older adults with OA, I should prefer topical NSAIDs or acetaminophen and avoid routine opioids. In those with high GI, CV, or renal risk, topical NSAIDs or acetaminophen are safer, and if oral NSAIDs are necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with gastroprotection as indicated. For hand OA, hand orthoses are recommended. For patients with depression, anxiety, or sleep disturbance, I should integrate psychological therapies and address mood because these factors amplify pain and disability [^112AzWmu] [^11432LrE] [^116BmFq1].

> I need to ensure the plan is practical and measurable. Shared decision-making should explicitly weigh benefits, harms, costs, and patient preferences. I should set functional goals and monitor pain, function, and disease activity at each visit, adjusting therapy accordingly. For OA, reassess every 3 months initially; for RA, monitor disease activity every 1–3 months until target is achieved, then space out. This cadence aligns with treat-to-target principles and helps close the evidence-to-practice gap [^111VCW9t] [^1136BFKv].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. There is no single "best" treatment for arthritis pain; the best approach is a multimodal, patient-centered program that starts with education, exercise, and weight management, then adds pharmacologic therapy tailored to arthritis type and comorbidities, reserving surgery for refractory, function-limiting disease. For OA, prioritize topical NSAIDs, then oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen as appropriate, and avoid routine opioids. For RA, prioritize early DMARD therapy with treat-to-target escalation and layer nonpharmacologic pain strategies when inflammation is controlled but pain persists. This strategy is consistently supported by high-quality guidelines and systematic reviews and should be adapted iteratively with the patient's goals and response in mind [^111VCW9t] [^1136BFKv] [^11432LrE] [^112AjDBn].

The best treatment for joint pain from arthritis is a **multimodal, patient-centered approach** that combines nonpharmacologic therapies (education, exercise, weight loss, physical therapy) with pharmacologic options (topical NSAIDs first-line, then oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen) as needed, and escalates to intra-articular injections or surgery if refractory [^111VCW9t] [^11432LrE]. For inflammatory arthritis, **early DMARDs with treat-to-target** control are essential to reduce pain and prevent damage [^112rZbQM] [^1136BFKv]. Opioids are not recommended for routine use due to limited benefit and significant risks [^115CFWDJ] [^117REtmr]. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbidities, preferences, and response, with regular reassessment and shared decision-making [^112PW2py] [^112SEUz1].

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic therapies are the **foundation of arthritis pain management** and are recommended for all patients [^11432LrE].

- **Education and self-management**: Structured programs improve pain, function, and quality of life [^notfound].

- **Exercise**: Land-based aerobic, resistance, and aquatic exercise reduce pain and improve function; supervised programs are more effective [^112AjDBn] [^113jVXbH].

- **Weight loss**: Even modest weight loss reduces pain and improves function in overweight/obese patients with knee or hip OA [^notfound].

- **Physical therapy**: Tailored programs improve strength, flexibility, and joint mechanics [^notfound].

- **Psychological therapies**: CBT and mindfulness reduce pain intensity and improve coping [^116BmFq1].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions

Pharmacologic therapy is added when nonpharmacologic measures are insufficient, with **topical NSAIDs preferred for knee and hand OA** due to favorable safety [^116qRMqb] [^115yBWuL].

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Topical NSAIDs | Knee/hand OA | First-line; strong recommendation [^116qRMqb] [^115yBWuL] |
| Oral NSAIDs | Hip/knee OA, inflammatory arthritis | Conditional; monitor GI/CV/renal risk [^116qRMqb] [^111pmNaf] |
| Acetaminophen | Mild OA, NSAID contraindications | Conditional; modest efficacy [^113BDPMv] [^115NtE77] |
| Intra-articular corticosteroids | Flare-ups, refractory pain | Conditional; short-term benefit [^114wK7F3] |
| DMARDs (methotrexate, biologics) | Inflammatory arthritis | Essential; treat-to-target [^112rZbQM] [^1136BFKv] |
| Opioids | Refractory pain, surgery declined | Strongly against routine use [^115CFWDJ] [^117REtmr] |

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for **end-stage disease** with refractory pain and functional impairment despite optimized conservative care [^112RZNW2]. Total joint arthroplasty provides **substantial, durable pain relief and functional improvement** in hip and knee OA [^112RZNW2] [^113dFZ4r].

---

## Emerging and investigational therapies

Several emerging therapies show promise but require further study:

- **Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)**: Mixed evidence; may benefit select knee OA patients [^114EFPBy].

- **Mesenchymal stem cells**: Early-stage; potential structural benefit under investigation [^notfound].

- **Nerve growth factor inhibitors**: Effective for pain but await safety clarification [^notfound].

---

## Individualized treatment planning

Treatment should be **individualized** based on:

- **Arthritis type and severity**: OA vs inflammatory arthritis drives different strategies [^111VCW9t] [^1136BFKv].

- **Comorbidities**: GI, CV, renal, and hepatic disease guide NSAID use [^116qRMqb].

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making improves adherence and outcomes [^112PW2py] [^112SEUz1].

- **Access and cost**: Practical constraints shape modality selection [^111VCW9t].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular reassessment of pain, function, and disease activity is essential to **optimize therapy and detect adverse effects** [^1136BFKv] [^114d4EDo]. Treat-to-target strategies in inflammatory arthritis require **frequent monitoring and escalation** until remission or low disease activity is achieved [^112rZbQM] [^113czPSn].

---

## Conclusion

The best treatment for arthritis joint pain is a **multimodal, patient-centered approach** that prioritizes nonpharmacologic care, uses pharmacologic therapy tailored to arthritis type and comorbidities, and reserves surgery for refractory cases. Early, aggressive control of inflammatory arthritis and avoidance of routine opioids are key principles [^112rZbQM] [^115CFWDJ].

### Mechanisms, impact and management of pain in rheumatoid arthritis [^113DmWoS]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) identify pain as their most important symptom, one that often persists despite optimal control of inflammatory disease. RA pain arises from multiple mechanisms, involving inflammation, peripheral and central pain processing and, with disease progression, structural change within the joint. Consequently, RA pain has a wide range of characteristics-constant or intermittent, localized or widespread-and is often associated with psychological distress and fatigue. Dominant pain mechanisms in an individual are identified by critical evaluation of clinical symptoms and signs, and by laboratory and imaging tests. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for effective management, although evidence from preclinical models should be interpreted with caution. A range of pharmacological analgesic and immunomodulatory agents, psychological interventions and surgery may help manage RA pain. Pain contributes importantly to the clinical assessment of inflammatory disease activity, and noninflammatory components of RA pain should be considered when gauging eligibility for or response to biologic agents. Further randomized controlled trials are required to determine the optimal usage of analgesics in RA, and novel agents with greater efficacy and lower propensity for adverse events are urgently needed. Meanwhile, targeted use of existing treatments could reduce pain in people with RA.

### Arthritis and joint pain management… [^115UvYxT]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Arthritis and Joint Pain Management Many professional organizations have guidelines for managing arthritis pain. A common theme across guidelines is that pain management strategies should be flexible, include options that do not involve medication, and be tailored to meet the needs of the patient. Such guidelines suggest the following for managing arthritis symptoms such as pain:

- Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
- Physical activity/exercise or community-based physical activity programs.
- Exercise therapy, including physical therapy.
- Self-management education workshops.
- Weight loss, if overweight or obese.
- Cognitive behavioral therapy — a psychological, goal-directed approach in which patients learn how to modify physical, behavioral, and emotional triggers of pain and stress.

Over-the-Counter Medications Emerging evidence suggests that these are safer and more effective treatments for managing long-term arthritis pain than opioids.
- A recent study of individuals with knee and hip osteoarthritis, the most common types of arthritis, found that after one year, people who took over-the-counter medications had greater reductions in pain severity than people who took opioids. Prescription opioids are medications that can be used to treat moderate to severe pain. In 2015, nearly one in three US adults with arthritis purchased at least 1 prescription opioid from a pharmacy that year. Furthermore, adults with arthritis accounted for more than half of US adults with at least 1 opioid prescription dispensed. There is limited evidence of prescribed opioids' long-term effectiveness when used for chronic conditions such as arthritis. Safer options exist to help manage arthritis pain.

### Which nonsurgical treatments Do patients believe are most effective for hip and knee arthritis? [^1129wU7z]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The pain associated with osteoarthritis can have a detrimental impact on a patient's function and quality of life. Total joint arthroplasty is an effective treatment option for end-stage osteoarthritis, but a trial of conservative management is prudent and should be tried before surgical intervention. There are many nonsurgical treatment options available to patients for the treatment of hip and knee osteoarthritis.

The American Academic of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) published the guidelines to assist in making evidence-based decisions in the conservative management of hip and knee osteoarthritis. Studies support the use of strengthening, low impact aerobic exercise, weight loss, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and tramadol in the management of knee osteoarthritis. Physical therapy (PT), NSAIDs, and intraarticular corticosteroids are recommended for conservative treatment of hip osteoarthritis. Inconclusive evidence exists regarding the use of acetaminophen, opioids, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, and hyaluronic acid injections. In addition, the literature largely consists of studies comparing the effectiveness of one or two treatment options and lacks a study of patients' attitudes toward which conservative treatments are most effective.

Despite AAOS recommendations, many patients undergo conservative treatment modalities that are either not endorsed or have inconclusive evidence. A recent study by Bedard et al.demonstrated that if only AAOS-recommended treatment modalities were used, the cost associated with treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee could be decreased by 45% in the year before arthroplasty. With the contemporary emphasis on minimizing healthcare costs, careful consideration should be given to the cost benefit ratio of conservative treatments for osteoarthritis of the hip and knee. The purpose of this study was to determine which nonsurgical treatments that patients reported are most effective for managing pain secondary to hip and knee arthritis and to determine the cost-effectiveness of each treatment modality.

### Are biological targets the final goal for rheumatoid arthritis therapy? [^114SX3hB]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disorder that is characterized by inflammation of synovial membrane and the release of inflammatory cytokines that ultimately results in joint destruction and disability. The therapeutic treatment plan for treating RA patient initiates with disease-modifying antirheumatic agents (DMARDs) and ends with the use of biological agents. Sometimes a combination of DMARDs and the biological agents are aggressively initiated. But this is not sufficient to retard the underlying progression of the disease and hence the disease-associated pain persists. The solution lies in the treatment of causative factors. Modern therapy aims at targeting newer target sites that can not only overcome the problem of pain and disability but also minimize the occurrence of adverse effects faced by the traditional therapeutic approach.

Areas Covered

This review covers the pathological background of the disease in brief, the traditional and newer biologicals, therapeutic targets and novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis.

Expert Opinion

Better management of the disease can be achieved by focusing on the causes and the factors of the disease. Newer therapies and targeting sites discussed in this review focus on treating the disability at the cellular level without affecting body's immune response and minimizing the chances of infection and inflammation.

### Editorial commentary: arthritis treatments for pain [^1126AJBe]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Arthritis treatment must be analyzed with regard to outcome. Pain is one important outcome measure. Pain relief is variable among individual patients; individually discerning, personalized, or precision medical indications for nonsurgical treatment of osteoarthritis must be more specifically determined.

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^115my6Me]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Goals for the management of osteoarthritis (OA) emphasize pain relief, reduction of inflammation, and improvement in functioning. Among pharmacological pain management interventions, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently recommended as the most effective treatment option for OA. However, the use of traditional oral NSAIDs is associated with risk of serious adverse events involving the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems. Topical NSAIDs are an alternative with well-established tolerability and efficacy in the treatment of OA of the knee or hand. While the management of OA pain is evolving toward the more widespread use of topical NSAIDs, some OA management guidelines have yet to incorporate these agents in their recommendations. This review examines the efficacy and tolerability of topical NSAIDs, their current placement in OA management guidelines, and their potential role in enabling pain specialists to provide individualized care for their patients with OA.

### Development of medical therapeutics in osteoarthritis: time for action to improve patient care [^114gRB91]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

So where does this leave us in the management of OA? Stratification tools can be developed to aid in the assessment and management of OA. Enriching patient subgroups by stratification in clinical trials – for example in post-traumatic, synovitis and pain sensitization – may yield more useful results for patients who could benefit from personalized strategies. Such interventions may require one or more drug interventions. Further, combining pharmacotherapy with exercise and physical therapy is proven to reduce pain and improve function in knee and hip OA, with improved performance, reduced disability and improved quality of life.

Proposing combination interventions is an attractive strategy for OA (Fig. 1). This combination therapy model relies on the efficacy of all the components for the outcome; critically, that pharmacological symptom improvement should allow people to gain maximal benefit by enabling physical therapies and improve outcome. Novel trial design remains challenging in OA and is crucial in testing such complex interventions, but also in assessing meaningful outcomes, and effect size, where changes may only occur over several years. 1
Effective therapies for OA are likely to involve a combination of therapies modifying joint structures and modulating pain symptoms

### Patient benefit-risk in arthritis – a rheumatologist's perspective [^112e2Pi2]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients suffering from RA or OA require a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment modalities to manage their condition.

As physicians, our aim is to control pain, optimize function and modify the disease process as much as we are able to. In RA, we aim to stop disease progression as well as reducing pain and maintaining functionality. In OA, although there is, as yet, no treatment to halt the processes of degeneration and inflammation, we can aim to reduce joint pain and inflammation while improving and maintaining joint function. We have a range of options at our disposal to help us achieve these goals: ranging from exercise and weight loss to oral analgesics, IA therapies, DMARDs, including the biologicals and surgery.

When we meet an individual who is experiencing pain and loss of function due to arthritis, gastrointestinal (GI) care may not always be at the forefront of our minds. Yet, it is an important element to take into consideration in those patients to whom we prescribe treatment with NSAIDs including both non-selective NSAIDs and Cox-2 selective inhibitors.

As rheumatologists, we are constantly making decisions about which of these options represents the best treatment for an individual with arthritis. We have many factors to consider. To choose the most beneficial management option, we need to take into account comorbid disorders in the patient and constitutional factors such as obesity. The choice of treatment is affected by suitability, availability, practicality, safety and costs.

In this article, the benefit–risk associated with non-selective NSAIDs and Cox-2 selective inhibitors is reviewed and the balance between GI and other risks associated with these treatments is examined.

### Safely managing acute osteoarthritis in the emergency department: an evidence-based review [^112bfsuv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Joint pain caused by acute osteoarthritis (OA) is a common finding in the emergency department. Patients with OA often have debilitating pain that limits their function and ability to complete their activities of daily living. In addition, OA has been associated with a high percentage of arthritis-related hospital admissions and an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Safely managing OA symptoms in these patients can present many challenges to the emergency provider.

Objectives

We review the risks and benefits of available treatment options for acute OA-related pain in the emergency department. In addition, evidence-based recommendations will be made for safely managing pain and disability associated with OA in patients with comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Discussion

Commonly used treatments for OA include acetaminophen, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids, each with varying degrees of efficacy and risk depending on the patient's underlying comorbidities. Effective alternative therapies, such as topical preparations, intra-articular corticosteroid injections, bracing, and rehabilitation are likely underused in this setting.

Conclusions

Emergency providers should be aware of the risks and benefits of all treatment options available for acute OA pain, including oral medications, topical preparations, corticosteroid injections, bracing, and physical therapy.

### Pharmacological pain management in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a narrative literature review [^116DG4WL]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune-mediated condition, characterised by persistent synovial inflammation (particularly of the hand and feet small joints, although any synovial joint can be affected). Raised inflammatory markers and autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies) are common. Contemporary RA management focuses on treat-to-target strategies. These involve measuring disease activity regularly — often using the Disease Activity Score for 28-Joint Counts (DAS28), which represents a composite score combining information on swollen and tender joint counts, the patient global assessment of disease activity, and inflammatory markers — and increasing treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) until the "target" of remission or low disease activity is achieved. The high prevalence of RA (which affects approximately 0.8% of adults in England, and 17.6 million people globally, and is rising in both contexts) and far-reaching personal and economic impacts (including increased disability and unemployment) mean that optimising the care patients with RA receive is a clinical priority.

### Therapeutic advances in rheumatoid arthritis [^116KUTDw]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common immune mediated inflammatory diseases. People with rheumatoid arthritis present with pain, swelling, and stiffness that typically affects symmetrically distributed small and large joints. Without effective treatment, significant joint damage, disability, and work loss develop, owing to chronic inflammation of the joint lining (synovium). Over the past 25 years, the management of this condition has been revolutionized, resulting in substantially higher levels of disease remission and better long term outcomes. This improvement reflects a paradigm shift towards early and aggressive pharmacological intervention coupled with a proliferation in treatment choice, in turn related to enhanced pathobiological understanding and the advent of new drugs for rheumatoid arthritis. Following an overview of these developments from a historical perspective, and with a general audience in mind, this review focuses on newer, targeted treatments in an ever evolving landscape. The review highlights ongoing areas of debate and unmet need, including the proportion of patients with persistent, difficult-to-treat disease, despite recent advances. Also discussed are personalized, strategic approaches to individual patients, the role for imaging in clinical decision making, and the goal of sustained, drug free remission and disease prevention in the future.

### Joint pain and arthritis… [^113eEVxL]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Joint Pain and Arthritis Chronic pain caused by arthritis affects millions of people in the United States every year. About one in four adults with arthritis — 15 million people — report experiencing severe joint pain related to arthritis. 1 Additionally, nearly half of adults with arthritis have persistent pain. 2 Children with arthritis have pain as well. There is limited information about pain in children in the general population. Learn about statistics on arthritis-related severe joint pain in the United States, and recommended pain management strategies that can help people with arthritis control their pain. Defining Pain Severe joint pain: When an individual rates his or her pain as 7 or higher out of 10 on a scale of 0 to 10. Persistent pain: When an individual reports having pain on most or all days in the past 3 months.

Arthritis-related severe joint pain affects adults of all ages, both sexes, and all races and ethnicities. Pain management strategies should be flexible and tailored to meet the needs of the patient. Physical activity and self-management education programs improve quality of life. CDC's Efforts to Reduce Arthritis Pain CDC supports programs for people with arthritis so they can work and do other daily activities, have less pain, manage their own care, and prevent or delay disability. CDC research related to pain includes:

- Studies examining how adults with arthritis prefer to manage their pain.
- Analyses of the effectiveness of community-based programs in reducing pain and improving quality of life.

The combined efforts and partnerships of CDC's funded programs have made proven arthritis-appropriate self-management education workshops and physical activity intervention programs available to more than 200, 000 adults in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and one territory — American Samoa.

### Multinational evidence-based recommendations for pain management by pharmacotherapy in inflammatory arthritis: integrating systematic literature research and expert opinion of a broad panel of rheumatologists in the 3e initiative [^112mpkKa]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Following presentation of the SLR results, each of the 15 national scientific committees produced recommendations regarding the 11 clinical questions and a provisional algorithm for the pharmacological management of pain in IA. At the final international meeting, the members of each of the scientific committees merged the national recommendations into 11 final recommendations and a treatment algorithm via a process of discussion and a modified Delphi vote.

The participating rheumatologists quantified their agreement with each recommendation and the potential impact of each recommendation on their clinical practice. The level of evidence for each component of the recommendations was appraised, and each recommendation was graded in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Where there was ambiguity regarding the appropriate grade or level of evidence, a lower grade or level was chosen.

### Pharmacological pain management in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a narrative literature review [^1137nMkn]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In patients with active RA, there is substantial evidence that DMARDs and short-term glucocorticoids improve pain. However, in a real-world setting many patients receiving DMARDs have persistent pain and receive long-term opioids and gabapentinoids despite absent trial evidence for efficacy. The reasons for this divergence between practice and evidence are not fully understood; they may reflect patients' and clinicians' beliefs about analgesics, which need evaluating in new qualitative research. As an absence of evidence does not mean analgesics are invariably ineffective, new high-quality trials of analgesic efficacy in contemporary RA populations are needed to better understand their relative benefits. Finally, there should be a greater focus on pain management within RA guidelines. In contrast to synovitis and inflammation — which can be simply and objectively measured in routine practice — the subjective, multi-factorial, and multidimensional nature of pain makes this a substantially more challenging outcome to improve.

### Therapeutic ultrasound for chronic pain management in joints: a systematic review [^115nb2Ev]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatments for joint pain and dysfunction focus on restoration of joint motion, improvement in pain and a return to the previous level of the patient's daily activity. Therapeutic ultrasound is a noninvasive modality widely utilized in the management of musculoskeletal disorders. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic ultrasound in the management of patients with knee, shoulder and hip pain.

Methods

Using PRISMA guidelines, a search of the PubMed, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), Web of Science and Scopus databases was performed to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated therapeutic ultrasound (continuous and pulsed) in patients with chronic knee, shoulder and hip pain.

Results

The search strategy identified 8 trials for knee, 7 trials for shoulder and 0 trials for hip that met the criteria for inclusion. All 8 trials showed improvement in knee pain, and of these studies 3 showed statistical significance improvement for therapeutic ultrasound versus the comparator. For shoulder pain, all 7 trials showed reduction in pain, but should be noted that 4 of studies demonstrated that therapeutic ultrasound is inferior to the comparator modality.

Conclusion

Therapeutic ultrasound is frequently used in the treatment of knee, shoulder and hip pain and is often combined with other physiotherapeutic modalities. The literature on knee arthritis is most robust, with some evidence supporting therapeutic ultrasound, though the delivery method of ultrasound (pulsed vs continuous) is controversial. As a monotherapy, ultrasound treatment may not have a significant impact on functional improvement but can be a reasonable adjunct to consider with other common modalities. In all three pain syndromes, especially for hip pain, further trials are needed to define the true effect of low-intensity ultrasound therapy knee, shoulder and hip pain. No conclusive recommendations may be made for optimal settings or session duration.

### Osteoarthritis treatment guidelines from six professional societies: similarities and differences [^111oSURj]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the high prevalence and burden of osteoarthritis (OA) worldwide, management of OA continues to primarily focus on symptom management due to the lack of approved pharmacologic agents that halt disease progression. Recent recommendations from 6 professional societies support the importance of education, self-management approaches, weight loss, and physical modalities in managing OA. These recent guidelines also highlight the paucity of effective and safe treatment options, with recommendations against ineffective therapies outnumbering those for effective ones. NSAIDs, oral and topical, remain the primary recommended pharmacologic management option for OA.

Despite its growing prevalence, osteoarthritis (OA) remains a poorly understood disease, and recent doubts about the safety of several commonly prescribed OA medications have served to highlight deficiencies in the traditional medical approach to management. This article presents a general outline for the management of the patient who has OA in the form of a narrative review considering diagnosis, investigation, and treatment. It provides the clinician with an overview of the available treatments in line with the guidelines of the Osteoarthritis Research Society International and the European League Against Rheumatism.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the United States (US), and its prevalence is increasing. Pain is the hallmark symptom of OA, often driving individuals to seek medical attention and contributing to functional limitations, reducing quality of life, and increasing the overall healthcare burden. Joint pain in OA is complex and incompletely understood, particularly as pain does not consistently correlate with observed structural joint damage. It can be a product of multiple factors, including peripheral/central sensitization and individual patient characteristics. These factors can further complicate the treatment of OA.

As OA can involve multiple joints and is progressive in nature, treatment is often dynamic and long term. Clinical guidelines for the management of OA are joint-specific and increasingly personalized, taking into account each patient's comorbidity profile, concerns, goals, and personal situation. Treatment for OA is generally focused on alleviating pain and reducing functional impairment through nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and surgical interventions.

The data in the presented treatment analysis were collected in 2017 as part of the Adelphi Disease Specific Programme (DSP). At the time, both the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR)guidelines for the nonsurgical management of hip and knee OA strongly recommended aerobic/resistance land-based exercise, water-based exercise, and weight loss (for overweight patients only) as appropriate nonpharmacologic therapies. This was to be conducted alongside the receipt of medications, if required, including acetaminophen (for those without comorbidities), oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs [for those without comorbidities]; preferably topical for the knee), and intra-articular corticosteroids. A number of other nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches are recommended in each of these guidelines.

### Multinational evidence-based recommendations for pain management by pharmacotherapy in inflammatory arthritis: integrating systematic literature research and expert opinion of a broad panel of rheumatologists in the 3e initiative [^1143zZda]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory arthritis (IA) affects up to 3% of the population and is characterized by pain, stiffness, loss of function and impaired quality of life. Despite recent advances in the management of IA, pain remains a common experience for IA patients, who report pain management to be their highest priority.

The 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative is a multinational collaboration aimed at promoting evidence-based practice in rheumatology by developing practical recommendations that address important clinical problems. The objective of the 2010 3e Initiative was to develop recommendations for the use of pharmacotherapy in the management of pain in patients with IA by integrating systematically generated evidence with the expertise of a broad panel of international rheumatologists.

### Guidelines for management of osteoarthritis published by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism: why are they so different? [^116A5Ntj]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Because of different methodology the ACR and EULAR guidelines differ significantly in their recommendations despite an identical evidence base. Guidelines that use a strictly evidence-based approach are less likely to incur bias than those that rely more on expert consensus. Although expert consensus is useful in areas in which there are little trial data, clear delineation should be made between evidence-based statements and expert opinion. Following the dissemination of guidelines for the management of OA, emphasis should now be placed on discussion and implementation of the recommendations and subsequent revision of guidelines as new evidence comes to light.

### Recommendations of the OARSI FDA osteoarthritis devices working group [^113dFZ4r]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis and a major cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain and functional disability. While both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic modalities are recommended in the management of OA, when patients with hip or knee OA do not obtain adequate pain relief and/or functional improvement, joint replacement surgery or other surgical interventions should be considered. Total joint arthroplasties are reliable and cost-effective treatments for patients with significant OA of the hip and knee. Evidence from cohort and observational studies has confirmed substantial improvements in pain relief with cumulative revision rates at 10 years following total hip (THA) and total knee arthroplasties (TKA) at 7% and 10%, respectively. Joint replacements have been used in most every synovial joint, although results for joints other than hip and knee replacement have not been as successful. The evolution of new device designs and surgical techniques highlights the need to better understand the risk to benefit ratio for different joint replacements and to identify the appropriate methodology for evaluating the efficacy and optimal outcomes of these new devices, designed to treat OA joints.

Regarding medical management for chronic arthritic pain, more specifically with respect to analgesic therapy, CDC 2016 guidelines recommend to implement nonpharmacologic therapy and non-opioid analgesics as first-line treatment for chronic non-cancer pain. Consider opioid therapy only if expected benefits for both pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. If opioids are used, consider combining with nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy, as appropriate.

### Core recommendations for osteoarthritis care: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^11432LrE]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that can affect any joint, but it most commonly occurs in the hip, knee, and hand. Symptoms often include joint pain, stiffness, and reduced range of movement. OA affects 303 million people worldwide, with prevalence expected to increase with aging populations and rising obesity rates globally. OA is a leading cause of pain and disability among adults worldwide and inflicts a significant burden on the individuals affected, including activity limitations and reduced quality of life. OA is associated with substantial direct health care costs due to health care visits, diagnostic procedures, medications and surgery, and indirect costs related to lost workplace productivity.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Eleven clinical practice guidelines for osteoarthritis (OA) were appraised as high quality.
Consistent recommendations were that care should be patient centered and include exercise, education, and weight loss (where appropriate). Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and surgical interventions are recommended for disabling OA that had not improved with nonsurgical care. Hand orthoses should be recommended for patients with hand OA.
To implement recommendations in practice, future priorities include identifying core skill sets and competencies among health care workers, developing training/education resources, and creating a framework to improve quality of OA care.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are a set of health care recommendations developed by reviewing scientific literature and consensus from an expert panel. The aim of CPGs is to guide health care decision‐making, thereby reducing practice variability and improving patient outcomes. Several global CPGs have been published in recent years for the management of OA. These typically include nonpharmacologic (e.g. exercise and education), pharmacologic (e.g. acetaminophen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), and surgical options such as total joint replacement. However, uptake of recommendations from CPGs into practice is variable, especially for first‐line, nonpharmacologic treatments such as exercise. Gaps between evidence and practice may in part be due to a lack of clarity about what is being recommended and conflicting recommendations across different CPGs, a situation exacerbated when CPGs for OA are not developed rigorously and their recommendations are less trustworthy. As CPGs are costly to develop, this is an inefficient use of resources and further adds to the confusion for clinicians. To encourage the uptake of evidence and delivery of appropriate OA care, clinicians require clear, consistent management recommendations.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that presents as a symmetrical polyarthritis characterised by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. It can affect any synovial joint in the body, most commonly starting in the small joints of the hands and feet, with the potential to impact every aspect of daily living. High levels of inflammation are associated with fatigue and impairment of participation in occupational, recreational, and societal roles. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect men, women, and children at any age, but is 2–3 times more likely to occur in women and is more common with increasing age, with onset most often occurring at 60–70 years of age. Without adequate treatment, the disease can lead to progressive joint destruction and deformity, causing long-term disability, chronic pain, and premature death.

Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis has improved considerably over time, leading to better health outcomes. However, access to treatment varies globally and substantial inequities exist. The optimal management of rheumatoid arthritis involves early diagnosis within a 3-month window of opportunity and treatment with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), using a treat-to-target management approach in which treatment is intensified according to disease activity measures until a state of low disease activity or disease remission is reached. The addition of, or switch to, biological DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs can be considered if there is severe disease or ongoing disease activity with first-line therapies. However, biological and targeted synthetic DMARDs are expensive and access to treatment varies globally. Methotrexate is a low-cost conventional synthetic DMARD and, when started early at effective doses, can control disease activity and minimise long-term disability and mortality. When diagnosis and access to specialist care is delayed, people with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to have both short-term and long-term disability.

### Register-based observational study of associations between inflammatory remission, formal treatment targets and the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs among patients with early rheumatoid arthritis [^113czPSn]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease that may lead to irreversible joint damage and permanent functional impairment. The primary goal in the management of RA is to suppress the inflammatory process and to prevent, or at least delay, the development of structural joint damage. This approach is formally expressed in the treat-to-target recommendations of an international task force, which states that clinical remission is the primary target for treatment of RA, while low disease activity (LDA) may be an acceptable alternative. The recommendations further state that drug therapy should be adjusted until the desired target is reached.

The development of new and effective antirheumatic treatments during recent decades has made these goals achievable in a larger part of patients with RA. In the wake of this therapeutical development, however, other outcomes than inflammatory disease activity have gained increasing importance. One of these is the management of pain, which is frequently rated as a top priority for patients with RA. For some patients, pain seems to become uncoupled from the underlying inflammatory condition during the course of the disease, potentially manifesting as persistent arthralgia with high tender joint counts (TJC)or as chronic widespread pain, also in patients with low or no inflammatory disease activity. While disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are pivotal to halt the inflammatory process in RA, the management of non-inflammatory pain primarily involves non-pharmacological interventions such as educational activities, exercise and psychological interventions.

### Pharmacological pain management in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a narrative literature review [^116a9iyJ]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain is a major challenge for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with many people suffering chronic pain. Current RA management guidelines focus on assessing and reducing disease activity using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Consequently, pain care is often suboptimal, with growing evidence that analgesics are widely prescribed to patients with RA, despite potential toxicities and limited evidence for efficacy. Our review provides an overview of pharmacological treatments for pain in patients with RA, summarising their efficacy and use.

Findings

Thirteen systematic reviews of drug efficacy for pain in patients with RA were included in this review. These showed moderate- to high-quality evidence from clinical trials in more contemporary time-periods (mainly 1990s/2000s for synthetic DMARDs and post-2000 for biological/targeted synthetic DMARDs) that, in patients with active RA, short-term glucocorticoids and synthetic, biologic, and targeted synthetic DMARDs have efficacy at reducing pain intensity relative to placebo. In contrast, they showed low-quality evidence from trials in more historical time-periods (mainly in the 1960s–1990s for opioids and paracetamol) that (aside from naproxen) analgesics/neuromodulators provide any improvements in pain relative to placebo, and no supportive evidence for gabapentinoids, or long-term opioids. Despite this evidence base, 21 studies of analgesic prescribing in patients with RA consistently showed substantial and sustained prescribing of analgesics, particularly opioids, with approximately one quarter and > 40% of patients receiving chronic opioid prescriptions in each year in England and North America, respectively. Whilst NSAID prescribing had fallen over time across countries, gabapentinoid prescribing in England had risen from < 1% of patients in 2004 to approximately 10% in 2020. Prescribing levels varied substantially between individual clinicians and groups of patients.

Conclusions

In patients with active RA, DMARDs have efficacy at reducing pain, supporting the role of treat-to-target strategies. Despite limited evidence that analgesics improve pain in patients with RA, these medicines are widely prescribed. The reasons for this are unclear. We consider that closing this evidence-to-practice gap requires qualitative research exploring the drivers of this practice, high-quality trials of analgesic efficacy in contemporary RA populations, alongside an increased focus on pain management (including pharmacological and non-pharmacological options) within RA guidelines.

### Remaining pain in early rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with methotrexate [^113Rinvf]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease associated with joint destruction, functional impairment, and chronic pain 1. In spite of effective immune‐suppressive therapies, observational studies show that a large number of patients continue to have significant pain, which is known to affect both quality of life and work capacity 2. In an international observational study of patient‐reported outcomes, the majority of the cohorts with established RA in Europe (60%) and the US (65%) reported discontent with pain management 3. In early arthritis, active joint inflammation causes a significant burden of pain. However, several earlier observations indicate an uncoupling of pain and joint inflammation during the disease course and show that pain may persist in inflammatory remission 4, 5. These findings indicate that pain, not directly related to inflammation, may be insufficiently controlled by antirheumatic drugs, and there is a lack of earlier studies of the pain pattern related to treatment response in early RA. In a population‐based cohort of incident RA cases receiving standard care, we have investigated the frequency and possible predictors of remaining pain after 3 months of treatment with methotrexate (MTX) initiated at the time of diagnosis, with special focus on patients with a good clinical response.

### Common elective orthopaedic procedures and their clinical effectiveness: umbrella review of level 1 evidence [^112RZNW2]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

About 200 musculoskeletal conditions have a substantial effect on the quality of life of millions of people in the UK and are associated with increased healthcare costs. According to the World Health Organization, the most common and disabling musculoskeletal conditions are osteoarthritis, back and neck pain, fractures associated with fragility of the bone, injuries, and systemic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Musculoskeletal conditions are typically characterised by persistent pain and restricted mobility. According to the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study, musculoskeletal conditions were the biggest contributor to global disability. Although many musculoskeletal conditions can be managed in primary care through a combination of core interventions such as exercise, weight management, physical therapies, psychological therapies, and drug treatment, some patients who do not respond to conservative measures need specialist care, surgical care, or both. In the UK, musculoskeletal conditions account for more than 25% of all surgical interventions in the National Health Service (NHS).

Total joint replacement is one of the most common elective orthopaedic procedures performed worldwide for end stage osteoarthritis, the most common musculoskeletal condition. Although total joint replacement is considered to be a clinically effective intervention for the management of osteoarthritis, it also accounts for enormous expenditures in the health system. The term "clinical effectiveness" is about ensuring that healthcare practice is based on the best available data and evidence of effectiveness. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) defines the "clinical effectiveness of a treatment" as how beneficial the treatment is under usual or everyday conditions, compared with doing nothing or opting for another type of care. Randomised controlled trials are considered the best method to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of an intervention. They deliver the highest level of evidence owing to their potential to minimise bias. Concerns have been expressed that many orthopaedic surgical interventions, as well as prostheses used in these interventions, do not have readily available or high quality evidence on their clinical effectiveness to support their use. A recent review found that 24% of all hip replacement implants available to surgeons in the UK did not have evidence for their clinical effectiveness. Although clinical guidelines, defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances", aim to be informed by the best available evidence, they have often been criticised for their lack of methodological rigour and applicability. A critical appraisal of existing treatment guidelines for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International's Treatment Guidelines Committee observed that the overall quality of existing guidelines was suboptimal and consensus recommendations were not always supported by the best available evidence.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^114Q4RMC]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis guideline — introduction describes that osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 302 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of disability among older adults, with the knees, hips, and hands the most commonly affected appendicular joints. OA is characterized by whole-joint pathology including cartilage degradation, bone remodeling, osteophyte formation, and synovial inflammation, leading to pain, stiffness, swelling, and loss of normal joint function. Patients with OA are likely to be treated with a number of different pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions, often in combination, and while some principles apply to all patients, some recommendations are specific to particular joints such as the hip, knee, patellofemoral joint, and first carpometacarpal joint (CMC), or to particular patient populations such as those with erosive OA.

### Does paracetamol (acetaminophen) reduce the pain of osteoarthritis? A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113BDPMv]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the best available evidence for efficacy of paracetamol (acetaminophen) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Scientific Citation Index, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and conference abstracts in the past 2 years from the British Society for Rheumatology, the European League Against Rheumatism, the American College of Rheumatology, and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Subjects

10 RCTs including 1712 patients with either symptomatic OA of the knee (6 trials) or hip/knee (3 trials) or multiple joints (1 trial).

Main Outcome Measures

(a). effect size (ES) for pain, stiffness, and functional scores from baseline to end point; (b). rate ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for clinical response rate and patient preference for treatment.

Results

Paracetamol was effective in relieving pain due to OA (ES = 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.41). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were better than paracetamol for pain relief (ES = 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.30). Clinical response rate was higher with NSAIDs than with paracetamol (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.41), and the number of patients who preferred NSAIDs was more than twice the number of those preferring paracetamol (RR = 2.46, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.12). NSAIDs were associated with more frequent gastrointestinal discomfort than paracetamol (RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.75).

Conclusion

Paracetamol is an effective agent for pain relief due to OA. Although safer, it is less effective than NSAIDs. For safety reasons paracetamol should be the first line treatment, with NSAIDs reserved for those who do not respond.

### Osteoarthritis year in review 2019: epidemiology and therapy [^112y77WS]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the past year many studies and clinical trials have been published in the osteoarthritis (OA) field. This review is based on systematic literature review covering the period May 1 st, 2018 to April 19 th, 2019; the final selection of articles was subjective. Specifically those articles considered to be presenting novel insights and of potential importance for clinical practice, are discussed. Further evidence has emerged that OA is a serious disease with increasing impact worldwide. Our understanding of development of pain in OA has increased. Detailed studies investigating widely used pharmacological treatments have shown the benefits to be limited, whereas the risks seem higher than expected, suggesting further studies and reconsideration of currently used guidelines. Promising new pharmacological treatments have been developed and published, however subsequent studies are warranted. While waiting for new treatment modalities to appear joint replacement is an effective alternative; new data have become available on how long they might last.

### Needs and opportunities in the assessment and treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee and hip: the view of the rheumatologist [^112X7m4s]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2009). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis represents a major therapeutic challenge to medical and health-care providers. In part, this is related to the limited tools that are available for assessing the structural state of joint tissues and to the lack of effective therapies to alter the natural history of osteoarthritis progression. From a clinical and pathologic perspective, osteoarthritis is not a homogeneous disorder, and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms differ among individuals. Even in the same individual, the pathologic processes and etiologic mechanisms may differ at specific stages of disease progression. In the development of strategies for effective intervention, several issues need to be considered. First, the stage of osteoarthritis progression must be considered. Therapies that are effective prior to the development of structural alterations may have limited utility in later stages. Similarly, treatments for late-stage osteoarthritis need to be adapted and adjusted to target specific symptoms that are amenable to modification. Despite the limited therapeutic options available for the treatment of osteoarthritis, there are interventions that have been shown to be beneficial. These include preventive strategies as well as specific interventions, such as the judicious use of analgesic medications for the control of pain. It is essential to develop an integrated multidisciplinary approach to osteoarthritis; this approach should be one that involves medical and surgical specialists as well as other health-care providers. In addition, further clinical and basic-science research is needed so that improved and more effective therapies for osteoarthritis as well as better methods for monitoring and assessing the efficacy of treatment interventions can be developed.

Conclusion

Although highly effective for relieving pain, oral nonselective NSAIDs are associated with serious AEs;–however, this risk may be reduced with the use of topical NSAID formulations. It is important that pain specialists are aware of changes in recommendations for use of oral and topical NSAIDs, based on recent OA guidelines. Topical NSAIDs provide a well-tolerated alternative approach to achieving pain relief with minimal risk of serious AEs. In patients with OA, topical NSAIDs have been shown to have superior efficacy compared with placebo and equivalent efficacy compared with oral NSAIDs, with no increase in the risk of serious AEs. These data suggest that the reduced incidence of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal AEs observed with the use of topical NSAIDs may make them useful in patients who are at high risk.

Optimal management of the pain associated with OA requires awareness and selection of the pharmacologic treatments and non-pharmacologic interventions that best meet a given patient's needs. For patients with OA of the knee or hand, the elderly, or those with certain comorbidities, topical NSAIDs may be the most effective tool for pain management, particularly because of the lower risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular AEs. The recommendations included in the newly updated American College of Rheumatology treatment guidelines regarding the use of topical NSAIDs in the treatment of OA of the knee or hand and in the elderly will be helpful in guiding pain specialists around the world on best practices in OA treatment in this population.

### Osteoarthritis [^113S1kXC]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a heterogeneous disorder that is increasingly prevalent largely due to aging and obesity, resulting in a major disease burden worldwide. Knowledge about the underlying aetiology has improved, with increased understanding of the role of genetic factors, the microbiome, and existence of different pain mechanisms. However, this knowledge has not yet been translated into new treatment options. New evidence has questioned the efficacy of recommended treatments, such as therapeutic exercise programmes and the focus on weight loss, but managing obesity and maintaining activity remain important for the prevention and management of osteoarthritis. Approaches should consider individual and cultural preferences and resource availability to increase patient and community engagement, and optimise outcomes worldwide. Most of the focus has been on established osteoarthritis where management is primarily directed at relieving symptoms. The search for the much needed effective treatments that improve both symptoms and structure, often referred to as disease-modifying osteoarthritic drugs, is ongoing. Promising data indicate that targeting inflammation is effective in hand osteoarthritis.

Regarding medical management for ankle osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to management of pain, pharmacotherapy, EULAR 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacological and joint-specific pain treatment, if indicated, according to established recommendations. Ask about the patient's existing use of prescribed and OTC analgesics, including homeopathic remedies, and check if the dosage and frequency of use are safe. Refer for further specialist or medical advice if additional pharmacological treatment may be indicated.

Usual care context for nonpharmacologic osteoarthritis recommendations — Unless otherwise specified, recommendations regarding physical, psychosocial, and mind-body approaches assume that the patient will be adding the intervention to usual care. For the purposes of the guideline, usual care includes the use of maximally recommended or safely tolerated doses of over-the- counter nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or acetaminophen, as has generally been explicitly permitted in clinical trials of nonpharmacologic interventions.

### Pain management in rheumatology research, training, and practice [^113F4vHf]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The Pain Management Task Force of the American College of Rheumatology published a report in 2010 highlighting pain management as a fundamental aspect of clinical practice, training and research. In the interim, the consideration of pain as a focus of attention of rheumatologists and rheumatology health professionals has become even more challenging than in 2010 because of the epidemic of opiate addiction and overdose death. The characterisation of categories of pain by mechanism (e.g., inflammation, joint degeneration, abnormalities of central pain processing) can help guide treatment. However, such categorisation can overlook the overlap of these processes and their interaction to create mixed pain states. Further complicating the assessment of pain, outcome measures in rheumatic disease often assess the degree of pain indirectly while concentrating on the quantification of inflammation. Non-inflammatory pain often persists despite treatment, highlighting the need for alternative analgesic therapies. Recommended therapies include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and stimulators of the pain inhibitory pathway. Each of these non-opioid therapies has incomplete efficacy and potential toxicities that can limit their utility. Non-pharmacologic therapies can show efficacy that rivals or surpasses pharmacologic therapies in the control of pain and improving function in a variety of rheumatic disorders including chronic low back pain and fibromyalgia. A limitation of the use of these therapies is inadequate training and appreciation of their benefits. Furthermore, the supply of trained practitioners to provide non-pharmacological care and support patient efforts for self-management is often limited. Together, these considerations suggest the importance of a renewed effort to implement task force recommendations.

Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis is a common complaint of many elderly patients in primary care offices. For those unable or unwilling to undergo knee replacement, the primary practitioners' understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the available treatment modalities for pain relief is critical to successful in-office counseling and expectation management. Treatment requires a multimodal approach of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies to achieve a maximal clinical benefit. The focus of this review is on the nonsurgical options for treatment of knee osteoarthritis in patients aged 65 and older.

Comorbidities and multimodal osteoarthritis management, with pharmacologic selection principle — When choosing among pharmacologic therapies, management should begin with treatments with the least systemic exposure or toxicity. Patients may experience a variety of additional symptoms as a result of the pain and functional limitations arising from OA and/or comorbidities, including mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety, altered sleep, chronic widespread pain, and impaired coping skills. The Patient Panel noted that the broader impact of OA on these comorbidities is of particular importance when choosing among treatment options and best addressed by a multimodal treatment plan, rather than one that is limited to the prescription of a single medication. Measures aimed at improving mood, reducing stress, addressing insomnia, managing weight, and enhancing fitness may improve the patient's overall well-being and OA treatment success, and interventions that have proven beneficial in the management of chronic pain may prove useful in OA even when data specific to patients with OA are limited.

### Multinational evidence-based recommendations for pain management by pharmacotherapy in inflammatory arthritis: integrating systematic literature research and expert opinion of a broad panel of rheumatologists in the 3e initiative [^114d4EDo]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Results

In total, 49 242 references were identified, from which 167 studies were included in the SLRs. The 11 final multinational recommendations are listed in Table 1 with the levels of evidence and grade of recommendation. The level of agreement by the participants with the recommendations ranged from 8.5 to 9.3 (mean 8.9) on a 1–10 point scale, where 10 represents full agreement (Table 1).

T1
Multinational recommendations on pain management by pharmacotherapy in IA

Recommendation 1

In patients with IA, pain should be measured routinely using one of the following validated scales: VAS, NRS or VRS; in addition, consider multi-dimensional measures or site-specific tools as needed.

Fifty-one studies were identified that evaluated a total of 20 tools that have been used in the setting of IA (predominantly RA) to measure patient-reported pain. The visual analogue scale (VAS) for overall pain intensity is currently the best evaluated pain measure in RA, but the related single-item measures, numerical rating scale (NRS) and verbal rating scale (VRS) demonstrated comparable clinimetric properties.

There was a consensus among the experts that measurement of pain is an important component of routine clinical care in patients with IA. Pain scales that measure overall pain (such as VAS, NRS or VRS) were felt to be most useful. It was recognized that multi-dimensional tools, which measure different characteristics of the phenomenon of pain, and tools limited to specific anatomical sites are also useful in certain clinical or research situations, but are not required in routine practice.

Recommendation 2

Paracetamol is recommended for the treatment of persistent pain in patients with IA.

Data from 12 short-term randomized controlled trials (RCTs) at high risk of bias provided weak evidence for a benefit of paracetamol over placebo and an additive benefit of paracetamol in combination with NSAIDs. Heterogeneity among the trials prevented meta-analysis. No important safety signals were identified in subjects treated with standard doses of paracetamol.

### Exercise for osteoarthritis of the knee [^112AjDBn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health issue causing chronic pain, impaired physical function, and reduced quality of life. As there is no cure, self-management of symptoms via exercise is recommended by all current international clinical guidelines. This review updates one published in 2015.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the effects of land-based exercise for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) by comparing: 1) exercise versus attention control or placebo; 2) exercise versus no treatment, usual care, or limited education; 3) exercise added to another co-intervention versus the co-intervention alone.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), together with reference lists, from the date of the last search (1st May 2013) until 4 January 2024, unrestricted by language.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated exercise for knee OA versus a comparator listed above. Our outcomes of interest were pain severity, physical function, quality of life, participant-reported treatment success, adverse events, and study withdrawals.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane for systematic reviews of interventions.

Main Results

We included 139 trials (12,468 participants): 30 (3065 participants) compared exercise to attention control or placebo; 60 (4834 participants) compared exercise with usual care, no intervention or limited education; and 49 (4569 participants) evaluated exercise added to another intervention (e.g. weight loss diet, physical therapy, detailed education) versus that intervention alone. Interventions varied substantially in duration, ranging from 2 to 104 weeks. Most of the trials were at unclear or high risk of bias, in particular, performance bias (94% of trials), detection bias (94%), selective reporting bias (68%), selection bias (57%), and attrition bias (48%). Exercise versus attention control/placebo Compared with attention control/placebo, low-certainty evidence indicates exercise may result in a slight improvement in pain immediately post-intervention (mean 8.70 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.70 to 11.70; 28 studies, 2873 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence indicates exercise likely results in an improvement in physical function (mean 11.27 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 7.64 to 15.09; 24 studies, 2536 participants), but little to no improvement in quality of life (mean 6.06 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI -0.13 to 12.26; 6 studies, 454 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that exercise likely increases participant-reported treatment success (risk ratio (RR) 1.46, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.92; 2 studies 364 participants), and likely does not increase study withdrawals (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.26; 29 studies, 2907 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that exercise may not increase adverse events (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.58; 11 studies, 1684 participants). Exercise versus no treatment/usual care/limited education Compared with no treatment/usual care/limited education, low-certainty evidence indicates exercise may result in an improvement in pain immediately post-intervention (mean 13.14 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 10.36 to 15.91; 56 studies, 4184 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence indicates exercise likely results in an improvement in physical function (mean 12.53 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 9.74 to 15.31; 54 studies, 4352 participants) and a slight improvement in quality of life (mean 5.37 points better (on a scale of to 100), 95% CI 3.19 to 7.54; 28 studies, 2328 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that exercise may result in no difference in participant-reported treatment success (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.49; 3 studies, 405 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that exercise likely results in no difference in study withdrawals (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.20; 53 studies, 4408 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that exercise may increase adverse events (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.17 to 8.57; 18 studies, 1557 participants). Exercise added to another co-intervention versus the co-intervention alone Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that exercise when added to a co-intervention likely results in improvements in pain immediately post-intervention compared to the co-intervention alone (mean 10.43 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 8.06 to 12.79; 47 studies, 4441 participants). It also likely results in a slight improvement in physical function (mean 9.66 points better, 95% CI 7.48 to 11.97 (on a 0 to 100 scale); 44 studies, 4381 participants) and quality of life (mean 4.22 points better (on a 0 to 100 scale), 95% CI 1.36 to 7.07; 12 studies, 1660 participants) immediately post-intervention. There was moderate-certainty evidence that exercise likely increases participant-reported treatment success (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.24; 6 studies, 1139 participants), slightly reduces study withdrawals (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.97; 41 studies, 3502 participants), and slightly increases adverse events (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.76; 19 studies, 2187 participants). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression We did not find any differences in effects between different types of exercise, and we found no relationship between changes in pain or physical function and the total number of exercise sessions prescribed or the ratio (between exercise group and comparator) of real-time consultations with a healthcare provider. Clinical significance of the findings To determine whether the results found would make a clinically meaningful difference to someone with knee OA, we compared our results to established 'minimal important difference' (MID) scores for pain (12 points on a 0 to 100 scale), physical function (13 points), and quality of life (15 points). We found that the confidence intervals of mean differences either did not reach these thresholds or included both a clinically important and clinically unimportant improvement.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low- to moderate-certainty evidence that exercise probably results in an improvement in pain, physical function, and quality of life in the short-term. However, based on the thresholds for minimal important differences that we used, these benefits were of uncertain clinical importance. Participants in most trials were not blinded and were therefore aware of their treatment, and this may have contributed to reported improvements.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^115yBWuL]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review identified 43 studies, comparing 36 RCTs (7900 patients with OA at any joint) and 7 observational studies (218 074 participants). Topical NSAIDs reduced pain and improved function in patients with OA. Diclofenac patches were the most effective topical NSAID for pain relief. No serious AEs were observed in randomised trials or observational studies in the general population. However, confirmation of the CV safety of topical NSAIDs still warrants further observational study.

What is already known on this topic?

Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for the treatment of osteoarthritis by many guidelines.
There are a number of topical NSAIDs. However, their relative efficacy remains largely unknown because there are few head-to-head comparative trials.
The safety of topical NSAIDs remains unclear, especially its systemic side effects such as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events.

What are the new findings?

Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective to reduce pain and improve function in osteoarthritis.
Among all available topical NSAIDs, diclofenac patches were most effective for pain relief and piroxicam was the best option to improve function.
Other than salicylate gel, topical NSAIDs are safe. They are not associated with increased local or systemic adverse effects such as gastrointestinal and renal events; this can be concluded from both randomised trials and observational studies.

Consensus Points for NSAIDs

NSAIDs are an effective treatment for mild-to-moderate pain secondary to osteoarthritis knee pain; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Topical NSAIDs are recommended before oral treatments because of their lower systemic exposure/toxicity; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Topical diclofenac 70–81 mg/day should be considered as first-line pharmacological treatment for knee OA - can be effective and generally safer than oral NSAIDs due to reduced systemic exposure and lower dose; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
NSAIDs should not be used for patients with comorbidities due to risk of adverse events; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
NSAIDs should not be used on a long-term basis (> 3 months) due to side effect profile (cardiovascular and gastrointestinal) and lack safety data; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Celecoxib and non-selective NSAIDs are as effective as opioid for knee OA; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Due to low effect on pain and physical function, regardless of dose, the potential clinical benefit of opioids does not outweigh the potential harm in patients with knee OA; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong

### Feasibility of conducting a cohort randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of a nurse-led package of care for knee pain [^112Z14sq]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain due to OA is a leading cause of disability in older people. Those unable to self-manage their symptoms are likely to first seek help from their general practitioner (GP), accounting for an estimated 880 000 GP consultations annually, with the knee or hip the most commonly affected joints. Multiple international guidelines, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, recommend education, strengthening and aerobic exercise, and weight-loss guidance (where applicable) as core, first-line treatment for all patients with OA. Medical and lifestyle advice, analgesics and referral to physiotherapy and/or weight-loss support are available in the NHS primary care setting; however, non-pharmacological options are frequently underused, with an emphasis on analgesic prescription, including opioids. While adequate analgesia may aid exercise adherence, this has not been formally tested within a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients frequently express reluctance to take oral analgesia or NSAIDs for joint pain. Exercise therapy has similar effects on pain and function compared with oral NSAIDs and paracetamol, but primary care physiotherapy treatment sessions are often limited and episodic. Additionally, not all physiotherapists feel they have the knowledge, skills or time to provide effective weight management advice. Group-based rehabilitation for joint pain incorporating NICE guidelines is clinical and cost-effective, but not widely available.

Given the rising prevalence of OA and increasing pressure within primary care, it is important to determine whether long-term management can be delivered effectively by other health professionals. Nurse-led interventions to manage other conditions demonstrate equivalent or better outcomes compared with usual care, particularly where lifestyle modifications are important. Additional value from nurse-led care may arise from communication styles, long-term continuity of care and a focus on psychosocial context.

In phase 1 of this study, we trained nurses to deliver an individualized, non-pharmacological intervention for people with knee pain. This included holistic assessment of the person, individualized education, exercise and weight loss advice utilizing evidence-based behaviour change strategies. We demonstrated the intervention was acceptable to patients and could be delivered with a high degree of fidelity. The aim of this present study, phase 2, was to assess the feasibility of conducting a cohort RCT of the intervention. We also explored whether a future trial should provide pharmacological treatment before or after non-pharmacological treatment.

### Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or acetaminophen for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee? A systematic review of evidence and guidelines [^113FDzTe]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The interpretation of available evidence on the relative efficacy of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) and acetaminophen in osteoarthritis (OA) has recently been debated. This systematic review summarizes the available evidence on the efficacy of NSAID compared to acetaminophen, and compares the quality and content of clinical guidelines regarding the pharmacological treatment of OA.

Methods

Published reports of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and clinical guidelines were identified by a systematic search of bibliographic databases and relevant websites. The quality of RCT was assessed by 2 reviewers independently using a standardized checklist. Data from these RCT were used to calculate pooled differences between groups for pain and disability. The methodology of identified guidelines was appraised using the AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) instrument.

Results

The search strategy resulted in the identification of 5 RCT. Statistical pooling of data from 3 trials with adequate methods and sufficient data presentation resulted in a pooled standardized mean difference for general pain of 0.33 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.51), indicating a small effect in favor of NSAID. Pooled estimates for other outcome measures were smaller. Three of the 9 identified guidelines satisfied more AGREE criteria than others, particularly regarding rigor of development. Stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence were poorly described in most guidelines. The content of recommendations regarding the use of NSAID or acetaminophen was fairly consistent.

Conclusion

Acetaminophen is often effective in OA and is associated with fewer adverse reactions than NSAID. Available evidence supports the recommendations of recent guidelines to use acetaminophen as initial therapy for OA in addition to nonpharmacological interventions. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy of NSAID or acetaminophen in relevant subgroups of patients. We agree with guidelines that it is important that treatment is tailored to individual patients taking into account the severity of symptoms, previous use of acetaminophen, and the patient's knowledge, expectations, and preferences.

### Effectiveness and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis: network meta-analysis [^116DqX4k]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to prepare this article (see web-appendix 1 for protocol; PROSPERO registration CRD42020213656).

Eligibility criteria

We considered large randomised trials of patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis that compared any of the following interventions for pharmacological treatment of osteoarthritis pain: NSAIDs, opioids, paracetamol (acetaminophen), or placebo. Trials that included patients with other types of arthritis or joints other than knee or hip were only included if ≥ 75% of the patients had confirmed knee or hip osteoarthritis. Additionally, trials were required to have at least one follow-up measurement of pain or another algofunctional outcome. To reduce small study bias, we only included trials with an average of ≥ 100 participants randomised per arm. No publication status or year restriction was applied, but we limited the publication language to English.

Identification of trials

To identify eligible trials, we conducted searches on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), from inception to 30 June 2021, and Medline and Embase from inception to 28 June 2021 (web-appendix 2). We also manually searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and systematic reviews (web-appendix 3), and searched ClinicalTrials.gov. When data were incomplete, we searched for additional data on ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO approved trial registries, company specific trial registries, and documents available on the website of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Selection of studies and data extraction

Each trial was independently evaluated by two reviewers (BRdC, CAH, HDK, LG, MOA, MR, NSB, PB, PSC, PS, RH, SMI, TM, and TVP) for screening and data extraction. When disagreements occurred, a consensus was reached through discussion among reviewers or by consultation with a senior scholar. We screened trials for eligibility, extracted data, and developed consensus by using a standardised and piloted web based data management tool, accompanied by a codebook. We extracted trial characteristics, such as design, size and duration; intervention characteristics, such as dose and treatment duration; participant characteristics, such as mean age, sex, mean duration of symptoms, index joint; type of outcome (pain or function); and outcome data for each time point of interest. If necessary, we approximated summary statistics and measures of variability from graphs. When possible, results based on the intention-to-treat principle were extracted.

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^115AiWkh]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, conservatively affects 27 million adults in the USA based on 2005 population data. As many as one in two adults may develop symptomatic OA of the knee by age 85; however, among obese adults, the lifetime risk of developing OA increases to two in three.OA of the knee is one of the top five causes of disability, with 80% of patients with the condition experiencing some degree of movement limitation affecting activities of daily living. Treatment options for OA include both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic modalities. Non-pharmacologic modalities, such as exercise and weight-management programs, have been shown to be effective for overweight and obese patients experiencing OA in weight-bearing joints and should be utilized in conjunction with other therapies if possible.–Pharmacologic options, including orally administered acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are the most commonly utilized pharmacological options for OA. However, the risk of adverse events (AEs) with the administration of higher doses or prolonged treatment with these drugs can limit their use in some patients, particularly the elderly and those with existing hepatic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal conditions.

There are multiple approaches that can help in mitigating these risks while providing safe and effective treatment. One option is to combine analgesics with different mechanisms of action to allow for the utilization of lower doses of each active ingredient. For example, combining an NSAID (eg, etodolac or ibuprofen) with acetaminophen has been shown to effectively alleviate OA symptoms.–Yet, for some of the risks associated with systemically administered agents, such as risk of cardiovascular events, it is not clear if they are dose dependent in nature. Consequently, patients may be at risk of AEs even at low doses.

Another option to mitigate the risk of orally administered therapy is to provide the medication locally, thus bypassing the systemic system and limiting hepatic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal AEs. Topical NSAIDs have only recently become available in the USA, but they have historically been more commonly utilized in other parts of the world. These agents are applied directly to the affected area, which limits their systemic exposure compared with oral NSAIDs. This review will examine the efficacy and safety of topical NSAIDs and their evolving role in OA management guidelines, as well as their potential for assisting pain specialists in providing individualized care for patients with OA.

### Treating osteoarthritis pain: recent approaches using pharmacological therapies [^113mjqKy]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitative, painful condition with significant global burden. Pharmacological options have limited analgesic efficacy and their side-effects often restrict their use. Novel pharmacological options are needed to relieve patient symptoms and their consequent disease impact. A variety of pharmacological options have been investigated in treating OA, including existing therapies previously used for treating other arthritides (such as colchicine and hydroxychloroquine) and new therapies targeting pain (including monoclonal antibodies to nerve growth factor and intra-articular trans-capsaicin). Extended-release triamcinolone may offer more persisting analgesic effects compared to immediate-release preparations. While most studies have been unsuccessful, pharmacological therapies targeting peripheral nociceptive pathways appear promising.

### Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: the earlier the better to prevent joint damage [^115zXzDq]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

The management of rheumatoid arthritis has undergone major advances in recent years, both in terms of the drugs armamentarium and therapeutic strategy. Treating disease to target, aiming at remission, through a tight control protocol is regarded as the standard of care. Reaching clinical and radiographic disease remission has therefore become an achievable goal. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that early diagnosis, prompt treatment initiation and early achievement of remission are the major predictors of long-term clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes. Concentrating efforts in controlling disease activity in a very early window of opportunity offers unique sustained benefits. In this short review, we analysed the available evidence supporting the value of treating rheumatoid arthritis early and the impact on disease outcomes, with particular focus on radiographic progression.

Discussion

The pathogenesis of RA remains unclear. Currently, clinical objectives primarily include controlling disease progression, delaying bone destruction, and preserving joint function. Prospects for complete recovery remain uncertain, highlighting an urgent need for more effective treatments. Pain, one of the most prevalent symptoms in RA patients, frequently constitutes their primary complaint. Indeed, up to 70% of patients prioritize pain relief above other symptom improvements. Traditionally, RA-related pain has been attributed predominantly to peripheral joint inflammation. While conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) are effective as first-line therapies, persistent pain in some patients, even after normalization of inflammatory markers, suggests involvement of non-inflammatory pain mechanisms. In such cases, escalating anti-inflammatory medication alone may be ineffective and increase adverse event risks, complicating chronic pain management. Traditional herbal medicine offers a more accessible, safer, and cost-effective alternative. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has demonstrated substantial therapeutic potential in RA management through its characteristic multi-target mechanisms and holistic treatment paradigm. Combining Western medicine and TCM may represent a promising strategy for achieving significant recovery in RA patients.

Opioids

The United States accounts for 5% of the worldwide population yet consumes roughly 80% of opioids worldwide. As a nation, we have a obvious proclivity for choosing opioids to treat pain, even in cases where other treatments have been shown to be more effective and safer long term – as is the case when it comes to treating knee pain. From 2004 to 2014, 16% of the patients presenting with knee pain and osteoarthritis were prescribed opioid medications for treatment. Despite this, there are no data supporting the effectiveness of chronic opioids for either pain or functional improvement in patients with osteoarthritis. In fact, only about 35% of the patients who take opioids for osteoarthritis report pain improvement. This is compared to 31% of the patients who were given placebo for similar pain. Similar numbers are revealed when we evaluate physical functional improvements in response to opioids or placebo. While opioids have not demonstrated benefits, they definitely have their risks. Opioid-naïve patients who are prescribed an 8-day supply of opioids have a 13.5% probability of continuing opioid therapy at 1-year. If this is increased to > 30 days, the probability increases to 29.9%. With the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reporting 46,802 opioid overdose deaths in 2018, the risk of opioid therapy in this population is felt to be greater than any potential benefit, with the exception of high-risk patients with limited alternative therapies.

Despite the presence of a plethora of suitable alternatives (most of which possess high levels of evidence to support their utility), practitioners continue to recommend opioids for the treatment of knee pain – even though there is little-to-no evidence to support their use in this particular setting. One of the principal goals of these guidelines is to illustrate just how many evidence-based treatment options that are available for knee pain that go beyond a seemingly innocuous prescription for opioid pain medication.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^116qRMqb]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are strongly recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA), and they remain the mainstay of the pharmacologic management of OA. A large number of trials have established their short-term efficacy, and oral NSAIDs are the initial oral medication of choice in the treatment of OA, regardless of anatomic location, and are recommended over all other available oral medications. While the guideline did not address the relative merits of different NSAIDs, there is evidence suggesting that certain agents may have more favorable side effect profiles than others, and safe use includes appropriate patient selection with regular monitoring for potential adverse gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal side effects and potential drug interactions; doses should be as low as possible, and NSAID treatment should be continued for as short a time as possible.

### Non-drug care for RA – is the era of evidence-based practice approaching? [^116kxtEW]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Non-pharmacological treatment modalities are often recommended, prescribed and used in addition to drug treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This article provides a review of the literature on their effectiveness. Currently, a considerable number of systematic reviews summarising the available studies for non-drug care interventions in RA are available. The evidence of effectiveness varies among the different non-pharmacological modalities, with relatively strong support for exercise and self-management interventions, and modest support for joint protection programmes, specific orthoses and comprehensive care interventions. Overall, the evidence for effectiveness of massage and electro-physical modalities is absent or weak. In general, few studies in patients with early RA, studies comparing different attributes of non-pharmacological modalities or comprehensive care models and economic evaluations have been performed, so that the optimal timing, intensity, duration and mode of delivery often remain unclear. The results of this review indicate a need for further investigation into the most clinically and cost-effective strategies to deliver individual non-pharmacological treatment modalities as well as comprehensive arthritis service delivery models for RA patients in different stages of the disease.

### Posttraumatic ankle arthritis: an update on conservative and surgical management [^1111uiq6]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

This manuscript offers current information regarding the examination, conservative treatment, and surgical treatment for individuals with posttraumatic arthritis. Although inflammatory and osteoarthritis can occur, posttraumatic arthritis is the most common form of arthritis to affect the ankle. Posttraumatic ankle arthritis occurs in a generally younger, active population. It is radiographically characterized by an asymmetrical degenerative process and may be associated with a history of trauma, instability, and/or lower extremity malalignment. When choosing between conservative/nonoperative versus surgical intervention, the extent of subchondral bone exposed and the time over which the arthritis has developed are factors that should be considered. The role and effectiveness for conservative treatment, such as medication, patient education, shoe modification, bracing, stretching, mobilization, strengthening, and symptom management, needs to be further determined. Surgical procedures for posttraumatic ankle arthritis can include distraction arthroplasty, arthrodesis, or total ankle arthroplasty. Unlike the relatively new procedure of distraction arthroplasty, the outcomes for arthrodesis have been well defined. Arthrodesis generally has a good outcome, but its limitations have been recognized. These limitations include the extended time required to achieve fusion, potential for nonunion, arthritis developing in adjacent joints, leg length discrepancy, malalignment, chronic edema, symptoms due to the hardware, stress fractures, and continued pain. While first generation total ankle arthroplasty led to poor results, advancements in prosthetic design and surgical technique have revived optimism regarding total ankle arthroplasty as an alternative to arthrodesis. The key for the future of total ankle arthroplasty may not be related to the development of newer ankle components but rather in refining the criteria to determine who would best benefit from joint replacement versus fusion.

### Management of glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis [^112uBA5W]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Opioid pain medication in glenohumeral osteoarthritis — it is the opinion of the work group that opioids not be prescribed as routine and long-term pain management of glenohumeral osteoarthritis, with Strength of Recommendation: Consensus and Strength of Evidence (evidence quality): No reliable evidence. Only low-quality studies have evaluated narcotic pain medication use in this setting, including reports that chronic opioid use in the pre-operative setting was an indicator for poor outcomes following anatomic TSA and that preoperative opioid use was associated with higher rates of sleep disturbance with worse Constant pain, Constant activity, and WOOS index scores. The page notes a lack of evidence of long-term effectiveness for chronic conditions such as arthritis and states that safer options exist to help manage arthritis pain. Stated benefits and harms emphasize there is no harm in reducing opioid use prevalence and that avoiding routine long-term opioid use may benefit patients by increasing focus on modalities with greater proven benefit. Cost considerations indicate it would seem cost effective to reduce utilization, while acknowledging costs of alternatives and required treatment programs, and acceptability notes patients on long-term opioids may have difficulty weaning although recommendations should be readily accepted by physicians.

### Clinical algorithms to aid osteoarthritis guideline dissemination [^114zjxD4]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous scientific organisations have developed evidence-based recommendations aiming to optimise the management of osteoarthritis (OA). Uptake, however, has been suboptimal. The purpose of this exercise was to harmonize the recent recommendations and develop a user-friendly treatment algorithm to facilitate translation of evidence into practice.

Methods

We updated a previous systematic review on clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for OA management. The guidelines were assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation for quality and the standards for developing trustworthy CPGs as established by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM). Four case scenarios and algorithms were developed by consensus of a multidisciplinary panel.

Results

Sixteen guidelines were included in the systematic review. Most recommendations were directed toward physicians and allied health professionals, and most had multi-disciplinary input. Analysis for trustworthiness suggests that many guidelines still present a lack of transparency. A treatment algorithm was developed for each case scenario advised by recommendations from guidelines and based on panel consensus.

Conclusion

Strategies to facilitate the implementation of guidelines in clinical practice are necessary. The algorithms proposed are examples of how to apply recommendations in the clinical context, helping the clinician to visualise the patient flow and timing of different treatment modalities.

Question 6: What is the Evidence for Treatment of Osteoarthritis/Osteochondral Defects Using Injectable Biologics?

Despite an expanding body of literature highlighting the efficacy of regenerative medicine interventions for OA, there has been a variable degree of support within the medical community. A position paper from the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) does not advocate using PRP in advanced hip and knee arthritis, stating that insufficient evidence supports its effectiveness. Conversely, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) and American Medical Society for Sports Medicine have published position papers strongly supporting regenerative techniques, including the use of PRP and MSCs in degenerative musculoskeletal disorders. In this section, we review the current evidence for injectable biologics for each specific OA/osteochondral indications.

Knee and Hip Osteoarthritis

PRP may offer more benefit than placebo for alleviating pain and improving patient-reported outcomes related to knee OA symptoms for up to one year post-injection. However, the ability of PRP to enhance the osteoarthritic joint's structure or function remains uncertain.

A meta-analysiscomparing PRP to traditional injectates for knee OA examined 42 studies through 2023 and concluded that PRP had superior efficacy over HA, CSI, and placebo, particularly in reducing WOMAC and VAS pain scores, with the most significant improvement observed at the 6-month mark. The PRP cohort also sustained pain relief and functional improvement at the 12-month follow-up. Subgroup analyses indicated that multiple injections of PRP, particularly LR-PRP, yielded significantly better outcomes than single injections or LP-PRP. However, the debate regarding leukocytes' role in PRP formulations persists, necessitating further research for clarification. Sahi et al evaluated the current state of systematic reviews concerning the use of PRP in knee OA. Their analysis involved 41 systematic reviews published between 2013 and 2023, revealing methodological deficiencies in most of these reviews. Despite the substantial number of studies included in these reviews (ranging from 5 to 43 primary studies), the overall methodological quality was deemed "critically low". This underscores the need for improved methodological rigor in future research on PRP therapy for knee OA to ensure the reliability and validity of findings.

### Combination therapy for pain management in inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, other spondyloarthritis) [^117TVMSB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite optimal therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, many people with inflammatory arthritis (IA) continue to have persistent pain that may require additional therapy.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and safety of combination pain therapy for people with IA (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and other spondyloarthritis (SpA)). We planned to assess differences in effects between patients on background disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy and patients on no background therapy in subgroup analyses.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE; and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2008–10).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and controlled clinical trials (RCTs and CCTs) assessing combination therapy (at least two drugs from the following classes: analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, opioid-like drugs and neuromodulators (antidepressants, anticonvulsants and muscle relaxants)) compared with monotherapy, for adults with IA (RA, AS, PsA and other SpA). We speficically excluded studies that did not report pain or studies without a standardised pain scale as an outcome measure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

Twenty-three trials (total of 912 patients) met the inclusion criteria (22 in RA; one in a mixed population of RA and osteoarthritis); all except one were published before 1990. Most study populations were not taking DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate, sulphasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide) and all studies were performed prior to the introduction of biologic therapies (e.g. etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab). All trials were at high risk of bias, heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis, and we were only able to report a general description of results. The majority (18 studies, 78%) found no differences between the combination and monotherapy treatments they studied, while five (22%) reported conflicting results, favouring either the combination or monotherapy arms. From the 12 trials on NSAID + analgesic vs NSAID, nine reported no significant difference between the interventions, while three did: in two, the combination therapy achieved better pain control; and the third trial compared combination therapy with two different dosages of monotherapy (NSAID alone) and reported that a high dose phenylbutazone was superior to combination therapy (paracetamol + aspirin), which was superior to low dose phenylbutazone. From the five studies on the combination of two NSAIDS vs one NSAID, four reported no significant differences between interventions, and one reported significantly better pain control with combination therapy. The single trial comparing a combination of opioid + neuromodulator vs opioid reported better pain control with monotherapy. The remaining trials (NSAID + neuromodulator vs NSAID (3 trials); opioid + NSAID vs NSAID (1 trial); and opioid + analgesic vs analgesic (1 trial)) found no significant difference between combination therapy and monotherapy. Information regarding withdrawals due to inadequate analgesia and safety was incompletely reported, but in general there were no differences between combination therapy and monotherapy. No data were available that addressed the value of combination pain therapy or monotherapy for people with IA who have optimal disease suppression. There were no studies that included patients with AS, PsA or SpA.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on 23 trials, all at high risk of bias, there is insufficient evidence to establish the value of combination therapy over monotherapy for people with IA. Importantly, there are no studies addressing the value of combination therapy for patients with IA who have persistent pain despite optimal disease suppression. Well designed trials are needed to address this question.

Hand, hip, and knee osteoarthritis — tramadol — is conditionally recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or OA. Recent work has highlighted the very modest level of beneficial effects in the long-term (3 months to 1 year) management of non-cancer pain with opioids, and RCT evidence for tramadol or other opioids over periods longer than 1 year is not available; if an opioid is being considered, tramadol is conditionally recommended over non-tramadol opioids.

### "I' D like more options! ": interviews to explore young people and family decision-making needs for pain management in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^114zMFr5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance and Innovations

This study highlights a need for information, communication and decision support about pain management options.

There is a need for assessing pain in an accurate manner and for sharing evidence-based information for pain management in JIA, especially for non-pharmacological treatment options.

There is a need for clarifying and discussing young people's and families' values and preferences about pain management in JIA and for a joint decision with HCPs.

Families' values and preferences were similar to those of HCPs and included the importance of effectiveness, safety and ease of use of treatments.

Decision support interventions may enable HCPs to work with youth and families to address decision-making needs for pain management among young people with JIA.

Background

Musculoskeletalpain is an important symptom of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), with most young people experiencing some pain, and about 17% developing chronic pain. Pain is associated with difficulties in physical, emotional, social and school functioning, thus affecting health-related quality of life and activity participation. To effectively manage pain in JIA, a multi-disciplinary approach, including pharmacological, physical and psychological interventions, is required. Unfortunately, pain in JIA is often under-recognized and communication about it is not optimal.

An optimal way to make decisions, especially when there is no perfect treatment option and the choice depends on what families value most, is to engage in shared decision making (SDM). SDM is a process by which patients and health care providers (HCPs) make a joint decision by considering the best available evidence for treatment options as well as the patient's and family's values and preferences. SDM is recommended as part of JIA treatment-to-target recommendations. When supported by decision support interventions, SDM can lead to improved knowledge of treatment options, decisions which are consistent with patients' values, and increased patient participation in decision-making.

Studies in JIA have shown that decision-making is not optimal, but most studies focused on pharmacological disease management and not pain management, which often involves both pharmacological and non-pharmacological options. Some studies revealed a lack of information-sharing with families on pain management options, but other aspects of SDM have not been assessed thoroughly. No study has assessed decision-making needs for pain management in the context of JIA using a SDM conceptual framework. We sought to explore families' decision-making needs with respect to pain management among young people with JIA, parents/caregivers and HCPs.

### The role of acetaminophen in the management of patients with osteoarthritis [^111EM5ZE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of osteoarthritis increase with advancing age. Management of osteoarthritis in older adults focuses on reducing pain and other symptoms, minimizing functional limitation and disability from the disease, and avoiding the side effects associated with pharmacologic therapy. This article first briefly reviews the clinical pharmacology of acetaminophen and then summarizes the evidence supporting the use of acetaminophen in the management of patients with osteoarthritis. We conclude that acetaminophen, when given at full doses of 4,000 mg/day, is more efficacious than placebo and has comparable efficacy to ibuprofen in the management of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who have mild to moderate pain. Thus, acetaminophen merits a trial as initial therapy based on its cost-effectiveness and safety profile relative to NSAIDs.

### EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis: report of a task force of the European standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^115Nmr3F]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To formulate EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis.

Methods

In accordance with EULAR's "standardised operating procedures", the task force pursued an evidence based approach and an approach based on expert opinion. A steering group comprised of 14 rheumatologists representing 10 European countries. The group defined the focus of the process, the target population, and formulated an operational definition of "management". Each participant was invited to propose issues of interest regarding the management of early arthritis or early rheumatoid arthritis. Fifteen issues for further research were selected by use of a modified Delphi technique. A systematic literature search was carried out. Evidence was categorised according to usual guidelines. A set of draft recommendations was proposed on the basis of the research questions and the results of the literature search. The strength of the recommendations was based on the category of evidence and expert opinion.

Results

15 research questions, covering the entire spectrum of "management of early arthritis", were formulated for further research; and 284 studies were identified and evaluated. Twelve recommendations for the management of early arthritis were selected and presented with short sentences. The selected statements included recognition of arthritis, referral, diagnosis, prognosis, classification, and treatment of early arthritis (information, education, non-pharmacological interventions, pharmacological treatments, and monitoring of the disease process). On the basis of expert opinion, 11 items were identified as being important for future research.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for the management of early arthritis or early rheumatoid arthritis were developed, based on evidence in the literature and expert consensus.

### A meta-analysis of the analgesic effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for inflammatory joint pain [^111uaADF]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

Between 40% and 60% of Americans use complementary and alternative medicine to manage medical conditions, prevent disease, and promote health and well-being. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) have been used to treat joint pain associated with several inflammatory conditions. We conducted a meta-analysis of 17 randomized, controlled trials assessing the pain relieving effects of omega-3 PUFAs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or joint pain secondary to inflammatory bowel disease and dysmenorrhea. Meta-analysis was conducted with Cochrane Review Manager 4.2.8. for six separate outcomes using standardized mean differences (SMDs) as a measure of effect size: (1) patient assessed pain, (2) physician assessed pain, (3) duration of morning stiffness, (4) number of painful and/or tender joints, (5) Ritchie articular index, and (6) nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug consumption. Supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs for 3–4 months reduces patient reported joint pain intensity (SMD: -0.26; 95% CI: -0.49 to -0.03, p = 0.03), minutes of morning stiffness (SMD: -0.43; 95% CI: -0.72 to -0.15, p = 0.003), number of painful and/or tender joints (SMD: -0.29; 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.10, p = 0.003), and NSAID consumption (SMD: -0.40; 95% CI: -0.72 to -0.08, p = 0.01). Significant effects were not detected for physician assessed pain (SMD: -0.14; 95% CI: -0.49 to 0.22, p = 0.45) or Ritchie articular index (SMD: 0.15; 95% CI: -0.19 to 0.49, p = 0.40) at 3–4 months. The results suggest that omega-3 PUFAs are an attractive adjunctive treatment for joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and dysmenorrhea.

### Management of fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis [^112LXXDB]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition with joint damage, pain, functional impairment and fatigue. Even though there are many treatments approved for RA, fatigue affects at least three-quarters of patients. Using a fatigue Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), 50% of RA patients have fatigue, that is at least five out of 10.

Key messages

Fatigue is very common in RA and is weakly correlated with disease activity.
Fatigue adversely affects the quality of life in RA.
Fatigue is related to pain, comorbidities, mood, poor sleep and personality factors.
Treatment of active RA can improve fatigue modestly.
Evidence-based treatment of fatigue in RA with mostly modest or weak effect size includes exercise and some guided self-management/cognitive-behavioural treatments.
Research is needed to find a more effective treatment for fatigue in RA.

Fatigue can be from disease activity, chronic pain, sleep disturbance, poor mood and other reasons including comorbidities. It is often correlated with disease activity but more with strongly with pain. When there are high inflammatory markers, cytokines that are elevated may cause a person to feel tired or even exhausted. This can be similar to the prodrome of an infection.

A previous review of fatigue in RA did not consistently show the same factors associated with fatigue. Depressed mood, sleep disturbance and functional impairment (disability) appear to frequently explain fatigue in patients with RA. Of course, if it can be exhausting to do usual activities when RA is active, and damage and/or pain will worsen fatigue. Many activities of daily living are affected in RA patients such as dressing, walking, meal preparation, eating and personal care such as bathing.

### The role of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of osteoarthritis: a United States viewpoint [^113eWBSU]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), first published in 1995 under the auspices of the American College of Rheumatology, were updated with publication of revised recommendations in September 2000 to take account of significant advances in OA management. These advances include increased understanding of the disease process and the introduction of new medications, including the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors and the intra-articular hyaluronans. In addition, studies demonstrating superior efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) vs acetaminophen in the treatment of OA led to a re-evaluation of indications for initial pharmacologic approaches, given the availability of safer NSAIDs. In contrast to the previous recommendation that acetaminophen was the drug of choice for the initial treatment of all patients with OA, the new recommendations support consideration of the use of NSAIDs as initial treatment — either COX-2 selective inhibitors or classical NSAIDs with gastroprotective agents — particularly in patients with moderate to severe pain and inflammation. The important role of non-pharmacologic approaches including weight loss, avoidance of joint overuse, appropriate exercises and orthotics was re-emphasized. It is anticipated that guideline revisions will take place at more frequent intervals in the future, given today's rapid advances in therapeutic approaches, not only for symptomatic therapy but also for therapy targeted to structural disease modification.

### Neuroendocrine and neurophysiological effects of interleukin 6 in rheumatoid arthritis [^113W3xyy]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Translational effects of IL-6 in RA

Pain

Pain is the primary reason that patients with inflammatory arthritis seek care from a rheumatologist and it is the RA-associated symptom for which most patients desire effective treatment and meaningful improvement. Despite an ever-growing understanding of pathological pain mechanisms, pain management still presents a major challenge in clinical practice. Typical arthritic pain may be experienced as ongoing pain in the absence of stimulation, in response to mechanical stimuli (i.e. movements in the working range and joint palpation) or from normally non-painful warm or cold stimuli, which are all states of hyperalgesia. Furthermore, while both inflammation and joint damage can cause peripheral pain, some patients with arthritis complain of more severe pain than the degree of inflammation and joint damage, while others may complain of joint pain in the absence of inflammation and damage, a mechanism known as central pain.

### Conventional and biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs for osteoarthritis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114r1Vth]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Targeting the innate immune response (through IL1), adaptive immune response (through TNF) and the overall level of inflammation (through MTX) without major effects on pain suggests that inflammation may not be a key driver of OA pain. This view is further supported by the lack of efficacy across the spectrum of inflammatory phenotypes (from no effusion/inflammatory flares to synovitis or erosive hand OA) and joint sites. The poor efficacy of these drugs, which are used for RA, may indicate that the quantity and/or role of inflammation in OA differs from the primary aggressive inflammation in inflammatory arthritides. Alternatively, the investigated drugs may not be targeting the correct inflammatory pathways or may not be using the drug at sufficient exposures to capture a clinical effect. Better understanding of pain mechanisms and the role of inflammation in OA is required in order to identify and develop more effective treatments.

Osteoarthritis comprehensive management — patient-centered and multimodal care is emphasized, with plans that "may include educational, behavioral, psychosocial, and physical interventions, as well as topical, oral, and intraarticular medications", and "for some patients at some time points, a single physical, psychosocial, mind-body, or pharmacologic intervention may be adequate to control symptoms; for others, multiple interventions may be used in sequence or in combination". Choice and sequencing "will vary among patients", and "no specific hierarchy of one option over another is implied other than on the basis of strength of the recommendation". "Treatment decisions should take the personal beliefs and preferences of the patient, as well as the patient's medical status, into consideration", and the guideline "applies to patients with OA with no specific contraindications to the recommended therapies". Each patient "should be assessed for the presence of medical conditions, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding risk, chronic kidney disease, or other comorbidities", as well as "injuries, disease severity, surgical history, and access to and availability of services (transportation, distance), potential ability to take time off work, cost, insurance coverage) that might have an impact on the choice of physical, psychological, and mind-body approaches". Conditional recommendations are explained as those "for which the majority of informed patients would choose to follow the recommended course of action, but some would not", and they "are particularly value- and preference-sensitive and always warrant a full shared decision-making approach".

### One year in review 2019: novelties in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^1168Ai1j]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The current treatment approach in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) follows a stepwise management, starting from early introduction of conventional synthetic (cs) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), moving to biological (b) DMARDs and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs. In the last few years, new drugs with different mechanisms of action have demonstrated their efficacy in treating such a disabling condition, and their approval, along with other more "experienced" treatments, has established their effectiveness on disease activity, damage accrual prevention, patients' quality of life improvement, confirming their safety profile. Moreover, new molecular pathways are under investigation as potential targets of new advanced therapies. Clinicians' capability of stratifying treatment strategies and decisions has improved, with several new tools for the optimisation of long-term management of RA; however, a high proportion of patients are refractory to the available drugs. Finally, as RA is a systemic disease, the knowledge in multi-systemic complications of the disease has grown, as well as the possibility in improving extra-articular manifestations of the disease, although certain drugs have potentially relevant non-articular effects, which need to be monitored. This narrative review summarises the most relevant studies published over the last year in the field of treatment of RA, with the major aim to let clinicians and researchers reflect on "what is new", "what is effective" and "what is safe".

A database search of Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), and a further search of 4 online guideline repositories (Guidelines International Network, National Health and Medical Research Council, Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) was conducted to identify all relevant CPGs. The search strategy was developed in consultation with a reference librarian. Medical subject headings and key words associated with CPGs (e.g. guideline*.mp. or Practice Guideline/ or Guideline/) and OA were used (see Supplementary Appendix A, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at). Other arthritis conditions were included in the search terms as this systematic review is part of a wider body of work to inform arthritis management. Eligibility criteria are presented in Table 1. The search included CPGs published between January 2015 and December 2020 and was updated to include CPGs published between December 2020 and February 14, 2022. This cutoff date was selected as CPGs > 5 years old may be out of date.

Protocol changes

In the original protocol, CPGs addressing 1 treatment modality (e.g. medication prescribing) were excluded. To improve comprehensiveness, the scope was expanded during the study selection phase to include all OA management options. Due to time that has elapsed since the original search, the original timeline (January 2015 and December 2020) was extended to include CPGs published up until February 2022.

Study selection

After importing search results into EndNote (Clarivate), duplicates were removed and titles/abstracts were uploaded into Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation; available at). Titles and abstracts were screened by 2 independent reviewers (BC and TG or IL); any disagreements were resolved through consensus discussion with a third reviewer. Following this, full texts were uploaded into Covidence and screened through the same process.

### Towards secondary prevention of early knee osteoarthritis [^1159gwmx]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is the most common arthritic disease, yet there is no convincing drug treatment available today that affects the progression of the disease process. There are many reasons for this, including the lack of understanding of what drives the disease process and the heterogeneity of the patient population. Indeed, there is considerable variability in disease trajectories, also dependent on patient profiles and the defined outcomes, leading to a need for disease stratification. A recent report has proposed a framework for the investigation of clinical and structural phenotypes; the patient characteristics and disease stage should be considered as most relevant for stratification of patients to be used in future studies. This approach will be of value for the field, but from a pragmatic clinical standpoint, it neither helps the individual patient nor the clinician facing the patient, today. However, we believe there is reasonable scientific evidence from studies in both animals and the human model that a personalised, patient-centred approach can result in successful clinical outcomes.

Therefore, in this narrative, we try to integrate scientific evidence and our professional experience to illustrate which approaches can be taken for prototypical individual patient profiles that are most likely going to successfully alleviate pain, control symptoms and signs, maintain or restore function and perhaps even affect the disease course. For sure, it is not our goal to be fully comprehensive, and we made some choices. This paper focuses on secondary prevention, thus on early knee OA, as we believe this being a window of opportunity for interventions that benefit the patient. As OA develops slowly, in most cases, pain, symptoms/signs and loss of function precede radiographic changes, although the opposite is also possible in some cases. Consequently, there is in general poor disease management in clinical practice over the course of the disease. Indeed, typical examinations in primary care do not reveal abnormalities in blood exam and imaging, certainly not in early disease, and the patient is getting the message to adapt and cope with it. Healthcare providers are not taking any coordinated action and await late stage disease associated with pronounced clinical manifestations including severe functional limitations and radiographic advanced disease. Then, more attention is geared towards surgical interventions mostly total knee replacement (with some exceptions). However, OA is a chronic disease process and begs for early disease intervention, as has been illustrated in other chronic arthritic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Economic Burden of Knee Pain

Osteoarthritis is a prevalent and disabling condition currently affecting 40 to 50 million Americans, with approximately 10–30% of those afflicted having significant pain, impaired function, and decreased quality of life.

The pain and loss of function can be debilitating; in developed countries the resultant socioeconomic burden is large, costing between 1% and 2.5% of gross domestic product. The socioeconomic burden of knee and hip OA alone averages more than $12,000 per patient annually in both direct and indirect costs of disease. In 2015, the average cost of TKA was approximately $16,000 per discharge, summing up to almost $10 billion in inpatient costs alone. Time lost from employment and leisure by participants and their unpaid caregivers accounted for 80% of the total cost. A 2017 study found that, when compared to healthy controls, knee OA patients had significantly more per-patient-per-year outpatient and pharmacy claims and costs. Knee OA patients incurred $7707 more per-patient-per-year total healthcare costs than controls.

In a national, cross-sectional, population-based study, it was found that about one-third of the population aged 50–64 had OA and more than half were out of paid work. Only knee OA was associated with early exit from work. The estimated annual cost of early exit from work attributable to OA was €384 per capita, €1294 per OA patient and €2095 per OA patient out-of-work. In another study, it was estimated that mean health losses due to knee OA over people's lifetimes are 3.44 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per person.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^115NtE77]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS knee osteoarthritis — oral acetaminophen is recommended to improve pain and function in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis when not contraindicated (Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Evidence cited indicates oral acetaminophen consistently improved pain and function compared to controls, with meta-analysis showing a meaningful reduction in pain and improved function with no evidence of confounding heterogeneity, and overall it is considered a safe medication with no evidence of significantly increased adverse events among the included studies; however, the United States FDA has a black-box warning for acetaminophen secondary to concern of overdose leading to hepatotoxicity or death. When oral acetaminophen was compared to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the use of oral NSAIDs provided a significant reduction in pain and improved function, and as a result, providers may consider using oral NSAIDs instead of acetaminophen when a contraindication to oral NSAIDs does not exist in the patient. Implementation guidance notes that although oral acetaminophen is widely used, providers must recognize the specific risks associated with each medication and that specific patient contraindications need to be assessed on an individual basis (example: renal failure). Outcome considerations include that the most important consideration will be removal of oral narcotics from medications prescribed for osteoarthritis of the knee, which becomes particularly significant due to the rise of the opioid epidemic in the United States. Cost-effectiveness remains undetermined to date, acetaminophen is commonly utilized so there should be no issues implementing this recommendation, and this recommendation may be implemented immediately having a potential positive impact in clinical practice.
