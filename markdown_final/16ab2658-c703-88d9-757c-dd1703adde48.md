## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the omission of recording a credit purchase of merchandise affects the year-end balance sheet, given that the merchandise was correctly included in the physical inventory. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the accounting equation and how inventory and accounts payable fit. Then, I should verify the effect of not recording the purchase on liabilities. Next, I will examine whether assets are affected by the inventory already being counted. Finally, I will reconcile these effects and match the correct answer choice.

> Let me first confirm the core accounting relationship: Assets equal Liabilities plus Equity, and inventory is an asset while accounts payable is a liability. If I omit recording a credit purchase, I fail to recognize both the increase in inventory and the increase in accounts payable, which would normally offset each other in the equation, so I need to check whether the inventory was still captured by the physical count despite the omission.

> Wait, let me verify the liability side. When a credit purchase is not recorded, accounts payable is understated because the obligation to the supplier has not been recognized on the books, so liabilities are understated by the amount of the omitted invoice. This is straightforward and not dependent on the inventory count, so liabilities are definitely understated here.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about assets. My first instinct is to say assets are understated because the purchase wasn't recorded, but wait, the problem states the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, which means the inventory asset is properly stated on the balance sheet even though the journal entry was missed. So, even though the purchase wasn't booked, the asset value is correct because the physical count captured the goods, and therefore total assets are not misstated.

> I should double-check the net effect. Liabilities are understated due to the missing accounts payable, while assets are correctly stated because inventory was counted, so the balance sheet is out of balance by the amount of the omitted payable, with equity implicitly overstated by the same amount. This matches the pattern of no effect on assets and an understatement of liabilities.

> Let me reconsider the answer choices. Option A claims no effect on either, which ignores the understated payable. Option C and D claim assets are understated, which contradicts the fact that inventory was correctly counted. Option B correctly states no effect on assets and an understatement of liabilities, which aligns with the analysis above.

> Final answer: B. No effect on assets, liabilities are understated.

The omission of recording a credit purchase **understates liabilities** (accounts payable) because the obligation is not recorded, while **assets are unaffected** because the merchandise was correctly included in inventory. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. No effect Understated**.

---

## Analysis of the omission

### Effect on liabilities

- **Accounts payable**: The credit purchase creates an obligation to pay the supplier. By not recording the purchase, accounts payable is understated, which directly understates total liabilities.

- **Total liabilities**: Since accounts payable is a component of total liabilities, the omission results in an understatement of total liabilities on the balance sheet.

---

### Effect on assets

- **Inventory**: The merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, so the asset value of inventory is accurately reflected on the balance sheet.

- **Total assets**: Because inventory is correctly stated, total assets are not affected by the omission of the purchase recording.

---

## Summary of effects

| **Balance sheet item** | **Effect of omission** |
|-|-|
| Assets | No effect (inventory correctly included) |
| Liabilities | Understated (accounts payable not recorded) |

---

## Conclusion

The omission of recording the credit purchase **understates liabilities** (accounts payable) while **assets remain unaffected** because inventory was correctly included. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. No effect Understated**.

### More than a third of middle-aged adults (50–65) have understated executive dysfunction [^4de478cf]. Aging & Mental Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Understated executive dysfunction (UED) is predictive of cognitive decline and death. We aimed to assess the prevalence of UED, assessed with the clock-drawing test (CDT) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) in middle-aged adults and to investigate associated characteristics.

Methods

Cross-sectional analysis of data on 516 community-dwellers aged 50–65, lacking cognitive complaints, who were included prospectively (2010–2017) after a multidimensional geriatric assessment at a "healthy ageing" outpatient clinic. Age- and educational-level-adjusted logistic models were used to assess factors associated with UED.

Results

The CDT and FAB were impaired in 27.7% and 14.7% of the participants (median age: 59.7years). The prevalence [95% confidence interval (CI)] of UED was 36.2% [32.2–40.5%]. After adjustment for age and education, participants with UED were more likely to be obese (odds ratio [95%CI] = 1.89 [1.12–3.19], P = 0.02), and to have a metabolic syndrome (1.98 [1.06–3.72], P = 0.03).

Conclusion

More than one third of middle-aged adults without cognitive complaints have UED, which was linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Cognitive screening tests targeting executive functions might be useful for early detection of UED and the initiation of multidomain interventions improving cognitive performance.

### The mortality cost of carbon [^ee8dff40]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

It is important to note that this study has several important limitations. First, there remains significant uncertainty around climate-mortality projections, and the primary specification results are based on central estimates in these projections. Second, the mortality damage function only represents temperature-related mortality; it leaves out potentially important climate-mortality pathways such as the effect of climate change on infectious disease, civil and interstate war, food supply, and flooding due to the limited availability of projections for these pathways in the scholarly literature that sufficiently meet our idealized criteria. Third, this does not consider likely mortality co-benefits of stricter climate policies such as decreases in particulate matter pollution. In future work, DICE-EMR could be combined with IAMs that quantify the mortality co-benefits of stricter climate policyto fully quantify the net effect of climate policy on mortality. Fourth, although the mortality damage function accounts for the effects of defensive adaptation in reducing the impact of climate change on mortality, these adaptations are likely to be costly and DICE-EMR does not directly model the costs of these adaptations. The costs of some adaptations, such as increased spending on air conditioning, are in principle included in the original DICE-2016 climate-economy damage function, although our review concludes that the costs are likely understated (see Supplementary Materials). While future research that reduces the uncertainty around temperature-related mortality projections may increase or decrease our MCC and SCC results, the second and third limitations likely contribute towards understating the MCC and SCC and the fourth limitation likely contributes towards understating the SCC (since it would only effect the SCC and not the MCC). If these limitations were accounted for, they would likely increase the central estimates of the SCC further and result in a more stringent optimal climate policy.

### Manifestation of borderline personality symptomatology in chronic pain patients under stress: an understated and exacerbated consequence of the COVID-19 crisis [^ff78e07c]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 Crisis, Chronic Pain, and Borderline Personality Expression: A Potentially Bad Storm

To this point, we have elucidated the challenges associated with being a patient with the comorbidities of chronic pain and BPD, as well as treating such patients under normal circumstances. The worldwide COVID-19 crisis has greatly exacerbated these challenges, which will be discussed in the remainder of this analysis.

Accepting the diathesis-stress model of chronic pain and BPD, the role of stress in exacerbating pain symptoms cannot be understated. Whether infected with the virus, living with loved ones who are infected or in a high-risk category, or fearing for our lives and/or livelihoods, everyone is under a heightened sense of stress. Much has been written about the levels of individual and societal stress associated with the crisis, and detailed description of all of the related stressors is beyond the scope of this analysis. What is important is the formidable body of literature unequivocally supporting the notion that stress exacerbates chronic pain.–Although the impact of stress on chronic pain experience has been studied extensively, investigation of the impact of societal stress on chronic pain has been limited.

### A new hemophilia carrier nomenclature to define hemophilia in women and girls: communication from the SSC of the ISTH [^bb3f79bd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Essentials

The term "hemophilia carrier" (HC) understates bleeding symptoms in women/girls.
A new HC nomenclature was defined by hemophilia experts consulting with patient advocacy groups.
Five new HC categories are: severe/moderate/mild hemophilia, symptomatic and asymptomatic HC.
Clear, precise nomenclature will enhance diagnosis, management, and research on HCs.

### PRISMA 2020 explanation and elaboration: updated guidance and exemplars for reporting systematic reviews [^0cbeec2c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Item 23d. Discuss implications of the results for practice, policy, and future research

Explanation: There are many potential end users of a systematic review (such as patients, healthcare providers, researchers, insurers, and policy makers), each of whom will want to know what actions they should take given the review findings. Patients and healthcare providers may be primarily interested in the balance of benefits and harms, while policy makers and administrators may value data on organisational impact and resource utilisation. For reviews of interventions, authors might clarify trade-offs between benefits and harms and how the values attached to the most important outcomes of the review might lead different people to make different decisions. In addition, rather than making recommendations for practice or policy that apply universally, authors might discuss factors that are important in translating the evidence to different settings and factors that may modify the magnitude of effects.

Explicit recommendations for future research — as opposed to general statements such as "More research on this question is needed" — can better direct the questions future studies should address and the methods that should be used. For example, authors might consider describing the type of understudied participants who should be enrolled in future studies, the specific interventions that could be compared, suggested outcome measures to use, and ideal study design features to employ.

### Coronary artery calcium scanning: the key to the primary prevention of coronary artery disease [^28f0a393]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium scanning (CAC) is the most powerful prognosticator of cardiac risk in the asymptomatic primary prevention population, far exceeding the role of risk factor-based paradigms. The primary utility of risk factors is to identify treatable targets for risk reduction after risk has been determined by CAC. Serial calcium scanning to evaluate progression of calcified plaque is useful for determining the response to treatment. The 2013 cholesterol treatment guidelines understate the value of CAC scanning for atherosclerotic disease risk assessment.

### Undescended testis and torsion: is the risk understated? [^e8e4f3b9]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Undescended testis (UDT) is seen in 3% to 5% of all newborn boys. Complications such as infertility and malignant transformation have been well documented in UDT. However, torsion of a UDT can also occur and the diagnosis is often missed or delayed, leading to loss of testis. This event may occur even before the currently recommended age for surgery, which is at 6–9 months. We present a case series of six children with torsion of undescended testes and their subsequent diagnosis and management. The risk of torsion of UDT is understated. Paediatricians should be educated about this complication and torsion should be included in the differential diagnosis when a boy with an empty scrotum presents with acute abdomen or red and tender swelling in the groin, as early detection and intervention can help salvage the testes.

### Are we making a mountain out of a mole hill? A call to appropriate interpretation of clinical trials and population-based studies [^19517831]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The volume of scientific articles being published continues to grow. Simultaneously, the ease with which both patients and providers can access scholarly articles is also increasing. One potential benefit of easy accessibility is broader awareness of new evidence. However, with a large volume of literature, it is often difficult to thoroughly review each article. Therefore, busy clinicians and inquisitive patients may often read the conclusion as their take-away message. In this article, we provide an overview of a few challenging study designs that are at increased risk for over- or understating conclusions, potentially leading to changes in clinical practice.

### Corrected US opioid-involved drug poisoning deaths and mortality rates, 1999–2015 [^407c2428]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Most prior estimates of opioid-involved drug poisoning mortality counts or rates are understated because the specific drugs leading to death are frequently not identified on death certificates. This analysis provides corrected national estimates of opioid and heroin/synthetic opioid-involved counts and mortality rates, as well as changes over time in them from 1999 to 2015.

Methods

Data on drug poisoning deaths to US residents from 1999 to 2015, obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Multiple Cause of Death (MCOD) files, were used with the drugs involved in fatal overdoses imputed when not identified on the death certificates.

Results

The official CDC figure that 33091 drug deaths involved opioids in 2015 is an undercount, with the actual number being approximately 39 999. Corrected counts and rates of any opioid and heroin/synthetic opioid-involved drug deaths are 20–35% higher in every year than reported figures. The corrections almost always raise the changes estimated to have occurred since 1999, with the largest differences observed in 2011 for any opioids (5677 deaths and 1.7 per 100000) and in 2015 for heroin/synthetic opioids (3228 deaths and 1.0 per 100000). However, percentage growth since 1999 is sometimes slower when based on corrected rather than reported fatality data, and with sensitivity to the choice of base years.

Conclusions

Death certificate reports understate the prevalence of and changes over time in opioid and heroin/synthetic opioid-involved drug mortality in the United States. Adjustments imputing the drugs involved for cases where none are identified on the death certificates are likely to provide more accurate estimates.

### Non-ventilator health care-associated pneumonia (NV-HAP): best practices for prevention of NV-HAP [^b56a8a2f]. American Journal of Infection Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the latest research and data show decreases in many health care-associated infections, recent publications highlight the understated but significant burden of nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP). This section presents best practices to prevent NV-HAP. Many of the tools and interventions address basic nursing care such as oral care, oral and nonoral alimentation, patient positioning and mobility, pharmacologic and immunologic controls. The section stresses the importance of working with an interdisciplinary caregiver team to address fundamental activities of daily living that mitigate risk of developing NV-HAP.

### The gynecologic oncology group's role in the treatment of recurrent cervix cancer: current clinical trials [^74fee526]. Gynecologic Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The Gynecologic Oncology Group's role in developing and evaluating vital research hypotheses for women with cancer of the uterine cervix cannot be understated, as methodical and interpretable conclusions from its many clinical studies have defined, supported and driven the standard of care in several avenues of clinical care. The focus of this presentation was to review for an international audience the principle structure, underlying hypotheses and historical progress in the investigation of chemotherapy options for women identified with recurrent cervix cancer. While the impact of phase II research queues were presented, the primary focus was to review the pivotal randomized trial which now define practice standards for these women.

### "The dream is that there's one place you go": a qualitative study of women's experiences seeking care from long COVID clinics in the USA [^1fb77865]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations and future directions

Despite the important implications of the current study findings, there are several limitations that should be considered. Participants' self-reported Long COVID status, and symptoms were not independently confirmed. Although many Long COVID symptoms can only be evidenced through self-report, future-related research might consider recruiting participants directly from Long COVID clinics rather than the diverse sampling techniques used in the current study. Additionally, over half of participants identified as White, recruiting and interviews were conducted in English, and education levels were somewhat higher than the U.S. average. Thus, the already notable barriers to obtaining care that were identified may be understated. In the USA, lower-income adults and Black and Hispanic women report higher rates of Long COVID. These women may face heightened barriers to accessing care due to structural and interpersonal racism. Further, everyone in our sample reported having some form of health insurance. Women without health insurance may face additional barriers to receiving referrals or being seen at clinics. These caveats are important for assessing the transferability of findings to other Long COVID populations.

Additionally, while all participants were asked about the care they had sought for Long COVID, not all participants were probed to ensure that a failure to mention Long COVID clinics represented a lack of interest in attending such a clinic. Accordingly, the strong barriers to clinic attendance that we found here may be understated. Finally, Zoom was used for transcription, which heightens the risk of transcription errors. To counteract this, we manually checked transcripts and all quotes were confirmed against the audio for accuracy. Future work should also consider asking participants how they learned about the study to help determine the most effective strategies for recruitment.

### Perceptions of closeness in adult parent-child dyads: asymmetry in the context of family complexity [^3097e7cf]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Hypotheses

We consider two dimensions of disagreement of parent- and child-reported closeness: Directional disagreement (as reflected by the difference between the parent- and child-reported means) and nondirectional disagreement (as reflected by the association between parent and child reports). Directional disagreement is an absolute measure of difference, whereas nondirectional disagreement is a relative measure. This is similar to studies of intergenerational social mobility, in which children have higher levels of education than their parents (high absolute mobility), whereas the association between parents' and children's education is still high (low relative mobility). In this section, we consider the theoretical meaning of both dimensions of disagreement and derive hypotheses on differences between types of parent–child ties.

Directional Disagreement

The literature on directional disagreement started with the observation that parents, relative to their young adult children, overreport affectual and consensual solidarity with their children, as reflected by a higher mean on parent-reported measures. This difference was originally explained with the idea of different developmental stakes which color parents' and children's perceptions: Adult children are concerned with developing a sense of autonomy, and therefore, tend to understate intergenerational affection and overstate intergenerational contrasts. Parents, on the other hand, would see their children as a continuation of themselves, and are concerned with transmitting their values. Therefore, parents tend to overstate affection and understate contrasts in relation to their offspring.

This idea (initially labeled "developmental stake", and later "intergenerational stake" or "generational stake") has experienced a number of developments in response to empirical findings (e.g.;), but continues to build on the original idea (parents' concern with continuity).add a different explanation by arguing that parents' perceptions are being colored by a cognitive desire for equity: Parents commonly invest more in their children than vice versa and thus, have a stronger desire for a good parent–child relationship as to legitimize these investments.

### Adopting and expanding ethical principles for generative artificial intelligence from military to healthcare [^0ba14c39]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, the importance of ethical considerations for generative AI in healthcare cannot be understated. From the human-centered perspective, the ultimate goal of generative AI is to enhance and augment human's creativity, productivity, and problem-solving capabilities, which is well aligned with the goal of healthcare in improving patient care. If the generative AI system is not used ethically and does not reflect our values, its role as a tool for improving the lives of people will greatly diminish.

### Lipoid proteinosis: unfamiliar skin findings delay diagnosis [^10e37f3b]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lipoid proteinosis (LP) is a rare, inherited condition that progresses gradually with multisystemic manifestations. Histopathologic characteristics can be understated, delaying the diagnosis if a high degree of suspicion is not present.

### Grief in the elderly: a qualitative content analysis [^87cbe00c]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

As also noted by Walker and Avant (2005), as long as there is no proper understating of their concepts or a precise definition of them, phenomena cannot be interpreted well, and be used as a common language by professionals and scientists for generating and transferring science. The authors of this article conducted a review study on the concept of grief and, considering that grief is a cultural concept, decided to examine the lived experiences of Iranian elderly in a field study. This study has thus been designed and implemented to interpret and define the concept of grief among the elderly.

### Cochlear implant [^06da04ab]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Cochlear implant is the first approved cranial nerve stimulator that works by directly stimulating the cochlear nerve. The medical and societal impact of this revolutionary device cannot be understated. This article reviews the evolving indications for cochlear implant, patient assessment, surgical approach, and outcomes for pediatric and adult cochlear implant that demonstrate its impact. Future concepts in cochlear implant are introduced briefly. This article covers a breadth of information; however, it is not intended be entirely comprehensive. Rather, it should serve as a foundation for understanding cochlear implant.

### Implications of large language models for quality and efficiency of neurologic care: emerging issues in neurology [^5c6f96a4]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Medical record summarization risks and oversight — In the specific case of implementing LLMs for medical record summarization, the potential risks associated with inaccuracies and bias cannot be understated; the generation of "hallucinations", where LLMs produce factually incorrect or irrelevant content, is a concerning issue, and content additions and omissions pose risks to patient safety, legal, ethical, and trust-related implications, and potential misallocation of healthcare resources; therefore their application in office visit documentation should be approached with caution, with human oversight being a fundamental requirement to maintain accuracy and reliability, and bridging the gap between health care and AI software engineering expertise remains a critical challenge.

### Geographic variation in opioid and heroin involved drug poisoning mortality rates [^301e65a3]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

An important barrier to formulating effective policies to address the rapid rise in U.S. fatal overdoses is that the specific drugs involved are frequently not identified on death certificates. This analysis supplies improved estimates of state opioid and heroin involved drug fatality rates in 2014, and changes from 2008 to 2014.

Methods

Reported mortality rates were calculated directly from death certificates and compared to corrected rates that imputed drug involvement when no drug was specified. The analysis took place during 2016–2017.

Results

Nationally, corrected opioid and heroin involved mortality rates were 24% and 22% greater than reported rates. The differences varied across states, with particularly large effects in Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Louisiana. Growth in corrected opioid mortality rates, from 2008 to 2014, were virtually the same as reported increases (2.5 deaths per 100,000 people) whereas changes in corrected heroin death rates exceeded reported increases (2.7 vs 2.3 per 100,000). Without corrections, opioid mortality rate changes were considerably understated in Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Jersey, and Arizona, but dramatically overestimated in South Carolina, New Mexico, Ohio, Connecticut, Florida, and Kentucky. Increases in heroin death rates were understated in most states, and by large amounts in Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Jersey, Louisiana, and Alabama.

Conclusions

The correction procedures developed here supply a more accurate understanding of geographic differences in drug poisonings and supply important information to policymakers attempting to reduce or slow the increase in fatal drug overdoses.

### Patient and family engagement: a survey of US hospital practices [^00ed69cc]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2016). Medium credibility.

Among the most widely adopted PFE bedside practices, 80% at least sometimes employed the use of white boards in patients' rooms, and 68% practised teach-back with patients in at least some units. The least frequently adopted practice was conducting multidisciplinary rounds with patients and families (61%).

Among practices related to patient and family access to information and support for shared decision-making, the most widely adopted practice was allowing patients to examine their health records either anytime (42%) or by appointment or consult (44%). The second most common was taking steps to address health literacy and language issues (73%). The least commonly reported practice was giving patients 24 h online access to their personal health information (28%). These findings are difficult to interpret, in part because of the inherent limitations of a survey. Responses may not correspond to actual practices at the hospital, and there may be differences across hospitals in what a particular practice actually means. To study this further, we contacted some of the 71% of hospitals that said they provided decision aids to patients and asked them for copies of decision aids they used. A large majority of the materials they provided were simply educational materials, such as pamphlets that did not fit the technical definition provided in the survey ('informational health materials and literature that help people become involved in decision-making by making explicit the decision that needs to be made, providing information about treatment options and outcomes, and helping the patient clarify personal values'). There are likely other item responses that similarly overstate or understate actual PFE; however, as suggested by the decision aid example, we think it is more likely that our results overstate rather than understate the use of PFE practices.

### Economic costs and benefits of community-based lymphedema-management programs for lymphatic filariasis in India [^659bbbd3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

We have not included other second-order costs of chronic filarial lymphedema and ADLA such as lost work time of family caregivers for those disabled from ADLA and lymphedema or the impact on child nutrition and schooling, which could affect the child's future earnings. By omitting those externalities, our calculations substantially understate the reduction in the economic cost of lymphedema and ADLA that a lymphedema-management program would generate. (See thefor a discussion of other ways that conservative assumptions were used in parameterizing the model.)

### Estimating drug involvement in fatal overdoses with incomplete information [^b6addd28]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Death certificates provide incomplete information on the specific drug categories involved in fatal overdoses. The accuracy of previously developed corrections for this and modifications to them was examined. Uncorrected mortality rates were compared with rates from the preferred correction models.

Methods

Data were obtained for the universe of 932,364 drug overdoses in the U.S. between 1999 and 2020, including 769,982 (82.6%) with a drug classification and 162,382 (17.4%) without, from the National Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause of Death files. Opioid and cocaine involvement for unclassified overdoses were estimated using multiple approaches. Prediction accuracy was assessed as the mean absolute deviation between actual and estimated involvement for a test sample with known drug involvement. Corrected death rates from preferred models were compared with uncorrected rates. Analyses were conducted in 2022–2023.

Results

Previous regression-based corrections that controlled for decedent characteristics can be improved upon by adding state-fixed effects as covariates. Once this is done, supplementary controls for county characteristics or contributory causes of death do not materially improve prediction accuracy. Properly designed naïve models, which distribute unspecified drug deaths proportionately to specified deaths, often provide similar results and, for county-level analyses, supply the most accurate predictions. Uncorrected results substantially understate the levels of opioid and cocaine involvement and can either understate or overstate changes over time.

Conclusions

Failing to correct for incomplete information on death certificates leads to inaccurate counts of deaths from specific categories of drugs, such as opioids. However, relatively simple corrections are available that substantially improve accuracy.

### Integrating indices of genetic risk for Cardiovascular disease [^e0317ecd]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Saadatagah et alare to be commended for their important work demonstrating that polygenic risk, monogenic risk, and family history can each provide additive information about risk in the primary prevention population, and particularly in young adults. These findings add to a growing literature suggesting that genetics may enable more targeted primordial and primary prevention. As ASCVD remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, the significance of this potential should not be understated.

### Using health data to highlight milestones: a cookbook for non-profit program managers [^9ff30cd2]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Unintentional fall deaths in the home — an example estimation multiplies statewide deaths by the national proportion occurring at home: "Unintentional fall deaths that occurred in the home in Georgia = 580 × 0.54 = 313", described as "a rough estimate" that may understate counts because "location was unknown for 11% of fall deaths at the national level". The calculation "can be used to estimate the number of unintentional injury deaths that occur within homes" and to estimate "fire/burn and drowning injury deaths" when the "unknown" location percentage is not large.

### Performance measurement in mental health and addictions systems: a scoping review [^fa55383c]. Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs: Supplement (2019). High credibility.

Percent of patients prescribed a medication for opioid use disorder (OUD) defines a Process measure aligned to Standard III.2 Providing Therapeutic Alternatives and is used to assess the extent to which clinicians make medications available to their patients with an OUD. The numerator is the number of patients receiving a medication for opioid use disorder and should include all FDA approved medications, with data captured from providers, payers, and Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) as specified. The denominator is the number of patients with an opioid use disorder diagnosis, which may understate the number of potential patients because many in treatment lack a diagnosis, with improvement anticipated via the proposed diagnosis documentation measure. Due to insufficient evidence on timing, no time period from diagnosis to initiation is included, and specifications build on prior work with removal of the time period and updating to ICD-10. Benchmarking is deferred; it is too early to set a benchmark on a prevalence percentage (e.g., greater than 0% and less than 100%), and time will be needed to test the measure, which may later evolve to consider concurrent medications and dosage levels. The panel also chose not to address medication adherence at this time and notes a lack of consensus on duration of treatment; hence, it would be inappropriate to set an adherence benchmark at this time. To address compliance, measurement requires whether a prescription has been paid for and filled, and although PCPI counseling measures exist, the panel believes that initiation of pharmacotherapy treatment is a more meaningful measure for addiction specialist physician care.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: new diagnostic criteria and treatment [^c22264d9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

PID is a common infection in reproductive-age women that presents an enormous public health and economic burden. It is responsible for much short- and long-term morbidity that may necessitate interventions subsequent to the original infection. Mild PID seems to be much more common than severe or "classic" PID, and the importance of early recognition and treatment cannot be understated. Current treatment regimens seem to be effective in terms of immediate clinical efficacy. As we learn more about the frequency and importance of subclinical PID, the true burden of upper genital tract infection upon reproductive age women continues to be elucidated.

### Unhappy patients can turn into angry patients: how to deal with both [^49a54ece]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Patient satisfaction is the ultimate measure of success in cosmetic facial plastic surgery. A successful outcome depends on patient selection, technical performance, and postoperative care. Patient perception can be influenced by physician-patient interactions. Surgical training focuses on diagnosis-identifying variations in physical condition and treatment. Although these skills are essential to a well-trained and successful facial plastic surgeon, the importance of proper patient selection, management of expectations, and empathetic communication in cosmetic surgery are often overlooked in education and cannot be understated. This article outlines the contributing factors to difficult physician-patient relationships and strategies for mitigating these situations.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^d4649b69]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Rationale for school health programs to promote healthy eating and physical activity — As of 2009, > 95% of children and adolescents aged 5–17 years were enrolled in schools, and schools have direct contact with students for approximately 6 hours each day and for up to 13 critical years of their social, psychological, physical, and intellectual development. The health of students is strongly linked to their academic success, and the academic success of students is strongly linked with their health. School health programs and policies might be one of the most efficient means to prevent or reduce risk behaviors, prevent serious health problems among students, and help close the educational achievement gap, and schools offer an ideal setting for delivering health promotion strategies that provide opportunities for students to learn about and practice healthy behaviors. Schools, across all regional, demographic, and income categories, share the responsibility with families and communities to provide students with healthy environments that foster regular opportunities for healthy eating and physical activity, and healthy eating and physical activity also play a significant role in students' academic performance. The importance of healthy eating, including eating breakfast, for the overall health and well-being of school-aged children cannot be understated, and recent reviews of breakfast and cognition in students report that eating a healthy breakfast might enhance cognitive function (especially memory), increase attendance rates, reduce absenteeism, and improve mood. Healthy People 2020 national health objectives include a comprehensive plan for health promotion and disease prevention in the United States and include objectives related to physical activity and healthy eating among children and adolescents and in schools.

### Study of bias in antenatal clinic HIV-1 surveillance data in a high contraceptive prevalence population in sub-saharan Africa [^00e77230]. AIDS (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe patterns, sources and consequences of bias in antenatal clinic (ANC) HIV prevalence estimates in a high contraceptive prevalence population.

Background

HIV surveillance in Africa relies on data from pregnant women attending ANCs. HIV estimates from pregnant women understate female infection levels in low income, high fertility populations. Bias in high contraceptive use, delayed sexual debut populations remains undescribed.

Design and Method

Comparison of parallel cross-sectional population and antenatal survey data from rural Zimbabwe, where 60% of women are recent contraceptive users.

Results

HIV prevalence in recently pregnant women (25.7%; n = 576) and all women (25.5%; n = 5138) is similar over the age-range 15–44 years. As in high fertility populations, HIV prevalence is higher in pregnant women at young ages and lower at older ages but the crossover point occurs later due to delayed sexual activity. HIV understatement at older ages due to HIV-associated infertility is mitigated by less HIV infection and less frequent ANC attendance in contraceptive users. The local ANC HIV prevalence estimate is lower [21.2%; n = 1215; risk ratio versus pregnant women in the general population, 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7–1.0], possibly because women from more remote areas are included. ANC estimates overstate the relative risk of HIV in more educated women (age-adjusted odds ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8–1.4 versus 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6–0.9).

Conclusions

ANC estimates understate female HIV prevalence in this low fertility population but, here, the primary cause is not selection of pregnant women. ANC estimate adjustment procedures that control for contraceptive use and age at first sex are needed.

### Performance measurement in mental health and addictions systems: a scoping review [^df9fd497]. Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs: Supplement (2019). High credibility.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) pharmacotherapy prescribing — process performance measure specifies that it will "assess the extent to which clinicians prescribe medications to treat AUD to their patients", is classified as "Process", and is aligned to "Standard: III.2 Providing Therapeutic Alternatives". The numerator is the "Number of patients receiving a medication for alcohol use disorder", and the numerator for AUD "should include all FDA-approved medications, as well as off-label medications", with data capture defined as "Data from providers will capture the number of prescriptions written or medications dispensed" and "Data from payers will capture number of prescriptions filled or paid for based on pharmacy and medical claims". The denominator is the "Number of patients with an alcohol use disorder diagnosis", with the note that "it is likely that the denominator will understate the number of potential patients" and that "This will improve over time with the proposed diagnosis documentation measure". Rationale indicates "strong evidence on the benefit of initiation of alcohol medications", and because "there is less evidence specifying the time period within which medications should be initiated once a diagnosis is made; therefore, no time period from diagnosis to initiation is included in the measure", with the specification intended to build on prior work "with the removal of the time period from diagnosis to initiation and updating the specification using ICD-10". Other comments state "It is too early to set a benchmark on a prevalence percentage", the panel "chose not to address medication adherence, at this time" given that "it would be inappropriate to set a benchmark at this time for adherence", and due to compliance challenges "it requires measuring whether a prescription has been paid for and filled".

### Association of health insurance, geography, and race and ethnicity with disparities in receipt of recommended postpartum care in the US [^5da613a2]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cross-sectional survey study suggest that evaluating postpartum care by attendance at a single visit obscures information about the content and quality of care. Inequities in the content of care received are extensive across patient health insurance type, rural or urban residence, and race and ethnicity. Moreover, these disparities are compounded for patients with multiple intersecting disadvantaged identities. Looking at only 1 dimension of identity understates the extent of disparities in postpartum health and care.

### Novel concepts for analgesia in pediatric surgical patients. cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, alpha 2-agonists, and opioids [^1c21dd52]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Pain has been an understated concern in infants and children. Failure to recognize pain in the past has resulted in undue suffering by infants and children of all ages, but with the introduction of instruments to measure pain and a widespread appreciation of the severity of this problem in this age group, pain is rapidly coming under control. Novel concepts in both old and new analgesics have created safe and effective pain management strategies for infants and children. This review examines three analgesics and their potential roles in infants and children: cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, alpha 2-agonists and opioids.

### Common misconceptions about vitamin D – implications for clinicians [^6a69aa96]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Misconceptions about vitamin D continue to grow despite publications in the past few years that have attempted to clarify risk. We present our perspective, and offer several conclusions. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation can reduce fracture risk by ∼10%. On the other hand, little evidence exists to support a threshold measure for vitamin D status (serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) above which fractures are reduced. The association of serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with other chronic diseases is confounded by multiple factors and conflicting outcomes that cannot be used to support a causal association. High doses of vitamin D supplements might not be completely harmless and should be avoided until additional data becomes available. Similarly, scant rationale exists for aggressive vitamin D supplementation for pregnant or lactating women. Dispelling misconceptions about vitamin D will ultimately benefit health-care providers and patients alike.

Increasing numbers of patients are surviving the intensive care unit. Concordant with our shifting focus to minimizing intensive care unit-acquired morbidity, in the present issue of Critical Care Moyen, Camire, and Stelfox describe the importance of quality pharmacotherapy. They describe challenges and potential solutions to this source of iatrogenic injury in our vulnerable patients. Their article reminds us not to understate the importance of medication error, to avoid overstating the benefits of incompletely proven methods to prevent medication error, and to distinguish harmful medication errors from other types of medication error.

### Homelessness and maternal and infant health [^ba297939]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This cross-sectional analysis found associations between homelessness and MCH. While PRAMS data are only representative of included states, applying the 2.4% homelessness rate to all US births in 2023 implies 70 000 babies would be born within 12 months of maternal homelessness. We expect increasing numbers of postpartum people to be affected, and concomitant inequities to widen, with expiration of pandemic-era renter protections. Limitations of this study are that PRAMS is cross-sectional and observational; we were unable to follow up affected populations over time or address potential unmeasured confounding. To the extent that homelessness also raises the risk of stillbirth or miscarriage, estimates focusing on live births may understate its impact on MCH. Self-reports of homelessness may also understate population prevalence. Longitudinal analysis is urgently needed to identify how health evolves over pregnancy, and whether supportive interventions (such as additional prenatal care) can improve MCH among postpartum people who have experienced homelessness and reduce racial and ethnic inequities.

### Exploring the use of hospital and community mental health services among newly resettled refugees [^3b756c27]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that refugees who resettle in Australia tend to use fewer mental health services than the Australian general population except for specific stress-related diagnoses. However, the need for a more comprehensive analysis cannot be understated, neither can the importance of better mental health literacy and mental health screening be ignored. The present study is therefore not only an exploration of refugee mental health use but also a call for more targeted investigations.

### Why the IOM recommendations for vitamin D are deficient [^e568c0e3]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The IOM recommendations for vitamin D fail in a major way on logic, on science, and on effective public health guidance. Moreover, by failing to use a physiological referent, the IOM approach constitutes precisely the wrong model for development of nutritional policy.

### Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and implantation of a leadless pacemaker: a case report [^c8a4885b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We reported a ccTGA patient with rare anatomical and electrophysiological abnormality who underwent leadless pacemaker implantation and aimed to provide evidence for this subgroup of patients. The importance of preoperative imaging evaluation for patients with rare anatomical and electrophysiological abnormalities cannot be understated. This case illustrates that the leadless pacemaker implant release position has to be controlled during the procedure to improve surgical efficiency and prevent complications.

### Vitamin D deficiency 2.0: an update on the current status worldwide [^d32a9517]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of > 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below < 30nmol/L (or 12ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.

### Calcium and vitamin D controversies [^317b6799]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Controversies regarding appropriate use of vitamin D and calcium are predominately related to the extraskeletal effects. Calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone health. The concerns regarding calcium and cardiovascular complications are inconclusive at best, and do not warrant a change in our approach to supplementation at this time. A growing body of literature exists suggesting that additional vitamin D may have numerous benefits, although more study needs to be done. Further prospective trials would provide insight into the potential advantages that increased vitamin D supplementation could provide.

Grade A: The USPSTF strongly recommends that clinicians provide [the service] to eligible patients. The USPSTF found good evidence that [the service] improves important health outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harms. Grade B: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians provide [the service] to eligible patients. The USPSTF found at least fair evidence that [the service] improves important health outcomes and concludes that benefits outweigh harms. Grade C: The USPSTF makes no recommendation for or against routine provision of [the service]. The USPSTF found at least fair evidence that [the service] can improve health outcomes but concludes that the balance of benefits and harms is too close to justify a general recommendation. Grade D: The USPSTF recommends against routinely providing [the service] to asymptomatic patients. The USPSTF found at least fair evidence that [the service] is ineffective or that harms outweigh benefits. Grade I: The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routinely providing [the service]. Evidence that [the service] is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Strength of overall evidence — The USPSTF grades the quality of the overall evidence for a service on a 3-point scale (good, fair, poor): Good: Evidence includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative populations that directly assess effects on health outcomes. Fair: Evidence is sufficient to determine effects on health outcomes, but the strength of the evidence is limited by the number, quality, or consistency of the individual studies, generalizability to routine practice, or indirect nature of the evidence on health outcomes. Poor: Evidence is insufficient to assess the effects on health outcomes because of limited number or power of studies, important flaws in their design or conduct, gaps in the chain of evidence, or lack of information on important health outcomes.

### Vitamin D: extraskeletal health [^42091167]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. There is a multitude of causes of vitamin D deficiency, but the major cause has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by the Institute of Medicine and other health agencies. It is likely that our hunter gatherer fore-fathers being exposed to sunlight on a daily basis were making several thousand IU of vitamin D a day. The fact that 100 IU of vitamin D prevented overt signs of rickets led to the false security that ingesting twice this amount was more than adequate to satisfy the body's vitamin D requirement. Although this may be true for preventing overt skeletal deformities associated with rickets, there is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. The likely reason is that essentially every tissue and cell in the body has a VDR and thus, to have enough vitamin D to satisfy all of these cellular requirements, the blood level of 25(OH)D needs to be above 30 ng/mL. It has been estimated that for every 100 IU of vitamin D ingested that the blood level of 25(OH)D increases by 1 ng/mL. Thus to theoretically achieve a blood level above 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of 3000 IU of vitamin D a day. There is evidence, however, that when the blood levels of 25(OH)D are less than 15 ng/mL, the body is able to more efficiently use vitamin D to raise the blood level to about 20 ng/mL. To raise the blood level of 25(OH)D above 20 ng/mL requires the ingestion of 100 IU of vitamin D for every 1-ng increase; therefore to increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D a day for adults. There is a great need to significantly increase the recommended adequate intakes of vitamin D. All neonates during the first year of life should take at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D, and increasing it to 1000 IU/d may provide additional health benefits. Children 1 year and older should take at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D as recently recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, but they should consider increasing intake up to 2000 IU/d derive maximum health benefits from vitamin D. Prepubertal and teenage girls who received 2000 IU of vitamin D per day for a year showed improvement in their musculoskeletal health with no untoward toxicity. All adults should be taking 2000 IU of vitamin D per day. A recent study reported that adults who took 50,000 IU of vitamin D once every 2 weeks, which is equivalent to taking 3000 IU of vitamin D a day, for up to 6 years was effective in maintaining blood levels of 25(OH)D of between 40 and 60 ng/mL without any toxicity. There is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake, with the exception of acquired disorders such as granulomatous diseases including sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, as well as some lymphomas with activated macrophages that produce 1,25(OH)2D3 in an unregulated fashion.

### The 2011 report on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D from the institute of medicine: what clinicians need to know [^3b64c997]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The available scientific evidence supports a key role for calcium and vitamin D in skeletal health, providing a sound basis for DRIs. The evidence, however, is not yet compelling that either nutrient confers benefits for, or is causally related to, extraskeletal health outcomes. Moreover, existing evidence suggests that nearly all individuals meet their needs at intake levels (RDAs) provided in this report and, for vitamin D, at 25OHD levels of at least 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) even under conditions of minimal sun exposure. Furthermore, higher levels have not been shown consistently to confer greater benefits, challenging the concept that "more is better". The Committee finds that the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy in the North American population has been overestimated by some groups due to the use of inappropriate cut-points that greatly exceed the levels identified in this report. Serum concentrations of 25OHD above 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) are not consistently associated with increased benefit, and risks have been identified for some outcomes at 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/liter). Additional research, including large-scale, randomized clinical trials, is needed. In the meantime, however, we believe that there is an urgent clinical and public health need for consensus cut-points for serum 25OHD inadequacy to avoid problems of both undertreatment and overtreatment.

### Controversies in vitamin D: summary statement from an international conference [^63a00243]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D is classically recognized as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent advances in the measurement of vitamin D metabolites, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, and clinical observations have led to an appreciation that along with its role in skeletal metabolism, vitamin D may well have an important role in nonclassical settings. Measurement of the circulating form of vitamin D that best describes total body stores, namely 25-hydroxyvitamin D, can be unreliable despite many sophisticated methodologies that have been proposed and implemented. Likewise, evidence from clinical studies showing a beneficial role of vitamin D in different disease states has been controversial and at times speculative. Moreover, the target concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to address a number of putative links between vitamin D inadequacy and nonskeletal diseases are further areas of uncertainty.

Setting

To address these issues, an international conference on "Controversies in Vitamin D" was held in Pisa, Italy, in June 2017. Three main topics were addressed: (i) vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D; (ii) skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D; (iii) therapeutics of vitamin D.

Results

This report provides a summary of the deliberations of the expert panels of the conference.

Conclusions

Despite great advances in our appreciation of vitamin D metabolism, measurements, biological actions on classical and nonclassical tissues, and therapeutics, all of which this report summarizes, much more work remains to be done so that our knowledge base can become even more secure.

### 'Vitamin D and cognition in older adults': updated international recommendations [^cfbf8017]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypovitaminosis D, a condition that is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years and above, is associated with brain changes and dementia. Given the rapidly accumulating and complex contribution of the literature in the field of vitamin D and cognition, clear guidance is needed for researchers and clinicians.

Methods

International experts met at an invitational summit on 'Vitamin D and Cognition in Older Adults'. Based on previous reports and expert opinion, the task force focused on key questions relating to the role of vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Each question was discussed and voted using a Delphi-like approach.

Results

The experts reached an agreement that hypovitaminosis D increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults and may alter the clinical presentation as a consequence of related comorbidities; however, at present, vitamin D level should not be used as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of Alzheimer's disease due to lack of specificity and insufficient evidence. This population should be screened for hypovitaminosis D because of its high prevalence and should receive supplementation, if necessary; but this advice was not specific to cognition. During the debate, the possibility of 'critical periods' during which vitamin D may have its greatest impact on the brain was addressed; whether hypovitaminosis D influences cognition actively through deleterious effects and/or passively by loss of neuroprotection was also considered.

Conclusions

The international task force agreed on five overarching principles related to vitamin D and cognition in older adults. Several areas of uncertainty remain, and it will be necessary to revise the proposed recommendations as new findings become available.

### How deficient are vitamin D deficient critically ill patients? [^5aba9a4a]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among critically ill patients and may be associated with adverse outcomes. Failure of conventional vitamin D supplementation in correcting deficiency has called for studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a high-dose regime in critically ill patients. High-dose vitamin D supplementation that corrects a deficient state effectively and safely allows for intervention studies to be undertaken to determine the impact of vitamin D on morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of concurrent conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

Appendix H quality of the body of evidence assessment — quality ratings and criteria define the overall rating as high, moderate, low, or insufficient. High means "High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect", and may be supported by "either multiple high-quality studies with consistent findings and precise estimates of effect or a single, multi-site RCT with definitive results". Moderate means "Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate", and "requires at least one high-quality study or moderate-quality with a precise estimate of effect", potentially including several moderate-quality studies with wide confidence intervals or some inconsistent findings. Low means "Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate", and may consist of "a single moderate-quality study or multiple studies with inconsistent findings or lack of precision". Insufficient indicates "Evidence either is unavailable or does not permit a conclusion", which is most common when no evidence was identified or when consistency is absent and precision is low or variable. Assessment involves "four domains: the aggregate quality of the studies, the consistency of the results, whether the evidence provided is direct or indirect, and the precision of the evidence", and quality of individual studies records how many are "Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3".

### Evidences for a protective role of vitamin D in COVID-19 [^c23ed00b]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Given the evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in modulating immune function, and the impact of vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D-deficient patients with COVID-19, as well as the favourable safety profile (and low cost) of vitamin D, practical recommendations should be synthesised as follows:

Current public health guidelines for optimising vitamin D status should be followed always and clinical data from systematic reviews and meta-analyses show benefits in the prevention of respiratory infections and improvement of pulmonary function when vitamin D-deficient patients are supplemented.
The optimal vitamin D status of the host may contribute key immunoregulatory functions in settings of viral respiratory infection and overall the altered immune-inflammatory COVID-19 reactivity at least by downregulating overly exuberant cytokine responses (pathological cytokine storm, in fact higher vitamin D levels correlate with lower IL-6 levels).
Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 should have baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations measured and should be supplemented to a level > 30 ng/mL (optimal 40–60 ng/mL), especially when the baseline level is < 10 ng/mL.
In COVID-19 patients with 25(OH)D serum concentrations under 20 ng/mL the recommended dose for correction of deficiency is 6000–7000 oral IU/day for 6–8 weeks. For maintenance, the dose varies from 2000 to 3000 oral IU/day depending on the age and clinical condition of the individual up to reach optimal concentrations.
When it is not possible to measure baseline 25(OH)D concentrations in COVID-19 patients, it seems essential supplementing with 2000–3000 oral IU per day up to the suggested optimal serum concentrations (40–60 ng/mL).

A final message based on all the practical issues discussed: keep the vitamin D serum concentrations during all the year between 40 and 60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L), it is one of the fundamental care to reduce, at least the risk of RTIs, COVID-19 included.

KDOQI hemodialysis adequacy — guideline statements were produced as "5 guidelines" and graded using the GRADE approach with "scales of A to D for quality of the evidence and 1 or 2 for strength of the recommendation". When evidence was insufficient, "the Work Group offered recommendations based on the best available evidence and expert opinion", and when data were sparse, "the guideline is ungraded, based on consensus opinion of the Work Group". Clinicians are advised that "circumstances may appear that would require straying from the recommendations of the Work Group".

### The R.O. A.D. to precision medicine [^d26f2196]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our proof of concept showcases one type of confounding bias that may be present in an observational study; specifically, patients who undergo treatment may have worse outcomes not because the treatment was detrimental but because their baseline risk was higher than that of the untreated patients. However, there is another type of confounding bias that falsely improves outcomes. For example, patients who receive Treatment A may fare better than those who receive Treatment B due to the presence of favorable but unobserved confounders in the former (e.g. younger age, fewer comorbidities, treatment at high-volume hospitals, etc.); thus, it is the confounders and not the treatment itself that improve patient outcomes. Notably, our approach can address unobserved confounding in this scenario as well. Specifically, we can increase the weight of the patients who received Treatment B and did not have a negative outcome until we find the optimal weight.

To make accurate HTE predictions on an individual level, it is important to address the challenges associated with unobserved confounding. To facilitate clinical implementation, it is equally important that the subsequent OPTs define patient subgroups with heterogeneous treatment effects based on their distinct characteristics. This is highly advantageous as these recommendations can be readily tested for clinical intuitiveness. In contrast, the methodologies that compare treatment effects across different risk strata lack an output in the form of patient subgroups with distinct characteristics. Another weakness of these methodologies relates to the somewhat arbitrary splits that define the different risk strata (e.g. risk deciles). Even when there are varying treatment effects across different strata, the treatment effects within each risk stratum may also vary, making it challenging to implement precision medicine. In contrast, the OPTs split on the level of which variables to include, which cut offs to select, and how the different variables are combined without any user intervention.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^7a055041]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST strength of recommendations — weak recommendations are graded 2A, 2B, and 2C with corresponding evidence and implications. Weak recommendations (2A–2B): Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden. Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence (2A): Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies; The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (2B): Evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies; Best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Weak recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (2C): Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risk, and burden may be closely balanced; Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence; Other alternatives may be equally reasonable. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.

Level 1 ("We recommend") implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 ("We suggest") implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". The additional category "Not Graded" "was used, typically, to provide guidance based on common sense or where the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence", and "are generally written as simple declarative statements, but are not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations". Evidence quality meanings are: A (High) — "We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect". B (Moderate) — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different". C (Low) — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect". D (Very low) — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth".

In conclusion, we recommend appropriate vitamin D RCTs to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 infections. Until there is more robust scientific evidence for vitamin D, we strongly caution against the use of high vitamin D supplementation (greater than the upper limit of 4000 IU/day (100 µg/day)). Rather, we strongly endorse avoidance of vitamin D deficiencyin the population (as per the six points above) and complete adherence to government's advice worldwide on the prevention of the spread of COVID-19.

### The effect of publication bias magnitude and direction on the certainty in evidence [^307c2397]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Publication bias occurs when studies with statistically significant results have increased likelihood of being published. Publication bias is commonly associated with inflated treatment effect which lowers the certainty of decision makers about the evidence. In this guide we propose that systematic reviewers and decision makers consider the direction and magnitude of publication bias, as opposed to just the binary determination of the presence of this bias, before lowering their certainty in the evidence. Direction of bias may not always exaggerate the treatment effect. The presence of bias with a trivial magnitude may not affect the decision at hand. Various statistical approaches are available to determine the direction and magnitude of publication bias.

### Treatment effects in randomised trials using routinely collected data for outcome assessment versus traditional trials: meta-research study [^96dcd3a8]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Data quality is a key problem of using routinely collected data for clinical research. On the one hand, for some outcomes the quality of routinely collected data might be lower, in particular as a result of non-uniform data collection and potential measurement errors. On the other hand, healthcare professionals collecting routine data during usual care might have more clinical expertise than research staff who often collect trial data only for a narrow time frame and scope, sometimes only for a few participants or even a single patient in each centre. Since routine data are collected independently of the trial from people unaware of treatment allocations, biases related to outcome ascertainment might be even less likely than in traditional trials. Moreover, quality of routinely collected data can vary enormously for different outcomes. For mortality, the quality might be high: complete, accurate information can be achieved with proper linkage to death registries, whereas other trials not linked to routinely collected data sources might lack information on survival status for many participants. Conversely, the quality of routinely collected data might be highly insufficient for other outcomes, such as specific adverse events or some patient reported endpoints. The impact of using routinely collected data for outcome ascertainment and the impact of potential inaccuracies on trial results is unclear. Misclassification of clinical events or missing information that occurs randomly — for example, due to coding errors or problems with database linkage, could diminish the treatment effect point estimates. Larger sample sizes achieved by using routinely collected data might increase precision of treatment effect estimates, but these could still be biased underestimations.

Here, we provide empirical insights on the agreement of findings from trials using routinely collected data for measuring outcomes compared with traditional randomised clinical trials not using routinely collected data.

### The R.O. A.D. to precision medicine [^d2b89f15]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, hyperparameter tuning of OPTs, which is the only level in which the user is involved, did not result in drastically different OPTs. In fact, regardless of the differences in the structure (e.g. different variables or different variable cut offs), the OPTs are robust in that their sensitivity and specificity converge. This may mean that some patient characteristics used by the OPTs are surrogates of the outcome of interest and not causally related. However, this does not decrease their practical value as the essence of precision medicine is to find the best match between the available treatments and patient subgroups and not the discovery of causal relationships. Importantly, not only did the sensitivity and specificity of the various OPTs converge, but their combined values exceeded those of current recommendations, which relied on a blend of expert opinion and statistical analysis. Furthermore, the use of sensitivity and specificity is a novel addition as the use of these metrics was previously restricted to validating diagnostic tests only.

### Systematic reviews: how they work and how to use them [^349a0f06]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

At their best, systematic reviews should be the least biased summaries of the effect of healthcare interventions. However, authors can introduce both intended and unintended biases into systematic reviews. Results presented as odds ratios are often misinterpreted by readers as relative risks, meaning that the effect of the intervention is overestimated. Authors may analyse trials separately having mistaken differences in baseline risk for differences in the effect of an intervention and differences in effect between trials that have been analysed together may go undetected. In this article I discuss how a systematic review should work and how it can go wrong.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^8974d2e7]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

KDIGO guideline — grading workflow and recommendation development specifies roles, definitions, and outputs: The evidence review was led by the ERT, while the Work Group Co-Chairs led discussion on recommendation strength. The strength of a recommendation indicates how confident one can be that adherence will do more good than harm, and the quality of a body of evidence refers to confidence in an estimate of effect sufficient to support a recommendation. Following GRADE, evidence for each outcome was initially categorized by study design, and the potential grade for each intervention–outcome pair started at high but could be lowered for methodological limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision or sparsity, or reporting bias. The final grade for an intervention–outcome pair could be High, Moderate, Low, or Very Low. Overall evidence quality across outcomes was then determined based on the outcome-specific grades and the relative importance of each outcome, with final categories A, B, C, or D. Net health benefit was determined from the anticipated balance of benefits and harms across clinically important outcomes and involved judgment from the Work Group and the ERT. Draft recommendation statements were developed by the Work Group Co-Chairs and members, considering health benefits, side effects, risks, and patient preferences when available.

ACOEM evidence-based recommendations — classification and evidence synthesis methods are specified as follows: Strongly Recommended (A) requires at least 2 high-quality studies, Moderately Recommended (B) requires at least 1 high-quality and/or multiple moderate quality, and Recommended (C) requires at least one moderate quality study; additional categories include Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I); No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I); Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I); Not Recommended (C); Moderately Not Recommended (B); and Strongly Not Recommended (A). Insufficient Evidence is used to clearly denote expert consensus recommendations and, when evidence is either absent or substantially conflicting, to demarcate consensus-based recommendations. Final recommendation summaries include the numbers and strength of studies in a clearly defined "Rationale for Recommendation" section. When combined analyses are sensible, tests for homogeneity (I²) and/or random effects models are used and reported; many pooled analyses are drawn from Cochrane reviews provided they reasonably support summary estimates. However, pooled summary measures may be inappropriate for topics with population heterogeneity, different outcome measures, or substantially varying time intervals. After the systematic review, discrepancies with prior quality systematic reviews are addressed first in the Guideline development group and then in panel deliberations.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^77a6fed7]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Proposed management of ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer

While there is little doubt of the role of D-dimer in the diagnostic workup of patients affected by acute illnesses such as VTE, DIC and sepsis (Table 1), a challenge is represented by the management of ambulatory individuals characterized by the detection of high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis. This issue has received greater attention given the generalized and indiscriminate dispensation of D-dimer testing during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. When an ostensibly healthy and asymptomatic person is referred for persistently high D-dimer, they should first be reassured by explaining all the possible reasons other than disease that may underly this abnormality. On the other hand, an abnormal D-dimer should not be overlooked in otherwise asymptomatic subjects. Thus, they should have access to differential diagnostic procedures, and all possible conditions associated with increased D-dimer should be taken into consideration in the process.

Certainty assessment

Item 15. Describe any methods used to assess certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence for an outcome

Explanation: Authors typically use some criteria to decide how certain (or confident) they are in the body of evidence for each important outcome. Common factors considered include precision of the effect estimate (or sample size), consistency of findings across studies, study design limitations and missing results (risk of bias), and how directly the studies address the question. Tools and frameworks can be used to provide a systematic, explicit approach to assessing these factors and provide a common approach and terminology for communicating certainty. For example, using the GRADE approach, authors will first apply criteria to assess each GRADE domain (imprecision, inconsistency, risk of bias, and so forth) and then make an overall judgment of whether the evidence supporting a result is of high, moderate, low, or very low certainty. Reporting the factors considered and the criteria used to assess each factor enables readers to determine which factors fed into reviewers' assessment of certainty. Reporting the process by which assessments were conducted enables readers to assess the potential for errors and facilitates replication.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^9ab16fa4]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

GRADE evidence to recommendation framework — recommendation strength and direction are determined using four decision domains, including Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, Confidence in the quality of the evidence, Values and preferences, and Other implications (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations). For the balance domain, judgments span "Benefits outweigh harms/burden", "Benefits and harms/burden are balanced", and "Harms/burden outweigh benefits"; for confidence they are "High Moderate Low Very low", and for values/preferences they include "Similar values", "Some variation", and "Large variation", with other implications summarized as "Various considerations". The strength of a recommendation is defined as confidence that desirable effects outweigh undesirable effects and is "based on the framework above, which combines the four domains", and "GRADE methodology does not allow for recommendations to be made based on expert opinion alone"; while "strong recommendations are usually based on high or moderate confidence in the estimates of effect (quality of the evidence) there may be instances where strong recommendations are warranted even when the quality of evidence is low". The GRADE of a recommendation is based on "Four decision domains used to determine the strength and direction (described above)", "Relative strength (Strong or Weak)", and "Direction (For or Against)", and "The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, "Strong" or "Weak".

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (5.1, 7.1).
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (5.2).
Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage (2.3, 5.3).
