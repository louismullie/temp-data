## Question

IV. Fluid therapy recommendations crohns flare

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about intravenous fluid therapy recommendations for a Crohn's disease flare. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity stratification. Then, I should verify the strength and quality of evidence for IV fluids. Next, I will quantify fluid needs and composition, integrate electrolyte and anemia correction, and consider special scenarios like abscess or severe colitis. Finally, I will align with treat-to-target principles and summarize a practical, safety-focused algorithm with monitoring checkpoints.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity framework, because fluid strategy hinges on whether this is a mild-to-moderate outpatient flare versus a moderate-to-severe presentation with systemic toxicity or an acute abdomen. In moderate-to-severe disease or when there is systemic inflammatory response, hospitalization and supportive care are indicated, whereas mild disease may be managed outpatient with oral rehydration and close follow-up, and I should not jump to conclusions before I classify severity and risk of complications [^da6d6c41] [^416ee663].

> Now, I need to check the strength of evidence for IV fluids. The WSES-AAST emergency surgery guideline explicitly recommends administering an adequate volume of intravenous fluids to all IBD patients presenting with an acute abdomen, alongside LMWH for thromboprophylaxis and correction of electrolytes and anemia, which gives this a strong, directive signal despite the emergency setting [^86c87c5d] [^4fa5c3a9]. Hold on, I should verify whether gastroenterology guidelines echo this; while ACG and ECCO emphasize objective assessment and treat-to-target, they do not contradict the need for IV fluids in ill patients, and their focus is more on disease-modifying therapy than on supportive care specifics, which still leaves the emergency guidance as the most explicit source for fluids in flares with systemic involvement [^da6d6c41] [^5fee3572].

> Next, I should review how to quantify "adequate" IV fluids. Let me think about practical targets: in adults with hypovolemia or systemic toxicity, typical resuscitation uses crystalloids such as Lactated Ringer's or normal saline, often starting with a 1–2 liter bolus followed by titration to urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hr, mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg, and normalization of heart rate and capillary refill, while avoiding over-resuscitation. Wait, I should double-check that these are accepted hemodynamic targets rather than IBD-specific numbers; yes, these are standard critical care and emergency resuscitation endpoints and are reasonable to apply in IBD flares with shock physiology or severe dehydration [^notfound].

> I will now examine fluid composition and electrolyte strategy. Isotonic crystalloids are appropriate for volume replacement, and I should correct deficits in potassium, magnesium, and phosphate as guided by labs, given frequent losses from diarrhea and poor intake. Let me verify that guidelines emphasize electrolyte correction; the WSES-AAST statement explicitly calls for correcting electrolyte abnormalities in acute IBD presentations, which supports proactive repletion during IV fluid therapy [^86c87c5d] [^4fa5c3a9].

> But wait, what if the patient is severely anemic or iron deficient? I need to ensure I integrate anemia management. ECCO and ESPEN recommend IV iron as first-line in active IBD with intolerance to oral iron or hemoglobin below about 10 g/dL, and recurrence is common, so I should anticipate the need for retreatment and monitor ferritin and hemoglobin during and after the flare. Hold on, I should verify thresholds; ECCO suggests IV iron when hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL in active disease, which aligns with practice to transfuse only if symptomatic or hemoglobin is very low, while prioritizing iron repletion otherwise [^2c7bd6e6] [^ebb4a725] [^b3155eb1].

> Next, I should review special scenarios that modify fluid and supportive care. If there is an intra-abdominal abscess, I need to ensure source control with image-guided drainage and targeted antibiotics rather than relying on fluids alone, and only then escalate anti-TNF therapy once sepsis risk is mitigated. Let me verify that both ECCO surgical guidance and WSES-AAST align here; yes, both recommend drainage and antibiotics for abscess before anti-TNF, and fluids remain supportive rather than definitive in this setting [^bb359521] [^4fa5c3a9]. For severe colitis or toxic megacolon physiology, aggressive IV fluids, NPO status, and close monitoring for perforation are essential, with early rescue therapy if steroids fail, which again underscores that fluids are foundational but insufficient without disease-directed escalation and surveillance imaging [^416ee663].

> I should confirm how this integrates with treat-to-target principles. Even while providing supportive fluids, I need to plan objective reassessment of disease activity within 4–12 weeks, consider biomarkers such as CRP and fecal calprotectin to guide escalation, and avoid prolonged steroid exposure without steroid-sparing maintenance. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping steroids too early; the balance is to taper once clinically improved while ensuring transition to maintenance therapy to prevent relapse [^da6d6c41] [^5fee3572].

> Let me synthesize a practical, safety-focused algorithm and double-check it aligns with evidence. In patients with a Crohn's flare and systemic toxicity or acute abdomen, start isotonic IV crystalloids with 1–2 liter boluses titrated to urine output, MAP, and heart rate, correct electrolytes promptly, assess for anemia and give IV iron if indicated, initiate VTE prophylaxis, and concurrently begin disease-specific therapy such as IV corticosteroids for severe colitis or anti-TNF induction once infections and abscesses are excluded or drained. In mild-to-moderate flares without systemic instability, oral rehydration may suffice, but I should monitor closely and escalate to IV fluids if oral intake is inadequate or symptoms worsen. I should verify that this approach matches both emergency and gastroenterology guidance; yes, it reflects WSES-AAST supportive care and ACG/ECCO treat-to-target principles without overstepping the evidence base [^86c87c5d] [^da6d6c41] [^5fee3572].

> Finally, I need to ensure monitoring and follow-up are explicit. During active inpatient management, check vitals, urine output, and electrolytes every 4–6 hours initially, reassess volume status daily, and obtain CBC and inflammatory markers to track response. After stabilization, transition to outpatient treat-to-target follow-up with biomarker and symptom monitoring, and plan objective reassessment of mucosal healing within 4–12 weeks to confirm remission and adjust maintenance therapy. Hold on, I should verify that biomarker-guided strategies improve outcomes; the AGA biomarker guideline supports biomarker-informed strategies to improve detection of active disease and guide timely escalation, which strengthens the case for structured monitoring after the acute phase [^da6d6c41] [^3ed775de] [^2dbc0428].

In Crohn's flares, **IV fluids are essential** for correcting dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and hypovolemia, especially with vomiting, diarrhea, or poor oral intake [^86c87c5d]. Use **isotonic crystalloids** (normal saline or Lactated Ringer's) and titrate to clinical endpoints (urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h, MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, HR < 100 bpm) [^notfound]. Add potassium, magnesium, and phosphate as needed, and avoid over-resuscitation to prevent fluid overload. In severe colitis or systemic toxicity, **early IV fluids** with close monitoring are critical; in mild flares, oral rehydration may suffice if tolerated [^416ee663].

---

## Indications for IV fluid therapy in Crohn's flares

IV fluids are indicated in Crohn's flares for the following scenarios:

- **Dehydration**: From vomiting, diarrhea, or poor oral intake [^notfound].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypophosphatemia from gastrointestinal losses.
- **Hypovolemia**: Reduced intravascular volume causing hypotension or organ hypoperfusion.
- **Severe disease**: Systemic toxicity, severe colitis, or acute abdomen requiring aggressive supportive care [^416ee663].

---

## Recommended IV fluid solutions

Isotonic crystalloids are **first-line** for volume replacement in Crohn's flares:

| **Fluid solution** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) | General dehydration, hypovolemia, electrolyte replacement | Isotonic; suitable for most patients |
| Lactated Ringer's | Dehydration with metabolic acidosis or lactate accumulation | Buffering effect; avoids hyperchloremic acidosis |
| Dextrose-containing solutions (e.g. D5W) | Hypoglycemia or when glucose supplementation is needed | Provides calories and prevents hypoglycemia |

---

Potassium, magnesium, and phosphate should be added based on **serial laboratory results** to replace ongoing losses.

---

## Fluid administration strategy

Fluid therapy should be **individualized** and titrated to clinical response:

- **Initial bolus**: 1–2 liters of isotonic crystalloid for significant dehydration or hypovolemia.
- **Maintenance**: 75–100 mL/hour, adjusted to urine output, heart rate, blood pressure, and clinical status.
- **Endpoints**: Urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h, mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg, heart rate < 100 bpm, and resolution of signs of dehydration.

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Continuous monitoring is essential to guide therapy and prevent complications:

- **Vital signs**: Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature.
- **Urine output**: Catheterize if necessary to accurately monitor.
- **Laboratory tests**: Electrolytes, renal function, acid-base status, and glucose.
- **Clinical assessment**: Mental status, skin turgor, mucous membranes, and edema.

---

## Potential complications of inadequate or excessive fluid therapy

Inadequate fluid therapy can cause **hypovolemic shock**, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte disturbances, whereas excessive fluids can lead to pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and electrolyte dilution. Careful titration and monitoring are essential to balance these risks [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Severe colitis or systemic toxicity**: Early aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with close monitoring is critical [^416ee663].
- **Renal or cardiac comorbidities**: Use caution and consider smaller boluses with closer monitoring.
- **Mild flares**: Oral rehydration may suffice if tolerated, reserving IV fluids for refractory cases.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Indications**: Dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, hypovolemia, severe disease.
- **Solutions**: Isotonic crystalloids (normal saline or Lactated Ringer's); add electrolytes as needed.
- **Strategy**: Individualized titration to clinical endpoints.
- **Monitoring**: Vital signs, urine output, labs, and clinical assessment.
- **Complications**: Avoid under- and over-resuscitation through careful monitoring.

---

IV fluid therapy is a **cornerstone of supportive care** in Crohn's flares, restoring volume and electrolytes while enabling disease-directed therapy. Use isotonic crystalloids, titrate to clinical response, and monitor closely to avoid complications.

CORTICOSTEROIDS Corticosteroids are often used for symptom management. 2, 24 Tapering courses of prednisone, with initial doses of 40 to 60 mg based on disease severity, are recommended. Depending on response and how quickly remission is achieved, first tapering by 5 mg per week until the patient reaches a dose of 20 mg, and then tapering by 2. 5 to 5 mg weekly until discontinuation is an appropriate strategy. 2 When disease is diffuse or located in the left colon, prednisone is preferred; however, formulations of controlled ileal-release budesonide are an option for disease affecting the ileum and/or proximal colon and may be preferred because of their unique delivery specifically to that area. 2 Budesonide undergoes significant first-pass metabolism in the liver, resulting in improved tolerability.

26 Because corticosteroids do not maintain remission, adverse effects are common, and because perforating complications are higher in patients who take corticosteroids, they are most often used to treat symptom flare-ups while patients transition to more effective therapies. Anti-TNF agents, such as certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, and infliximab, induce and maintain remission in moderate- to high-risk patients, or in patients with inadequate response to corticosteroids and immunomodulators. Onset of action and clinical benefit are often seen within two weeks of therapy initiation. The overall effectiveness of anti-TNF agents is greatest when given within two years of disease onset. OTHER THERAPIES Enteral nutrition is first-line therapy to induce remission in children. 23, 35 Small studies also show benefit for enteral nutrition for maintenance therapy in adults, so it may be considered when medications are contraindicated or refused.

13, 36 Current evidence does not support the use of probiotics or omega-3 fatty acids.
13. Perianal fistulization is classified as simple or complex. Simple disease is managed with surgical drainage of abscesses and antibiotic therapy. Complex disease first requires surgical drainage of abscesses followed by therapy with an anti-TNF agent. Surgical Treatment The need for surgery is common, with up to 57% of patients requiring at least one surgery.

### Crohn's is not a 6-week disease: lifelong management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease [^0c2a4a2c]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disorder of the digestive tract with heterogeneous clinical presentations. Crohn's is currently not a curable disease, and patients are faced with a lifetime of recurrent disease flare-ups and remissions. Management strategies for Crohn's must therefore be targeted toward lifelong management, taking into consideration not only the short-term but also the long-term aspects of the disease. With this in mind, here we review the classifications and natural history of Crohn's disease and discuss possible predictive factors for the disease evolution in a patient. Here we also evaluate the current preferable treatment practices, based on scientifically valid research and collective clinical experience, for the management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^da6d6c41]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — general management principles and objective assessment — are based on disease location, severity, disease-associated complications including extraintestinal manifestations, and factors affecting future prognosis, and the goal is to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission without significant adverse effects; objective evaluation by endoscopic, sonographic, or cross-sectional imaging is recommended, with improvement evident within 4–12 weeks and maximal treatment effect by 12–16 weeks, after which patients achieving response or remission are transitioned to steroid-sparing maintenance therapy; for continued active symptoms despite optimized therapy, evaluation with an objective study is recommended, and if symptoms or inflammation persist, assessment for medication optimization, addition of other agents, or transition to a different medical or surgical strategy is warranted; biomarkers such as CRP and FC can be assessed but should not exclusively serve as a treatment endpoint, and mimickers such as C. difficile, cytomegalovirus infection, and medication-related adverse effects should be excluded, noting that risks of C. difficile infection may be up to 5-fold higher among patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

Efficacy and Safety of Formulation Switching Between SC Infliximab and IV Infliximab in Patients With CD ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The goal of this prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial is to test efficacy and safety of formulation switching between subcutaneous infliximab and intravenous infliximab in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. The primary endpoint of this study is deep remission at week 54. The main questions this study aims to answer are: In this study, patients with moderately to severely active CD who achieve clinical response to SC Remsima at week 30 will be randomly assigned to IV Remsima group or to continued SC Remsima group. Non-responders at week 30 will be allocated to Arm 1.

The primary endpoint is the non-inferiority of Arm 3 compared with Arm 2 in terms of deep remission rate at week
54. The secondary endpoint is the non-inferiority of Arm 3 compared with Arm 1 in terms of deep remission rate at week 54. The non-inferiority margin is set as -20% and a total of 100 patients will be enrolled.
- 18 years or older
- Moderate to severe Crohn's disease
- Ileocolonic Crohn's disease with Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn Disease ≥ 6 or ileal or colonic CD with with Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn Disease ≥ 4 and ulcer score ≥ 1 in at least one segment.
- **However, the following patients can be included**: from baseline, 4 weeks or more after proper drainage of perianal abscess and from baseline, 8 weeks or more after proper drainage of intra-abdominal abscess
- Active tuberculosis.

However, the following patients can be included: Patients who were diagnosed with tuberculosis, but were properly treated with anti-tuberculosis therapy according to the standard guidelines and who were confirmed to be cured.

### Positioning therapies in the management of Crohn's disease [^29c4cbfb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

In the past decade, several new therapies with different mechanisms of action have been approved for the management of moderate to severe Crohn's disease. However, there is limited guidance on optimal positioning of agents as first- or second-line therapies because of the absence of head-to-head trials. Furthermore, given the lack of comparative studies, treatment guidelines have provided limited insight. In this review, we discuss data on key treatment attributes, comparative efficacy and safety, factors predictive of response to each agent, and propose an algorithm for positioning therapies for the management of patients with low-risk and high-risk Crohn's disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^b7150653]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — subcutaneous infliximab (anti–tumor necrosis factor) maintenance efficacy and dosing: Infliximab is the only anti-TNF agent available as either an intravenous or subcutaneous maintenance therapy for patients with CD, and in the LIBERTY phase 3 trial, 62% of subcutaneous infliximab-treated patients achieved clinical remission at week 54 compared with 32% of placebo patients, with over 50% achieving endoscopic response compared with only 18% of placebo-treated patients. For patients transitioning to subcutaneous infliximab 120 mg every other week, some may require dose escalation to 240 mg subcutaneous every other week to achieve or recapture response. After switching to subcutaneous infliximab 120 mg every 2 weeks, disease relapse occurred in 18.8% of patients within 6 months, with relapse rates by prior intravenous infliximab dosing of 10.2% (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks), 7.3% (10 mg/kg every 8 weeks), 16.7% (10 mg/kg every 6 weeks), and 66.7% (10 mg/kg every 4 weeks). Patients receiving infliximab 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks with an FC > 250 μg/g were more likely to experience a flare, suggesting these patients may need a dose of infliximab 240 mg subcutaneous every 2 weeks at initiation.

Severe colitis in Crohn's colitis — definition, evaluation, and initial management: Severe acute colitis and fulminant colitis apply to patients with colitis with frequent stools (≥ 6/day) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and severe colitis can be classified using modified Truelove and Witts criteria as ≥ 6 bowel movements per day plus at least one of temperature > 37.8°C, pulse > 90 beats per minute, erythrocyte sedimentation rate > 30 mm/h, C-reactive protein > 30 mg/L, or hemoglobin < 10.5 g/dL. Megacolon is often defined as a transverse colon diameter ≥ 5.5 cm and in the setting of SIRS is termed toxic megacolon. When severe Crohn's colitis is suspected, alternative causes (eg, Clostridium difficile, cytomegalovirus) should typically be excluded with stool studies and endoscopic mucosal biopsy via careful flexible sigmoidoscopy; therapeutic drug monitoring may be helpful to guide monoclonal antibody therapy. Laboratory testing including serum C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, creatinine, and albumin, fecal calprotectin, and monoclonal antibody drug levels can help measure response, and given the potentially masking effects of high-dose steroids, patients are usually followed with plain abdominal x-rays to detect megacolon or perforation and these may need to be repeated often, if not daily, until clinical condition improves. Initial treatment includes supportive care, intravenous fluid resuscitation, avoidance of antidiarrheals, limited use of opiates and anticholinergics, and prompt intravenous glucocorticoids (eg, methylprednisolone 60 mg/day); venous thromboembolism prophylaxis beginning on hospital admission is recommended, whereas bowel rest and prophylactic antibiotics are usually not necessary. Response to steroid therapy includes improvement or resolution of SIRS and a decrease in stool frequency (eg, < 6/day) with overall clinical improvement.

Management of C difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease emphasizes early treatment of confirmed infection and supportive measures: clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for CDI in IBD flares, and with a positive stool test for toxigenic C difficile, the initial step is to treat initially for CDI and, if no clinical response is evident, later intensify IBD therapy; after initial fluid and electrolyte balance management, a detailed history and laboratory data must be obtained, and concomitant systemic antibiotics ideally should be discontinued or de-escalated; management is challenging, emerging evidence supports fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for CDI in IBD, and in the absence of prospective IBD-specific data, evidence from the non-IBD population is used.

Introduction

Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterised by recurrent flares that can lead to progressive bowel damage. Conventional management involves treatment of acute flares with corticosteroids and, where required, addition of immunomodulators and advanced therapies to achieve sustained remission. However, the disease course and clinical outcomes for a newly diagnosed patient are highly uncertain. The frequency and severity of flares, likelihood of response to any particular treatment, and rate of progression to complications requiring surgery, including the intestinal strictures and fistulae that characterise Crohn's disease, are all unpredictable. The advent of biologic treatments, including anti-TNF therapy, has helped mitigate adverse outcomes but surgical resection is still required in 17–25% of patients within 5 years of diagnosis.

Ideally, a safe and affordable treatment strategy would be available that was effective in all patients from diagnosis. Thiopurines appear ineffective in this context and the efficacy of advanced therapies from diagnosis remains largely unstudied. Indeed, Crohn's disease trials usually enrol patients years after diagnosis and typically show benefit of active comparator over placebo of only 10–20%. However, one consistent observation based on both post-hoc clinical trial analyses and retrospective cohorts is that the earlier patients receive advanced treatments the more effective they are. Notably, D'Haens and colleaguesrandomised 133 patients within 4 years of Crohn's diagnosis to either infliximab induction followed by azathioprine or conventional step-up care. Remission at week 52 was significantly higher in patients receiving early combined immunosuppression. Similarly, the CALM and REACT trials, which enrolled patients with established Crohn's disease in flare, found that earlier escalation to anti-TNF therapy resulted in fewer major adverse outcomes than treatment with conventional step-up strategies.

AGA living guideline process and update cadence — the guideline is maintained as a living guideline with periodic evidence review and PICO framing of clinical questions. The AGA developed these guidelines as living guidelines, given the rapid pace of innovation and new therapies in CD. A living guideline is defined as one that allows for optimization of guidelines during the development process with updating of individual recommendations based on the availability of new evidence. The evidence for focused questions in the living mode will be reviewed every 6 months; these questions are denoted as living questions in Table 4. The PICO format was used to outline the specific patient population (P), intervention (I), comparator (C), and outcome(s) for each clinical question (Table 4).

Interpretation of strong versus conditional recommendations (GRADE framework) — for patients, the strong form means "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", whereas the conditional form means "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". For clinicians, a strong recommendation implies "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while a conditional recommendation implies "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with their values and preferences. Use shared decision making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For policy makers, a strong recommendation indicates "The recommendation can be adapted as policy or performance measure in most situations" and a conditional recommendation indicates "Policy making will involve various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess whether decision making is appropriate".

### Personalised medicine in Crohn's disease [^c1b0f095]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Similar to many immune-mediated diseases, Crohn's disease follows a relapsing-remitting pattern, with a variable disease course and heterogeneous clinical outcomes. Frequency of flare-ups, development of complications, and response to treatment collectively determine the effect on a patient's quality of life, which can vary from minimal disruption to profound disability or death. Despite recent advances in the understanding of complex disease pathogenesis, including for Crohn's disease, management decisions are still typically made using a one-size-fits-all approach. Indeed, the inability to reliably predict clinical outcomes in a way that could guide future therapy represents a major unmet need. Recently, several important insights have been made into the biology underlying outcomes in Crohn's disease. In this Review, we will summarise these insights and discuss how greater understanding of these disease mechanisms can be used to develop clinically useful biomarkers, identify novel approaches to optimise disease control, and help deliver the goal of personalised medicine.

### ACR appropriateness criteria Crohn disease [^f7350b3e]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder involving the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by episodic flares and times of remission. Underlying structural damage occurs progressively, with recurrent bouts of inflammation. The diagnosis and management of this disease process is dependent on several clinical, laboratory, imaging, endoscopic, and histologic factors. In recent years, with the maturation of CT enterography, and MR enterography, imaging has played an increasingly important role in relation to Crohn Disease. In addition to these specialized examination modalities, ultrasound and routine CT have potential uses. Fluoroscopy, radiography, and nuclear medicine may be less beneficial depending on the clinical scenario. The imaging modality best suited to evaluating this disease may change, depending on the target population, severity of presentation, and specific clinical situation. This document presents seven clinical scenarios (variants) in both the adult and pediatric populations and rates the appropriateness of the available imaging options. They are summarized in a consolidated table, and the underlying rationale and supporting literature are presented in the accompanying narrative. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

Medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) and crohn's sisease (CD) is complex. While there is significant overlap in medical therapies used for UC and CD, there remain few distinct differences in their management. The overall goals of therapy are to achieve disease remission, prevent complications, decrease the need for surgical interventions, and restore patients' quality of life. In the current article, we discuss currently available therapies and their mechanisms, limitations and side effects, followed by a comprehensive discussion of key consideration points in regards to the medical management.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed for articles in any language published up to Sept 17, 2023, with the search terms "Crohn's disease", "early disease", "combined immunosuppression", "treatment algorithm", and "biomarker-stratified". This produced no results. Dropping the requirement for "biomarker-stratified" yielded abstracts for three high quality interventional clinical trials. The Step-Up/Top-Down trial recruited 133 immunosuppressant and anti-TNF-naive patients with moderate to severely active Crohn's disease within 4 years of diagnosis. Patients were randomised to early combined anti-TNF and immunosuppressant induction followed by intermittent anti-TNF treatment to control disease flares, or conventional step-up therapy. At week 52, 61% and 42%, respectively, were in corticosteroid-free symptomatic remission (p = 0·028), with no differences in serious adverse events between groups. The CALM trial randomised 244 adults with Crohn's disease (mean duration 1 year) and endoscopic activity to tight control (treatment escalation for elevated CRP or calprotectin as well as symptoms) versus conventional management (treatment escalation for symptomatic flares). More patients in the tight control group achieved the primary endpoint of mucosal healing at week 48 (46% vs 30%), with no difference in adverse events. Although REACT was framed as testing early combined immunosuppression with a TNF antagonist and antimetabolite, its participants had an average disease duration of over 12 years. The primary endpoint of steroid-free remission (using a symptom-based score alone without corroboration by objective evidence of inflammation) at 12 months, was similar between the 921 patients treated with early combined immunosuppression and the 806 treated conventionally (66% vs 62%; p = 0·52). However, the composite secondary outcome of serious adverse events (complications, hospitalisation, surgery) was lower at 24 months in the early combined immunosuppression group. Although previous trials support earlier use of anti-TNF therapy, typically in combination with an immunomodulator, an accelerated step-up approach to the management of Crohn's disease, where treatment is escalated in intensity until the tendency to relapse is controlled, remains the most common strategy in the UK and globally. Under this strategy, the course of Crohn's disease, including the frequency of disease flares, varies substantially between patients and is unpredictable. To better understand the basis of these heterogeneous outcomes and enable personalised therapy in IBD a blood-based biomarker derived from transcriptional signatures in T-cell subsets was developed and shown in observational datasets to be associated with need for future treatment escalation. Testing its utility, however, would require a biomarker-stratified randomised controlled trial.

Postoperative Crohn's disease — normal C-reactive protein (CRP) test performance in asymptomatic patients is summarized with misclassification counts per 1000 tested across pretest probabilities: false negatives (FN) were 70 (60 to 79) at low pretest probability (10%), 210 (180 to 237) at intermediate (30%), and 420 (360 to 474) at high (60%); false positives (FP) were 90 (54 to 144), 70 (42 to 112), and 40 (24 to 64), respectively. The table notes that FNs would be falsely reassured with potential risk of complications and flare, whereas FPs may undergo unnecessary endoscopy or treatment adjustment with avoidable anxiety and resource use. GRADE certainty of evidence is reported as VERY LOW for FNs, and for FPs as VERY LOW in the low-pretest column and LOW in the intermediate and high columns.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^7409ae27]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline — scope and methods for Crohn's disease biomarkers are defined as follows: This document represents the official recommendations of the AGA and was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. The objective is to inform the role of commonly used serum and fecal biomarkers as surrogates for endoscopic disease activity for both cross-sectional assessment and longitudinal monitoring in patients with an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD). The scope is restricted to biomarkers that are widely available commercially within the United States, and the guideline separately examined the predictive value of biomarkers for assessment of postoperative recurrence in CD while not examining the role of biomarkers in the diagnostic pathway for patients with suspected CD. The target audience includes gastroenterology health care professionals; primary care, emergency, and urgent care providers; patients; and policy makers. The panel defined biomarkers as molecules quantifiable in tissue, blood, stool, or urine that represent an underlying biological disease process, and focused on biomarkers widely used for assessing disease activity and making treatment decisions, measurable in easily accessible body fluid compartments, and commercially available in the United States. The panel examined performance in unselected cohorts of patients with CD, including initial assessment of postoperative recurrence after surgically induced remission, and used endoscopic assessment of disease activity as the gold standard for cross-sectional performance. Biomarkers with demonstrated utility in research studies only, but not available for widespread commercial use, were outside the scope.

AGA living guideline on pharmacologic management of Crohn's disease — discussion of endoscopic targets and outcomes: Recent position statements advise that longitudinal targets for the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) should include not only clinical remission but also endoscopic resolution of inflammation, and studies have shown favorable long-term outcomes among patients who achieve endoscopic remission, including a post‑hoc analysis reporting fewer serious disease‑related complications with endoscopic remission (adjusted HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07–0.31). In contrast, a TAILORIX long‑term follow‑up examined 95 individuals, 45 of whom had achieved deep remission, and in this small cohort there was no difference in rates of Crohn's disease (CD)–related treatment modification, major abdominal or perianal surgery, or CD‑related hospitalization over follow‑up. There was significant heterogeneity among the 2 reviewed studies using endoscopic targets, and based on uncertainty the guideline panel could not make a recommendation in relation to selecting endoscopic targets over clinical targets. In both included trials, the majority of individuals in the endoscopic healing arms were not able to meet the goal of endoscopic healing; for example, only 11% of individuals achieved endoscopic remission. The current question does not address a tight control strategy focusing on treating to a target of biochemical remission, and the CALM trial demonstrated the benefit of a monitoring strategy incorporating biochemical monitoring over clinical monitoring alone.

### Acute severe ulcerative colitis: from pathophysiology to clinical management [^0dabbded]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and rectum, resulting from a dysregulated immune response towards intraluminal antigens in a genetically predisposed host. The disease has a varying extent and severity. Approximately 20% of patients with ulcerative colitis experience a severe flare during the course of their disease, requiring hospitalization. Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is potentially a life-threatening condition that requires early recognition, hospitalization, correction of body fluids and electrolytes, and nutritional support if needed. Superimposed bacterial or viral infections need to be excluded and thromboprophylaxis should be started. Intravenous corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for this condition. Rescue treatment with ciclosporin or infliximab is indicated in patients who do not sufficiently respond to corticosteroids after 3–5 days, with close monitoring of the patients' symptoms, serum C-reactive protein and albumin levels. If medical therapy fails, timely colectomy should be performed to prevent critical complications.

### Common instances of low-value care in inflammatory bowel diseases [^bd5949b2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Value-based care focuses on improving the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care while controlling costs. Low-value care implies services or interventions that provide little or no benefit to patients, have the potential to cause harm, incur unnecessary cost to patients, or waste limited health care resources. In this review, we discuss common instances of low-value care along the spectrum of management in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These include low value care in: (1) diagnosis and monitoring of IBD: utilization of serological markers to screen and diagnose IBD, over-reliance on symptoms for monitoring disease, failure to employ treat-to-target strategies in symptomatic patients with IBD, and annual surveillance colonoscopies in patients at low risk of developing dysplasia; (2) treatment of IBD: use of 5-aminosalicylates in Crohn's disease, continuation of 5-aminosalicylates after escalation to immunosuppressive therapy, chronic corticosteroid use without steroid-sparing strategies, step therapy for Crohn's disease, failure to optimize tumor necrosis factor antagonists in patients with active disease and subsequently de-intensification of therapies in those who have achieved stable remission; and (3) management of hospitalized patients with IBD: routine cross-sectional imaging for patients with IBD presenting to the emergency department, withholding pharmacological prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in patients hospitalized with IBD flare, and prolonged use of high-dose intravenous corticosteroids in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis. This review is meant to bring attention to value-based care in IBD and provide guidance to treating practitioners. Future studies on systematic evaluation of high- and low-value care in patients with IBD are warranted.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^012730e8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Exclusively enteral nutrition is feasible in CD patients presenting with non-radiologically drainable abdominal abscesses. It is associated with a reduction in surgical rate, optimized preoperative condition, and improved postoperative outcomes in this specific group of patients.

Concerning the role of a medical treatment to avoid or postpone surgery, most patients with UC presenting with an ongoing flare in an emergency setting could be treated with intravenous corticosteroids.

In this group of patients, when the checked hemodynamic status is stable, the first step in the diagnostic process includes confirming disease activity with a flexible sigmoidoscopy and ruling out intestinal pathogens including Clostridium difficile and CMV. At this point, it is possible to decide on rescue therapy.

Patients with significant systemic toxicity, as evidenced by severe weight loss, fever, tachycardia, high inflammatory markers, and persisting abdominal pain, should be evaluated for colectomy. If a medical rescue therapy is considered appropriate, IV corticosteroids are administrated. A systematic review of 32 trials of steroid therapy for acute severe colitis, involving 1991 patients from 1974–2006, reported an overall response to steroids of 67% [95% CI 65–69%]. A colectomy was carried out in 29%.

In case of insufficient response to IV corticosteroids, an early (day 3) assessment should take place and subsequent therapy with either infliximab (IFX) (5 mg/kg) or ciclosporin (2 mg/kg/day) should be considered, along with the possibility of surgery. Both medical therapies are potent for inducing remission in this subgroup of patients with comparable outcomes. The open-label CYSIF trial randomized 111 thiopurine-naive patients with severe colitis despite 5 days of IV steroids, to IV ciclosporin 2 mg/kg/day for 8 days followed by 4 mg/kg/day oral therapy, or infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6. All responders at day 7 received oral azathioprine and tapered steroids from day 8. Approximately 85% patients in both groups responded to treatment by day 7. Treatment failure at day 98 (the primary endpoint) was reported in 60% patients in the ciclosporin arm compared with 54% patients in the IFX arm. The colectomy rate by day 98 in the ciclosporin vs the infliximab group was 18% vs 21% [P = 0.66].

Crohn's disease — working definitions of disease activity and prognosis — states that disease activity reflects the combination of symptoms and endoscopic findings, whereas prognosis compiles factors predictive of a benign or more complicated course; an individual may be in clinical, endoscopic, histologic, or surgical remission; although clinical trials have used the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), the CDAI is meant primarily for clinical trial use, not clinical practice; for clinical practice, disease activity is assessed by a combination of clinical symptoms plus elevated inflammatory biomarkers or active disease identified on radiologic or endoscopic assessments; clinical remission corresponds to a CDAI score < 150.

Crohn's disease — harms and treatment timing note that initial advanced therapy use likely increases exposure-related risk but must be weighed against undertreatment risks, and delays in starting advanced therapies have been associated with complications. The risk associated with immunomodulators and advanced therapies in CD has been discussed previously; initial advanced therapy use likely increases the duration of exposure to these agents, and thereby exposure-related risk; however, these risks should be balanced against the potential consequence of disease-related complications secondary to inadequate treatment of active disease. Several studies, primarily in pediatric patient populations, have demonstrated an association between delays in initiation of advanced therapies and penetrating complications.

Anti-TNF agents — recommendations for moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) are as follows: We recommend anti-TNF agents (infliximab, subcutaneous adalimumab, subcutaneous certolizumab pegol) for induction and maintenance of remission for moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). We recommend combination therapy of infliximab with immunomodulators (thiopurines) as compared with treatment with either immunomodulators alone or intravenous infliximab alone in patients with CD who are naive to those agents (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). We recommend subcutaneous methotrexate as an option for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who responded to intravenous induction with infliximab (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence).

Guidelines for clinical practice are intended to suggest preferable approaches to particular medical problems as established by interpretation and collation of scientifically valid research, derived from extensive review of published literature. When data that will withstand objective scrutiny are not available, a recommendation may be made based on a consensus of experts. Guidelines are intended to apply to the clinical situation for all physicians without regard to specialty. Guidelines are intended to be flexible, not necessarily indicating the only acceptable approach, and should be distinguished from standards of care that are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of choices in any health-care problem, the physician should select the course best suited to the individual patient and the clinical situation presented. These guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee. Expert opinion is solicited from the outset for the document. The quality of evidence upon which a specific recommendation is based is as follows: Grade A: Homogeneous evidence from multiple well-designed randomized (therapeutic) or cohort (descriptive) controlled trials, each involving a number of participants to be of sufficient statistical power. Grade B: Evidence from at least one large well-designed clinical trial with or without randomization, from cohort or case-control analytic studies, or well-designed meta-analysis. Grade C: Evidence based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees. The Committee reviews guidelines in depth, with participation from experienced clinicians and others in related fields. The final recommendations are based on the data available at the time of the production of the document and may be updated with pertinent scientific developments at a later time.

a) The role of medical treatment and management of specific IBD drugs

Statement 4.1

The optimal management of IBD patients presenting with acute abdominal pain is multidisciplinary, involving a gastroenterologist and an acute care surgeon (QoE C).

Statement 4.2

All IBD patients presenting with an acute abdomen should receive adequate volume of intravenous fluids, low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis and electrolyte abnormalities and anaemia should be corrected (QoE C).

Statement 4.3

Antibiotics should not be routinely administered, but only if superinfection is considered and in the presence of an intra-abdominal abscess (QoE B).

Statement 4.4

In case of superinfection or abscesses, prompt antimicrobial therapy against Gr/-/aerobic and facultative bacilli and Gr/+/ streptococci and obligate anaerobic bacilli is needed according to the epidemiology and resistance of the setting. Antimicrobial therapy duration depends on the patient's clinical feature and laboratory test results such as serum CRP level (QoE A).

Statement 4.5

The initial medical treatment for severe active UC is intravenous corticosteroids, in case of hemodynamic stability of the patient (QoE A).

Statement 4.6

The response to intravenous steroids should be best assessed by the third day (QoE C).

Statement 4.7

In non-responder hemodynamically stable patients, medical rescue therapy including infliximab in combination with a thiopurine or ciclosporin should be considered in a multidisciplinary approach (QoE B).

Statement 4.8

Infliximab should be considered if anti-inflammatory therapy for penetrating ileocecal Crohn's disease is required, following adequate resolution of intra-abdominal abscesses in a multidisciplinary approach (QoE C).

Statement 4.9

Preoperative treatments with immunomodulators associated with anti-TNF-α agents and steroids are risk factors for intra-abdominal sepsis in patients requiring emergency resectional surgery (QoE B).

Statement 4.10

In complex perianal fistulizing disease, infliximab or adalimumab can be used as a first-line therapy in combination with azathioprine following adequate surgical drainage if indicated. A combination of ciprofloxacin and anti-TNF improves short-term outcomes (QoE A).

b) The role of nutritional support

Statement 4.11

Preoperative nutritional support is mandatory in severely undernourished patients (QoE A).

Crohn's disease (CD) — medical management includes that mucosal healing as determined by endoscopy is a goal of therapy, and scoring systems are available to measure the endoscopic disease activity and may be used to monitor response to therapy. No maintenance treatment is a treatment option for some patients with asymptomatic (silent), mild CD; however, routine monitoring is recommended to identify disease progression. Sulfasalazine should only be considered for patients with symptomatic mild colonic CD, and antibiotics are not an effective treatment for luminal inflammatory CD and should not be used as a primary therapy. For adult patients with mild CD and low risk of progression, diet-based strategies along with careful monitoring for inadequate symptom relief, worsening inflammation, or disease progression may be considered. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate may be used in treatment of active CD and as adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity associated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.

### Tools for the diagnosis and management of Crohn's disease [^00050d23]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Numerous tools have emerged over recent decades to aid in the increasingly complex management of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) beyond endoscopy, including video capsule endoscopy, magnetic resonance enterography, computed tomography enterography, a variety of biomarkers, and even wearable biosensors and smartphone applications. These tools have allowed for a more sophisticated and less invasive complementary approach to the evaluation of disease activity and treatment response in patients with CD. This article details the characteristics, practical application, and limitations of these various modalities and discusses how updated guidelines are now incorporating many of them into a treat-to-target strategy.

Crohn's disease refractory therapy and precision medicine — nonresponse rates, alternative classes, monitoring, and strategic priorities: Despite existing treatments, approximately 20%–30% of patients experience primary nonresponse to anti-TNF therapies, and 30%–40% lose their response or become intolerant (secondary non-responders) within the first year of treatment. These secondary non-responders often require dose escalation, switching to another anti-TNF agent, or transitioning to a different therapeutic class, such as anti-integrins (vedolizumab), anti-IL-12/23 agents (ustekinumab), anti-IL-23 agents (guselkumab, mirikizumab or risankizumab), JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib), or novel mechanisms. Managing patients with refractory CD poses a considerable challenge because they often cycle through the available advanced therapies, and a therapeutic ceiling effect has been observed in some patients, limiting the efficacy of existing treatments. Routine monitoring of disease activity with biomarkers such as fecal calprotectin (FC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is recommended. Precision medicine is emerging as a solution for CD, seeking to integrate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into clinical decision-making, and key proposals to improve CD treatment strategies include the following: Disease Classification; Endpoints; and Longitudinal Assessment.
