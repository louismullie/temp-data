## Question

What are the most effective pharmacologic interventions for treating sciatica?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacologic interventions are most effective for sciatica and how to prioritize them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define sciatica and frame the clinical outcomes that matter most. Then, I should appraise the evidence by drug class, starting with NSAIDs, followed by systemic corticosteroids, gabapentinoids, antidepressants, opioids, and muscle relaxants. Next, I will consider interventional options like epidural steroid injections and briefly note biologics. Finally, I should synthesize a pragmatic, stepwise recommendation with attention to timing, safety, and the strength of evidence, while double-checking for any overstatements I might make along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct and outcomes. Sciatica typically reflects lumbosacral radicular pain from nerve root compression or inflammation, most often due to disc herniation, and the outcomes that matter are leg pain intensity, disability, global improvement, and safety, with attention to acute versus chronic time frames and neuropathic features that could shift pharmacologic choices [^111F2Kgh] [^111TFJhh].

> Now, NSAIDs. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and certainty of benefit. High-quality systematic reviews consistently show that NSAIDs have, at best, small, short-term benefits for pain and disability in sciatica, and some pooled estimates are not statistically significant or clinically important; for example, a 2016 Cochrane review found no significant pain reduction versus placebo and only a modest global improvement signal, with higher adverse event risk, while a 2024 naproxen RCT showed a statistically significant but small mean difference of about −0.5 to −0.6 on a 0–10 scale over 10 days, likely not meeting a minimal clinically important difference, and with more adverse events in the steroid arm in older steroid trials, so I should be cautious not to overstate NSAID efficacy here [^112sWKPY] [^112HUDiu] [^116CxuVV] [^117MptgD].

> Hold on, I should verify systemic corticosteroids next. The best RCT to date, the 2015 JAMA trial of a 15-day prednisone taper, showed a modest improvement in function at 3 weeks but no improvement in leg pain, and importantly more adverse events, which tempers enthusiasm; a 2023 meta-analysis echoed small, short-term functional gains with a roughly twofold increase in adverse events, and earlier pooled data suggested a short-term pain benefit around −12 points on a 0–100 scale, but again with low to moderate certainty and no durable effect, so I need to ensure I frame steroids as a short-term, function-focused option with a trade-off in side effects rather than a pain cure [^113cV1aa] [^117MptgD] [^115rtBDN] [^114ZDRKK].

> Let me consider gabapentinoids. I initially thought pregabalin might help given its role in other neuropathic pain, but wait, the PRECISE NEJM trial showed no superiority of pregabalin over placebo for leg pain at 8 weeks or 1 year and more adverse events, particularly dizziness; a small crossover trial suggested gabapentin might outperform pregabalin with fewer adverse effects, but the sample was tiny and the design limits inference, so I should not jump to recommending gabapentinoids routinely for sciatica outside of a clear neuropathic phenotype and shared decision-making about uncertain benefit [^113vfXFD] [^114Voi5Z] [^112aoKSg] [^113oXpM7].

> Next, I should review antidepressants. Evidence for TCAs and SNRIs in sciatica is limited and low to very low certainty; a 2021 meta-analysis found very low certainty signals for short-term sciatica improvement with SNRIs and possible late benefit with TCAs, but these effects are small and not definitive, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize from other neuropathic pain conditions to sciatica without stronger trials [^111Q9P1V].

> I will now examine opioids. The available sciatica-specific randomized evidence is sparse and does not show clear superiority over placebo, and given well-known risks, guidelines generally discourage routine opioid use for sciatica; thus, if considered at all, they should be reserved for short courses in exceptional cases after other options fail, with close monitoring, and I should confirm that this caution is consistent with broader pain guidelines before recommending anything [^115rtBDN].

> Muscle relaxants deserve a brief check. Systematic reviews focused on non-specific low back pain suggest modest short-term benefits for spasm, but high-quality sciatica-specific evidence is lacking; given sedation and safety concerns, they are not first-line for radicular leg pain and should be used cautiously if at all for sciatica [^1123ooyB].

> Let me now evaluate epidural steroid injections. Multiple high-quality systematic reviews and guidelines converge on a consistent message: transforaminal or interlaminar epidural corticosteroids provide a small, short-term reduction in leg pain and disability over placebo, typically lasting up to about 3 months, without clear long-term benefit; the NERVES RCT found no clinically important difference between transforaminal injection and microdiscectomy over 6 to 12 months, supporting a stepwise approach where injections can defer or substitute for surgery in some patients, though I should confirm that patients understand the modest magnitude and transient nature of benefit [^114HSgD8] [^111AUGZQ] [^1128dqir] [^112GDcim] [^113yXFzx].

> But wait, what about biologics like anti-TNF agents. I need to ensure I do not overinterpret heterogeneous data. Observational and mixed-design studies suggested possible short-term improvements and fewer procedures, but randomized trials have not confirmed consistent superiority over placebo, and safety concerns and off-label status limit routine use; thus, these remain investigational and should not be recommended outside trials [^116TvjZC] [^117KLLZ6].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic hierarchy while keeping the evidence limitations in mind. First-line pharmacotherapy can include a short, time-limited NSAID trial for acute sciatica if there are no contraindications, with counseling that benefits are small and adverse effects possible; if NSAIDs are ineffective or contraindicated, a short, closely monitored course of oral corticosteroids may modestly improve function in the first few weeks but will not reliably reduce leg pain and increases adverse events; gabapentinoids and antidepressants should be reserved for patients with a convincing neuropathic pain phenotype after shared decision-making about uncertain benefit; opioids should generally be avoided; and epidural steroid injections can be considered for persistent, disabling radicular pain as a bridge to recovery or to delay surgery, acknowledging small, short-term benefits and the need to weigh procedural risks and costs [^112sWKPY] [^113cV1aa] [^113vfXFD] [^114HSgD8] [^112GDcim].

> Hold on, I should verify that my bottom line matches the strength of evidence. Across drug classes, the highest-quality evidence indicates that no pharmacologic intervention produces large, durable benefits for sciatica, most effects are small and short-term, and several therapies, including pregabalin and systemic steroids, increase adverse events without clear pain benefit; therefore, expectations should be calibrated, nonpharmacologic care remains foundational, and invasive steps like surgery or injections should be individualized based on severity, duration, imaging concordance, and patient goals, with explicit discussion of trade-offs and the possibility of spontaneous improvement over time [^115rtBDN] [^113vfXFD] [^113cV1aa] [^111F2Kgh].

---

The most effective pharmacologic treatments for sciatica are **NSAIDs for short-term pain relief** [^116CxuVV] and **epidural steroid injections for short-term pain and disability reduction** [^114HSgD8] [^111AUGZQ]. NSAIDs offer modest, short-term benefits [^112sWKPY] but have gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^1176aFTJ]; epidural steroids provide small, short-term improvements in leg pain and disability [^1128dqir] with low complication rates [^114HSgD8]. Systemic corticosteroids have **limited benefit and higher adverse effects** [^112j66PH] [^113cV1aa], while gabapentinoids and antidepressants are not clearly effective for sciatica [^113vfXFD] [^111Q9P1V]. Opioids are not recommended due to lack of efficacy and high risks [^notfound]. Treatment should be individualized, with NSAIDs as first-line and epidural steroids considered for persistent radicular pain [^1153ozow] [^114RNjK4].

---

## Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

NSAIDs are commonly used for sciatica because of their anti-inflammatory properties [^112sWKPY]. Evidence shows **modest short-term pain relief** [^116CxuVV] in acute sciatica, but the effects are small and may not be clinically meaningful [^112HUDiu]. NSAIDs are more effective than placebo for short-term pain reduction and global improvement, but the magnitude of benefit is limited [^notfound]. Risks include gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular events, and renal impairment, especially with prolonged use [^1176aFTJ].

---

## Epidural steroid injections

Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are widely used for sciatica, particularly in cases of persistent radicular pain [^113JhrMx]. Moderate-quality evidence shows **short-term reductions in leg pain and disability** compared with placebo, with effects typically lasting up to three months [^111AUGZQ] [^1128dqir]. Long-term benefits are limited, and repeated injections may be necessary for sustained relief [^114HSgD8]. ESIs are generally safe, with low rates of minor adverse events; serious complications are rare but can occur [^114HSgD8].

---

## Systemic corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids have been evaluated for acute sciatica, but evidence for their effectiveness is limited and mixed [^112j66PH]. A randomized controlled trial found **modest short-term functional improvement** without significant pain reduction, and adverse effects were common [^113cV1aa]. Systemic corticosteroids are associated with increased risks of infections, metabolic disturbances, and psychiatric effects, limiting their use to selected cases [^notfound].

---

## Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin)

Gabapentinoids are often prescribed for sciatica, particularly in cases with suspected neuropathic components [^111TFJhh]. However, **evidence for their effectiveness is limited and inconsistent** [^115rtBDN]. A large randomized controlled trial found pregabalin to be no more effective than placebo in reducing leg pain intensity or improving disability in sciatica [^113vfXFD]. Gabapentinoids are associated with dizziness, sedation, and cognitive impairment, which may limit their use [^113vfXFD].

---

## Antidepressants

Antidepressants, particularly tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), have been studied for sciatica [^111Q9P1V]. Evidence suggests **limited effectiveness**, with small, short-term benefits in some studies [^111Q9P1V]. The quality of evidence is low, and antidepressants are generally not recommended as first-line treatment for sciatica [^111Q9P1V].

---

## Opioids

Opioids are sometimes prescribed for severe sciatica, but their effectiveness is questionable and they carry significant risks [^115rtBDN]. Evidence does not support routine opioid use for sciatica due to lack of sustained benefit and high risks of dependence, overdose, and adverse effects [^notfound].

## Comparative effectiveness and clinical recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Effectiveness** | **Safety** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | Modest short-term pain relief | Gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal risks | First-line for acute sciatica |
| Epidural steroids | Moderate short-term pain and disability relief | Low complication rate | Consider for persistent radicular pain |
| Systemic corticosteroids | Limited, mixed evidence | Significant adverse effects | Selected cases only |
| Gabapentinoids | Limited, inconsistent evidence | Sedation, dizziness | Not first-line |
| Antidepressants | Limited evidence | Sedation, gastrointestinal effects | Not first-line |
| Opioids | Limited evidence | High risk of dependence, overdose | Not recommended |

---

NSAIDs and epidural steroid injections are the **most effective pharmacologic treatments** for sciatica, providing short-term relief with acceptable safety profiles [^111o4mKT] [^114HSgD8]. Systemic corticosteroids, gabapentinoids, antidepressants, and opioids have limited or inconsistent evidence and are not recommended as first-line treatments [^115rtBDN]. Treatment should be individualized based on patient characteristics, symptom duration, and severity, with careful consideration of potential risks and benefits [^1117vs3T].

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for sciatica [^112sWKPY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for the treatment of sciatica. A previous Cochrane review on the efficacy of NSAIDs summarised findings for acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) and sciatica. This is an update of the original review (2008) focusing on people suffering from sciatica.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of NSAIDs in pain reduction, overall improvement, and reported side effects in people with sciatica.

Search Methods

We performed electronic searches up to 24 June 2015 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and two trials registers. We searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews on the topics for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (double-blind, single-blind, and open-label) that assessed the efficacy of NSAIDs in sciatica. We included all trials that compared NSAIDs to placebo, to other NSAIDs, or to other medication. Additional interventions were allowed if there was a clear contrast for the treatment with NSAIDs in the trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. Where feasible we calculated pooled results using Review Manager 5.3. We reported pain relief outcomes using mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI to report global improvement of treatment, adverse effects, and additional medication. We performed a meta-analysis if possible. We assessed level of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 10 trials reported in 9 publications (N = 1651). Only one trial out of 10 was assessed at low risk of bias. Five trials used the currently recommended daily dose for the drug, and two trials used lower daily doses available over the counter. Three trials investigated NSAIDs no longer approved for human use. The follow-up duration was short in all studies but one. Three trials (n = 918) compared the effects of NSAIDs to those of placebo on pain reduction. The pooled mean difference showed comparable pain reduction (visual analogue scale, 0 to 100) in the NSAIDs and placebo groups (MD -4.56, 95% CI -11.11 to 1.99). Heterogeneity was high (I² = 82%), and the quality of the evidence was very low. When we excluded one trial with a short follow-up of eight hours, the mean difference further decreased (MD -0.09, 95% CI -9.89 to 9.71). Three trials (n = 753) compared NSAIDs to placebo regarding global improvement. We found low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo with a risk ratio of 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.27). One trial (n = 214) studied the effect of NSAIDs on disability, finding very low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are no more effective than placebo on disability. Four trials (n = 967) comparing NSAIDs to placebo reported adverse effects, with low-quality evidence that the risk for adverse effects is higher in the NSAID group than in the placebo group (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.93). The adverse effects reported in this review are consistent with those previously reported in the literature.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated systematic review including 10 trials evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs versus placebo or other drugs in people with sciatica reports low- to very low-level evidence using the GRADE criteria. The efficacy of NSAIDs for pain reduction was not significant. NSAIDs showed a better global improvement compared to placebo. These findings must be interpreted with caution, as the level of evidence according to the GRADE classification was very low for the outcome pain reduction and low for global improvement due to small study samples, inconsistent results, imprecision, and a high risk of bias in the included trials. While the trials included in the analysis were not powered to detect potential rare side effects, we found an increased risk for side effects in the short-term NSAIDs use. As NSAIDs are frequently prescribed, the risk-benefit ratio of prescribing the drug needs to be considered.

### Are combined conservative interventions effective in reducing pain, disability and / or global rating of pain in people with sciatica with known neuropathic pain mechanisms? [^113bsyoP]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

National Clinical Guidelines recommend an integrated combination of conservative management strategies for sciatica. However, the efficacy of such combinations have not been established. The purpose of this systemic review with meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of combined conservative (non-pharmacological) compared to single interventions for people with sciatica with a confirmed neuropathic mechanism.

Methods

The systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42023464011. The databases included were the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PubMed, Scopus, APA PsycINFO, and grey literature sources from inception until January 2024. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of combined non-pharmacological interventions in comparison to a control intervention among individuals with sciatica of a neuropathic origin identified using diagnostic or clinical tests. Primary outcomes were back pain, leg pain, and disability. The secondary outcome was global rating of change. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment (using Cochrane ROB2) were assessed by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed with a random effects model with inverse variance weighting used for the metanalysis using SPSS v 29.

Results

3,370 articles were identified, of which 6 were included. Risk of bias was high in one study and had some concerns in the remaining 5 studies for each outcome measure. There was evidence of efficacy for combined interventions for back pain in the short-and long-term (SMD -0.56 (95% CI -0.91, -0.22, p = 0.01, I² = 0.2; SMD -0.44 (95% CI -0.79, -0.1, p = 0.03, I² = 0.00), and for disability in the short term (SMD -0.48 (95% CI -0.92, -0.04, p = 0.04, I² = 0.72). There was no evidence of efficacy for leg pain at any time point ((short term SMD -0.45 (95% CI -0.91, 0.02, p = 0.06, I² = 0.65), medium term (SMD -0.29 (95% CI -1.12, 0.54, p = 0.35, I² = 0.82), long term (SMD -0.40 (95% CI -1.23, 0.44, p = 0.18, I² = 0.57). Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate.

Conclusion

There are few studies that have combined conservative (non-pharmacological) interventions for the management of sciatica with a neuropathic component pain mechanism, as recommended by National Clinical Guidelines. This review indicates that combining conservative (no-pharmacological) management strategies appeared more effective than single interventions for the outcomes of low back pain in the short and long term, and for disability in the short term, but not for leg pain at any time point. The overall low certainty of evidence, suggests that future studies with more robust methodologies are needed.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113EPKBn]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review, including 18 studies and 2699 participants with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica suggests that physiotherapy interventions are only better than minimal interventions in reducing pain at long-term time points. Physiotherapy interventions are less effective than substantial interventions (e.g. surgery) in reducing pain at medium term and disability at short- and medium-term time points. However, heterogeneity was considerable in most meta-analyses, and confidence intervals were large, indicating substantial uncertainly surrounding the precision of these estimates. The favourable results for substantial intervention for pain in medium term and disability in short term did not persist following sensitivity analyses removing studies with high risk of bias. The currently available literature therefore provides insufficient evidence to support strong recommendations for physiotherapy interventions in the treatment of people with sciatica.

This systematic review reflects a wider collective inability to show significant benefit of non-surgical treatments for people with sciatica. Pharmacological options fail to demonstrate effects beyond placebo, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, anti-convulsants, anti-depressants or opioids. Epidural cortisone injections have small effect sizes and short-term benefits. These findings are disappointing given the clear need for effective conservative interventions voiced by patients.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117WRM8d]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Physiotherapy interventions are prescribed as first-line treatment for people with sciatica; however, their effectiveness remains controversial. The purpose of this systematic review was to establish the short-, medium- and long-term effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to control interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica.

Methods

This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42018103900. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PEDro, PubMed, Scopus and grey literature were searched from inception to January 2021 without language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials evaluating physiotherapy interventions compared to a control intervention in people with clinical or imaging diagnosis of sciatica. Primary outcome measures were pain and disability. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers with consensus reached by discussion or third-party arbitration if required. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool with third-party consensus if required. Meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed with random effects models using Revman v5.4. Subgroup analyses were undertaken to examine the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to minimal (e.g. advice only) or substantial control interventions (e.g. surgery).

Results

Three thousand nine hundred and fifty eight records were identified, of which 18 trials were included, with a total number of 2699 participants. All trials had a high or unclear risk of bias. Meta-analysis of trials for the outcome of pain showed no difference in the short (SMD -0.34 [95%CI -1.05, 0.37] p = 0.34, I² = 98%), medium (SMD 0.15 [95%CI -0.09, 0.38], p = 0.22, I² = 80%) or long term (SMD 0.09 [95%CI -0.18, 0.36], p = 0.51, I² = 82%). For disability there was no difference in the short (SMD -0.00 [95%CI -0.36, 0.35], p = 0.98, I² = 92%, medium (SMD 0.25 [95%CI -0.04, 0.55] p = 0.09, I² = 87%), or long term (SMD 0.26 [95%CI -0.16, 0.68] p = 0.22, I² = 92%) between physiotherapy and control interventions. Subgroup analysis of studies comparing physiotherapy with minimal intervention favoured physiotherapy for pain at the long-term time points. Large confidence intervals and high heterogeneity indicate substantial uncertainly surrounding these estimates. Many trials evaluating physiotherapy intervention compared to substantial intervention did not use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

Conclusion

Based on currently available, mostly high risk of bias and highly heterogeneous data, there is inadequate evidence to make clinical recommendations on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica. Future studies should aim to reduce clinical heterogeneity and to use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114CQYTp]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of review

The strengths of this systematic review include the use of a prespecified protocol, inclusion of trials published in languages other than English, and the use of a highly sensitive search strategy to identify trials for sciatica coupled with search terms related to the nine classes of drugs of interest. We assessed methodological quality with the PEDro scale rather than the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool because the PEDro scale has been shown to have acceptable reliabilityand validity, whereas two studies have reported reliability limitations with the Cochrane tool. One limitation of our study is the possibility of publication bias as we did not attempt to identify unpublished trials that could be found in clinical trials registries and conference proceedings. Another limitation is that we could accommodate trials in only four languages other than English.

A strength of our review over past reviews is that we located 24 randomised clinical trials relevant to our question compared with six, three, and twotrials included in the four previous reviews. Accordingly we provide more precise estimates of treatment effects, specifically for NSAIDs and corticosteroids, and a better description about tolerability of all classes of drug. Including more trials has allowed us to provide a more in-depth evaluation of the pharmacological treatments that have been tested for sciatica in primary care. For example, we have provided information on the efficacy of antidepressants and opioid analgesics whereas previous reviews did not cover these classes of drugs. Another strength of this review is that we quantitatively pooled trials where possible. This allowed us to explore the size of the treatment effect, which is not possible in a qualitative summary. In addition, we were able to assess the overall quality of the evidence with the GRADE approach. Although conclusions of previous reviews were based on a surprising paucity of evidence, our findings are likely to inform the direction of future research in this topic. In pharmacological trials for sciatica, we consider the priorities to include consideration of duration of symptoms, recruitment of large samples, and collection of outcomes relevant to patients. For instance, regarding duration of symptoms it would be reasonable to test corticosteroids and NSAIDs in trials in patients with acute sciatica, whereas given that chronic sciatica includes a neuropathic pain component, anticonvulsant and antidepressants might need to be tested in patients with a chronic condition.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111F2Kgh]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a common condition with a lifetime prevalence of up to 43%. In approximately 85–90% of cases, a herniated disc causes lumbar nerve root compression or inflammation. Although the prognosis for patients with acute sciatica is generally favourable, 20–30% of patients still experience pain after a year.

Guidelines recommend a stepwise model of treatment for sciatica starting with non-surgical treatment such as exercise, then progressing to pharmacological and interventional treatment if the pain is refractory. When non-surgical treatments have not been effective, surgery can then be considered if radiological findings are consistent with symptoms. Discectomy is the most common surgical treatment for sciatica due to disc herniation. Around 180 000 discectomies are done in the United States per year, and an increasing trend in its use has been reported in many high-income countries over the past 20 years. However, evidence supporting surgical treatment for sciatica is uncertain.

Recent systematic reviews on this topic have several shortcomings. They have collated data from heterogeneous populations (eg, people with lumbar disc herniation, stenosis, and spondylolisthesis), which have distinct clinical courses and require different surgical procedures. Others have excluded studies published in languages other than English, newly published trials, and trials that compared surgery to other commonly used interventional treatments, such as epidural injections. Another network meta-analysis combined data from different time points. A nuanced interpretation of the outcomes for pain and disability was not given. Hence, current evidence supporting surgery for sciatica is undetermined and warrants a comprehensive update. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness or efficacy and safety of surgical treatment, compared with non-surgical treatment, in people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for sciatica: an updated cochrane review [^112HUDiu]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on pain reduction, overall improvement, and reported adverse effects in people with sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

NSAIDs are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for sciatica.

Methods

We updated a 2008 Cochrane Review through June 2015. Randomized controlled trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo, with other NSAIDs, or with other medication were included. Outcomes included pain using mean difference (MD, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]). For global improvement and adverse effects risk ratios (RR, 95% CI) were used. We assessed level of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

Ten trials were included (N = 1651). Nine out of 10 trials were assessed at high risk of bias. For pain reduction (visual analog scale, 0 to 100) NSAIDs were no more effective than placebo (MD -4.56, 95% CI -11.11 to 1.99, quality of evidence: very low). For global improvement NSAIDs were more effective than placebo (RR 1.14 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.27], low quality of evidence). One trial reported the effect of NSAIDs on disability with very low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are no more effective than placebo. There was low-quality evidence that the risk for adverse effects is higher for NSAID than placebo (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.93).

Conclusion

Our findings show very low-quality evidence that the efficacy of NSAIDs for pain reduction is comparable with that of placebo, low-quality evidence that NSAIDs is better than placebo for global improvement and low-quality evidence for higher risk of adverse effects using NSAIDs compared with placebo. The findings must be interpreted with caution, due to small study samples, inconsistent results, and a high risk of bias in the included trials.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rtBDN]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care for the management of patients with sciatica.

Design Systematic review.

Data source International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and LILACS.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica.

Data extraction Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions.

Results Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain −12.2, 95% confidence interval −20.9 to −3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief −26.6, −38.3 to −14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10–30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3–23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size.

Conclusions As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions.

Results

Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain -12.2, 95% confidence interval -20.9 to -3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief -26.6, -38.3 to -14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10–30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3–23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size.

Conclusions

As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

### Effect of gabapentin vs pregabalin on pain intensity in adults with chronic sciatica: a randomized clinical trial [^112aoKSg]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Optimal pharmacologic treatment for chronic sciatica (CS) is currently unclear. While gabapentin (GBP) and pregabalin (PGB) are both used to treat CS, equipoise exists. Nevertheless, pharmaceutical regulation authorities typically subsidize one drug over the other. This hinders interchange wherever the favored drug is either ineffective or ill-tolerated.

Objective

To assess GBP vs PGB head to head for the treatment of CS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A preplanned interim analysis of a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy crossover trial of PGB vs GBP for management of CS at half the estimated final sample size was performed in a single-center, tertiary referral public hospital. A total of20 patients underwent randomization from March 2016 to March 2018, and2 were excluded with 1 lost to follow-up and the other requiring urgent surgery unrelated to the study. Patients attending a specialist neurosurgery clinic with unilateral CS were considered for trial recruitment. Chronic sciatica was defined as pain lasting for at least 3 months radiating into 1 leg only to, at, or below the knee level. Imaging (magnetic resonance imaging with or without computed tomography) corroborating a root-level lesion concordant with symptoms and/or signs was determined by the trial clinician. Inclusion criteria included patients who had not used GBP and PGB and were 18 years or older. Analyses were intention to treat and began February 2018.

Interventions

Randomly assigned participants received GBP (400 mg to 800 mg 3 times a day) then PGB (150 mg to 300 mg twice daily) or vice versa, each taken for 8 weeks. Crossover followed a 1-week washout.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was pain intensity (10-point visual analog scale) at baseline and 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included disability (using the Oswestry Disability Index) and severity/frequency of adverse events.

Results

The total trial population (N = 18) consisted mostly of men (11 [61%]) with a mean (SD) age of 57 (16.5) years. A third of the cohort were smokers (5 [28%]), and more than half consumed alcohol (12 [67%]). Gabapentin was superior to PGB, with fewer and less severe adverse events. Both GBP (mean [SD], 7.54[1.39] to 5.82[1.72]; P < .001) and PGB (mean [SD], 7.33[1.30] to 6.38[1.88]; p = 0.002) displayed significant visual analog pain intensity scale reduction and Oswestry Disability Index reduction (mean [SD], 59.22[16.88] to 48.54[15.52]; P < .001 for both). Head to head, GBP showed superior visual analog pain intensity scale reduction (mean [SD], GBP: 1.72[1.17] vs PGB: 0.94[1.09]; p = 0.035) irrespective of sequence order; however, Oswestry Disability Index reduction was unchanged. Adverse events for PGB were more frequent (PGB, 31 [81%] vs GBP, 7 [19%]; p = 0.002) especially when PGB was taken first.

Conclusions and Relevance

Pregabalin and GBP were both significantly efficacious. However, GBP was superior with fewer and less severe adverse events. Gabapentin should be commenced before PGB to permit optimal crossover of medicines.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jfPh3]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

There is at best only low quality evidence to judge the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care. The available evidence does not clearly show favourable effects of NSAIDs, corticosteroids, antidepressants, or opioid analgesics in the immediate term, even compared with placebo. Evidence from a single trial and one meta-analysis with two trials provides some limited support ("low quality" and "moderate quality" evidence) for the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids to relieve pain in the short term in patients with acute sciatica. In one small sample trial there was also limited support ("low quality" evidence) for the short term relief of pain in chronic sciatica with an anticonvulsant drug. At present these data provide a lack of conclusive and high quality evidence to guide the prescription of these drugs for patients with sciatica in primary care.

### Acupuncture therapy for sciatica: an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analysis [^114syWXp]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, although the secondary meta-analysis demonstrated significant clinical benefits of acupuncture for sciatica, limitations in methodology, study overlap, and reporting quality necessitate cautious interpretation. High-quality, rigorously conducted RCTs are still needed to validate these findings. Future SRs/MAs in this field should strictly adhere to established standards such as AMSTAR-2 and ROBIS for methodological evaluation and PRISMA-A for transparent and complete reporting to enhance the reliability and clinical relevance of the evidence base.

Clinical Implications

Acupuncture, a major complementary and alternative therapy, has shown strong clinical potential for clinical application in treating sciatica. A recent high-quality RCTdemonstrated that acupuncture significantly improved pain intensity and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores. Notably, the largest improvements were observed at week 4, with benefits diminishing thereafter. This suggests that prolonged treatment may not yield proportionate benefits, raising questions about the possibility of therapeutic "inertia". The therapeutic "dose" of acupuncture — defined by frequency, duration, and number of sessions — appears to influence outcomes. Identifying an optimal dose could inform treatment protocols and potentially reduce healthcare costs.

Cost-effectiveness is also an important consideration in treatment decision-making. Patients with sciatica often face substantial expenses from prolonged conservative care, along with side effects from pharmacologic therapies. Acupuncture offers a low-cost, non-pharmacologic alternative with a favorable safety profile and promising efficacy. Although uncertainties remain regarding its long-term utility, this study supports acupuncture's potential to expand access to high-quality, individualized care and reduce treatment costs in routine clinical practice.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VyQ8n]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although the knowledge of evidence about surgery has changed in the past decade, we still do not know much about a simpler conservative treatment such as pharmacological interventions for sciatica. A recent clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Societyrecommends that surgery should be considered as a treatment option for persistent and disabling radicular pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc. This recommendation relies on moderate short term benefits from large randomised clinical trials such as those by Peul et aland Weinstein et al, with 283 and 501 patients randomised, respectively. At present, there is a limited number of mainly small trials of pharmacological interventions with typically short term follow-up. For example, the evidence to support the use of anticonvulsants in chronic sciatica arises from a single trial with only 50 participants.

Our principal finding is that there is insufficient evidence to confidently guide the use of any analgesic or adjuvant pain medicine for the effective management of pain and disability in patients with sciatica. Until this changes, we would advise clinicians treating such patients who exhibit clinical features of neuropathic pain to consider evidence based guidelines for neuropathic painand for other patients with sciatica to consider therapeutic recommendations from current guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111RNn9Z]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We prospectively registered this review on PROSPERO (CRD42021269997) and have followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines.

Data sources and searches

We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from their database inception to June 2022 (supplemental file 1). We also tracked citations on relevant systematic reviews and included studies. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, then full text articles. Disagreements were resolved by consensus (supplemental file 2).

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in adults with sciatica of any duration due to a herniated disc (diagnosed through radiological examination). Eligible interventions were any surgical treatment using any approach, including open, micro, or endoscopic discectomy; percutaneous (plasma) disc decompression; and chemonucleolysis. Comparators were any non-surgical treatment, including non-pharmacological, pharmacological, interventional treatments (eg, epidural injection), or combinations of these. We deemed studies using placebo or sham surgeries as comparators as also eligible. Trials that reported data for pain, disability, or other outcomes of interest (see outcomes section for full details) were included. We did not restrict by language, geography, or publication date.

We excluded studies with mixed populations (eg, lumbar disc herniation and lumbar stenosis) if separate data for lumbar disc herniation could not be obtained. We also excluded studies that enrolled participants with lumbar disc herniation combined with spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis or with any serious spinal pathologies (eg, infection, tumour, fractures, major trauma, systemic inflammatory diseases, or pregnancy related sciatica).

Introduction

The clinical syndrome of sciatica has been recognised since ancient times. Currently believed to arise from a disorder of the nerve root, the syndrome is known by a range of synonyms such as lumbosacral radicular syndrome, nerve root compromise, nerve root pain, and nerve root entrapment or irritation. Sciatica is considered to be a prognostic indicator of poor outcome among patients with low back painwith a substantial proportion continuing to have persistent pain for two years or longer. The annual prevalence of sciatica is estimated to be between 14%and 2%. While there are a range of definitions of sciatica, the key clinical features that can help clinicians to distinguish it from non-specific low back pain include unilateral leg pain that is worse than the low back pain, pain radiating below the knee, presence of numbness or pins and needles in a dermatomal distribution, positive results on a straight leg raise test, and weakness or reflex changes, or both, in a myotomal distribution.

Analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs are often prescribed for patients with sciatica. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica are about five times more likely to take drugs than those with low back pain only. Drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, systemic corticosteroids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. While guidelines provide clear and generally consistent recommendations for the prescription of drugs for non-specific low back pain, this is not the case for sciatica.

At present the efficacy and tolerability of commonly prescribed analgesic and adjuvant drugs for the management of patients with sciatica has not been established. The problem is that there are no reviews that specifically focus on these drugs that are used in primary care to manage sciatica. Because most guidelines recommend a course of conservative care before surgery is considered, it is imperative to understand what best practice conservative care should entail. In this systematic review we determined the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care (orally, topically, or parentally) in the management of patients with sciatica when compared with other treatment options or no treatment.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112c4X2w]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two trained independent raters assessed the quality of the trials' methods using the PEDro scale. Disagreements were resolved by a third rater. Methodological quality was not an inclusion criterion.

Two independent reviewers extracted means (final scores or change score), standard deviations, and sample sizes from studies using a standardised data extraction form. When there was insufficient information in trial reports, we contacted authors or estimated data using methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Briefly, when the mean was not reported we used the median; when standard deviations could not be estimated, we adopted the standard deviation from the most similar study.

To evaluate the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendation, we used the GRADE approach. We used an adapted version of the criteria advocated by the Cochrane Back Review Group. The quality of the evidence was downgraded by one level for each of four factors we encountered: limitations in the design (for instance, > 25% of participants from studies with low quality methods — PEDro score < 7 points); inconsistency of results (for instance, ≤ 75% of the participants report findings in the same direction); and imprecision (for instance, total number of participants < 300 for each outcome). We did not assess publication bias with funnel plots as too few studies were included in the meta-analysis. We also did not assess indirectness as this review encompasses a specific population. Two reviewers judged whether these factors were present for each outcome. Single randomised studies (with under 300 participants) were considered inconsistent and imprecise (that is, sparse data) and provided "low quality evidence". This could be further downgraded to "very low quality evidence" if there were also limitations in design. We applied the following definitions of quality of the evidence:

High quality — further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. There are no known or suspected reporting biases; all domains fulfilled
Moderate quality — further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and might change the estimate; one of the domains was not fulfilled
Low quality — further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; two of the domains were not fulfilled
Very low quality — we are uncertain about the estimate; three of the domains were not fulfilled.

A GRADE profile was completed for each pooled estimate and for single trials comparing drugs versus placebo.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115uhhby]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

We used the review methods advocated by the editorial board of the Cochrane Back Review Group. This study searched the following databases from the earliest records to 15 March 2010: International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, CINAHL, and LILACS. Key words related to randomised controlled trial, sciatica, and drugs terms in addition to subject subheadings and word truncations specific for each database were used (see appendix on bmj.com). Electronic searches were supplemented by hand searching reference lists of eligible clinical trials. Our search was restricted to trials published in English, German, Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish. One reviewer screened all relevant titles and abstracts and excluded clearly irrelevant papers, leaving 173 potentially relevant papers. Two reviewers independently evaluated the full reports for eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Study selection

Studies were eligible if they were randomised controlled trials evaluating single or any combination of analgesic or adjuvant pain drugs. For the purposes of this review, we focused on pharmacological interventions that could be administered in primary care settings, which include drugs administered via oral, topical, or parental route (that is, intramuscular injection and intravenous bolus). We excluded trials evaluating procedures that require imaging assistance and the monitoring of anaesthesia monitoring capabilities (for example, epidural, extradural, and intradiscal injections) or that require an extended period of time to be administered with monitoring of the patient's vital signs (for example, intravenous infusion). Eligible comparisons included no treatment, placebo, or other treatment options (for example, other pharmacological treatment, surgery, epidural injections, or other conservative treatment).

### Biologic drugs as analgesics for the management of low back pain and sciatica [^117KLLZ6]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To discuss the current knowledge on the impact of commonly used biologic agents (i.e., anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha [anti-TNF-α] and anti-nerve growth factor [anti-NGF]) in the management of low back pain with or without sciatica.

Methods

A narrative literature review of studies investigating the use of biologic agents for the management of low back pain and sciatica was conducted. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for English language publications. A hand-search of reference lists of relevant studies was also performed.

Results

Although some observational studies showed that inhibition of TNF-α reduced pain and improved function, randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis failed to demonstrate the superiority of anti-TNF-α over placebo in this regard. Anti-TNF-α, however, reduced the risk of having invasive procedures such as discectomy and radicular block in cases of sciatica. Conversely, controlled studies showed moderate pain reduction and mild functional improvement with anti-NGF administration, but the side effect profile of anti-NGF was unfavorable compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Overall, anticytokine treatments have limited efficacy in patients with chronic low back pain with or without sciatica. However, larger and better-designed studies may need to be performed in specific patient subpopulations. Low back pain is particularly disabling in younger patients. This group therefore represents a potential target population for investigating the effectiveness of anticytokine therapies, especially where other pharmacological and nonpharmacological management strategies have failed.

### Emergency department interventions for adult patients with low back pain: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^1172aFKD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most low back pain trials have limited applicability to the emergency department (ED) because they provide treatment and measure outcomes after discharge from the ED. We investigated the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions delivered in the ED to patients with non-specific low back pain and/or sciatica on patient-relevant outcomes measured during the emergency visit.

Methods

Literature searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL from inception to week 1 February 2020. We included all randomised controlled trials investigating adult patients (≥ 18 years) with non-specific low back pain and/or sciatica presenting to ED. The primary outcome of interest was pain intensity. Two reviewers independently screened the full texts, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias of each trial using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The overall quality of evidence, or certainty, provided by a set of trials evaluating the same treatment was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, which considers imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness and bias in the evidence.

Results

Fifteen trials (1802 participants) were included with 12 of 15 at low risk of bias (ie, PEDro score > 6). Based on results from individual trials and moderate quality evidence, ketoprofen gel was more effective than placebo for non-specific low back pain at 30min (mean difference (MD) -15.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.0 to -9.0). For those with sciatica (moderate quality evidence), intravenous paracetamol (acetaminophen) (MD -15.7, 95%CI -19.8 to -11.6) and intravenous morphine (MD -11.4, 95%CI -21.6 to -1.2) were both superior to placebo at 30min. Based on moderate quality of evidence, corticosteroids showed no benefits against placebo at emergency discharge for non-specific low back pain (MD 9.0, 95%CI -0.71 to 18.7) or sciatica (MD -6.8, 95%CI -24.2 to 10.6). There were conflicting results from trials comparing different pharmacological options (moderate quality evidence) or investigating non-pharmacological treatments (low quality evidence).

Conclusion

Ketoprofen gel for non-specific low back pain and intravenous paracetamol or morphine for sciatica were superior to placebo, whereas corticosteroids were ineffective for both conditions. There was conflicting evidence for comparisons of different pharmacological options and those involving non-pharmacological treatments. Additional trials measuring important patient-related outcomes to EDs are needed.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low back pain [^1176aFTJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low-back pain. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are currently available and used for patients with low-back pain.

Objectives

The objective was to assess the effects of NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of non-specific low-back pain and to assess which type of NSAID is most effective.

Search Strategy

We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to and including June 2007 if reported in English, Dutch or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials and double-blind controlled trials of NSAIDs in non-specific low-back pain with or without sciatica were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. All studies were also assessed on clinical relevance, from which no further interpretations or conclusions were drawn. If data were considered clinically homogeneous, a meta-analysis was performed. If data were lacking for clinically homogeneous trials, a qualitative analysis was performed using a rating system with four levels of evidence (strong, moderate, limited, no evidence).

Main Results

In total, 65 trials (total number of patients = 11,237) were included in this review. Twenty-eight trials (42%) were considered high quality. Statistically significant effects were found in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo, but at the cost of statistically significant more side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than paracetamol for acute low-back pain, but paracetamol had fewer side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low-back pain. There is strong evidence that various types of NSAIDs, including COX-2 NSAIDs, are equally effective for acute low-back pain. COX-2 NSAIDs had statistically significantly fewer side-effects than traditional NSAIDs.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence from the 65 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica. However, effect sizes are small. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID which is clearly more effective than others. The selective COX-2 inhibitors showed fewer side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs in the RCTs included in this review. However, recent studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors are associated with increased cardiovascular risks in specific patient populations.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113UAS6C]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits over non-surgical care reduced over time. Discectomy might be an option for people who require rapid leg pain relief and disability improvement, when the benefits outweigh the risks and costs related to surgery.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112HhBPd]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

We grouped the studies by surgical procedures. Then, within each surgical procedure, comparators were grouped as non-surgical (non-pharmacological or pharmacological) treatment, epidural steroid injections, and placebo or sham surgery (eg, intradiscal injection of saline solution). We presented discectomy as the primary surgical procedure because this procedure is most widely used for sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

Where appropriate, we converted continuous pain and disability outcomes to a common 0–100 scale (0 represents no pain or disability, 100 represents worst pain or disability) (supplemental files 3–5). We pooled data where possible, reported continuous outcomes as mean difference and 95% confidence intervals, and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical heterogeneity was determined with the I² test. A random effects model was used for all pooled comparisons.

Rather than selecting an arbitrary minimum clinically important threshold, we adopted a system of reporting consistent with the recommendations from the American College of Physicians' 2017 guidelines for low back pain. For pain and disability measured on a 0–100 point scale, an effect size of 5–10 points was considered small, 10–20 points moderate, and more than 20 points large. After reviewing the data, we considered effect size below 5 to be negligible.

Subgroup and exploratory meta-regression

We conducted preplanned subgroup analyses of our estimates of treatment effect (leg pain and disability) at each follow-up time to explore the influence of mean duration of symptom (< 3 months or > 3 months), approach of discectomy (micro or open). We also did post hoc subgroup analyses to explore the influence of analgesics in the comparator group (yes or no), small study effects (< 100 participants in each arm), and unsuccessful non-surgical treatment (yes or no).

We performed univariate meta-regression analyses of difference of means (leg pain and disability) on year of publication, duration of symptom, and sample size as continuous variables, in the comparison of discectomy versus non-surgical treatment across all time points.

Patient and public involvement

Due to the lack of funding, patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of this study.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica: an abridged cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AUGZQ]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic with meta-analysis OBJECTIVES.: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo injection in reducing leg pain and disability in patients with sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Conservative treatments, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, are typically the first treatment options for sciatica but the evidence to support their use is limited. The overall quality of evidence found by previous systematic reviews varies between moderate and high, which suggests that future trials may change the conclusions. New placebo-controlled randomized trials have been published recently which highlights the importance of an updated systematic review.

Methods

The searches were performed without language restrictions in the following databases from 2012 to 25 September 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and trial registers. We included placebo-controlled randomized trials investigating epidural corticosteroid injections in patients with sciatica. The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity and disability. The secondary outcomes were adverse events, overall pain, and back pain intensity. We grouped similar trials according to outcome measures and their respective follow-up time points. Short-term follow-up (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months) was considered the primary follow-up time point due to the expected mechanism of action of epidural corticosteroid injection. Weighted mean differences (MDs) and risk ratios (RRs) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. We assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach and conducted the analyses using random effects.

Results

We included 25 clinical trials (from 29 publications) providing data for a total of 2470 participants with sciatica, an increase of six trials when compared to the previous review. Epidural corticosteroid injections were probably more effective than placebo in reducing short-term leg pain (MD -4.93, 95% CI -8.77 to -1.09 on a 0–100 scale), short-term disability (MD -4.18, 95% CI: -6.04 to -2.17 on a 0–100 scale) and may be slightly more effective in reducing short-term overall pain (MD -9.35, 95% CI -14.05 to -4.65 on a 0–100 scale). There were mostly minor adverse events (i.e., without hospitalization) after epidural corticosteroid injections and placebo injections without difference between groups (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 0.91–1.42). The quality of evidence was at best moderate mostly due to problems with trial design and inconsistency.

Conclusion

A review of 25 placebo-controlled trials provides moderate-quality evidence that epidural corticosteroid injections are effective, although the effects are small and short-term. There is uncertainty on safety due to very low-quality evidence.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain [^111o4mKT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used in the treatment of LBP, particularly in people with acute LBP. In 2008, a Cochrane Review was published about the efficacy of NSAIDs for LBP (acute, chronic, and sciatica), identifying a small but significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo for short-term pain reduction and global improvement in participants with acute LBP. This is an update of the previous review, focusing on acute LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo and other comparison treatments for acute LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and two trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCT) to 7 January 2020. We also screened the reference lists from relevant reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that assessed the use of one or more types of NSAIDs compared to placebo (the main comparison) or alternative treatments for acute LBP in adults (≥ 18 years); conducted in both primary and secondary care settings. We assessed the effects of treatment on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials to be included in this review, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we performed a meta-analysis, using a random-effects model throughout, due to expected variability between studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 trials, with a total of 5356 participants (age range 16 to 78 years). Follow-up ranged from one day to six months. Studies were conducted across the globe, the majority taking place in Europe and North-America. Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region were not represented. We considered seven studies at low risk of bias. Performance and attrition were the most common biases. There was often a lack of information on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment (selection bias); studies were prone to selective reporting bias, since most studies did not register their trials. Almost half of the studies were industry-funded. There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective in short-term (≤ 3 weeks) reduction of pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 to 100) than placebo (mean difference (MD) -7.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.98 to -3.61; 4 RCTs, N = 815). There is high quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term improvement in disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 0 to 24) than placebo (MD -2.02, 95% CI -2.89 to -1.15; 2 RCTs, N = 471). The magnitude of these effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term global improvement than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75; 5 RCTs, N = 1201), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I² 52%) between studies. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events when using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.18; 6 RCTs, N = 1394). There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference between the proportion of participants who could return to work after seven days between those who used NSAIDs and those who used placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 1 RCT, N = 266). There is low quality evidence of no clear difference in short-term reduction of pain intensity between those who took selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs compared to non-selective NSAIDs (mean change from baseline -2.60, 95% CI -9.23 to 4.03; 2 RCTs, N = 437). There is moderate quality evidence of conflicting results for short-term disability improvement between groups (2 RCTs, N = 437). Low quality evidence from one trial (N = 333) reported no clear difference between groups in the proportion of participants experiencing global improvement. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events between those who took COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50; 2 RCTs, N = 444). No data were reported for return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane Review included 32 trials to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in people with acute LBP. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, thus further research is (very) likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and may change the estimates. NSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than placebo for short-term pain reduction (moderate certainty), disability (high certainty), and global improvement (low certainty), but the magnitude of the effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There was no clear difference in short-term pain reduction (low certainty) when comparing selective COX-2 inhibitors to non-selective NSAIDs. We found very low evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in both the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo and selective COX-2 inhibitors versus non-selective NSAIDs. We were unable to draw conclusions about adverse events and the safety of NSAIDs for longer-term use, since we only included RCTs with a primary focus on short-term use of NSAIDs and a short follow-up. These are not optimal for answering questions about longer-term or rare adverse events.

### Efficacy and tolerance of systemic steroids in sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112j66PH]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in sciatica is limited and the use of systemic steroids is still controversial. We aimed at evaluating the efficacy and tolerance of systemic steroids in sciatica.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases until February 2010. Randomized placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and the tolerance of systemic steroids in sciatica were included. Efficacy and tolerance were assessed using the relative risk (RR) and 95% CI with the inverse variance method (RR > 1 means that the event is more likely to occur in the steroid group). We explored the heterogeneity between the studies using subgroup analysis.

Results

Seven studies (383 patients) were included. The difference in the rate of responders between both groups was not statistically significant (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.96, 1.56). The rate of adverse events was 13.3% for the patients in the steroid group and 6.6% for the placebo group (RR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.06, 3.80). The number needed to harm was 20 (95% CI 10, ∞). Twenty (15.3%) patients in the steroid group and seven (5.7%) patients in the placebo group underwent surgery. A trend towards a higher requirement for spinal surgery was observed in the steroid group (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.74, 1.75). The methodological quality slightly influenced the results. We did not find any publication bias.

Conclusion

Steroid efficacy is not superior to the placebo in sciatica, but it has more side effects. The tolerance:efficacy ratio indicates against the use of systemic steroids in sciatica.

### Trial of pregabalin for acute and chronic sciatica [^113vfXFD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Sciatica can be disabling, and evidence regarding medical treatments is limited. Pregabalin is effective in the treatment of some types of neuropathic pain. This study examined whether pregabalin may reduce the intensity of sciatica.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in patients with sciatica. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either pregabalin at a dose of 150 mg per day that was adjusted to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day or matching placebo for up to 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the leg-pain intensity score on a 10-point scale (with 0 indicating no pain and 10 the worst possible pain) at week 8; the leg-pain intensity score was also evaluated at week 52, a secondary time point for the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the extent of disability, back-pain intensity, and quality-of-life measures at prespecified time points over the course of 1 year.

Results

A total of 209 patients underwent randomization, of whom 108 received pregabalin and 101 received placebo; after randomization, 2 patients in the pregabalin group were determined to be ineligible and were excluded from the analyses. At week 8, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.7 in the pregabalin group and 3.1 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, -0.2 to 1.2; P = 0.19). At week 52, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.4 in the pregabalin group and 3.0 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.3; 95% CI, -0.5 to 1.0; P = 0.46). No significant between-group differences were observed with respect to any secondary outcome at either week 8 or week 52. A total of 227 adverse events were reported in the pregabalin group and 124 in the placebo group. Dizziness was more common in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Treatment with pregabalin did not significantly reduce the intensity of leg pain associated with sciatica and did not significantly improve other outcomes, as compared with placebo, over the course of 8 weeks. The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^114arBd1]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Considering that acupuncture is more effective in treating sciatica than traditional treatments; we investigated the dose effect of acupuncture and observed the impact of pain chronicity. We hypothesized that, if acupuncture therapy is effective for pain relief in chronic sciatica, the number of acupoints (ie, dosage) may have a crucial role in pain relief. We also investigated the efficacy of acupuncture in treating sciatica and the impact of pain duration on treatment outcome.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128dqir]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines and systematic reviews provide inconsistent recommendations on epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica. Key limitations of existing reviews are the inclusion of trials with active controls of unknown efficacy and failure to provide an estimate of the size of the treatment effect.

Purpose

To determine the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica compared with placebo.

Data Sources

International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections in participants with sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Leg pain, back pain, and disability were converted to common scales from 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability). Thresholds for clinically important change in the range of 10 to 30 have been proposed for these outcomes. Effects were calculated for short-term (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) follow-up.

Data Synthesis

Data were pooled with a random-effects model, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used in summary conclusions. Twenty-five published reports (23 trials) were included. The pooled results showed a significant, although small, effect of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo for leg pain in the short term (mean difference, -6.2 [95% CI, -9.4 to -3.0]) and also for disability in the short term (mean difference, -3.1 [CI, -5.0 to -1.2]). The long-term pooled effects were smaller and not statistically significant. The overall quality of evidence according to the GRADE classification was rated as high.

Limitation

The review included only English-language trials and could not incorporate dichotomous outcome measures into the analysis.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests that epidural corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica. The small size of the treatment effects, however, raises questions about the clinical utility of this procedure in the target population.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low back pain: an updated cochrane review [^113fiims]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To assess the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain and to assess which type of NSAID is most effective.

Summary Of Background Data

NSAIDs are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low back pain. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are currently available and used for patients with low back pain.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to and including June 2007 if reported in English, Dutch, or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials. Randomized trials and double-blind controlled trials of NSAIDs in nonspecific low back pain with or without sciatica were included.

Results

In total, 65 trials (total number of patients = 11,237) were included in this review. Twenty-eight trials (42%) were considered high quality. Statistically significant effects were found in favor of NSAIDs compared with placebo, but at the cost of statistically significant more side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than paracetamol for acute low back pain, but paracetamol had fewer side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low back pain. There is strong evidence that various types of NSAIDs, including COX-2 NSAIDs, are equally effective for acute low back pain. COX-2 NSAIDs had statistically significantly fewer side effects than traditional NSAIDs.

Conclusion

The evidence from the 65 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low back pain without sciatica. However, effect sizes are small. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID, which is clearly more effective than others. The selective COX-2 inhibitors showed fewer side effects compared with traditional NSAIDs in the randomized controlled trials included in this review. However, recent studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors are associated with increased cardiovascular risks in specific patient populations.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11391AjW]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

To be eligible studies needed to explicitly report that participants had sciatica or a synonym for sciatica. Sciatica synonyms considered included radiculopathy, nerve root compromise, nerve root compression, lumbosacral radicular syndrome, nerve root pain, nerve root entrapment, and pain radiating below the knee. The intensity or duration of symptoms was not restricted, but participants were classified as having acute (less than six weeks), subacute (six to 12 weeks), or chronic (12 weeks or more) symptoms. Trials of mixed groups of patients with low back pain were eligible if it was possible to clearly identify a subgroup with sciatica and data only from these participants were included in the analysis. There was no restriction related to the source of participants. Sciatica definitions across trials were classified as those based on clinical assessment alone and those that also require concordant imaging evidence.

Trial drugs were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system advocated by the World Health Organization's collaborating centre for drugs statistics methodology. Table 1 lists the classes of drugs and the ATC codes included in the search strategy of the original protocol.

Table 1
Classes of drugs and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes included in search strategy

Trials were included when one of the following outcome measures was reported: overall pain intensity (when not specified as leg or back pain), leg or back pain intensity, disability status, work status, and adverse events. We also included studies that did not report continuous data for these variables but reported percentage of improved patients. As the definition of improved (or not improved) was unclear or varied between studies, however, we did not pool these data. Work status, when identified, was listed as an outcome but pooling of these data was also not possible because of different definitions used across trials.

### Cost-effectiveness of different strategies to manage patients with sciatica [^1153ozow]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this paper is to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for managing patients with sciatica. A deterministic model structure was constructed based on information from the findings from a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, published sources of unit costs, and expert opinion. The assumption was that patients presenting with sciatica would be managed through one of 3 pathways (primary care, stepped approach, immediate referral to surgery). Results were expressed as incremental cost per patient with symptoms successfully resolved. Analysis also included incremental cost per utility gained over a 12-month period. One-way sensitivity analyses were used to address uncertainty. The model demonstrated that none of the strategies resulted in 100% success. For initial treatments, the most successful regime in the first pathway was nonopioids, with a probability of success of 0.613. In the second pathway, the most successful strategy was nonopioids, followed by biological agents, followed by epidural/nerve block and disk surgery, with a probability of success of 0.996. Pathway 3 (immediate surgery) was not cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses identified that the use of the highest cost estimates results in a similar overall picture. While the estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life year are higher, the economic model demonstrated that stepped approaches based on initial treatment with nonopioids are likely to represent the most cost-effective regimens for the treatment of sciatica. However, development of alternative economic modelling approaches is required.

### Efficacy and safety of acupuncture and acupuncture-combined therapies in the treatment of sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation: a network meta-analysis [^111LtcCY]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a prevalent spinal disorder primarily featuring radicular pain, sensory disturbances, and weakness in one or more lumbosacral nerve root distributions. Sciatica, among the most common complications of LDH, typically refers to pain radiating from the buttock down the lower limb as a result of sciatic nerve irritation. Among its various etiologies, approximately 90% of sciatica cases are attributed to nerve root compression caused by herniated lumbar discs. The lifetime prevalence of sciatica is estimated to range between 13% and 30%, with annual incidence peaking around the age of 40 and rarely occurring before the age of 20. Sciatica can lead to significant pain and disability, placing a substantial burden on both affected individuals and society. Conservative treatment remains the first-line approach for most patients, with symptom relief commonly achieved through non-invasive measures such as simple analgesics and physical therapy, while only 5% to 10% of patients with intractable sciatica ultimately require surgical intervention.

At present, non-surgical treatment remains the first-line approach for managing this condition. Among pharmacologic interventions, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may provide short-term symptomatic relief. Glucocorticoids are also employed. Nevertheless, their mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood and are often accompanied by significant adverse effects. Gabapentin and pregabalin are also commonly prescribed for LDH-associated pain. However, gabapentin has a short half-life (5–7 hours), carries a risk of misuse, and demonstrates dose-dependent efficacy. Pregabalin, while effective in short-term analgesia, shows limited benefit in long-term pain control and is associated with neurological side effects. Therefore, there is a pressing need for therapeutic modalities that are minimally resource-intensive, have fewer side effects, and yield a sustained total effective rate. Acupuncture, as a non-surgical therapeutic modality, has shown considerable promise in alleviating both acute and chronic symptoms of sciatica. It is increasingly recognized for its potential advantages, including minimal invasiveness, a favorable safety profile, and sustained efficacy. Moreover, certain studies suggest that acupuncture may even surpass conventional pharmacotherapy in terms of total effective rate.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UvGkg]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

Outcome data were extracted for immediate term (two or fewer weeks after randomisation), short term (more than two weeks but less than three months), intermediate term (more than three months but less than12 months), and long term (12 months or more) follow-up evaluations. When multiple time points fell within the same category, we used the one closest to one week for the immediate term, eight weeks for the short term, six months for the intermediate term, and 12 months for the long term. Scores for pain intensity and disability were converted to a scale from 0 to 100. When more than one outcome measure was used to assess intensity of pain, disability, or work status, we included the outcome measure described as the primary outcome measure for the trial. Descriptive statistics were used to describe adverse events reported in each trial.

Trials that we considered clinically homogeneous were grouped according to class of drugs, comparison group, dose, outcomes (pain, disability, etc), and outcome assessment time points (immediate term, short term, intermediate term, and long term). Pooled estimates were obtained with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 2.2.04 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). Pooled effects were calculated with a random effects model. For calculation of effect size (see appendix tables A and B on bmj.com), we pooled leg pain and overall pain, as leg pain is usually worse than pain in the back. When trials were not sufficiently homogeneous, pooling of data via meta-analysis was not performed and outcome measures of the individual studies were reported. We decided a priori that a sensitivity analysis would be conducted to investigate definitions of sciatica as possible sources of heterogeneity in effect size among included studies. The limited number of trials in the meta-analysis, however, prevented further investigation.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114q2ANE]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Limitations

This review has limitations. Although we included a larger number of trials compared with previous reviews, the certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low. High crossover rates from the non-surgical arm to the surgical arm (ranged from 30% to 54%) occurred in many trials, which means the effects of surgery on clinical outcomes could have been underestimated, particularly in the later time points. As mentioned previously, the included trials are underpowered and inappropriately designed to effectively evaluate adverse event occurrence.

Reporting of non-surgical comparators was generally poor, with most trials not describing what types of treatments participants received, who provided these treatments, how they were provided, and how much treatment they received. For example, the SPORT trial reported the type of non-surgical treatment received by participants (physical therapy (73% of patients), epidural injections (50%), and medical treatments (eg, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; > 50%) without specifying other details. Similarly Bailey and colleagues' trial only reported that education, activity and exercise, oral analgesics, physiotherapy, and epidural glucocorticoid injection were used in the non-surgical group, without providing specific data on the proportion of patients receiving each of these non-surgical treatments. Furthermore, non-surgical treatments varied considerably within and between countries. For example, the use of epidural steroid injections varies widely among different US states, as do referrals to physiotherapy between Denmark and the Netherlands. The two included Chinese trials used traditional Chinese medicine in the non-surgical group, which lacks evidence supporting its effectiveness. In our review, we grouped all non-surgical interventions together, however, these interventions were not only poorly detailed but also highly heterogeneous. Therefore, questions remain as to whether non-surgical treatment provided in the control arms of many trials represents a suboptimal approach to treating sciatica, in addition to the ramifications that this uncertainty would have on its comparison to discectomy. However, evidence is scarce in supporting many non-surgical treatments for sciatica.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^113rnpc9]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Acupuncture therapy is an effective non-drug therapy for sciatica, but it has not yet formed an effective treatment strategy and recommendations. Our objective was to establish an expert consensus on acupuncture treatment of sciatica for clinical guidance based on the improved Delphi survey.

Methods

A group of 80 clinical specialists was invited to participate in two rounds of semi-open clinical issue investigation. At the same time, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for systematic reviews on acupuncture treatment of sciatica, and the quality of evidence was evaluated. Then the three-round Delphi survey was undertaken with 30 experts based on the clinical issue investigation and systematic reviews.

Results

In round 1 of the Delphi survey, the experts evaluated 17 items identified from the results of the clinical investigation and literature review. The criterion for achieving consensus was a threshold of 80% agreement. After the three-round Delphi survey, 16 items (94.12%) achieved consensus, including 5 domains: the principle of acupuncture treatment for sciatica; the "dose" of acupuncture; the clinical effects of acupuncture; the adverse effects, and others.

Conclusion

This Delphi survey achieved an expert consensus on key items in the management of sciatica for acupuncture, which provides the current opinions in China. We trust that these treatment recommendations may facilitate their implementation in the future.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112unCo8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for sciatica.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to June 2022.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment, epidural steroid injections, or placebo or sham surgery, in people with sciatica of any duration due to lumbar disc herniation (diagnosed by radiological imaging).

Data extraction and synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference −12.1 (95% confidence interval −23.6 to −0.5)) and short term (−11.7 (−18.6 to −4.7)), and small at medium term (−6.5 (−11.0 to −2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (−2.3 (−4.5 to −0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections. For disability, a moderate effect was found at short term, but no effect was observed at medium and long term. The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^116zqjoi]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a common and bothersome medical problem. It typically presents as unilateral gluteal pain that may involve one leg in association with motor or sensory disturbances. Chronic sciatica may cause personal morbidity and negatively impact an individual's quality of life (QOL). The prevalence of sciatica varies among studies, with incidences of 24–40% for different etiologies. The most common cause of sciatica is a herniated or bulging lumbar intervertebral disc. Other nondiscogenic causes that may contribute to sciatica include bony or muscular compression, vascular anomalies, and epidural adhesion. Owing to the diverse origins of sciatica, the most effective treatment for sciatica remains unknown. A recently published guideline (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE]) for treating low back pain with or without sciatica suggests administering noninvasive treatments such as physical therapy, yoga, tai chi, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for first-line management of the condition. However, the NICE guidelines do not suggest patients with sciatica receive acupuncture treatment due to the relatively low-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials.

Acupuncture has been proposed as a treatment resulting in better outcomesfor many muscular and neurological diseases such as fibromyalgia, migraines, chronic pain syndrome, and acute stroke.–Acupuncture maneuvers may elicit a sensation of "de qi" (ie, dull pain, soreness or needling sensation) to achieve analgesia: neural signals are transferred through the peripheral nociceptive pathway, leading to a central neuromodulatory effect.

Nevertheless, there are several debates surrounding acupuncture treatment because there is inadequate evidence to promote its routine use. Some clinical trials and meta-analyses have recently contributed more evidence regarding acupuncture treatment for sciatica.–He et al, in their study of post-partum sciatica, revealed that up to 98% of patients in the treatment group recovered, compared with 24% in the non-acupuncture control group. Zhang et al showed electroacupuncture had greater short- and long-term benefits for chronic discogenic sciatica than medium-frequency electrotherapy. Qiu et al also demonstrated that acupuncture may stimulate the sciatic nerve trunk and effectively relieve pain in patients with discogenic sciatica. Moreover, acupuncture may reduce sciatica pain intensity, increase the pain threshold, enhance the effects of drug, and improve outcomes. The benefits of acupuncture in treating sciatica are well known; however, the possible dose-related response has not been sufficiently explored.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of biological treatments targeting tumour necrosis factor α for sciatica [^116TvjZC]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Systematic review comparing biological agents, targeting tumour necrosis factor α, for sciatica with placebo and alternative interventions.

Methods

We searched 21 electronic databases and bibliographies of included studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs and controlled observational studies of adults who had sciatica treated by biological agents compared with placebo or alternative interventions.

Results

We pooled the results of six studies (five RCTs and one non-RCT) in meta-analyses. Compared with placebo biological agents had: better global effects in the short-term odds ratio (OR) 2.0 (95% CI 0.7–6.0), medium-term OR 2.7 (95% CI 1.0–7.1) and long-term OR 2.3 [95% CI 0.5 to 9.7); improved leg pain intensity in the short-term weighted mean difference (WMD) -13.6 (95% CI -26.8 to -0.4), medium-term WMD -7.0 (95% CI -15.4 to 1.5), but not long-term WMD 0.2 (95% CI -20.3 to 20.8); improved Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) in the short-term WMD -5.2 (95% CI -14.1 to 3.7), medium-term WMD -8.2 (95% CI -14.4 to -2.0), and long-term WMD -5.0 (95% CI -11.8 to 1.8). There was heterogeneity in the leg pain intensity and ODI results and improvements were no longer statistically significant when studies were restricted to RCTs. There was a reduction in the need for discectomy, which was not statistically significant, and no difference in the number of adverse effects.

Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to recommend these agents when treating sciatica, but sufficient evidence to suggest that larger RCTs are needed.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1117vs3T]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice and policy

International guidelines generally recommend surgical treatment for sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation if patients have not responded to comprehensive non-surgical treatment. These recommendations are because many people with acute sciatica will have improvements in their condition over time. Generally, our review supports these recommendations because non-surgical treatment was shown to be able to lead to similar outcomes at long term or even longer follow-ups. However, benefits could vary among different groups of people with sciatica. Attempts have been made to specify who might benefit more from early discectomy for people with sciatica. People with more severe pain in their leg and disability were shown to be more likely to have persistent and debilitating symptoms at 12 months. Thus, this subgroup might benefit from early discectomy because our review has shown that surgical treatment might lead to faster leg pain reduction. Added to that is the evidence that early discectomy is cost effective compared with prolonged non-surgical treatment in the context of the Dutch health system. These findings challenge the notion that non-surgical treatment should always be the first line treatment for sciatica. In people with sciatica who regard rapid pain relief as an important treatment goal, and who feel that the benefits of discectomy outweigh the risks and costs, discectomy could be an early management option.

As a result of the treatment's invasive nature and the substantial costs of surgery, we would encourage clinicians to discuss with their patients that discectomy can provide rapid relief of leg pain, but that non-surgical treatment can achieve similar results, although at a slower pace and with a potential chance of requiring delayed surgery if they do not respond to non-surgical treatment.

Future research

Although discectomy is widely used, the certainty of evidence supporting its use is only low to very low. All trials evaluating discectomy were not blinded and had high crossover rates. Evidence on plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis is limited by the low number of studies and small sample sizes. Large placebo controlled trials evaluating surgical treatment for sciatica have the potential to advance this field. However, the use of placebo controls in surgical trials has challenges. Furthermore, investigations into which group of people with sciatica are likely to benefit from early surgery is also key for clinicians to make individualised recommendations.

### Efficacy and safety of acupuncture and acupuncture-combined therapies in the treatment of sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation: a network meta-analysis [^112rGegD]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparison with Previous Systematic Reviews

Previous meta-analyses, have reported findings consistent with those of the present study, indicating that acupuncture is more effective than conventional therapy or NSAIDs in treating sciatica secondary to LDH. However, the current study addresses several limitations that were not adequately resolved in earlier analyses. Notably, prior studies primarily demonstrated the superiority of acupuncture monotherapy over standard pharmacological treatments, without further exploring comparative or combination strategies. Nevertheless, acupuncture encompasses a broad array of modalities, each with distinct therapeutic advantages, and is frequently administered in conjunction with conventional pharmaceuticals or rehabilitation therapies in clinical settings. Therefore, comparative analysis across different acupuncture-related interventions holds significant clinical relevance, as it may inform the selection of more effective and safer treatment strategies for patients presenting with complex and heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Furthermore, this study adopted a more comprehensive and multidimensional set of outcome indicators and investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of acupuncture on sciatica secondary to LDH. In addition, the literature search was conducted from the inception of each database through February 10, 2025, thereby extending the search timeframe and improving the comprehensiveness of the included studies.

Clinical Implications and Significance

Our study identified more effective interventions for each outcome measure, thereby providing valuable guidance for clinical decision-making to achieve better therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, for analgesia, the combination of NK and rehabilitation therapy was recommended. To improve functional impairment and quality of daily living, EA combined with cupping therapy is advised. For the restoration of neurological function, ES in conjunction with rehabilitation therapy is suggested. To alleviate inflammatory responses, EA combined with ES appears to be more effective. Given the advantages of these interventions, including convenience, safety, minimal adverse effects, and low cost, they warrant broader clinical adoption and application. Despite differences in intervention modalities, a notable consistency was observed in the selection of acupoints. According to our analysis, GB30, BL40, BL25, and BL34 were among the most frequently utilized points, aligning with prior researchand commonly recommended acupoints in the treatment of sciatica. Therefore, GB30, BL40, BL25, and BL34 may represent common and effective acupoint choices in the clinical management of sciatica caused by LDH.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114fgkNq]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Risk of bias and certainty of evidence

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias) of included trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We assessed funding and conflict of interest statements as part of assessing other bias (eg, industry funded trials without declaration of investigator autonomy was judged to be at high risk; supplemental file 11). We rated the certainty of evidence for each of the outcomes by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework. For each GRADE domain, the quality of evidence was downgraded by one level if a serious flaw was present, that is: risk of bias (> 25% of participants in this comparison were from studies at high risk of bias (supplemental file 3), inconsistency (substantial unexplained interstudy heterogeneity, I² > 50), imprecision (95% confidence interval were 20 points different to the point estimates), and, and small study effects (> 25% of participants were from small studies (< 100 participants per arm)). Certainty of evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. Any discrepancies between the evaluation of risk of bias and certainty of evidence were resolved through consensus, or, when required, by arbitration with a third reviewer.

### A comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of the treatments for sciatica: a network meta-analysis [^113QLRHj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There remains a lack of a systematic summary of the efficacy and safety of various medicines for sciatica, and discrepancies among these exist.

Objective

The aim of this study is to comprehensively assess the efficacy of and tolerance to several medical options for the treatment of sciatica.

Methods

We performed a network meta-analysis and illustrated the results by the mean difference or odds ratio. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used for indicating the preferable treatments. All data analyses and graphs were achieved via R 3.3.2 and Stata 13.0.

Results

The subcutaneous anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to the epidural steroid + anesthetic in reducing lumbar pain in both acute + chronic sciatica patients and acute sciatica patients. The epidural steroid demonstrated a better ability regarding the Oswestry disability score (ODI) compared to the subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. In addition, for total pain relief, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was inferior to the epidural steroid + anesthetic. The epidural anesthetic and epidural steroid + anesthetic both demonstrated superiority over the epidural steroid and intramuscular steroid. The intravenous anti-TNF-α ranked first in leg pain relief, while the subcutaneous anti-TNF-α ranked first in lumbar pain relief, and the epidural steroid ranked first in the ODI on the basis of SUCRA. In addition, their safety outcome (withdrawal) rankings were all medium to high.

Conclusions

Intravenous and subcutaneous anti-TNF-α were identified as the optimal treatments for both acute + chronic sciatica patients and acute sciatica patients. In addition, the epidural steroid was also recommended as a good intervention due to its superiority in reducing ODI.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^114Ask8U]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is usually unilateral radiation pain along the direction of the sciatic nerve, accounting for 13% to 40% in different studies and reviews. Lumbosacral nerve root (L4-S1) inflammation or compression is the main cause. Neuroradiology studies have confirmed that 85% of sciatica is related to disc disease. Most patients report low back pain at the same time as pain. The severity of pain varies from patient to patient along with a sudden or chronic onset mostly. It can extend from below the knee to the toes of the feet. In severe cases, symptoms such as low back pain, decreased muscle strength, and abnormal reflexes may occur, which would cause severe discomfort with limited quality of life and function.

The current focus of treatment is to prevent the disease from becoming chronic through conventional drug treatment and early conservative treatment. However, conventional drugs have a variety of potential adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects. Recently updated clinical guidelines emphasize the role of conservative treatment of sciatica from Denmark, and the US. Surgery which can early relieve pain maybe is an option if the symptoms do not improve after 6–8 weeks of early intervention, but its effect is similar to that of conservative treatment within one year.

Acupuncture is a non-pharmacological therapy used in pain control. At present, acupuncture is widely used in the treatment of sciatica, but the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that acupuncture should not be provided as a non-invasive treatment for patients with sciatica, which is based on the following: i) Relative values of different outcomes; ii) Trade-off between clinical benefits and harms; iii) Trade-off between net clinical effects and costs; iv) Quality of evidence; and v) Other considerations. In terms of the standardized use of acupuncture, there is no internationally recognized evidence and guidance recommendations except for the "Evidence-Based Acupuncture Clinical Practice Guide: Sciatica" from China. However, with the continuous emergence of new research evidence (ie, changes in available interventions, clinical efficacy, or cost), it is necessary to conduct expert consensus based on existing evidence and update appropriately to maintain the trustworthiness of clinical guidelines.

These uncertainties of acupuncture treatment recommendations for sciatica prompted this study to establish an expert consensus based on the clinical investigation and literature review by using the improved Delphi method, which is conducive to unifying the acupuncture principles and putting forward a standard therapeutic protocol for the treatment of sciatica which could be used in future trials and clinical practice.

### The efficacy of systematic active conservative treatment for patients with severe sciatica: a single-blind, randomized, clinical, controlled trial [^112Vkh5t]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective single-blind, randomized, clinical, controlled trial.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of active conservative treatment and to compare 2 active conservative treatment programs for patients with severe sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Reviews have demonstrated little or no efficacy for passive conservative treatment modalities in patients suffering from sciatica. The results for surgery are conflicting. Cohort studies have shown excellent results for active treatment modalities in patients with sciatica.

Methods

One hundred eighty-one consecutive patients with radicular pain below the knee were examined at the baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 1 year after the treatment. Participants were randomized into 2 groups: (1) symptom-guided exercises + information + advice to stay active and (2) sham exercises + information + advice to stay active. Symptom-guided exercises consisted of a variety of back-related exercises given in accordance with a written algorithm in which symptoms or response to exercises determined the exercises given (http://www.sygehuslillebaelt.dk/wm345075, click exercises). Sham exercises were optional, designed to increase general blood circulation, and had no targeted effect on the back. The information was comprehensive and included anatomy, pathogenesis, and how discs heal without surgery. The advice included encouragement to stay as active as possible but to reduce activity if leg pain increased. The use of medication was optional, but only paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were recommended.

Results

A mean of 4.8 treatment sessions were provided. All patients experienced statistically significant and clinically important improvements in global assessment, functional status, pain, vocational status, and clinical findings. The symptom-guided exercise group improved significantly more than the sham exercise group in most outcomes.

Conclusion

Active conservative treatment was effective for patients who had symptoms and clinical findings that would normally qualify them for surgery. Although participating patients had greater faith in the sham exercises before treatment, the symptom-guided exercises were superior for most outcomes.

### Low back and radicular pain: a pathway for care developed by the British pain society [^112dHsJD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

These consensus guidelines aim to provide an overview of best practice for managing chronic spinal pain reflecting the heterogeneity of low back pain. Most guidelines have covered only one aspect of spinal care and thus have been divisive and potentially worsened the quality of care. Additionally, some of the evidence base is subjective and of poor quality. The British Pain Society low back pain pathway has reached across all disciplines and involved input from patients. It is recognized, however, that there is an urgent need for further good-quality clinical research in this area to underpin future guidelines. Considerable work is still needed to clarify the evidence; however, foundations have been laid with this pathway. Key features include: risk stratification; clarification of intensity of psychological interventions; a logical progression for the management of sciatica; and decision points for considering structural interventions such as spinal injections and surgery.

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^117WVCEo]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common causes of low back pain (LBP) and radiating leg pain (sciatica). The prevalence of sciatica vary from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in specific working populations. Most cases of sciatica caused by acute LDH show favorable outcomes and resolve within 2 weeks to 3 months. However, in some cases, LDH becomes a chronic condition of lifelong experience with LBP.

Conservative treatment should be the first-line therapy for sciatica; nonetheless, the best method of conservative treatment remains unclear, with guidelines differing in their recommendations. The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that non-pharmacological treatments, such as superficial heat treatment, massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation, should be selected for patients with LBP with or without sciatica. Among these various non-pharmacological treatments, there are many differences between guidelines for acupuncture and manual therapy. Korea guidelinesrecommend acupuncture and spinal manual therapy with high grade level of evidence. It suggested that acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and spinal manual therapy are helpful in improving pain and overall symptoms in patients with LDH. However, the United Kingdom (UK) guidelinesrecommend manual therapy only alongside an exercise program and against acupuncture. The Danish guidelinesalso state that acupuncture has low-quality evidence.

On the other hand, harms and serious adverse events for these non-pharmacological therapies have not been reported. In an RCT study on manual therapy for the neck, adverse events related to the musculoskeletal system and nervous system were observed in 5 patients (9.3%) in the intervention group, but all were mild or moderate side effects. In a systemic review of acupuncture treatment for a LDH patient, adverse events were reported in two trials, one reported no adverse events, and one reported local haematoma.

The recommendations for invasive treatment also vary widely depending on guidelines. Some recent guidelines, do not recommend epidural injections or facet joint injections, whereas the UK guidelinesrecommend epidural injections for patients with severe sciatica. The United States (US) guidelinesalso strongly recommend epidural injections for the management of sciatica or LDH. It suggested that transforaminal epidural steroid injections provide short-term (2–4 weeks) pain relief in LDH patients. Epidural injection is associated with serious adverse events such as plegia, spinal cord injury, dural hemorrhage, paralysis, stroke, and dural punctures, although the incidence rate is low.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156bLVV]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Results

Figure 1 outlines the flow of trials through the review. The initial electronic database search identified 2460 potential studies of interest. After screening citations by title and abstract, we considered 197 potentially eligible articles for inclusion and retrieved full articles. We included 23 published reports(reporting 24 different clinical trials, as onereported on two trials). Three trials reported in previous systematic reviewswere not included in this review because of unclear randomisation.

Fig 1 Selection process of trials examining pain relief in patients with sciatica

The included trials investigated six different classes of drugs: NSAIDs, antidepressants, corticosteroids, opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, and anticonvulsants. The drugs investigated in the included trials were administered orally in 16 trialsand parenterally in five trials (four trialsinvestigated intramuscular injections and one trialinvestigated intravenous infusions). Three other trialsused mixed administration of a starting intramuscular dose and subsequent oral doses. One study compared oral versus parenteral administration. Table 2shows the characteristics of the included trials, and table 3presents details of methodological quality.

*Dreisser et al 28 reported on two clinical trials.

Duration of symptoms varied a lot across studies (table 2). Six trials specifically investigated patients with chronic symptomsand eight trials included patients with acute symptoms. In six trials, however, patients had mixed duration of symptoms; in two trials duration was not specified; and in two trials patients were reported to have acute symptoms but no information regarding duration was provided. Regarding the definition of sciatica, 15 trials used a definition based on clinical assessment alone, whereas nine trials also required concordant imaging evidence. Pooling of data via meta-analysis was possible only for comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo in pain intensity at immediate follow-up and for corticosteroids versus placebo in pain intensity at immediate and short term follow-up. Table 2 also presents the number of studies comparing each class of drug and control.

### Trial of pregabalin for acute and chronic sciatica [^114Voi5Z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study PRECISE was published by Stephanie Mathieson and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Low back pain and Sciatica. In the PRECISE study, the trial question was: what is the role of pregabalin in patients with acute and chronic sciatica? In the PRECISE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PRECISE study, the population was: 207 patients (115 female, 92 male). The inclusion criteria were outpatients with moderate-to-severe sciatica. The key exclusion criteria were known or suspected serious pathologic condition of the spine; pregnancy; considering or planning spinal surgery for sciatica during the first 8 weeks of the trial; contraindications to pregabalin. In the PRECISE study, the interventions were: n = 106 pregabalin (at a dose of 150 mg/day, adjusted to a maximum dose of 600 mg/day, for up to 8 weeks) n = 101 placebo (matching placebo for up to 8 weeks). In the PRECISE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in leg pain intensity score at week 8 (3.7 points vs. 3.1 points; MD 0.5, 95% CI -0.2 to 1.2). In the PRECISE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in leg pain intensity score at week 52 (3.4 points vs. 3 points; MD 0.3, 95% CI -0.5 to 1) No significant difference in extent of disability score on the Roland Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica at week 8 (9.1 points vs. 8.5 points; MD 0.1, 95% CI -1.8 to 2) No significant difference in back pain intensity score at week 8 (3.5 points vs. 3.1 points; MD 0.2, 95% CI -0.6 to 1). In the PRECISE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events and suicidal thoughts. significant differences in adverse events (64.2% vs. 42.6%), dizziness (39.6% vs. 12.9%). In the PRECISE study, the conclusion was: in outpatients with moderate-to-severe sciatica, pregabalin was not superior to placebo with respect to leg pain intensity score at week 8.

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^113SpM2c]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to compare the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacological- and pharmacological treatment strategies for Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) in pragmatic clinical settings.

Patients and Methods

This study was a pilot, two-armed, parallel pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Thirty patients aged 19–70 years with a numeric rating scale (NRS) score ≥ 5 for sciatica and confirmed LDH on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included. Participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to non-pharmacological (non-Phm) or pharmacological (Phm) treatment group. They were treated for 8 weeks and a total follow-up period was 26 weeks after randomization. Non-Phm treatment included acupuncture, spinal manual therapy, etc. Phm included medication, injection, nerve block, etc. The primary outcome was a numeric rating scale (NRS) of radiating leg pain. NRS for low back pain, Oswestry disability index, visual analog scale, Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, patient global impression of change, Short Form-12 Health Survey, version 2, 5-level European Quality of Life-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) were also measured. Linear mixed model was used to evaluated the difference in change of outcomes from baseline between two groups. An economic evaluation was conducted using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.

Results

There was no significant difference between the two groups in the intervention period, but non-Phm group showed significantly greater degree of improvement in follow-up of Week 14. Difference in the NRS for sciatica and ODI were 1.65 (95% CI 0.59 to 2.71, p = 0.003) and 8.67 (95% CI 1.37 to 15.98, p = 0.21), respectively in Week 14. The quality-adjusted life year (QALY) value calculated by EQ-5D and Short Form-6 Dimension were 0.006 (95% CI −0.012 to 0.024, p = 0.472) and 0.015 (95% CI −0.008 to 0.038, p = 0.195) higher in non-Phm group than in Phm group. The cost was lower in non-Phm group than in Phm group (Difference: −682, 95% CI −3349 to 1699, p = 0.563).

Conclusion

We confirmed that the non-Phm treatment could be more cost-effective treatments than Phm treatments and feasibility of a large-scale of main study in future.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ZDRKK]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Corticosteroids

Three trials in patients with acute sciatica tested the effect of corticosteroids compared with placebo. The individual studies provided imprecise estimates of treatment effect (fig 2). For the immediate term, pooling showed no effect of steroids on leg pain (mean difference −1.8, −11.1 to 7.5; P = 0.71) with a GRADE classification of "moderate quality" of evidence (downgraded for imprecision) (fig 3). For the short term, pooling showed a significant effect of steroids on pain (overall and leg pain) (mean difference −12.2, −20.9 to −3.4; P < 0.01) and "moderate quality" of evidence according to the GRADE approach (downgraded for imprecision) (fig 3).

Antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioid analgesics

Three trials investigated the efficacy of antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioid analgesics (fig 2). As these were single trials that investigated different classes of drugs or time points of assessment, pooling was not possible. Hence, the quality of evidence for all these medications was considered "low quality" (single studies)or "very low quality" (single study downgraded for limitation of study design)according to the GRADE approach.

Two trials investigated the effect of anticonvulsants in patients with chronic symptoms of sciatica. In one crossover trial, topiramate (50–400 mg/day) showed no better immediate effects than placebo for disability and leg or back pain. In contrast, data from another trialshowed significant overall pain relieving effect with the anticonvulsant gabapentin (900–3600 mg) in the short term (mean difference −26.6, −38.3 to −14.9; P < 0.001) compared with placebo.

One crossover study with four periods investigated the relative efficacy of opioid analgesics (sustained release morphine 15 mg/day), antidepressants (nortriptyline 25 mg/day), and a combination of both and placebo in patients with chronic sciatica. In this trial, antidepressants, opioid analgesics, and a combination of both had no significant effect compared with placebo in the immediate term for disability or leg or back pain.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114KBNkX]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Pain radiating from the spine into the leg is commonly referred to as "sciatica". "Sciatica" may be associated with significant consequences for the person living with the condition, imposing a reduced quality of lifeand substantial direct and indirect costs (eg, £1.2–10.6 billion annually in the United Kingdom alone, extrapolated from primary care data).

Of note, there is no consensus on the definition and diagnostic criteria for "sciatica". The term "sciatica" has been used to encompass a range of nerve-related conditions originating from the spine such as radicular pain or painful radiculopathy. Despite the linguistic allusion to neural involvement, "sciatica" has in some instances even been used to encompass somatic referred pain.

Although these pain conditions may overlap, they are discrete entities with differing dominant pain characteristics (eg, nociceptive or neuropathic), which may require specific management approaches. Nevertheless, these terms are often used interchangeably, and these heterogeneous conditions are often amalgamated in clinical trials. Whether or not this amalgamation contributes to the modest treatment effects seen for "sciatica" is unclear.

Two of the main challenges associated with a diagnosis of "sciatica" relate to the inconsistent use of terminology for the diagnostic labels, "sciatica" or radicular pain or painful radiculopathy, and the identification of neuropathic pain. These challenges hinder collective clinical and scientific understanding and clarity regarding these conditions, impact effective clinical communication and care planning, prevent clear interpretation of the scientific literature related to the condition, and ultimately may contribute to the limited efficacy of care for people living with "sciatica". Indeed, most trials on conservative management for people with "sciatica" either show no, or at best, modest effects.

### Targeting neurotrophic factors for low back pain and sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115tZadu]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This meta-analysis aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of medicines that target neurotrophic factors for low back pain (LBP) or sciatica.

Methods

We searched published and trial registry reports of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of medicines that target neurotrophic factors to LBP or sciatica in seven databases from inception to December 2020. Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and certainty in the evidence.

Results

Nine studies (3370 participants) were included in the meta-analyses. Low certainty evidence showed that anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) may reduce pain at 4weeks (mean difference [MD] -6.75, 95% CI: -8.61, -4.90) and 12weeks (MD -6.16, 95% CI: -8.38, -3.94), and may increase adverse effects for chronic LBP (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.38). Higher doses of anti-NGF may offer a clinically important reduction in pain at the cost of increased adverse effects for chronic LBP. Very low certainty evidence showed that anti-NGF and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (pro-GDNF) may not reduce pain for sciatica at 4weeks (MD -1.40, 95% CI: -8.26, 5.46), at 12weeks (MD -2.91, 95% CI: -13.69, 7.67) and may increase adverse effects for sciatica (OR 3.27, 95% CI: 1.78, 6.00).

Conclusion

Anti-NGF may offer small reductions in pain intensity for chronic LBP. The effect may depend on the dose and types of medicines. For sciatica, anti-NGF or pro-GDNF may not reduce pain. Medicines that target neurotrophic factors for LBP or sciatica are associated with different adverse effects compared to those observed in commonly prescribed medicines for these conditions.

### Efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of back pain and osteoarthritis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Q9P1V]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for back and osteoarthritis pain compared with placebo.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception to 15 November and updated on 12 May 2020.

Eligibility Criteria For Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy or safety, or both of any antidepressant drug with placebo (active or inert) in participants with low back or neck pain, sciatica, or hip or knee osteoarthritis.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Pain and disability were primary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). A random effects model was used to calculate weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. Safety (any adverse event, serious adverse events, and proportion of participants who withdrew from trials owing to adverse events) was a secondary outcome. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) framework.

Results

33 trials (5318 participants) were included. Moderate certainty evidence showed that serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) reduced back pain (mean difference -5.30, 95% confidence interval -7.31 to -3.30) at 3–13 weeks and low certainty evidence that SNRIs reduced osteoarthritis pain (-9.72, -12.75 to -6.69) at 3–13 weeks. Very low certainty evidence showed that SNRIs reduced sciatica at two weeks or less (-18.60, -31.87 to -5.33) but not at 3–13 weeks (-17.50, -42.90 to 7.89). Low to very low certainty evidence showed that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) did not reduce sciatica at two weeks or less (-7.55, -18.25 to 3.15) but did at 3–13 weeks (-15.95, -31.52 to -0.39) and 3–12 months (-27.0, -36.11 to -17.89). Moderate certainty evidence showed that SNRIs reduced disability from back pain at 3–13 weeks (-3.55, -5.22 to -1.88) and disability due to osteoarthritis at two weeks or less (-5.10, -7.31 to -2.89), with low certainty evidence at 3–13 weeks (-6.07, -8.13 to -4.02). TCAs and other antidepressants did not reduce pain or disability from back pain.

Conclusion

Moderate certainty evidence shows that the effect of SNRIs on pain and disability scores is small and not clinically important for back pain, but a clinically important effect cannot be excluded for osteoarthritis. TCAs and SNRIs might be effective for sciatica, but the certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low.

### Acupotomy for military training-induced lumbar radiculopathy with sciatica: protocol of a randomized controlled trial [^1114XxRv]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The rising global healthcare burden of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) has intensified research into effective therapies. While prior studies have evaluated acupuncture and massage for sciatica in civilian populations, combat-related low back pain frequently involves disc herniation with sciatica — present in 62% of cases. Traditional therapies are often suboptimal for military operational contexts, as prolonged recovery times and side-effect risks conflict with operational imperatives. A 2025 meta-analysis of interventional pain techniquesdemonstrated that ultrasound-guidance reduces adverse events by 37% compared to blind procedures, supporting its risk-reduction utility in resource-constrained settings. This study addresses an evidence gap by examining non-pharmacological interventions for occupational sciatica and proposing military healthcare improvements. If proven effective, acupotomy could emerge as a pivotal non-pharmacological military medicine treatment, reducing reliance on NSAIDs and epidural injections. Its short recovery enables weekly sessions, potentially decreasing medical discharges through accelerated return-to-duty rates — critical for sustaining combat readiness. Future cost-effectiveness analyses may establish its economic advantage over surgery or long-term pharmacotherapy, with findings extending to civilian cohorts like firefighters facing comparable physical demands.

The study has several limitations. Acupotomy's efficacy is highly operator-dependent, relying significantly on practitioner skill and experience. Primary outcomes were assessed only at 4 weeks and 1 month post-treatment, leaving its long-term effectiveness (eg, at 6 months or 1 year) unknown. The participant cohort consisted solely of active-duty military personnel aged 18–45, limiting generalizability to other populations. Additionally, the nature of the intervention complicates blinding and introduces potential placebo effects, which could impact the assessment of allocation concealment. We must also account for neurophysiological effects from the sham procedure. A superficial puncture (5–10 mm depth) may stimulate cutaneous nociceptors, potentially inducing transient pain modulation through gate control mechanisms. Alternatively, it might trigger limited pro-inflammatory cytokine release (eg, IL-6), contributing to non-specific pain modulation. While we will statistically control for rescue medication (Celecoxib), its analgesic effects may obscure the treatment's therapeutic benefits. This approach reflects real-world military clinical practice, where adjunct medication is often unavoidable in severe sciatica cases. Dynamic MRI for intervertebral foraminal volume assessment was considered but omitted due to cost and logistical constraints in military settings.

### The role of systemic steroids in sciatica due to herniated lumbar disc: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117MptgD]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objective

Evaluate the role of systemic steroids in treating patients with sciatica due to lumbar disk herniation (LDH).

Summary Of Background Data

The association between LDH and sciatica has been well described. The use of steroids seems logical in this context; however, their efficacy is not well described, and their use remains controversial.

Methods

A comprehensive search on PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases (up to February 15, 2022) was performed to identify randomized clinical trials that included patients with symptoms of sciatica due to LDH that were treated with systemic steroids. The risk of bias was judged using the Cochrane risk-of-Bias2 tool. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model to estimate the between-group effect size for pain and functional outcomes. The risk of developing adverse events (AE) was computed using relative risks. All pooled results are reported with their 95% confidence interval (CI) and certainty of evidence analyzed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework.

Results

Ten studies met inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 1017 participants: 540 in the treatment group and 477 in the control group. Steroid treatment was associated with a significant superior reduction of pain (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.08, weak effect, very-low certainty) and reduction in disability (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.10, weak effect, very-low certainty). Corticosteroid administration was associated with a significant increased risk of developing an AE (relative risks = 2.00, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.85, low certainty).

Conclusion

The use of systemic steroids in the treatment of sciatica due to LDH seems reasonable despite a 2-fold higher risk of developing mild AEs. However, the effect size is small for reducing pain in the short term and improving functional outcomes at long-term follow-up.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^1138xLXi]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessment of network inconsistency (heterogeneity and incoherence)

Variation in treatment effects between studies (ie, heterogeneity) and variation between direct and indirect sources of evidence (ie, incoherence) are two concepts related to the inconsistency.

The assessment of statistical heterogeneity in the entire network was based on the magnitude of the heterogeneity variance parameter (τ2) estimated by using NMA models. We assumed equal heterogeneity across all treatment comparisons accounting for correlations induced by multiarm studies. Then, to assess presence of global inconsistency, we used a full design-by-treatment interaction random effects model (global χ² test). If the null hypothesis of inconsistency parameters being equal to zero was not rejected, we fit a consistency model. We presented local inconsistency estimates using forest plots and side-splitting for direct and indirect estimates in each available comparison (online supplemental I and J). When global significant inconsistency was found, multiple strategies were explored. We first checked the dataset for data extraction errors or outlier effect sizes among comparisons (visually inspected by pairwise meta-analysis). Then, we tried to interpret the significant inconsistency parameters separating indirect from direct evidence (side-splitting) and finally we explored the observed inconsistency using prespecified covariates in network meta-regression analyses and subgroup analyses. If any strategy explained the inconsistency, we presented only forest plots grouped into direct and indirect estimates (network forests).

Meta-regression and subgroup analyses

We performed network meta-regression random effects within a frequentist framework with metareg command in Stata using aggregate-level data to examine relationship between treatments effects and each specified covariate (age, percentage of male, stage of low back pain, baseline severity of pain, presence of leg pain or sciatica, RoB).

When inconsistency remains unexplained by meta-regression, we explored the treatments effects performing subgroup analyses into pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions groups.

### Oral steroids for acute radiculopathy due to a herniated lumbar disk: a randomized clinical trial [^113cV1aa]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Oral steroids are commonly used to treat acute sciatica due to a herniated disk but have not been evaluated in an appropriately powered clinical trial.

Objective

To determine if oral prednisone is more effective than placebo in improving function and pain among patients with acute sciatica.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from 2008 to 2013 in a large integrated health care delivery system in Northern California. Adults (n = 269) with radicular pain for 3 months or less, an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of 30 or higher (range, 0–100; higher scores indicate greater dysfunction), and a herniated disk confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging were eligible.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive a tapering 15-day course of oral prednisone (5 days each of 60 mg, 40 mg, and 20 mg; total cumulative dose = 600 mg; n = 181) or matching placebo (n = 88).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was ODI change at 3 weeks; secondary outcomes were ODI change at 1 year, change in lower extremity pain (measured on a 0–10 scale; higher scores indicate more pain), spine surgery, and Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores (0–100 scale; higher scores better).

Results

Observed baseline and 3-week mean ODI scores were 51.2 and 32.2 for the prednisone group and 51.1 and 37.5 for the placebo group, respectively. The prednisone-treated group showed an adjusted mean 6.4-point (95% CI, 1.9–10.9; p = 0.006) greater improvement in ODI scores at 3 weeks than the placebo group and a mean 7.4-point (95% CI, 2.2–12.5; p = 0.005) greater improvement at 52 weeks. Compared with the placebo group, the prednisone group showed an adjusted mean 0.3-point (95% CI, -0.4 to 1.0; p = 0.34) greater reduction in pain at 3 weeks and a mean 0.6-point (95% CI, -0.2 to 1.3; p = 0.15) greater reduction at 52 weeks. The prednisone group showed an adjusted mean 3.3-point (95% CI, 1.3–5.2; p = 0.001) greater improvement in the SF-36 PCS score at 3 weeks, no difference in the SF-36 PCS score at 52 weeks (mean, 2.5; 95% CI, -0.3 to 5.4; p = 0.08), no change in the SF-36 MCS score at 3 weeks (mean, 2.2; 95% CI, -0.4 to 4.8; p = 0.10), and an adjusted 3.6-point (95% CI, 0.6–6.7; p = 0.02) greater improvement in the SF-36 MCS score at 52 weeks. There were no differences in surgery rates at 52-week follow-up. Having 1 or more adverse events at 3-week follow-up was more common in the prednisone group than in the placebo group (49.2% vs 23.9%; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with acute radiculopathy due to a herniated lumbar disk, a short course of oral steroids, compared with placebo, resulted in modestly improved function and no improvement in pain.

### Efficacy of naproxen in patients with sciatica: multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116CxuVV]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This trial assessed the efficacy of naproxen in patients with sciatica in outpatient clinics across 4 Norwegian hospitals. A total of 123 adults with radiating pain below the knee (≥ 4 on a 0–10 numeric rating scale) and signs consistent with nerve root involvement were included. Participants were randomized to receive either naproxen 500 mg or a placebo twice daily for 10 days. The primary outcome, daily leg pain intensity measured on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale throughout the treatment period, revealed a statistically significant difference in favor of naproxen, with an adjusted mean difference of -0.5 (95% CI -0.8 to -0.1, P = 0.015). In the naproxen group, the treatment effect was significantly related to time, and over the whole 10-day period, the average adjusted difference was -0.6 (95% CI -0.8 to -0.5). Mean numbers needed to treat for 30% and 50% improvement were 9.9 (95% CI 4.7–15.0) and 20.7 (8.7–32.7), respectively. The adjusted mean difference for back pain was -0.4 (95% CI -0.8 to 0.0), and for Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica, it was -1.5 (95% CI -3.0 to 0.0). No differences were found for sciatica bothersomeness or consumption of rescue medication or opioids. Participants in the naproxen group exhibited an adjusted odds ratio of 4.7 (95% CI 1.3–16.2) for improvement by 1 level on the global perceived change scale. In conclusion, naproxen treatment showed small, likely clinically unimportant benefits compared with placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe sciatica.

### Epidural steroid compared to placebo injection in sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178Ri8V]. European Spine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether epidural steroid injections (ESI) are superior to epidural or non-epidural placebo injections in sciatica patients.

Methods

The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science databases were searched for trials comparing ESI to epidural or non-epidural placebo. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. The primary outcome measures were pooled using a random-effects model for 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were described qualitatively. Quality of evidence was graded using GRADE classification.

Results

Seventeen out of 732 articles were included. ESI was superior compared to epidural placebo at 6 weeks (-8.6 [-13.4; -3.9]) and 3 months (-5.2 [-10.1; -0.2]) for leg pain and at 6 weeks for functional status (-4.1 [-6.5; -1.6]), though the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) was not met. There was no difference in ESI and placebo for back pain, except for non-epidural placebo at 3 months (6.9 [1.3; 12.5]). Proportions of treatment success were not different. ESI reduced analgesic intake in some studies and complication rates are low.

Conclusion

The literature indicates that ESI induces larger improvements in pain and disability on the short term compared to epidural placebo, though evidence is of low to moderate quality and MCID is not met. Strong conclusions for longer follow-up or for comparisons with non-epidural placebo cannot be drawn due to general low quality of evidence and limited number of studies. Epidural injections can be considered a safe therapy.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for lumbosacral radicular pain [^114HSgD8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lumbosacral radicular pain (commonly called sciatica) is a syndrome involving patients who report radiating leg pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections deliver a corticosteroid dose into the epidural space, with the aim of reducing the local inflammatory process and, consequently, relieving the symptoms of lumbosacral radicular pain. This Cochrane Review is an update of a review published in Annals of Internal Medicine in 2012. Some placebo-controlled trials have been published recently, which highlights the importance of updating the previous review.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy and safety of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo injection on pain and disability in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases without language limitations up to 25 September 2019: Cochrane Back and Neck group trial register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and two trial registers. We also performed citation tracking of included studies and relevant systematic reviews in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included studies that compared epidural corticosteroid injections of any corticosteroid drug to placebo injections in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain. We accepted all three anatomical approaches (caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal) to delivering corticosteroids into the epidural space. We considered trials that included a placebo treatment as delivery of an inert substance (i.e. one with no pharmacologic activity), an innocuous substance (e.g. normal saline solution), or a pharmacologically active substance but not one considered to provide sustained benefit (e.g. local anaesthetic), either into the epidural space (i.e. to mimic epidural corticosteroid injection) or adjacent spinal tissue (i.e. subcutaneous, intramuscular, or interspinous tissue). We also included trials in which a local anaesthetic with a short duration of action was used as a placebo and injected together with corticosteroid in the intervention group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently performed the screening, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessments. In case of insufficient information, we contacted the authors of the original studies or estimated the data. We grouped the outcome data into four time points of assessment: immediate (≤ 2 weeks), short term (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months), intermediate term (> 3 months but < 12 months), and long term (≥ 12 months). We assessed the overall quality of evidence for each outcome and time point using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 clinical trials (from 29 publications) investigating the effects of epidural corticosteroid injections compared to placebo in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain. The included studies provided data for a total of 2470 participants with a mean age ranging from 37.3 to 52.8 years. Seventeen studies included participants with lumbosacral radicular pain with a diagnosis based on clinical assessment and 15 studies included participants with mixed duration of symptoms. The included studies were conducted mainly in North America and Europe. Fifteen studies did not report funding sources, five studies reported not receiving funding, and five reported receiving funding from a non-profit or government source. Eight trials reported data on pain intensity, 12 reported data on disability, and eight studies reported data on adverse events. The duration of the follow-up assessments ranged from 12 hours to 1 year. We considered eight trials to be of high quality because we judged them as having low risk of bias in four out of the five bias domains. We identified one ongoing trial in a trial registry. Epidural corticosteroid injections were probably slightly more effective compared to placebo in reducing leg pain at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) -4.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.77 to -1.09 on a 0 to 100 scale; 8 trials, n = 949; moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias)). For disability, epidural corticosteroid injections were probably slightly more effective compared to placebo in reducing disability at short-term follow-up (MD -4.18, 95% CI -6.04 to -2.17, on a 0 to 100 scale; 12 trials, n = 1367; moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias)). The treatment effects are small, however, and may not be considered clinically important by patients and clinicians (i.e. MD lower than 10%). Most trials provided insufficient information on how or when adverse events were assessed (immediate or short-term follow-up) and only reported adverse drug reactions - that is, adverse events that the trialists attributed to the study treatment. We are very uncertain that epidural corticosteroid injections make no difference compared to placebo injection in the frequency of minor adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.42; 8 trials, n = 877; very low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision)). Minor adverse events included increased pain during or after the injection, non-specific headache, post-dural puncture headache, irregular periods, accidental dural puncture, thoracic pain, non-local rash, sinusitis, vasovagal response, hypotension, nausea, and tinnitus. One study reported a major drug reaction for one patient on anticoagulant therapy who had a retroperitoneal haematoma as a complication of the corticosteroid injection.

Authors' Conclusions

This study found that epidural corticosteroid injections probably slightly reduced leg pain and disability at short-term follow-up in people with lumbosacral radicular pain. In addition, no minor or major adverse events were reported at short-term follow-up after epidural corticosteroid injections or placebo injection. Although the current review identified additional clinical trials, the available evidence still provides only limited support for the use of epidural corticosteroid injections in people with lumbosacral radicular pain as the treatment effects are small, mainly evident at short-term follow-up and may not be considered clinically important by patients and clinicians (i.e. mean difference lower than 10%). According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, suggesting that further studies are likely to play an important role in clarifying the efficacy and tolerability of this treatment. We recommend that further trials should attend to methodological features such as appropriate allocation concealment and blinding of care providers to minimise the potential for biased estimates of treatment and harmful effects.

### Oral steroids in initial treatment of acute sciatica [^113RNxTf]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Many physicians use prednisone to treat acute sciatica with the hope of speeding recovery. There is little clinical evidence to support this practice. Our objective was to determine whether early administration of oral prednisone affects parameters related to recovery from acute sciatica.

Methods

In this double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 27 patients were sequentially assigned to receive either a 9-day tapering course of prednisone (n = 13) or placebo (n = 14) within 1 week of developing sciatic symptoms. Patients and investigators were blinded to the drug administered. Follow-up assessment was done weekly for 1 month and then monthly for 5 months.

Results

Prednisone and control groups showed no statistically significant differences in physical findings, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotic medications, or rates of patients returning to work at any time interval studied. Compared with controls, patients who received prednisone had more rapid rates of improvement from baseline in pain, mental well-being, and disability scores. These changes were subtle but statistically significant. Patients who received prednisone tended to receive fewer epidural injections for pain.

Conclusions

Early administration of oral steroid medication in patients with acute sciatica had no significant effect on most parameters studied. It did, however, lead to slightly more rapid rates of improvement in pain, mental well-being, and disability scores. The impact of oral steroids on other outcomes is suggested by this study, but its small sample size limited its statistical power.

### Outcome of invasive treatment modalities on back pain and sciatica: an evidence-based review [^114HNsk8]. European Spine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Within the framework of evidence-based medicine high-quality randomised trials and systematic reviews are considered a necessary prerequisite for progress in orthopaedics. This paper summarises the currently available evidence on surgical and other invasive procedures for low back pain. Results of systematic reviews conducted within the framework of the Cochrane Back Review Group were used. Data were gathered from the latest Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 2. The Cochrane reviews were updated using the evidence summary on surgery and other invasive procedures from the COST B13 European Guidelines for the Management of Acute and Chronic Non-Specific Low Back Pain. Facet joint, epidural, trigger point and sclerosant injections have not clearly been shown to be effective and can consequently not be recommended. There is no scientific evidence on the effectiveness of spinal stenosis surgery. Surgical discectomy may be considered for selected patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc prolapses that fail to resolve with the conservative management. Cognitive intervention Combined with exercises is recommended for chronic low back pain, and fusion surgery may be considered only in carefully selected patients after active rehabilitation programmes during 2 years time have failed. Demanding surgical fusion techniques are not better than the traditional posterolateral fusion without internal fixation.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113uGdup]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

NSAIDs

Four trials compared orally administered NSAIDs with placebo for acute sciatica. Of these, three trials used a three arm design. Treatment effects for these studies are presented in figure 2. Data for pooling were available from all three studies. Figure 3shows small and non-significant pooled effect size for pain (overall and leg pain) in the immediate term follow-up (mean difference −4.9, 95% confidence interval −10.2 to 0.4; P < 0.07). Because of the three arm design, we calculated effect sizes for three other treatment comparisons (comparison 2 (meloxicam 7.5 mg/day, lornoxicam 8 mg/day, piroxicam 20 mg/day v placebo): mean difference −4.4, −8.9 to 0.1, I² = 0.1%, P < 0.06; comparison 3 (meloxicam 15 mg/day, lornoxicam 8 mg/day, piroxicam 2 mg/day v placebo): mean difference −3.9, −8.0 to 0.2, I² = 0.6%, P < 0.07; comparison 4 (meloxicam 15 mg/day, diclofenac 50–150 mg/day, piroxicam 20 mg/day v placebo): mean difference −4.4, −9.4 to 0.6, I² = 6.8%, P < 0.09) (not shown in fig 3). The quality of evidence (GRADE) for this pooling was rated "low quality" (downgraded for limitation of study design and inconsistency).

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^114xvrnk]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — comparative effectiveness of epidural injections for sciatica and chronic pain: A network meta-analysis of management strategies for sciatica reviewing 122 relevant studies and 21 treatment strategies showed a statistically significant improvement with epidural injections, and a comparative network meta-analysis found that epidural steroid with local anesthetic was superior to epidural steroid without local anesthetic and to intramuscular steroid; subcutaneous antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to epidural local spinal anesthetic at reducing pain, but epidural steroids produced superior reductions in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores compared to subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported after review of 73 trials that adding corticosteroids to local anesthetic had only small benefits with a potential for harm and no meaningful improvement in pain scores or duration of pain relief, and the authors recommended that clinical decisions should consider the potential for harm with steroids and the therapeutic benefit by the local anesthetic alone; additionally, a prior systematic review of 4 randomized trials was rated very low in methodologic quality, and despite numerous systematic reviews there have not been guidelines systematically developed to assess clinical and cost effectiveness of epidural injections, including percutaneous adhesiolysis, in managing spinal pain.

### Effectiveness of pregabalin treatment for neuropathic pain in patients with spine diseases: a pooled analysis of two multicenter observational studies in Japan [^113oXpM7]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Based on the accumulated evidence in various conditions associated with an NeP component, such as postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, spinal cord injury, and painful lumbar or cervical radiculopathy, pregabalin is recommended as one of the first-line treatments for NeP. However, in some RCTs in patients with NeP associated with spine diseases, the efficacy of pregabalin was not shown to be greater than that obtained in the placebo group, partially due to a high placebo response. For example, the RCT in patients with acute or chronic sciatica, reported pain intensity was reduced by about 50% from baseline to week 8 in both the pregabalin and placebo groups, and nearly two-thirds of both groups were satisfied with their treatments. Their study population comprised mostly of acute cases (pain < 3 months in 80.2%). Considering that the sciatica pain resolves early (2 weeks in 36% and 12 weeks in 73%) without surgery, these improvements in both groups may have reflected spontaneous recovery. Moreover, in an RCT in patients with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy, pain relief during the single-blinded pregabalin treatment phase may have been carried over to the following double-blind treatment phase, leading to a lack of separation of treatment effect by pregabalin from those by placebo. Furthermore, the possible involvement of the nociceptive component of the target conditions (sciatica, lumbosacral radiculopathy, and lumbar spinal stenosis) may have affected the treatment response. For example, in an RCT in patients with sciatica, the baseline PainDETECT score suggested that most of the patients were likely to have had predominantly nociceptive pain or unlikely/uncertain neuropathic pain component. Taken together, the possibility of pregabalin's effectiveness for chronic pain with an NeP component from spine diseases may not be completely excluded, and may require further consideration.

### Short-term efficacy of intravenous pulse glucocorticoids in acute discogenic sciatica. A randomized controlled trial [^1111vDEB]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Double-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Objective

To test the short-term efficacy of a single intravenous (IV) pulse of glucocorticoids on the symptoms of acute discogenic sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

The use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of acute discogenic sciatica is controversial. A potential advantage of the IV pulse therapy is the ability to distribute high glucocorticoid concentrations to the area surrounding the prolapsed disc without the risks and inconveniences of an epidural injection.

Methods

Patients with acute sciatica (< 6-week duration) of radiologically confirmed discogenic origin were randomized to receive either a single IV bolus of 500 mg of methylprednisolone or placebo. Clinical evaluation was performed in a double-blind manner on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, and 30. The primary outcome was reduction in sciatic leg pain during the first 3 days following the infusion; secondary outcomes were reduction in low back pain, global pain, functional disability, and signs of radicular irritation. The analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis using a longitudinal regression model for repeated measures.

Results

A total of 65 patients were randomized, and 60 completed the treatment and the follow-up assessments. A single IV bolus of glucocorticoids provided significant improvement in sciatic leg pain (P = 0.04) within the first 3 days. However, the effect size was small, and the improvement did not persist. IV glucocorticoids had no effect on functional disability or clinical signs of radicular irritation.

Conclusions

Although an IV bolus of glucocorticoids provides a short-term improvement in leg pain in patients with acute discogenic sciatica, its effects are transient and have small magnitude.

### Traction for low-back pain with or without sciatica [^115mLj9M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Various types of traction are used in the treatment of low-back pain (LBP), often in conjunction with other treatments.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of traction in the management of LBP.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 4, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to November 2004, references in relevant reviews, and our personal files.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining any type of traction for the treatment of acute (less than four weeks duration), sub-acute (four to 12 weeks) or chronic (more than 12 weeks) non-specific LBP with or without sciatica.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, methodological quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by sets of two reviewers. As available studies did not provide sufficient data for statistical pooling, a qualitative analysis was performed.

Main Results

Twenty-four RCTs, involving 2177 patients (1016 receiving traction) were included in the review. Five trials were considered high quality. There is strong evidence that there is no significant difference in short or long-term outcomes between either continuous or intermittent traction and placebo, sham, or other treatments for patients with a mixed duration of LBP, with or without sciatica. There is moderate evidence that: autotraction is more effective other forms of traction are no more effective than placebo, sham or no treatment for patients with a mixed duration of LBP with sciatica. There is limited evidence that: there is no significant difference in outcomes between a standard physical therapy program with continuous traction and the same program without traction, for patients with a mixed duration of LBP, with or without sciatica autotraction on its own is more effective than a physical therapy program that includes Tru-Trac traction for patients with a mixed duration of LBP with sciatica. There is conflicting evidence regarding the short-term effectiveness of either continuous or intermittent traction compared to placebo, sham or other treatments, in the management of patients who have either chronic LBP or a mixed duration of LBP with sciatica.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that traction is probably not effective. Neither continuous nor intermittent traction by itself was more effective in improving pain, disability or work absence than placebo, sham or other treatments for patients with a mixed duration of LBP, with or without sciatica. Although trials studying patients with sciatica had methodological limitations and inconsistent results, there was moderate evidence that autotraction was more effective than mechanical traction for global improvement in this population.

### Epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica: a comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of cochrane review [^113JhrMx]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidural injections are one of the commonly performed procedures in managing low back and lower extremity pain. In the past, Pinto et al and Chou et al performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses with a recent update from Oliveira et al showing lack of effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar radiculopathy. In contrast, multiple other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have supported the efficacy and use of epidural injections utilizing fluoroscopic guidance.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of 3 categories of epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica performed utilizing saline with steroids, local anesthetic alone, or steroids with local anesthetic.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, RCTs with a placebo control or an active control design, performed under fluoroscopic guidance, with at least 6 months of followed-up were included. The outcome measures were pain relief and functional status improvement. Significant improvement was defined as 50% or greater pain relief and functional status improvement. Literature search was performed through January 2021. Methodological quality assessments were performed. Evidence was summarized utilizing principles of best evidence synthesis.

Results

In this analysis, a total of 21 RCTs were utilized with at least 6 months of follow-up and performed under fluoroscopic guidance. However, only 6 of 25 trials from Cochrane review met inclusion criteria for this review. Based on qualitative analysis, of the 21 trials included in the present analysis, there was only one placebo-controlled trial found to be negative. With conventional meta-analysis, there was no significant difference among the studies because all of the studies were active control with local anesthetic or local anesthetic and steroids. Further, with single-arm analysis, of the 5 trials included in that portion of the study, significant improvement was seen with local anesthetic alone compared to local anesthetic and steroids. There was a tendency for better improvement with steroids in terms of both pain relief and functional status. The level of evidence is Level I or strong for local anesthetic with steroids and Level I to II or moderate to strong for local anesthetic as a single agent based on multiple relevant high quality RCTs.

Limitations

Despite multiple trials available, there is a paucity of true RCTs performed under fluoroscopic guidance with any of the approaches.

Conclusion

Epidural injections with or without steroids for radiculopathy showed significant effectiveness with Level I or strong evidence for local anesthetic with steroids and Level II to I or moderate to strong evidence with local anesthetic alone.

### Effectiveness of pregabalin for treatment of chronic cervical radiculopathy with upper limb radiating pain: an 8-week, multicenter prospective observational study in Japanese primary care settings [^114G5JBN]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

This study should be interpreted in light of some limitations. As an observational, open-label, nonrandomized design in which the treating physician chose the treatment practices based on best clinical judgment, the potential for bias in treatment selection cannot be ruled out. Differences in the baseline characteristics of the two treatment arms, including higher levels of baseline pain in the pregabalin group compared with the usual care arm, may suggest a slight bias in physicians prescribing pregabalin for patients with higher levels of pain. This trend has been previously noted in a non-interventional study involving pregabalin in NeP. In addition, patients may have been susceptible to treatment bias if they had prior expectations about the efficacy of pregabalin. The Japanese patients in the current study were required to have moderate-to-severe chronic cervical pain with radiating upper limb NeP to be eligible for enrollment into the study, which limits the generalizability of the results to other patient groups or pain types. Pregabalin has been approved in Japan for the treatment of chronic NeP and pain associated with fibromyalgia, and our observations should be considered in light of the population and pain modality under study. One study of acute sciatica in Australian patients suggests pregabalin is not effective at reducing acute pain, nor in other types of lumbar radial pain. Whereas other studies have demonstrated the efficacy of pregabalin, in combination with other agents, in NeP associated with nerve compression, including one small study of chronic sciatica in Australian patients. These observations collectively highlight the complexity of NeP, and the need for more high-quality studies to confirm the efficacy of specific drug combinations in different patient populations. Finally, this study could not measure or draw conclusions about the pharmacologically mediated effects of pregabalin due to patients being able to carry on receiving concomitant analgesic medications during the study. However, pregabalin was evaluated relative to other analgesic treatments, reflecting a usual-care approach to pain management in Japan. The efficacy/safety outcomes are the simple reflection of the real-world treatment choice physicians made, and additional RCTs, which captures dose information about the comparator arm, would be required if we want to validate the outcome of these two treatment approaches.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115biusW]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discectomy versus epidural steroid injections

Two trials compared the effectiveness of discectomy with epidural steroid injections. Very low to low certainty of evidence showed that discectomy reduced leg pain at all time points. The effect was large at immediate term (medium difference −27.0 (95% confidence interval −34.8 to −19.2)), moderate at short term (−15.1 (−23.5 to −6.7)) and medium term (−14.8 (−28.3 to −1.3)), and small at long term (−7.3 (−14.4 to −0.3)).

Compared with epidural steroid injections, discectomy provided moderate effects on disability at short term, but had no effects at medium and long term. For back pain, small effects were observed at short and medium term and no effect at long term (table 3 and supplemental file 13). No trials reported outcomes for quality of life and treatment satisfaction.

Other surgical procedures

Three trials compared plasma disc decompression with non-surgical treatment. Very low to low certainty evidence showed that plasma disc decompression reduced leg pain at the immediate and long term (moderate effects), but had no effect at short term (supplemental files 6, 14a); and reduced disability at immediate, short, and long term (moderate to large effects; supplemental files 7, 14b). Compared with epidural steroid injections, plasma disc decompression resulted in moderate to large effects on leg pain and disability at the immediate, short, and medium term (low certainty evidence; supplemental files 6, 7, and 15). Outcomes for quality of life and treatment satisfaction are presented in supplemental file 8.

Chemonucleolysis

Two trials compared chemonucleolysis using condoliase with placebo. Low certainty evidence indicated moderate effects on leg pain at all time points, and small effects on disability at short and long term (supplemental file 16).

Five trials investigated the effectiveness or efficacy of chemonucleolysis with chymopapain compared with placebo (n = 4)or manipulative therapy (n = 1). Very low to low certainty evidence indicated (except for chemonucleolysis with chymopapain versus placebo at immediate term) that this treatment combination did not reduce leg pain, disability, and back pain in any time points specified (supplemental files 17 and 18). Other outcomes are presented in supplemental file 8.

### The use of lumbar epidural / transforaminal steroids for managing spinal disease [^114ex1Pc]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Lumbar epidural steroid injections are used to manage low back and leg pain (ie, sciatica). Utilization of the procedure is increasing, with Medicare spending for lumbar epidural procedures topping $175 million annually. Few prospective randomized controlled trials have clearly demonstrated the efficacy of epidural steroid injections; many have shown conflicting results. Several studies show favorable short-term outcomes with epidural steroid injection for radicular pain, but less conclusive results are achieved > 6 months. Methodologic flaws limit interpretation of results from most scientific studies. As a tool for predicting surgical outcome, epidural spinal injection has been found to have a sensitivity between 65% and 100%, a specificity between 71% and 95%, and a positive predictive value as high as 95% for 1-year surgical outcome. Despite inconclusive evidence, when weighing the surgical alternatives and associated risk, cost, and outcomes, lumbar epidural steroid injections are a reasonable nonsurgical option in select patients.

### Comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of cochrane review of epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica [^1175azPX]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidural injections are among the most commonly performed procedures for managing low back and lower extremity pain. Pinto et al and Chou et al previously performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which, along with a recent update from Oliveira et al showing the lack of effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and radiculopathy. In contrast to these papers, multiple other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have supported the effectiveness and use of epidural injections utilizing fluoroscopically guided techniques. A major flaw in the review can be related to attributing active-controlled trials to placebo-controlled trials. The assumption that local anesthetics do not provide sustained benefit, despite extensive evidence that local anesthetics provide long-term relief, similar to a combination of local anesthetic with steroids is flawed.

Study Design

The Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy were reanalyzed using systematic methodology and meta-analysis.

Objectives

To re-evaluate Cochrane data on RCTs of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy utilizing qualitative and quantitative techniques with dual-arm and single-arm analysis.

Methods

In this systematic review, we have used the same RCTs from the Cochrane Review of a minimum of 20% change in pain scale or significant pain relief of ≥ 50%. The outcome measures were pain relief and functional status improvement. Significant improvement was defined as 50% or greater pain relief and functional status improvement. Our review was performed utilizing the Cochrane Review methodologic quality assessment and the Interventional Pain Management Techniques - Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB). Evidence was summarized utilizing the principles of best evidence synthesis and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system. Clinical relevance of the pragmatic nature of each study was assessed.

Results

In evaluating the RCTs in the Cochrane Review, 10 trials were performed with fluoroscopic guidance. Utilizing conventional dual-arm and single-arm meta-analysis, the evidence is vastly different from the interpretation of the data within the Cochrane Review. The overall combined evidence is Level I, or strong evidence, at one and 3 months, and Level II, or moderate evidence, at 6 and 12 months.

Limitations

The limitation of this study is that only data contained in the Cochrane Review were analyzed.

Conclusion

A comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of the Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy yielded different results. This review, based on the evidence derived from placebo-controlled trials and active-controlled trials showed Level I, or strong evidence, at one and 3 months and Level II at 6 and 12 months. This review once again emphasizes the importance of the allocation of studies to placebo-control and active-control groups, utilizing standards of practice with inclusion of only the studies performed under fluoroscopic guidance.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^112GDcim]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

There is considerable uncertainty about the clinical effectiveness of epidurals in sciatica compared with surgery for treatment of herniated lumbar disc. However, transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI), a newer and more precise treatment option, offered promise given that it can deliver the drug in a closer proximity to the site of pathology. We searched PubMed using the term "sciatica epidural steroid" immediately before the initial development of the NERVES protocol in 2013–14 and found that previous evidence supporting TFESI had come from cohort studies or single-centre studies, without clear specification of the non-surgical treatments provided. A meta-analysis from 2015 suggested that non-opioid analgesia, TFESI, and surgery were effective management options for sciatica secondary to uncomplicated herniated lumbar disc. However, the effectiveness of TFESI compared with surgery for herniated lumbar disc was uncertain, leading to wide variation in management guidelines for this common condition.

Added value of this study

NERVES is the first multicentre randomised trial directly comparing surgical microdiscectomy with TFESI on a 1:1 allocation basis as initial invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc. There was no significant difference between TFESI and surgery pathways in clinical outcome, and surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI. Complications of surgery were significant, offsetting any benefits of surgery as an early treatment, whereas only minor adverse events were seen with TFESI.

Implications of all the available evidence

NERVES provides high-quality evidence for a stepwise treatment framework of uncomplicated sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration of up to 12 months. TFESI would be less costly as an initial alternative to surgery for this condition, while achieving similar levels of improved outcomes.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1123ooyB]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Supplementary file 1 shows the protocol deviations.

Data sources and searches

We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Back and Neck Group's trial register (through CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform from inception to 23 February 2021. The search strategies were developed and piloted by the review team for bibliographic databases and clinical trial registries using medical subject headings or Emtree and text words for "low back pain", "randomised controlled trials", and "spasmolytic muscle relaxant medicines" (see supplementary files 2 and 3). We searched the reference lists from retrieved full text articles and previous systematic reviews. Searches were also done through PROSPERO for any ongoing or recently completed systematic reviews.

Eligibility criteria

Records of randomised controlled trials were included that allocated adults (≥ 18 years) with non-specific low back painto receive a systemically administered dose of a spasmolytic muscle relaxantcompared with a non-active control group (sham (placebo) drug, continuation of usual care, waiting list, or no treatment). We also included randomised controlled trials that investigated the combination of two drugs compared with one drug alone (eg, tizanidine and ibuprofen versus ibuprofen). Drugs had to be classified as muscle relaxants, listed on the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, and licensed in the US (Food and Drug Administration), Europe (European Medicines Agency), or Australia (Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods) as at 29 March 2019 (see supplementary file 4). Trials reported in English, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, and Dutch were included. We did not restrict the inclusion of trials by the duration of low back pain reported, trial publication status, outcomes reported, or instrument used to assess outcomes. Trials were excluded that investigated suspended muscle relaxants or those not currently licensed in the US, Europe, or Australia, reported in other languages, and sampled participants with specific spinal conditions (eg, infection, neoplasm, inflammatory disease, or fracture)or with sciatica. We excluded trials that sampled multiple health conditions unless separate data were available for the participants with non-specific low back pain.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^113yXFzx]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herniated lumbar disc resulting in back and leg pain travelling below the knee, sciatica, or radiculopathy is a worldwide burden to society. The condition affects an estimated 11% of patients presenting to their primary-care provider worldwide, with an annual prevalence estimated to be 2.2%. Generally, outcomes are favourable and 80% of patients improve with conservative care within 12–24 months. However, given that patients affected by this condition are typically aged 40–45 years, there is a risk of loss of livelihood if it is not managed promptly.

Treatment options have been considered by various expert-led guidelines, but no consensus exists for transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) due to a scarcity of class I evidence. Generally, once analgesia and lifestyle-modifying treatments have failed, steroid nerve root injections and surgical microdiscectomy are recommended for severe persistent cases. Stepwise care approaches based on treatment with non-opioids have been identified as likely to represent a more cost-effective approach than strategies involving direct referral for disc surgery; however, evidence for a stepwise treatment progression involving TFESI is scarce. Following various randomised trials comparing surgical treatments with non-surgical therapy, surgery is often deemed the most successful treatment option, leading to more than 10 000 discectomy procedures per year in the UK and 190 000 such procedures in the United States. The costs to the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for microdiscectomy (requiring patients to be hospitalised for 2 nights, on average) are approximately £4500 compared with £700 for TFESI.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^1142T83o]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — single infusion intravenous (IV) glucocorticosteroids: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of a single infusion of IV glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy; Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence). In a randomized controlled trial of acute discogenic sciatica, of the 60 patients, 31 received an intravenous bolus of 500 mg of methylprednisolone and 29 received an injection of normal saline, with all patients also receiving standard medical therapy and physical therapy; outcomes were assessed at one, three, 10 and 30 days using VAS sciatica, low back pain and global pain, McGill pain scale, ODI and signs of radicular irritation.

### Modulating neuroplasticity for chronic pain relief: noninvasive neuromodulation as a promising approach [^111pDsfN]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic neuropathic pain is a debilitating neuroplastic disorder that notably impacts the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. This complex condition, encompassing various manifestations, such as sciatica, diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, arises from nerve damage or malfunctions in pain processing pathways and involves various biological, physiological and psychological processes. Maladaptive neuroplasticity, known as central sensitization, plays a critical role in the persistence of chronic neuropathic pain. Current treatments for neuropathic pain include pharmacological interventions (for example, antidepressants and anticonvulsants), invasive procedures (for example, deep brain stimulation) and physical therapies. However, these approaches often have limitations and potential side effects. In light of these challenges, interest in noninvasive neuromodulation techniques as alternatives or complementary treatments for neuropathic pain is increasing. These methods aim to induce analgesia while reversing maladaptive plastic changes, offering potential advantages over conventional pharmacological practices and invasive methods. Recent technological advancements have spurred the exploration of noninvasive neuromodulation therapies, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial ultrasound stimulation, as well as innovative transformations of invasive techniques into noninvasive methods at both the preclinical and clinical levels. Here this review aims to critically examine the mechanisms of maladaptive neuroplasticity in chronic neuropathic pain and evaluate the efficacy of noninvasive neuromodulation techniques in pain relief. By focusing on optimizing these techniques, we can better assess their short-term and long-term effects, refine treatment variables and ultimately improve the quality of neuropathic pain management.

### Traction for low-back pain with or without sciatica [^112aAyAt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Traction has been used to treat low-back pain (LBP), often in combination with other treatments. We included both manual and machine-delivered traction in this review. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1995, and previously updated in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of traction compared to placebo, sham traction, reference treatments and no treatment in people with LBP.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Back Review Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (January 2006 to August 2012), EMBASE (January 2006 to August 2012), CINAHL (January 2006 to August 2012), and reference lists of articles and personal files. The review authors are not aware of any important new randomized controlled trial (RCTs) on this topic since the date of the last search.

Selection Criteria

RCTs involving traction to treat acute (less than four weeks' duration), subacute (four to 12 weeks' duration) or chronic (more than 12 weeks' duration) non-specific LBP with or without sciatica.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. As there were insufficient data for statistical pooling, we performed a descriptive analysis. We did not find any case series that identified adverse effects, therefore we evaluated adverse effects that were reported in the included studies.

Main Results

We included 32 RCTs involving 2762 participants in this review. We considered 16 trials, representing 57% of all participants, to have a low risk of bias based on the Cochrane Back Review Group's 'Risk of bias' tool. For people with mixed symptom patterns (acute, subacute and chronic LBP with and without sciatica), there was low- to moderate-quality evidence that traction may make little or no difference in pain intensity, functional status, global improvement or return to work when compared to placebo, sham traction or no treatment. Similarly, when comparing the combination of physiotherapy plus traction with physiotherapy alone or when comparing traction with other treatments, there was very-low- to moderate-quality evidence that traction may make little or no difference in pain intensity, functional status or global improvement. For people with LBP with sciatica and acute, subacute or chronic pain, there was low- to moderate-quality evidence that traction probably has no impact on pain intensity, functional status or global improvement. This was true when traction was compared with controls and other treatments, as well as when the combination of traction plus physiotherapy was compared with physiotherapy alone. No studies reported the effect of traction on return to work. For chronic LBP without sciatica, there was moderate-quality evidence that traction probably makes little or no difference in pain intensity when compared with sham treatment. No studies reported on the effect of traction on functional status, global improvement or return to work. Adverse effects were reported in seven of the 32 studies. These included increased pain, aggravation of neurological signs and subsequent surgery. Four studies reported that there were no adverse effects. The remaining studies did not mention adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

These findings indicate that traction, either alone or in combination with other treatments, has little or no impact on pain intensity, functional status, global improvement and return to work among people with LBP. There is only limited-quality evidence from studies with small sample sizes and moderate to high risk of bias. The effects shown by these studies are small and are not clinically relevant. Implications for practice To date, the use of traction as treatment for non-specific LBP cannot be motivated by the best available evidence. These conclusions are applicable to both manual and mechanical traction. Implications for research Only new, large, high-quality studies may change the point estimate and its accuracy, but it should be noted that such change may not necessarily favour traction. Therefore, little priority should be given to new studies on the effect of traction treatment alone or as part of a package.

### Cost effectiveness of epidural steroid injections to manage chronic lower back pain [^113piCiB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

An English trial of multiple ESIs for sciatica included around 230 patients. As with the PINE study, these were assessed twice only in the short term, at 3 and at 6 weeks. Against a placebo saline injection, the estimated health gain was even smaller, at 0.006 QALYs per patient, and almost all this accrued at 3 weeks. Again by way of explanation, quality of life outcomes for the sciatica trial were measured using the SF36 instrument, translated to the SF-6D and its associated utilities. There is robust evidence from parallel instrumentation studies that, for a given health improvement, the utility gain when measured using the SF-6D is significantly smaller than when measured by the EQ-5D. Also, and unlike our patients, the sciatica patients were a mixture of chronic and acute, and the health gain amongst the acute patients was smaller. Finally, the sciatica trial was not so much a trial of the procedure as of the active ingredient, because all subjects received an injection.

A common feature of both of these previous trials was that the subjects had no record of successful treatment by ESI. Indeed, previous receipt of an ESI for pain was an explicit exclusion criterion for the sciatica trial. In contrast, all our patients had received ESIs at the Pain Clinic on previous occasions. One of the few areas of agreement in the debate over the efficacy of ESIs is that not all people experiencing chronic back pain respond to treatment. It therefore follows that differential bias in recruitment must also contribute to explaining the differences in findings. Trials requiring subjects to have no experience of ESI in pain relief are more likely to recruit people for whom the technique will prove ineffectual, thereby lowering the average health gain recorded. In contrast, the clientele of any clinic offering routine care will be dominated by patients for whom the treatment is efficacious. Many of the patients unresponsive to ESI, therefore, would have discontinued treatment prior to being recruited into our study.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^114RNjK4]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Summary

Background

The optimal invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc remains controversial, with a paucity of evidence for use of non-surgical treatments such as transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) over surgical microdiscectomy. We aimed to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of these options for management of radicular pain secondary to herniated lumbar disc.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 11 spinal units across the UK. Eligible patients were aged 16–65 years, had MRI-confirmed non-emergency sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration between 6 weeks and 12 months, and had leg pain that was not responsive to non-invasive management. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either TFESI or surgical microdiscectomy by an online randomisation system that was stratified by centre with random permuted blocks. The primary outcome was Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) score at 18 weeks. All randomly assigned participants who completed a valid ODQ at baseline and at 18 weeks were included in the analysis. Safety analysis included all treated participants. Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the EuroQol-5D-5L, Hospital Episode Statistics, medication usage, and self-reported resource-use data. This trial was registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN04820368, and EudraCT, number 2014–002751–25.

Findings

Between March 6, 2015, and Dec 21, 2017, 163 (15%) of 1055 screened patients were enrolled, with 80 participants (49%) randomly assigned to the TFESI group and 83 participants (51%) to the surgery group. At week 18, ODQ scores were 30.02 (SD 24.38) for 63 assessed patients in the TFESI group and 22.30 (19.83) for 61 assessed patients in the surgery group. Mean improvement was 24.52 points (18.89) for the TFESI group and 26.74 points (21.35) for the surgery group, with an estimated treatment difference of −4.25 (95% CI −11.09 to 2.59; p = 0.22). There were four serious adverse events in four participants associated with surgery, and none with TFESI. Compared with TFESI, surgery had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £38 737 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and a 0.17 probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

Interpretation

For patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc, with symptom duration of up to 12 months, TFESI should be considered as a first invasive treatment option. Surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI.

### Periradicular infiltration for sciatica: a randomized controlled trial [^116DHPdQ]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted.

Objectives

To test the efficacy of periradicular corticosteroid injection for sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

The efficacy of epidural corticosteroids for sciatica is controversial. Periradicular infiltration is a targeted technique, but there are no randomized controlled trials of its efficacy.

Methods

In this study 160 consecutive, eligible patients with sciatica who had unilateral symptoms of 1 to 6 months duration, and who never underwent surgery were randomized for double-blind injection with methylprednisolone bupivacaine combination or saline. Objective and self-reported outcome parameters and costs were recorded at baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, at 3 and 6 months, and at 1 year.

Results

Recovery was better in the steroid group at 2 weeks for leg pain (P = 0.02), straight leg raising (P = 0.03), lumbar flexion (P = 0.05), and patient satisfaction (P = 0.03). Back pain was significantly lower in the saline group at 3 and 6 months (P = 0.03 and 0.002, respectively), and leg pain at 6 months (13.5, P = 0.02). Sick leaves and medical costs were similar for both treatments, except for cost of therapy visits and drugs at 4 weeks, which were in favor of the steroid injection (P = 0.05 and 0.005, respectively). By 1 year, 18 patients in the steroid group and 15 in the saline group underwent surgery.

Conclusions

Improvement during the follow-up period was found in both the methylprednisolone and saline groups. The combination of methylprednisolone and bupivacaine seems to have a short-term effect, but at 3 and 6 months, the steroid group seems to experience a "rebound" phenomenon.

NSAIDs v NSAIDs

Five studies compared one type of NSAID with other NSAIDs. Figure 4shows all the comparisons involving different types of NSAIDs. None of these studies showed one NSAID to be better than the other. One study found no difference in overall pain between oral and parenteral administration of meloxicam 15 mg a day.

NSAIDs v other treatments

In three separate trials the NSAID diclofenac (50–75 mg/day) showed no difference in outcomes compared with antidepressantor electroacupuncturebut did worse than caudal epidural injections of corticosteroidsfor pain and disability, specifically in the immediate follow-up (fig 3). In one trial the NSAID ketoprofen (200 mg/day) was no better than a combination of corticosteroids for pain in the immediate follow-up.

Adverse events

Adverse events were investigated in 75% (18/24) of the included trials (table 4); the median number of adverse events (interquartile range) was 17% (10–30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3–23%) for placebo. The rate and type of adverse events reported varied substantially between drugs and between trials for the same medicine.

### Epidural steroid injections compared with gabapentin for lumbosacral radicular pain: multicenter randomized double blind comparative efficacy study [^1123Fy5Z]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The physical, socioeconomic, and psychological impact of low back pain is enormous. Low back pain has been the leading cause of years lost to disability over the past several decades, with a lifetime prevalence that ranges between 50% and 90%. The economic cost is estimated to exceed $100bn a year in the United States (£67bn, €93bn), over half of which can be attributed to lost productivity. Efforts to deal with the worldwide burden posed by low back pain have become an international priority.

The classification of back pain is perhaps the most important distinction for clinicians to make as it influences investigation and treatment decisions at all levels of care. Since the development of validated instruments to categorize low back pain, studies have determined that the proportion of chronic cases that are predominantly neuropathic (that is, sciatica, radicular pain from a herniated disc, or neurogenic claudication from spinal stenosis) ranges between 17% and 55%, with one review finding a median prevalence rate of 41%. Whereas the presence of neuropathic symptoms portends a more negative prognosis for acute episodes, lumbosacral radicular pain might be more responsive to procedural interventions than non-specific back pain.

Observational evaluations of caudal epidural injections — In a high quality study, Sayegh et al evaluated caudal epidural injections containing steroid versus nonsteroid preparations in low back pain and sciatica and concluded that caudal epidural injections containing local anesthetic and steroids or water seem to be effective, with steroid preparations demonstrating better and faster efficacy. The review also notes positive results assessing 183 patients for short-term and long-term relief, while another evaluation by Mathews et al had a small number of patients confounding results.

### A multicentre randomized controlled trial of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica: the WEST study [^111f7x3m]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and predictors of response to lumbar epidural corticosteroid injections (ESI) in patients with sciatica. We performed a 12-month, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in four secondary pain-care clinics in the Wessex Region.

Methods

Two hundred and twenty-eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral sciatica of 1–18 months' duration were randomized to either three lumbar ESIs of triamcinolone acetonide or interligamentous saline injections at intervals of 3 weeks. The main outcome measure was the Oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire (ODQ).

Results

At 3 weeks, the ESI group demonstrated a transient benefit over the placebo group (patients achieving a 75% improvement in ODQ, 12.5 vs 3.7%; number needed to treat, 11.4). No benefit was demonstrated from 6 to 52 weeks. ESIs did not improve physical function, hasten return to work or reduce the need for surgery. There was no benefit of repeated ESIs over single injection. No clinical predictors of response were found. At the end of the study the majority of patients still had significant pain and disability regardless of intervention.

Conclusions

In this pragmatic study, ESIs offered transient benefit in symptoms at 3 weeks in patients with sciatica, but no sustained benefits in terms of pain, function or need for surgery. Sciatica is a chronic condition requiring a multidisciplinary approach. To fully investigate the value of ESIs, they need to be evaluated as part of a multidisciplinary approach.

Sacroiliac joint interventions — complications are described as exceedingly rare, with common issues for intraarticular and periarticular injections relating to needle placement or drug administration; most side effects such as local swelling and pain are short-lived and self-limited, but more serious events may include neural trauma, injection into the intervertebral foramina, hematoma formation, sciatic nerve injury, and infectious complications including intraarticular abscess, systemic infection, and even meningitis; neurolysis-related effects include worsening usual pain, burning or dysesthesias, decreased sensation, allodynia over the denervated area, transient leg pain, persistent leg weakness, and inadvertent lesioning of the sciatic nerve resulting in motor deficits, sensory loss, and possible deafferentation pain.

ASIPP epidural guidelines — Karppinen et al randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a single injection comparing sodium chloride solution versus local anesthetic with steroid followed patients for up to one year and reported that patients who received sodium chloride fared better at 3 months and 6 months, but there was no significant difference at one year; in subgroup analysis of patients with disc protrusions, local anesthetic with steroid had a better efficacy than just sodium chloride, and Karppinen et al also calculated cost effectiveness of periradicular infiltration for sciatica based on subgroup analysis of an RCT, which was noted as types of assessments that never yield appropriate cost effectiveness results. There has been significant related criticism.

Recommendation 5: Patients should be provided with evidence-based information about their expected treatment course, advised to remain active, and given information about self-care options. Recommendation 6: In combination with information and self-care, the use of medications with proven benefits should be considered. Before beginning treatment, physicians should evaluate the severity of the patient's baseline pain and functional deficits and the potential benefits and risks of treatment, including the relative lack of long-term effectiveness and safety data. In most cases, acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line medication options.

Although it is a slightly weaker analgesic than NSAIDs, acetaminophen has a more favorable safety profile and a low cost, which makes it a first-line option for the treatment of acute or chronic back pain. Nonselective NSAIDs are more effective for pain relief, but are associated with gastrointestinal and renovascular risks; therefore, these risk factors should be assessed and the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration is recommended. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against aspirin in the treatment of low back pain. For medications in the skeletal muscle relaxant class, the antispasticity medication tizanidine has been well-studied for low back pain. However, there is little evidence for the effectiveness of baclofen and dantrolene, which are also approved for the treatment of spasticity.

Other skeletal muscle relaxants are an option for short-term pain relief, but medications in this class are associated with adverse effects to the central nervous system, and risk-benefit profiles may vary substantially. Systemic corticosteroids are not recommended. For patients with sciatica or spinal stenosis, there is little evidence for medication recommendations, other than gabapentin, which has also been associated with small, short-term benefits for patients with radiculopathy. There is insufficient evidence to recommend other antiepileptic medications for back pain. The effectiveness of benzodiazepines appears to be similar to that of skeletal muscle relaxants for short-term pain relief of acute or chronic low back pain, but risks include abuse, addiction, and tolerance; a time-limited course of therapy is recommended.
