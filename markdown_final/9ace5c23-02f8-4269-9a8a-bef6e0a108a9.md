## Question

When to repeat elevated serum creatinine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for guidance on when to repeat an elevated serum creatinine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding pre-analytical error. Then, I should classify the clinical context into acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, drug-induced changes, contrast exposure, or outpatient care. Next, I will apply context-specific thresholds and timelines for repeat testing. After that, I need to integrate patient-specific modifiers such as baseline CKD, age, and comorbidities. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm and highlight special scenarios and caveats, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality before acting on it, because pre-analytical and analytical variability can mislead us; I should repeat creatinine within 24–48 hours to verify persistence, and I need to check for hemolysis, assay interference, and whether the patient recently ate a high-protein meal or engaged in strenuous exercise, all of which can artifactually elevate creatinine, so I should correct those issues and repeat the test under steady-state conditions before labeling an AKI or CKD event [^112Boerf].

> Next, I should review the clinical context to anchor urgency and cadence; I will categorize the scenario as suspected AKI, established or suspected CKD, drug-associated creatinine rise, recent iodinated contrast exposure, or an outpatient incidental finding, because each context carries different risks and different recommended monitoring intervals, and I need to ensure I am not mixing AKI timelines with CKD confirmation strategies [^1151kJym] [^115sSaVq].

> For suspected AKI, I need to apply KDIGO thresholds and time windows; if creatinine increased by at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or by at least 1.5 times baseline within 7 days, I should repeat creatinine within 12–24 hours to stage and trend, and I should monitor urine output concurrently because oliguria refines risk stratification and staging, with more frequent checks in unstable patients and consideration of nephrology input if stage 2–3 AKI or high-risk features emerge [^116qEK8z] [^113zXqz7].

> Hold on, I should verify the baseline before I overcall AKI; if there is no reliable baseline, I should obtain historical values or use the earliest in-episode value as a pragmatic baseline, recognizing that back-calculation or imputation can misclassify AKI, so I will document uncertainty and plan serial measurements to clarify trajectory rather than jumping to conclusions [^112Xhksn] [^112gvZAp].

> For CKD evaluation, I must not assume chronicity from a single abnormal eGFR or ACR; I should repeat creatinine with eGFR and ACR in about 2–4 weeks to confirm persistence beyond 3 months, and if CKD is confirmed, I will align monitoring frequency to stage and risk, typically annually for moderate-to-severe CKD, with closer intervals if rapidly changing or if new nephrotoxic exposures occur [^1151kJym] [^1114ry3p].

> Let me consider drug-induced creatinine changes carefully; with renin–angiotensin system blockade, a modest early rise up to about 30% can be hemodynamic and acceptable if potassium is stable, so I should recheck creatinine and potassium 7–14 days after initiation or dose escalation, and only reconsider therapy if the rise exceeds 30% or if hyperkalemia or volume depletion is present, keeping in mind that even small increases can flag higher cardiorenal risk and warrant closer follow-up [^1174eGoT] [^113tVgEZ].

> With calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, I should double-check the monitoring cadence; during the first 3 months, creatinine should be checked every 2 weeks, then monthly if stable, and if creatinine rises by at least 25% from baseline, I should repeat within 2 weeks and consider dose reduction, with a mandatory dose reduction if the rise is at least 50%, and if after two dose adjustments the creatinine does not return within 25% of baseline, I should discontinue the drug [^111Atu6K] [^116NX9rX].

> For deferasirox, I need to ensure I act on defined thresholds; if creatinine increases by 33% or more from the patient's average baseline, I should repeat within 1 week and, if still elevated by 33% or more, reduce the dose by 7 mg/kg, with heightened vigilance during acute illnesses that cause volume depletion and with avoidance of concomitant nephrotoxins [^116rLXJB].

> After iodinated contrast, I should confirm risk and timing; in patients with eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or less, I will arrange follow-up creatinine at 48–72 hours, whereas for eGFR greater than 30 without other major risk factors, routine repeat testing is not necessary, though I will advise patients to seek care if they develop oliguria, edema, or dyspnea, and I will obtain a baseline creatinine before high-risk procedures when feasible [^111aVSmt] [^111q3qmB] [^113JchVg].

> In the outpatient setting, I should not let incidental creatinine rises go unchecked; if I detect an unexplained increase, I will repeat within 1–2 weeks to confirm persistence, recognizing that community-acquired AKI is under-recognized and that failure to close the loop is associated with progression to CKD, so I will also review medications, volume status, and intercurrent illness at the time of repeat testing [^115WFD66].

> I need to ensure patient-specific modifiers refine my thresholds; in patients with baseline CKD, smaller absolute creatinine changes can represent larger GFR losses, so I should interpret relative changes and consider cystatin C or measured GFR when decisions hinge on accurate GFR, whereas in pediatrics, neonatal creatinine reflects maternal levels early and small absolute rises can be meaningful, so I will adjust interpretation and monitoring frequency accordingly [^114MBnvR] [^111NBuLs] [^112HyG5X].

> But wait, what if the creatinine rise reflects a non-GFR determinant rather than true injury; I should double-check for high protein intake, supplements, muscle injury, cimetidine or trimethoprim effects on secretion, and fluid status, and if suspected, I will repeat creatinine after correcting the factor or use alternative filtration markers to avoid misclassification and inappropriate drug dosing changes [^1115dGtK] [^113qXCvM].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway without oversimplifying; first, repeat within 24–48 hours to confirm the elevation and exclude error, then classify the context into AKI, CKD, drug effect, contrast, or outpatient incidental, next apply the context-specific repeat interval and threshold, escalate monitoring frequency with higher risk or instability, and finally, if uncertainty persists, broaden evaluation with cystatin C, measured GFR, urinalysis, and imaging as indicated, documenting rationale at each step [^1151kJym] [^115sSaVq].

> I should double-check special scenarios that often trip us up; after endurance events, creatinine may rise modestly and return to baseline within 48 hours, so a single repeat in 1–2 days is reasonable if the patient is well, whereas in cirrhosis with suspected hepatorenal syndrome, serial creatinine guides therapy and retreatment decisions, and in pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, new hypertension with creatinine above 1.1 mg/dL or a doubling supports severe features, prompting urgent obstetric evaluation [^113iKac9] [^115Hr6nF].

> In summary, I need to ensure that my repeat-testing cadence matches the clinical context: within 12–24 hours for suspected AKI, about 2–4 weeks to confirm CKD, 7–14 days after starting or uptitrating RAS blockade, 48–72 hours after contrast in high-risk patients, every 2 weeks early on for cyclosporine with defined dose actions at 25–50% rises, and within 1 week for deferasirox if creatinine rises 33% or more, all while verifying true change and adjusting for patient-specific factors before making definitive management decisions [^113zXqz7] [^1151kJym] [^111aVSmt] [^111Atu6K] [^116rLXJB].

Repeat an elevated serum creatinine **within 24–48 hours** to confirm true change and exclude lab error or transient causes [^113zXqz7]. If confirmed, **repeat every 48–72 hours** until stable or until the trend is clear, then adjust to the clinical context (e.g. weekly in CKD, after nephrotoxin exposure, or post-contrast) [^1151CoVW] [^111aVSmt]. For chronic CKD, monitor **annually** if stable, or every 3–6 months if progressing or with new therapies [^1114ry3p]. Always interpret changes in light of baseline, comorbidities, and medications, and escalate monitoring if rapid deterioration or high-risk features occur [^112Boerf].

## General principles for repeating elevated serum creatinine

- **Confirmatory testing**: Always repeat an elevated serum creatinine within 24–48 hours to confirm true elevation and exclude laboratory error or transient factors (e.g. dehydration, recent intense exercise, high protein intake) [^113zXqz7] [^115pcTQX].

- **Clinical context**: The frequency of repeat testing depends on the clinical context, including baseline renal function, comorbidities, medications, and the severity of the elevation [^111C45S2].

- **Trend monitoring**: Serial measurements are essential to determine whether the elevation is transient, progressive, or stable, guiding further diagnostic and therapeutic decisions [^113qXCvM].

## Specific clinical scenarios and recommended repeat testing intervals

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended repeat testing interval** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute kidney injury (AKI) | Repeat within 24–48 hours initially, then every 48–72 hours until stable or trend is clear [^notfound] | - Early detection and staging of AKI <br/> - Guide interventions and prevent progression [^112gvZAp] |
| Chronic kidney disease (CKD) | Annually if stable; every 3–6 months if progressing or with new therapies | Monitor progression and adjust therapy [^1114ry3p] [^1125hA23] |
| Nephrotoxic drug exposure (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, aminoglycosides) | Repeat within 3–7 days after initiation or dose change [^notfound] | Detect early renal impairment and adjust therapy [^1174eGoT] |
| Contrast media administration | Repeat at 48–72 hours post-contrast [^111aVSmt] | Detect contrast-induced nephropathy [^1151CoVW] |
| Hemodynamic instability (e.g. sepsis, shock) | Every 12–24 hours until stable [^notfound] | Rapid changes in renal function require close monitoring [^111C45S2] |
| Postoperative patients | Every 24–48 hours for the first week postoperatively | Detect postoperative AKI and guide management [^112gvZAp] |

## Factors influencing the frequency of repeat testing

Several factors **influence how often to repeat** an elevated serum creatinine:

- **Baseline renal function**: Patients with pre-existing CKD may require more frequent monitoring due to higher risk of progression and complications [^1114ry3p].

- **Severity of elevation**: Larger elevations (> 50% from baseline) warrant more frequent monitoring than mild elevations (< 20% from baseline) [^notfound].

- **Clinical stability**: Stable patients may have less frequent monitoring than unstable patients with rapidly changing clinical conditions [^111C45S2].

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and liver disease increase the risk of renal impairment and may necessitate closer monitoring [^notfound].

- **Medications**: Nephrotoxic drugs or those affecting renal hemodynamics (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs) require careful monitoring due to potential renal effects [^1125hA23].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed repeat testing

Delayed repeat testing can have **significant clinical consequences**:

- **Progression of renal impairment**: Unrecognized AKI or CKD progression can lead to irreversible renal damage [^111aLLFH].

- **Increased morbidity and mortality**: Delayed detection of renal impairment is associated with higher risks of adverse outcomes, including mortality and cardiovascular events [^113aLH8Z].

- **Missed therapeutic opportunities**: Delayed recognition may result in missed opportunities for early intervention, such as medication adjustments or nephrology referral [^114YTEht].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial repeat testing**: Repeat within 24–48 hours to confirm elevation and exclude transient factors [^113zXqz7].

- **AKI monitoring**: Repeat every 48–72 hours until stable or trend is clear [^notfound].

- **CKD monitoring**: Annually if stable; every 3–6 months if progressing or with new therapies [^notfound].

- **Nephrotoxic drug exposure**: Repeat within 3–7 days after initiation or dose change [^notfound].

- **Contrast media**: Repeat at 48–72 hours post-contrast [^111aVSmt].

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Every 12–24 hours until stable [^113zXqz7].

- **Postoperative patients**: Every 24–48 hours for the first week postoperatively.

---

Repeat an elevated serum creatinine **within 24–48 hours** to confirm the result, then tailor the frequency to the clinical context, trending every 48–72 hours until stable. For chronic CKD, monitor annually if stable, or every 3–6 months if progressing or with new therapies.

It is advisable to monitor serum creatinine after an increase of the dose of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and after initiation of new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy during Gengraf®treatment.

Blood pressure should be evaluated every 2 weeks during the initial 3 months of therapy and then monthly if the patient is stable, or more frequently when dosage adjustments are made. Patients without a history of previous hypertension before initiation of treatment with Gengraf®, should have the drug reduced by 25% to 50% if found to have sustained hypertension. If the patient continues to be hypertensive despite multiple reductions of Gengraf®, then Gengraf®should be discontinued. For patients with treated hypertension, before the initiation of Gengraf®therapy, their medication should be adjusted to control hypertension while on Gengraf®. Gengraf®should be discontinued if a change in hypertension management is not effective or tolerable.

### Evaluation of short-term changes in serum creatinine level as a meaningful end point in randomized clinical trials [^1177fkY5]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Observational studies have shown that acute change in kidney function (specifically, AKI) is a strong risk factor for poor outcomes. Thus, the outcome of acute change in serum creatinine level, regardless of underlying biology or etiology, is frequently used in clinical trials as both efficacy and safety end points. We performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials to quantify the relationship between positive or negative short-term effects of interventions on change in serum creatinine level and more meaningful clinical outcomes. After a thorough literature search, we included 14 randomized trials of interventions that altered risk for an acute increase in serum creatinine level and had reported between-group differences in CKD and/or mortality rate ≥ 3 months after randomization. Seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, increased risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.89), and seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, reduced risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.74). However, pooled risks for CKD and mortality associated with interventions did not differ from those with placebo in either group. In conclusion, several interventions that affect risk of acute, mild to moderate, often temporary elevation in serum creatinine level in placebo-controlled randomized trials showed no appreciable effect on CKD or mortality months later, raising questions about the value of using small to moderate changes in serum creatinine level as end points in clinical trials.

### Cyclosporine (Neoral) [^116NX9rX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of cyclosporine nephropathy is reduced when the starting dose is low (2.5 mg/kg/day), the maximum dose does not exceed 4.0 mg/kg/day, serum creatinine is monitored regularly while cyclosporine is administered, and the dose of Neoral is decreased when the rise in creatinine is greater than or equal to 25% above the patient's pretreatment level. The increase in creatinine is generally reversible upon timely decrease of the dose of Neoral or its discontinuation.

Serum creatinine and BUN should be evaluated every 2 weeks during the initial 3 months of therapy and then monthly if the patient is stable. If the serum creatinine is greater than or equal to 25% above the patient's pretreatment level, serum creatinine should be repeated within two weeks. If the change in serum creatinine remains greater than or equal to 25% above baseline, Neoral should be reduced by 25% to 50%. If at any time the serum creatinine increases by greater than or equal to 50% above pretreatment level, Neoral should be reduced by 25% to 50%. Neoral should be discontinued if reversibility (within 25% of baseline) of serum creatinine is not achievable after two dosage modifications. It is advisable to monitor serum creatinine after an increase of the dose of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and after initiation of new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy during Neoral treatment.

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome defined by a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output as per KDIGO classification. Future definitions are likely to incorporate novel functional and damage biomarkers to characterise AKI better. Early diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic work-up are essential to determine the underlying aetiology and to identify cases of AKI that require specific and timely therapeutic interventions. The exact diagnostic investigations depend on the clinical context and should include routine baseline tests as well as more specific and novel tools.

Serum creatinine and BUN should be evaluated every 2 weeks during the initial 3 months of therapy and then monthly if the patient is stable. If the serum creatinine is greater than or equal to 25% above the patient's pretreatment level, serum creatinine should be repeated within two weeks. If the change in serum creatinine remains greater than or equal to 25% above baseline, cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be reduced by 25% to 50%. If at any time the serum creatinine increases by greater than or equal to 50% above pretreatment level, cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be reduced by 25% to 50%. Cyclosporine should be discontinued if reversibility (within 25% of baseline) of serum creatinine is not achievable after two dosage modifications. It is advisable to monitor serum creatinine after an increase of the dose of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and after initiation of new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy during cyclosporine capsules (modified) treatment.

Blood pressure should be evaluated every 2 weeks during the initial 3 months of therapy and then monthly if the patient is stable, or more frequently when dosage adjustments are made. Patients without a history of previous hypertension before initiation of treatment with cyclosporine capsules (modified), should have the drug reduced by 25% to 50% if found to have sustained hypertension. If the patient continues to be hypertensive despite multiple reductions of cyclosporine capsules (modified), then cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be discontinued. For patients with treated hypertension, before the initiation of cyclosporine capsules (modified) therapy, their medication should be adjusted to control hypertension while on cyclosporine capsules (modified). Cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be discontinued if a change in hypertension management is not effective or tolerable.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^111cJLNg]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

CKD detection and testing — KDOQI US commentary agrees with KDIGO practice points, noting that an analysis of over 27 million individuals across 114 international cohorts highlighted the graded and additive associations of lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria with 10 important cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. The KDOQI Work Group agrees with the practice points that endorse both UACR and eGFR for CKD testing, with confirmatory repeat testing in those found incidentally to have elevated UACR or low eGFR, and while they agree that cystatin C should be combined with Scr to provide the most reliable estimation of GFR, if these results are readily available to impact critical medical or medication-related decision making, both Scr (cr) and cystatin C (cys) should be obtained at the same time and used to estimate the GFR (eGFRcr-cys).

### Changes in renal function associated with oral emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate use for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^113YK221]. AIDS (2014). Low credibility.

Creatinine elevations confirmed at consecutive visits were more frequent in the treatment arm (7 vs. 1), but rare overall (7/1248 or 0.6%): The number needed to harm, defined as a confirmed creatinine elevation including elevations that remain in the normal range, was approximately 166. The risk of adverse renal outcomes was readily managed with every 12-week serum creatinine testing. This study indicates that TDF use in PrEP may lead to mild and subclinical decline in CrCl without proximal tubular dysfunction.

These findings support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention interim guidance that oral FTC/TDF PrEP should include monitoring of serum creatinine. Monitoring BUN, serum phosphate, and urine-derived parameters of proximal tubulopathy had no discernible value. We advise repeating the abnormal serum creatinine measurements on a separate specimen before discontinuing FTC/TDF because the majority of elevations are self-limited. The safety and optimal monitoring frequency for oral FTC/TDF PrEP users having risk factors for renal dysfunction warrants evaluation.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114mzS29]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary — definition, staging, screening, and risk factors for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI): The first recommendation is that contrast-induced AKI be defined and staged using the KDIGO definition and staging criteria, while noting that most clinical studies have used thresholds including increments in serum creatinine level of ≥ 25% or ≥ 50% relative to baseline and/or an absolute change in serum creatinine level ≥ 0.5 mg/dL within 2–5 days following iodinated contrast media. The applicability of the urine output criteria to the diagnosis and staging for this form of AKI is uncertain and most episodes of contrast-induced AKI are nonoliguric. For pre-procedure risk identification, measuring serum creatinine prior to all contrast-enhanced procedures is neither practical nor feasible; simple questionnaires have been shown to be effective for identifying patients at higher risk of abnormal underlying renal function, and in patients without a recent serum creatinine measurement it is reasonable to use such questionnaires to identify patients who should have serum creatinine measured prior to contrast administration. Additional risk factors to recognize include diabetes in the setting of renal impairment, heart failure, repeated contrast exposure over short periods, and concomitant nephrotoxin administration (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aminoglycosides).

### Acute kidney injury associated with endurance events-is it a cause for concern? A systematic review [^113iKac9]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A growing body of evidence suggests even small rises in serum creatinine (SCr) are of considerable clinical relevance. Given that participants in endurance events are exposed to potential (repeated) renal insults, a systematic review was undertaken to collate current evidence for acute kidney injury (AKI), complicating such events.

Methods

A systematic review of studies and case reports meeting inclusion criteria on Medline and EMBASE (inception to October 2015). Included: studies with markers of renal function before and after endurance or ultraendurance events; case reports of severe AKI. Two reviewers assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

Results

Eleven case report publications (n = 27 individuals) of severe AKI, were retrieved, with risk factors including systemic illness or nephrotoxic medications usually identified. From 30 studies of endurance and ultraendurance events, mean rise in SCr was 29 (± 12.3) µmol/L after marathon or ultramarathon (17 studies, n = 568 participants) events. Where follow-up tests were conducted, SCr returned to baseline within 48hours. Rises in biomarkers suggest potential parenchymal insult, rather than simply muscle breakdown. However, evidence of long-term deleterious effects is lacking.

Conclusions

Raised levels of SCr are reported immediately after endurance events. It is not clear whether this is either clinically significant, or if repeated participation predisposes to long-term sequelae. The aetiology of severe exercise-associated AKI is usually multifactorial, with risk factors generally identified in the rare cases reported. On-site biochemistry, urine analysis and biomarkers of AKI may help identify collapsed runners who are at significant short-term risk and allow suitable follow-up.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, choice of test, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to repeat tests to confirm the presence of CKD in case of incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, hematuria, or low eGFR.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to baseline renal function testing, ERBP 2012 guidelines recommend to use the first documented serum creatinine value of the episode as 'baseline' rather than historical creatinine values or a calculated value based on a presumed GFR of 75 mL/min.

### Do acute elevations of serum creatinine in primary care engender an increased mortality risk? [^111TPLVL]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first to describe the survival outcome associated with acute elevations in SCr occurring entirely in primary care without subsequent non-elective admission to hospital. However there have been a small number of in-hospital studies that have compared community acquired AKI (CA-AKI) with Hospital acquired (HA-AKI) which have found that number of CA-AKI was higher than HA- AKI on a ratio 3:1. The incidence of acute elevations in SCr fulfilling AKIN criteria in our study population was estimated to be 14,132 per million adult population per year (pmap/yr) which is similar in comparison to a contemporaneous in-patient study of the same population, which estimated an in-hospital incidence of 15,352 pmap/yr. This implies that in total 5% of the adult population of East Kent have experienced an acute elevation in SCr fulfilling AKIN criteria during the study time period. Although the majority of the acute elevations in SCr in managed in primary care were skewed to AKI 1 than in other in-hospital studies.

We have been careful to describe these acute elevations in SCr as fulfilling AKIN creatinine criteria rather than defined as AKI because it was not possible to fulfil the time constraints for either the AKIN or RIFLE definitions of AKI because blood tests in the community are seldom repeated within 48 hours. Instead we used the methodology described by La France and Miller 21 which extends the time to reference creatinine to 12 months. Whilst this may increase the incidence of acute elevations in SCr corresponding to AKIN stage 1, relative to time to baseline creatinine, the evidence suggests that such small rises have a significant adverse effect on outcome in hospital inpatients. However, in model 7 and 8 we adjusted the analysis for time to baseline in months. Despite the fact that this showed each months increase had a very small significant effect on reducing the risk of mortality, this is unlikely to have large impact on outcome (Table 7).

KDOQI commentary — serum creatinine change threshold and CKD versus pediatrics: An absolute change in serum creatinine level of 0.3 mg/dL may be relatively inconsequential for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD), whereas in neonatal/pediatric patients such small changes may represent relatively large changes in actual GFR that should not be disregarded.

Evaluation of CKD — detection of CKD: Practice points state to "Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurement and assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR)", and, after incidental abnormalities, to "repeat tests to confirm presence of CKD" when "elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria, or low estimated GFR (eGFR)" are detected.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^114MBnvR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) evaluation — serum creatinine–based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in adults recommends using serum creatinine and a GFR estimating equation for initial assessment, and recommends that clinicians use a GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum creatinine (eGFRcreat) rather than relying on the serum creatinine concentration alone; laboratories should measure serum creatinine using a specific assay traceable to international standard reference materials, report eGFRcreat in addition to the serum creatinine concentration in adults, and report eGFRcreat in adults using the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation; when reporting eGFRcreat, it should be reported and rounded to the nearest whole number and relative to a body surface area of 1.73 m2 in adults using the units ml/min/1.73 m2, and eGFRcreat levels less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 should be reported as "decreased"; additional tests (such as cystatin C or a clearance measurement) are suggested for confirmatory testing in specific circumstances when eGFR based on serum creatinine is less accurate.

### Biomarker explorations in acute kidney injury: the journey continues [^112zmfSx]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Determining whether an elevation in serum creatinine represents structural damage or a reversible functional change is a dilemma that clinicians encounter frequently. The emergence of kidney-specific biomarkers offers an opportunity to improve our discriminatory ability. Singer et al. provide new information on the utility of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) to distinguish pre-renal from established acute kidney injury.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^113tVgEZ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and implications

In routine primary care, most patients starting treatment with an ACEI/ARB have only minor changes in renal function. However, increases in creatinine concentrations of more than 10% after starting ACEI/ARB treatment affect more than 15% of patients and have important implications. We have shown that creatinine increases after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment were associated with cardiorenal risks in a "dose-response" relation, with no distinct cut-off at 30%, as previously suggested. Further investigation is needed to ascertain whether ACEI/ARB associated changes in renal function unmask underlying pathophysiology or lead directly to adverse outcomes by causing permanent renal impairment in some patients. In addition, a better understanding of the overall risk-benefit ratio of continuing treatment after loss of kidney function for different prescribing indications is needed. Most importantly, patients with substantial increases in creatinine after starting ACEI/ARB treatment should be recognised as a very high risk group needing close ongoing monitoring. Review is needed of the risks and potential benefits of continuation of drug treatment for the specific prescribing indication for each patient.

### Are small changes in serum creatinine an important risk factor? [^113aLH8Z]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Serum creatinine levels are strongly associated with longitudinal risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Recent studies addressed whether worsening renal function - defined by small increases in creatinine - is independently associated with adverse outcomes. This review evaluates the recent literature on worsened renal function as an independent risk factor.

Recent Findings

Studies have evaluated worsening renal function as a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in three settings: cardiac surgery patients, hospitalized heart failure patients, and ambulatory coronary artery disease patients. Small creatinine changes following cardiac surgery were strongly associated with mortality risk. One study found a J-shaped association between 48 h post surgery creatinine change and 30-day mortality risk. Compared with patients with creatinine decreases of 0–0.3 mg/dl, patients with creatinine increases less than 0.5 mg/dl had a twofold adjusted mortality risk and those with creatinine increases of at least 0.5 mg/dl had a nearly sixfold mortality risk; surprisingly those with decreases over 0.3 mg/dl had a twofold adjusted risk. Worsening renal function was also a strong predictor of mortality for hospitalized heart failure patients independent of baseline creatinine; the magnitude of creatinine rise appeared to be linearly associated with mortality risk. However, one study found no independent association between worsening renal function and cardiovascular or mortality risk over longer follow-up.

Summary

Acute elevations in serum creatinine had a linear association with increased risk for adverse outcomes among patients hospitalized for cardiac surgery or heart failure. Future studies should determine interventions to prevent and treat in-hospital worsening renal function to reduce the risk for adverse outcomes.

### Biological markers of acute kidney injury [^117PdxEu]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

An abrupt change in serum creatinine, the most common indicator of acute kidney injury (AKI), is strongly linked to poor outcomes across multiple clinical settings. Despite endless attempts to distill the magnitude and timing of a changing serum creatinine into a standardized metric, singular focus on this traditional functional marker obligates the characterization of AKI to remain, at best, retrospective and causally noninformative. The resultant inability to meaningfully segregate critical aspects of injury such as type, onset, propagation, and recovery from ongoing decrements in renal function has hindered successful translation of promising therapeutics. Over the past decade, however, the emerging field of clinical proteomics reinvigorates hope of identifying novel plasma and urine biomarkers to characterize cause and course of kidney injury. Efforts to validate these markers for use in clinical studies now show early promise but face important obstacles including interpretive difficulties inherent in using serum creatinine as a sole comparator for diagnostic performance, a need to better evaluate the incremental performance of new markers above established clinical and biochemical predictors, a relative lack of power to sufficiently examine hard clinical end points, and a potential over-reliance on use alone of receiver operating curves for assessing biomarker utility. Here, we discuss efforts to address these barriers and further ascertain the clinical value of new markers.

### Recent developments in the detection and management of acute kidney injury [^1147Qg45]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Creatinine as an AKI biomarker

The diagnosis of AKI has traditionally relied on measurements of serum creatinine (SCr) as a marker of GFR and/or monitoring of urine output. However, SCr is a poor biomarker for AKI and there is no consensus AKI definition, as illustrated by the existence of more than 30 definitions in the published literature. Two of the most widely used definitions for paediatric AKI are the paediatric Risk or renal dysfunction, Injury to the kidney, Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage renal disease (pRIFLE) and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications (figure 1). The use of muscle-derived creatinine as a biomarker for AKI is based on the observation that it is freely filtered by the healthy glomerulus, but creatinine filtration becomes less efficient as renal damage increases in severity, and SCr levels rise as a consequence. However, 'normal' baseline SCr varies widely due to many interindividual variables including muscle mass, age and sex.SCr is also a late and insensitive marker of renal damage; levels only rise significantly once 25–50% of renal function has been lostand there is a temporal dissociation between reduced GFR and increased SCr. Furthermore, relatively small changes in SCr levels may reflect significant pathology: in a study involving children with acute decompensated heart failure, an inhospital SCr increase of > 27 µmol/L was independently associated with increased patient mortality, and need for mechanical ventilation. Other limitations of SCr measurements include a poor correlation with GFR outside of steady-state filtration (GFR changes rapidly during AKI), and the dissociation between renal function and SCr in patients receiving dialysis (dialysis removes creatinine). Additionally, in diseases such as lupus nephritis, significant kidney injury can coexist with preserved GFR and maintenance of a normal SCr. The lack of consensus regarding the definition of AKI is problematic, as it has led to a wide variation in reported epidemiological, and morbidity and mortality data. As SCr-based methods of monitoring renal function often hamper timely diagnosis of AKI, this may also partially explain the repeated failure of novel therapeutic interventions for AKI, as significant disease progression has already occurred by the time the trial therapy is administered.

### Do acute elevations of serum creatinine in primary care engender an increased mortality risk? [^115bXUTo]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study suggests patients who develop acute SCr elevations in primary care and are not subsequently admitted to hospital have a significantly increased mortality compared to those whose SCr is stable. The increased mortality appears to be temporally associated with the acute SCr elevation, i.e. within 30 days, suggesting a direct association between the event and adverse outcome. This association persists even after multiple adjustments for potential confounders. Further studies are required to examine the potential causal association between these events in primary care and poor outcome. Clearly if there is a causal relationship this would be an important area in which to intervene.

2.5 Dose Modifications for Decreases in Renal Function While on JADENU

JADENU is contraindicated in patients with eGFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].

For decreases in renal function while receiving JADENU [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], modify the dose as follows:

Transfusional Iron Overload

Adults:

If the serum creatinine increases by 33% or more above the average baseline measurement, repeat the serum creatinine within 1 week, and if still elevated by 33% or more, reduce the dose by 7 mg per kg.

Pediatric Patients (ages 2 years–17 years):

Reduce the dose by 7 mg per kg if eGFR decreases by greater than 33% below the average baseline measurement and repeat eGFR within 1 week.
Interrupt JADENU for acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor more frequently. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal. Avoid use of other nephrotoxic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
In the setting of decreased renal function, evaluate the risk benefit profile of continued JADENU use. Use the minimum effective JADENU dose and monitor renal function more frequently, by evaluating tubular and glomerular function. Titrate dosing based on renal injury. Consider dose reduction or interruption and less nephrotoxic therapies until improvement of renal function. If signs of renal tubular or glomerular injury occur in the presence of other risk factors such as volume depletion, reduce or interrupt JADENU to prevent severe and irreversible renal injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Acute kidney injury in critical care: time for a paradigm shift? [^11517ZeP]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute alterations in renal function are commonly encountered in various settings with varied clinical manifestations ranging from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure. Our knowledge of human acute kidney injury has been fairly stagnant, until recently largely limited by a lack of concerted efforts in the field. This review summarizes the recent advances and provides an overview of emerging trends in this field.

Recent Findings

One of the limitations in our knowledge of human acute kidney injury has been the lack of a standardized definition and staging criteria for this disorder. New information on the epidemiology and outcomes of acute kidney injury has emerged providing an opportunity to reappraise our approach to this disease. Also, there has been new work on the relationship of alterations of renal function to short and long-term outcomes, particularly mortality.

Summary

To translate advances from basic research to clinical application a multidisciplinary approach is required. New research in the field of biomarkers combined with clinical markers will lead to therapies that can be introduced earlier in the course of the disease and, hopefully, lead to a decrease in mortality from this potentially reversible condition.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^115bTM7k]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Many post hoc analyses of clinical trials have examined the prognostic significance of a deterioration in renal function after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment. In clinical trials of patients with heart failure, deterioration in renal function after starting ACEI/ARB treatment is commonly found. Although this deterioration is associated with a poorer prognosis compared with patients with preserved renal function, the overall benefits of ACEI/ARB treatment compared with placebo remain for cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Our study does not undermine that evidence but flags that the risk-benefit ratio may differ among patients with marked changes in creatinine concentrations. This is particularly the case for other prescribing indications for which the clinical trial evidence is less clear.

The recommendation in many international guidelines to stop ACEI/ARB treatment if creatinine rises by 30% or more after initiation are founded on a single review of 12 clinical trials of ACEI/ARB treatment for diabetes and heart failure. Studies included in this review evaluated progression of renal disease among patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Of these studies, only six were double blinded and included a total of 1102 participants. These trials were published during 1993–97 and may not relate to patients receiving contemporary routine clinical care. The methods that define a cut-off level of creatinine increase at 30% for cessation are not clearly presented. In addition, the results provided by these studies are not supported by later trials. Recent reviews have not shown the superiority of ACEI/ARBs compared with other antihypertensive drugs for treating early non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, diabetes with normal renal function, and diabetes and chronic kidney disease. A UK multicentre interventional trial to compare the outcomes of continuation versus cessation of ACEI/ARB treatment is under way in response to observational evidence that stopping ACEI/ARB treatment may slow progression in advanced renal disease.

A fixed recommendation to stop ACEI/ARB treatment only if creatinine is increased by 30% or more is also hard to reconcile with the growing body of evidence related to acute kidney injury, which shows that even a small deterioration in renal function is associated with a subsequently increased risk of mortality and other adverse outcomes. It is important to consider that the prognostic significance of ACEI/ARB associated renal impairment may depend on the underlying cause and on subsequent changes in renal function if ACEI/ARB treatment is continued. Underlying causes may be different in the routine care setting, in which patients are older, have multiple comorbidities, and have more advanced kidney disease compared with patients who participated in early clinical trials.

### Imperfect gold standards for kidney injury biomarker evaluation [^114PbobT]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Clinicians have used serum creatinine in diagnostic testing for acute kidney injury for decades, despite its imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Novel tubular injury biomarkers may revolutionize the diagnosis of acute kidney injury; however, even if a novel tubular injury biomarker is 100% sensitive and 100% specific, it may appear inaccurate when using serum creatinine as the gold standard. Acute kidney injury, as defined by serum creatinine, may not reflect tubular injury, and the absence of changes in serum creatinine does not assure the absence of tubular injury. In general, the apparent diagnostic performance of a biomarker depends not only on its ability to detect injury, but also on disease prevalence and the sensitivity and specificity of the imperfect gold standard. Assuming that, at a certain cutoff value, serum creatinine is 80% sensitive and 90% specific and disease prevalence is 10%, a new perfect biomarker with a true 100% sensitivity may seem to have only 47% sensitivity compared with serum creatinine as the gold standard. Minimizing misclassification by using more strict criteria to diagnose acute kidney injury will reduce the error when evaluating the performance of a biomarker under investigation. Apparent diagnostic errors using a new biomarker may be a reflection of errors in the imperfect gold standard itself, rather than poor performance of the biomarker. The results of this study suggest that small changes in serum creatinine alone should not be used to define acute kidney injury in biomarker or interventional studies.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114QCpNE]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) definition — small changes in serum creatinine: The AKIN definition was based on evidence that minor fluctuations in serum creatinine concentration were strongly associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized individuals, with the association remaining, albeit attenuated, after multivariate adjustment. Subsequent studies have identified small changes in serum creatinine to be prognostically important, and even a 0.1-mg/dL increase appears to be associated with increased risk compared to no change. However, whether these small changes reflect clinically meaningful kidney function fluctuations or are merely markers of underlying conditions remains unresolved, and an implicit assumption is that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in an individual is constant over time and not subject to physiologic fluctuation.

### Detecting chronic kidney disease in population-based administrative databases using an algorithm of hospital encounter and physician claim codes [^117Kfkuu]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Kidney function laboratory values (Reference standard)

GFR was estimated from serum creatinine using the CKD-EPI equation. We chose the most recent serum creatinine value from any setting prior to the outpatient prescription as our test value. If this value was done while a patient was in hospital, this was the most recent value prior to discharge (which helps avoid temporary elevated serum creatinine values due to acute kidney injury where physicians wait for resolution prior to hospital discharge).

Although a recently revised staging system for CKD does exist its use in the elderly remains controversial. Nonetheless, stage IIIb CKD or more is defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and is accepted as a clinically important reduction in kidney function in elderly patients. Furthermore, when creatinine tests are repeated, eGFR values < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 in the outpatient setting are more stable compared to higher eGFR values. For these reasons we selected our primary threshold to define CKD as an eGFR < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. However, in additional analyses we also examined thresholds of < 60 and < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. We used thresholds rather than mutually exclusive groups to mimic how inferences about the types of patients detected by the algorithm will be made in practice.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality.

Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, and increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians and other healthcare professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^112gvZAp]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

It remains unclear how to best determine baseline kidney function. What constitutes a baseline serum creatinine level is controversial and inconsistently defined. It would be ideal to have prior serum creatinine or GFR measurements widely available through electronic medical records, but this is not current practice in many parts of the world. Prior serum creatinine or GFR measures may also further elucidate the risk of AKI in patients considered at high risk on the basis of either comorbidity or an intervention. There is controversy about whether an acute decrease in serum creatinine level indicates AKI that has already occurred, and more research is needed in this area. For example, small declines in serum creatinine level need to be interpreted with caution because they may be the result of acute changes in creatinine production or volume of distribution. After a timed insult (e.g. coronary angiography, elective surgery, nephrotoxic drug exposure), serum creatinine level should be measured at an appropriate time, allowing for AKI to manifest. After AKI onset, serum creatinine level should be measured during follow-up as necessary for clinical management and care transitions (e.g. transfer to and from intensive care) and for determining changes in AKI staging and classification (AKI vs. AKD), including onset of CKD at 90 days.

How urine output should be evaluated is also an area that needs further investigation to avoid variability in reporting of AKI incidence (i.e. use of actual or ideal body weight, strict time period vs. time-averaged values). Future guidelines should address how differences in body composition (overweight, fluid overload) affect the interpretation of urine output, and whether these differences need to be considered in regard to the thresholds for AKI. Similarly, fluid status should be considered when evaluating for AKI. Fluid overload is associated with increased mortality and AKI, and it may impact the diagnosis of AKI through its impact on the volume of distribution of serum creatinine. Although there are research methods to define fluid overload, these are not routinely used in clinical practice, and it is unclear whether there is sufficient evidence to define a clinical threshold for fluid overload. In the next AKI guideline, fluid overload should be defined operationally through a rigorous literature review.

They note "the lack of correlation between serum creatinine level and GFR in the acute setting", such that increases in serum creatinine can yield "apparent progression in AKI stage, despite improvement in GFR", and describe the recommendations as "relatively nonspecific and unlikely to help in daily clinical practice". They caution that "development of clinical action plans based on AKI stage may result in inappropriate protocolization of care", and cite examples where "waiting until stage 2 AKI to check for changes in drug dosing" is implied and recommendations to consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) and "intensive care unit admission in stage 2 AKI seem premature". They also "agree with the emphasis on close postdischarge clinical evaluation of patients with moderate to severe AKI".

### Assessment and diagnosis of renal dysfunction in the ICU [^117H2XCL]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Identifying patients with impaired renal function is crucial in the setting of critical illness. Serum creatinine serves as the gold standard for assessing steady-state renal function, helping to define those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although these baseline creatinine values are often not available in the setting of critical illness, CKD, whether defined by serum creatinine or proteinuria, increases the risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI). Despite delays in elevations following renal insults, serum creatinine remains the standard for assessing acute changes in renal function. Standardized definitions of AKI, using changes in serum creatinine and urine output, have informed the epidemiology of ICU-acquired AKI and have helped define the long-term outcomes in patients who experience AKI. A complex cyclical interplay exists between AKI and CKD, in which CKD predisposes patients to an increased risk of AKI, whereas those with AKI, regardless of baseline renal function, are more likely to suffer from post-AKI CKD. The clarification of the AKI-CKD dynamic remains a work in progress and will be aided by the implementation of novel measures of renal function. Several novel biomarkers of renal function have been proposed to augment serum creatinine in the diagnosis of AKI and CKD. These biomarkers, taken with recent clinical investigations, have laid the groundwork for the impending paradigm shift in risk stratifying and in diagnosing changes in renal function in the ICU.

### Fluctuations in serum creatinine levels during hospitalization and long-term end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^113oe6hz]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Creatinine level–based eGFR may not accurately reflect the severity of the kidney injury in the acute setting, as creatinine levels are often not increased until several days after AKI has occurred. Despite this shortcoming, the use of creatinine level–based eGFR has distinct advantages compared with current risk stratification strategies, which focus on the presence of AKI and an increase in serum creatinine levels over time. First, reliance on the definition of AKI may fail to recognize clinical outcomes of patients with smaller serum creatinine increases or variable creatinine level fluctuations. Second, these approaches still require information on baseline serum creatinine levels, which is not always available. In addition, efforts to estimate baseline creatinine levels from in-hospital creatinine tests or by using other patient-based equations were inaccurate and resulted in misclassifications of AKI.

A possible explanation for our findings is that an observed decrease in kidney function during hospitalization might reveal an existing decreased kidney reserve, unmasked by the stress of acute illness. Even though kidney function may seem to be recovered at discharge, the persistent reduction in kidney reserve could have long-term implications. Setting the threshold for normal kidney function at an eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 revealed no associations with 1-year mortality, implying that more substantial kidney damage may be required to influence long-term outcomes.

### Management of presumed acute kidney injury during hypertensive therapy: stay calm and carry on? [^116UZ6Cx]. American Journal of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies have demonstrated that intensive blood pressure control is associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. Acute kidney injury (AKI), however, was more common in the intensive treatment group prompting concern in the nephrology community.

Summary

Clinical trials on hypertension control have traditionally defined AKI by changes in serum creatinine. However, serum creatinine has several inherent limitations as a marker of kidney injury, with various factors influencing its production, secretion, and elimination. Urinary biomarkers of kidney injury and repair have the potential to provide insight on the presence and phenotype of kidney injury. In both the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes study, urinary biomarkers have suggested that the increased risk of AKI associated with intensive treatment was due to hemodynamic changes rather than structural kidney injury. As such, clinicians who encounter rises in serum creatinine during intensification of hypertension therapy should "stay calm and carry on". Alternative explanations for serum creatinine elevation should be considered and addressed if appropriate. When the rise in serum creatinine is limited, particularly if albuminuria is stable or improving, intensive blood pressure control should be continued for its potential long-term benefits. Key Messages: Increases in serum creatinine during intensification of blood pressure control may not necessarily reflect kidney injury. Clinicians should evaluate for other contributing factors before stopping therapy. Urinary biomarkers may address limitations of serum creatinine as a marker of kidney injury.

### Hyperkalemia in a hemolyzed sample in pediatric patients: repeat or Do not repeat? [^113UUXKo]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to analyze whether repeat testing is necessary in healthy children presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) who are found to have hyperkalemia on a hemolyzed specimen.

Methods

A 5-year retrospective analysis of pediatric ED patients found to have elevated potassium values on laboratory testing of a sample reported to be hemolyzed. All patients aged 0 to 17 years who had an elevated potassium level after an intravenous draw resulted from a serum sample that was reported as hemolyzed during an ED visit were included in the study.

Results

One hundred eighty-seven patients with some degree of both hemolysis and hyperkalemia were included in the final analysis. The median age was 1.9 years of age. The most common race among all patients was White, followed by African American, and Asian. One hundred forty-five children had repeat sampling for hemolyzed hyperkalemia, 142 children, 97.9% (95% confidence interval, 95.6%-100%) had a normal potassium on repeat and 3 children, 2.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-4.4%) had true hyperkalemia. The frequency of true hyperkalemia in our study population was 2% (3/145). All 3 of these patients had underlying conditions that would appropriately have raised clinician suspicion for hyperkalemia.

Conclusions

It may be unnecessary to obtain repeat samples to confirm normal potassium in a hemolyzed sample with normal blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.

### Evaluation of serial creatinine measurements with reference change value in gentamicin-treated patients: a new tool in nephrology practice? [^114gms16]. Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In this study, we aimed to evaluate serum creatinine levels with reference change value in patients receiving treatment with gentamicin.

Methods

Serum creatinine levels of patients who received gentamicin were recorded retrospectively before treatment and on the 7th and 14th days after treatment. Analytical coefficient of variation (s/x̄) × 100 (CV) and reference change value were calculated (z = 1.64; P < .05). The percentage increase in serum creatinine level at day 7 and day 14 compared with before treatment was considered statistically significant if it exceeded the reference change value. Nephrotoxicity was assessed by comparing changes in serum creatinine levels using reference change value and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria.

Results

A total of 55 patients with a mean (SD) age of 53 (17)years were included in the study. The reference change value for serum creatinine was calculated as11.9%. The rate of increase in serum creatinine levels showed a statistically significant increase in 45.5% and 63.6% of patients on days 7 and 14, respectively, compared with before treatment, while the increase was statistically significant in 8.2% and 25.5% of patients, respectively, when evaluated by KDIGO criteria.

Discussion

We believe that it would be in the patient's best interest for clinicians to include reference change value in clinical nephrology practice alongside known acute kidney failure criteria.

### Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and subsequent risk of end-stage renal disease and mortality [^111aLLFH]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The established chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression end point of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or a doubling of serum creatinine concentration (corresponding to a change in estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of −57% or greater) is a late event.

Objective

To characterize the association of decline in estimated GFR with subsequent progression to ESRD with implications for using lesser declines in estimated GFR as potential alternative end points for CKD progression. Because most people with CKD die before reaching ESRD, mortality risk also was investigated.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Individual meta-analysis of 1.7 million participants with 12,344 ESRD events and 223,944 deaths from 35 cohorts in the CKD Prognosis Consortium with a repeated measure of serum creatinine concentration over 1 to 3 years and outcome data.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Transfer of individual participant data or standardized analysis of outputs for random-effects meta-analysis conducted between July 2012 and September 2013, with baseline estimated GFR values collected from 1975 through 2012.

Main Outcomes and Measures

End-stage renal disease (initiation of dialysis or transplantation) or all-cause mortality risk related to percentage change in estimated GFR over 2 years, adjusted for potential confounders and first estimated GFR.

Results

The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of ESRD and mortality were higher with larger estimated GFR decline. Among participants with baseline estimated GFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the adjusted HRs for ESRD were 32.1 (95% CI, 22.3–46.3) for changes of −57% in estimated GFR and 5.4 (95% CI, 4.5–6.4) for changes of −30%. However, changes of −30% or greater (6.9% [95% CI, 6.4%-7.4%] of the entire consortium) were more common than changes of −57% (0.79% [95% CI, 0.52%-1.06%]). This association was strong and consistent across the length of the baseline period (1 to 3 years), baseline estimated GFR, age, diabetes status, or albuminuria. Average adjusted 10-year risk of ESRD (in patients with a baseline estimated GFR of 35 mL/min/1.73 m2) was 99% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for estimated GFR change of −57%, was 83% (95% CI, 71%-93%) for estimated GFR change of −40%, and was 64% (95% CI, 52%-77%) for estimated GFR change of −30% vs 18% (95% CI, 15%-22%) for estimated GFR change of 0%. Corresponding mortality risks were 77% (95% CI, 71%-82%), 60% (95% CI, 56%-63%), and 50% (95% CI, 47%-52%) vs 32% (95% CI, 31%-33%), showing a similar but weaker pattern.

Conclusions and Relevance

Declines in estimated GFR smaller than a doubling of serum creatinine concentration occurred more commonly and were strongly and consistently associated with the risk of ESRD and mortality, supporting consideration of lesser declines in estimated GFR (such as a 30% reduction over 2 years) as an alternative end point for CKD progression.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^112714HR]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury is a clinical tool designed for the identification and classification of acute kidney injury (AKI). It serves a crucial role in the early detection of AKI, facilitating timely intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.

The primary components of the KDIGO criteria include changes in serum creatinine and urine output. Specifically, the criteria are met if any of the following conditions are present: an increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL [≥ 26.5 mcmol/L] within 48 hours, an increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days, or a urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours.

The result is determined based on the presence or absence of these conditions. If any of the conditions are met, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are fulfilled. Conversely, if none of these conditions are present, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are not met. This straightforward approach allows for rapid assessment and diagnosis in a clinical setting.

The tool assesses whether a person meets the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI). It evaluates three specific medical measurements provided by the user. Each measurement is checked against defined thresholds to determine if the criteria for AKI are met.

The tool uses the following diagnostic criteria:

The first criterion checks for an increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL (or 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours. If this is true, it indicates a potential diagnosis of AKI.

The second criterion evaluates whether there is an increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times the baseline level in the previous 7 days. Again, a positive result supports a diagnosis of AKI.

The third criterion assesses urine volume, specifically whether it is 0.5 mL/kg/hour or less over 6 hours. If this condition is met, it further supports the diagnosis of AKI.

The tool processes the inputs by checking which of these conditions have been met:

| **Criterion description** | **Condition** |
|-|-|
| Increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis |
| Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis |
| Urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours | If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis |
| All conditions false | "Diagnostic criteria are not met" |
| At least one condition true | "Diagnostic criteria are met" |

### Four hour creatinine clearance is better than plasma creatinine for monitoring renal function in critically ill patients [^116143WH]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

A low CCl (in our study < 48.6 ml/min) on entry to the ICU indicates that individuals are at high risk of AKI. We suggest this should lead to the appropriate management recommended by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consortium (see Figure 4 in). This comprises: discontinuation of nephrotoxic agents, maintenance of perfusion pressure and volume status, further haemodynamic monitoring, continued monitoring of serum creatinine and urine output, avoidance of hyperglycaemia and contrast procedures, and additional diagnostic workups. In addition, we recommend further CCl monitoring. As a research tool, where available, measurement of biomarkers of kidney injury could assist in establishing the diagnosis of AKI. In contrast, if CCl on entry to the ICU is normal in the presence of an increased pCr, patients may be stratified to lower risk. At this stage, we would recommend at least one more 4-h CCl to confirm normal clearance. Clearly, biomarkers of acute kidney injury could be helpful here too, if available. Clearly all patients who appear to have had a short episode of AKI prior to entry to ICU should have nephrology follow up after discharge to check for progression to CKD.

Limitations

There are limitations in the use of a CCl to estimate GFR. A measured CCl is averaged over the collection period and requires pre- and post or mid-point pCr measurement. If the time interval is brief pCr is unlikely to change substantially. If the interval is too brief, relative errors in measurement of urine output may be increased. We suggest that 2 to 4 h is a reasonable and practical compromise. We recently demonstrated in these same patients that a 4-h clearance could detect the early phase decrease in CCl that characterises the initial phase of patients developing AKI. The costs associated with CCl, are minimal, simply more frequent assays of urine and pCr, with careful attention to recording urine output accurately.

The optimal frequency for CCl measurements is uncertain. In a patient with oliguria, urine collection for less than 1 to 2 h will be relatively inaccurate. Assuming laboratory turnaround was 2 h or less, the maximum frequency of clearance measurements would be 3- to 4-hourly, which may set a reasonable minimum interval over which to review change based on creatinine excretion data. Clearly, given time and cost, these measurements should be undertaken on entry to the ICU to establish a baseline, but only repeated at this frequency in patients at high risk of, or already suspected of having AKI.

1. The definition needs to be broad enough to accommodate variations in clinical presentation over age groups, locations, and clinical situations.

2. Sensitive and specific markers for kidney injury are not currently available in clinical practice. Several groups are working on developing and validating biomarkers of kidney injury and GFR which may be used in the future for diagnosis and prognosis.

3. There is accumulating evidence that small increments in serum creatinine are associated, in a variety of settings, with adverse outcomes that are manifest in short-term morbidity and mortality and in longer-term outcomes, including 1-year mortality. Current clinical practice does not focus much attention on small increments in serum creatinine, which are often attributed to lab variations. However, the coefficient of variation of serum creatinine with modern analyzers is relatively small and therefore increments of 0.3 mg/dl (25 μmol/l) are unlikely to be due to assay variation. Changes in volume status can influence serum creatinine levels. Because the amount of fluid resuscitation depends on the underlying clinical situation, the group agreed that application of the diagnostic criteria would be used only after an optimal state of hydration had been achieved.

4. A time constraint of 48 hours for diagnosis was selected based on the evidence that adverse outcomes with small changes in creatinine were observed when the creatinine elevation occurred within 24 to 48 hours and to ensure that the process was acute and representative of events within a clinically relevant time period. In the two aforementioned studies, there was no distinction of underlying CKD or de novo AKI. However, in the study by Chertow and colleagues, the odds ratio for mortality with a change in creatinine of 0.3 mg/dl (25 μmol/l) was 4.1 (confidence interval 3.1 to 5.5) adjusting for CKD. There is no requirement to wait 48 hours to diagnose AKI or initiate appropriate measures to treat AKI. Instead, the time period is designed to eliminate situations in which the increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 is very slow and thus is not 'acute'.

### Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure and renal insufficiency: how concerned should we be by the rise in serum creatinine? [^1161tg2e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the association between the early rise in serum creatinine levels associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the long-term renoprotective properties of these drugs in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.

Background

Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated survival benefits of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure. In patients with renal insufficiency, whether associated with diabetes mellitus or not, use of ACE inhibitors is associated with slowing in the progression of renal disease. In fact, patients who have the most advanced renal insufficiency at baseline are the ones who show the maximum slowing of the disease progression, but these patients are also more likely to show an early rise in serum creatinine levels after ACE inhibitor therapy. There is evidence that patients with renal insufficiency often do not receive ACE inhibitors. There is also evidence that patients with heart failure are not receiving this life-saving drug or are receiving it at dosages lower than that used in the clinical trials. One of the main reasons for this underutilization of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure is the underlying renal insufficiency or the rise in serum creatinine level after initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor.

Methods

The authors reviewed 12 randomized clinical trials of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency, with or without diabetes mellitus or heart failure. Studies were included for review if they met the following criteria: subjects were randomized to receive ACE inhibitor; subjects were followed up for a minimum of 2 years; and most of the subjects had baseline chronic renal insufficiency (≥ 25% loss of renal function), irrespective of cause. Of the 12 studies that met these criteria, six were multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled studies. The other six were smaller randomized studies. The studies had a mean ± standard deviation follow-up of 3.2 ± 0.3 years. One thousand one hundred two patients were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of these, 705 (64%) had data on renal function at baseline (within 6 months of the start) and at the end of the study. The authors examined the changes in serum creatinine levels or glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in patients who were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors. The authors also assessed the blood pressures achieved in the trials.

Results

Patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency who achieved their blood pressure control goals were likely to demonstrate an early rise in serum creatinine levels, approximately 25% above the baseline (approximately 1.7 mg/dL) after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. This rise in serum creatinine was more acute (by approximately 15% from the baseline) during the first 2 weeks of therapy and was more gradual (additional approximately 10%) during the third and fourth weeks of therapy (Figure 1). The serum creatinine level was likely to stabilize after about 4 weeks, provided patients had a normal salt and fluid intake. In addition, patients who did not show a rise in serum creatinine level during the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, were less likely to experience one after that period, unless they were dehydrated from use of diuretics or gastroenteritis or had used a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID). In spite of this early rise in serum creatinine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (a serum creatinine level of ≥ 124 micromol/L or ≥ 1.4 mg/dL) who were randomized to receive an ACE inhibitor, these patients receiving the drug showed a 55% to 75% lower risk of worsening renal function than those with normal renal function receiving the drug. The rate of risk reduction was inversely related to the severity of renal impairment at baseline, but data were limited on the benefit of ACE inhibitors in patients with more advanced renal insufficiency (GFR < 30 mL/min). The authors noted that those aged 65 and older were likely to have much lower GFRs for given levels of serum creatinine than younger patients and were therefore likely to have advanced renal insufficiency at serum creatinine levels as low as 2 mg/dL (vs 4 mg/dL for younger patients). Patients with normal renal function were likely to show a much smaller rise in serum creatinine level (approximately 10% above the baseline of 0.9 mg/dL), mostly occurring during the first week after initiation of therapy, with subsequent stabilization, whereas patients with normal renal function suffering from heart failure, volume depletion, or bilateral renal artery stenosis experienced a significant rise (approximately 225% above baseline) in serum creatinine level, much higher in magnitude and rate than that experienced by those with renal insufficiency (Figure 1). Serum creatinine levels in these patients sharply increased (by approximately 75% above baseline) in the 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor, followed by an even sharper increase (another approximately 150%) during the subsequent 2 weeks. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL) who received therapy with ACE inhibitors had about a five times higher risk of developing hyperkalemia than those with normal renal function, whereas presence of heart failure increased the risk of hyperkalemia by about three times over those without heart failure. Concomitant use of diuretics was associated with an approximately 60% reduction in risk of hyperkalemia.

Conclusion

The authors conclude that, in patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.4 mg/dL) treated with ACE inhibitors, there is a strong association between early (within the first 2 months) and moderate (not exceeding 30% over baseline) rise in serum creatinine and slowing of the renal disease progression in the long run. The authors recommend that ACE inhibitor therapy should not be discontinued unless serum creatinine level rise above 30% over baseline during the first 2 months after initiation of therapy or hyperkalemia (serum potassium level ≥ 5.6 mmol/L) develops.

Relapse of LN — retreatment and reevaluation: We suggest that a relapse of LN after complete or partial remission be treated with the initial therapy followed by the maintenance therapy that was effective in inducing the original remission (2B), and if resuming the original therapy would put the patient at risk for excessive lifetime cyclophosphamide exposure, then we suggest a non–cyclophosphamide-based initial regimen be used (2B). Consider a repeat kidney biopsy during relapse if there is suspicion that the histologic class of LN has changed, or there is uncertainty whether a rising SCr and/or worsening proteinuria represents disease activity or chronicity (Not Graded). The commentary notes that many clinicians think that the upper limit of lifetime exposure should be 12 g/m2 intravenous cyclophosphamide, allowing for 2 full courses dosed at maximum of 1 g/m2, and it adds that a clinically defined relapse should consider increasing (ie, a doubling) proteinuria or a newly active urine sediment, with or without changes in serum creatinine.

Diagnosis of AKI

The diagnosis of AKI is traditionally based on a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output. The definition has evolved from the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage (RIFLE) criteria in 2004 to the AKI Network (AKIN) classification in 2007. In 2012, both were merged resulting in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification. Accordingly, AKI is diagnosed if serum creatinine increases by 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) or more in 48 h or rises to at least 1.5-fold from baseline within 7 days (Table 1). AKI stages are defined by the maximum change of either serum creatinine or urine output. The importance of both criteria was confirmed in a recent study in > 32,000 critically ill patients which showed that short- and long-term risk of death or renal replacement therapy (RRT) were greatest when patients met both criteria for AKI and when these abnormalities persisted for longer than 3 days.

Several studies in various different patient populations have confirmed an association between stages of AKI and short- and long-term outcomes. However, serum creatinine and urine output are markers of excretory function only and do not provide any information about any other roles of the kidney, i.e. metabolic, endocrine, or immunological functions. They are also not kidney specific and need to be interpreted within the clinical context. Some patients fulfil the AKI definition but do not have AKI, and there are also patients with clear evidence of renal injury who do not meet the creatinine or urine criteria for AKI (Table 2).

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^117QPeGE]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Serum creatinine is measured as a concentration and is therefore affected by variations in volume status. As a result, the diagnosis of AKI may be delayed or missed in patients with significant fluid shifts or fluid overload. This was highlighted in a post-hoc analysis of the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial. It revealed that AKI was unmasked or classified differently in up to 18% of patients after serum creatinine levels were adjusted for net fluid balance and estimated total body water. Affected patients had mortality rates similar to those with AKI that was present before adjustment.

Another important limitation of all creatinine-based definitions of AKI is that they require a reference value to describe "baseline" renal function. Ideally, this value should reflect the patient's steady-state kidney function just before the episode of AKI. However, information on pre-hospital kidney function is not always available so that various surrogate estimates are frequently used. These may include inpatient results or the imputation of values such as back-calculating a baseline creatinine and using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 75 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 in patients with missing data. Unfortunately, these methods can inflate as well as reduce the true incidence of AKI. At present, there is no standard approach to determining baseline renal function.

Creatinine-based criteria for AKI often do not take into account underlying renal reserve. In patients with normal kidney function, a rise in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl may indeed be due to an important reduction in GFR. In contrast, in patients with underlying CKD, absolute rises in serum creatinine represent variable changes in GFR, and a rise by 0.3 mg/dl may be within the acceptable daily variation and simply reflect an inconsequential change in GFR. This is particularly relevant when diagnosing KDIGO AKI stage 3 which is defined by a rise in serum creatinine to > 4.0 mg/dl (≥ 353.6 μmol/l). A patient with a baseline serum creatinine of 3.9 mg/dl (345 μmol/l) who experiences a creatinine rise by 0.3 mg/dl in 48 h would be classified as having KDIGO AKI stage 3, whereas such a rise would be defined as AKI stage 1 in a patient with normal baseline renal function.

### False-positive rate of AKI using consensus creatinine-based criteria [^112LJMX7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Use of small changes in serum creatinine to diagnose AKI allows for earlier detection but may increase diagnostic false-positive rates because of inherent laboratory and biologic variabilities of creatinine.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We examined serum creatinine measurement characteristics in a prospective observational clinical reference cohort of 2267 adult patients with AKI by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria and used these data to create a simulation cohort to model AKI false-positive rates. We simulated up to seven successive blood draws on an equal population of hypothetical patients with unchanging true serum creatinine values. Error terms generated from laboratory and biologic variabilities were added to each simulated patient's true serum creatinine value to obtain the simulated measured serum creatinine for each blood draw. We determined the proportion of patients who would be erroneously diagnosed with AKI by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria.

Results

Within the clinical cohort, 75.0% of patients received four serum creatinine draws within at least one 48-hour period during hospitalization. After four simulated creatinine measurements that accounted for laboratory variability calculated from assay characteristics and 4.4% of biologic variability determined from the clinical cohort and publicly available data, the overall false-positive rate for AKI diagnosis was 8.0% (interquartile range = 7.9%-8.1%), whereas patients with true serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl (representing 21% of the clinical cohort) had a false-positive AKI diagnosis rate of 30.5% (interquartile range = 30.1%-30.9%) versus 2.0% (interquartile range = 1.9%-2.1%) in patients with true serum creatinine values < 1.5 mg/dl (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Use of small serum creatinine changes to diagnose AKI is limited by high false-positive rates caused by inherent variability of serum creatinine at higher baseline values, potentially misclassifying patients with CKD in AKI studies.

RIFLE and AKIN criteria for acute kidney injury — adult thresholds — define severity by serum creatinine (SCr) change and urine output. Risk is "Increased SCr to > 1.5× baseline" or urine output " < 0.5 mL/kg/h for > 6 h". Injury is "Increased SCr to > 2× baseline" or urine output " < 0.5 mL/kg/h for > 12 h". Failure is "Increased SCr to > 3× baseline; or an increase of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL to a value of ≥ 4 mg/dL" or urine output " < 0.3 mL/kg/h for > 12 h or anuria for > 12 h". AKIN staging aligns as: Stage 1 "Increase in SCr ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or increase in SCr to ≥ 150%-200% of baseline", Stage 2 "Increase in SCr to > 200%-300% of baseline", and Stage 3 "Increase in SCr to > 300% of baseline; or to ≥ 4 mg/dL with an acute increase of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL; or on RRT". Progression categories include "Loss Need for RRT for > 4 wk" and "End stage Need for RRT for > 3 mo". Timing qualifiers specify "For RIFLE, the increase in SCr should be both abrupt (within 1–7 days) and sustained (> 24 hours)" and "For AKIN, the increase in SCR must occur in less than 48 hours", and abbreviations define "RRT" and "SCr".

### Beyond muscle destruction: a systematic review of rhabdomyolysis for clinical practice [^113PKQ2U]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Laboratory work-up

Serum CK levels gradually increase during the first 12 h of rhabdomyolysis, peak within 3–5 days, and return to baseline during the following 6–10 days. Clinicians often use serum CK levels exceeding five times the upper limit of normal for diagnosing rhabdomyolysis.

Urinalysis can detect the presence of myoglobin when it exceeds 0.3 mg/L in serum. The heme molecule reacts in a urine dipstick but this method cannot distinguish between a positive result due to the presence of hemoglobin or myoglobin. Myoglobinuria can be considered when a patient has a reactive heme test positive for blood but the microscopic exam reveals only few red blood cells in the urine. The urine pH tends to be acidic and it often contains detectable levels of protein.

Serum CK levels have traditionally been considered the best predictor of AKI. However, Baeza-Trinidad and coworkers recently conducted a retrospective study of 522 patients with rhabdomyolysis in which both initial CK and creatinine levels were recorded. In this study, the initial CK level was not a predictor of AKI. Serum myoglobin has also been used as a predictor of AKI; Premru and coworkers found that > 15 mg/L of myoglobin in the blood was highly associated with development of AKI in a cohort of 484 patients. However, data regarding the use of myoglobin as an early marker of rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI remains inconclusive since many values of myoglobin overlap.

The Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) criteria are used in most studies nowadays to define AKI. However, different criteria have been used to establish the diagnosis of AKI after rhabdomyolysis in clinical studies. Talaie and coworkers diagnosed rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI in patients with a serum creatinine level elevation of more than 30% in the first days of admission. In another study, Iraj and coworkers established a diagnosis based on two repeated values of creatinine ≥ 1.6 mg/dL.

Kidney assessment in hypertension — hypertension is highlighted as "the second most important cause of CKD after diabetes". Antihypertensive therapy can transiently affect creatinine: "BP reduction by antihypertensive treatment often leads to an acute increase in serum creatinine by as much as 20–30%, especially with renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers", and CKD classification uses eGFR: "CKD is classified according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated by the 2009 CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration formula". Albuminuria assessment is specified: "The albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) is measured from a spot urine sample (preferably early morning urine), and is the preferred method to quantify urinary albumin excretion". Monitoring is advised: "Serum creatinine, eGFR, and ACR should be documented in all hypertensive patients, and if CKD is diagnosed, repeated at least annually", and urinalysis caveat: "One negative urinary dipstick test does not rule out albuminuria, in contrast to a normal ACR".

### Incidence, recognition, and follow-up of laboratory evidence of acute kidney injury in primary care practices: analysis of 93, 259 creatinine results [^115WFD66]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-acute kidney injury) is under-recognized in the outpatient setting and is associated with adverse outcomes.

Methods

We analyzed the incidence of CA-acute kidney injury in an academic primary care practice and community health center and assessed recognition and follow-up as determined by repeat creatinine measurement (closed-loop). We reviewed 93,259 specimens for 36,593 unique patients from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2021.

Results

There were 220 unique patients with CA-acute kidney injury, defined as a > 75% increase in creatinine from baseline (incidence: 150/100,000; 0.15% per year). One hundred thirty seven patients (62.3%) had repeat serum creatinine performed within 30 days. Chart reviews of the 83 (37.72%) patients with open loops found there was no follow-up creatinine ordered in 69/83 (83.1%) patients. Mean baseline creatinine was higher and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower in the closed-loop group (0.92 ± 0.4 mg/dL; 84.45 ± 27.49 mL/min) vs the open-loop group (0.63 ± 0.34 mg/dL; 105.19 ± 26.67 mL/min) (P < .0001). Preexisting chronic kidney disease was more prevalent in closed-loop patients (35/137; 25.6%) compared with those with open loops (3/83; 3.6%). Patients with baseline chronic kidney disease were more likely to have closed loops. Progression to new chronic kidney disease was common among CA-acute kidney injury patients, occurring in 25% of open-loop and 24.1% of closed-loop patients. New baseline eGFR was lower in all groups.

Conclusions

Clinicians frequently overlooked a clinically significant change in eGFR, especially when the baseline creatinine and incident creatinine levels were in the "normal" range.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression — implementation considerations — emphasize that "It is important to differentiate between progression of chronic disease and acute injury", and that "small changes in GFR could be consistent with AKI, whereas only large changes in GFR would indicate progressive CKD", so "Clinicians will need to attend to other clinical indicators to be able to accurately identify the cause of changes in GFR". They also note that "Change in eGFR may be due to true change in GFR or due to changes in the non-GFR determinants of creatinine concentrations, including assay fluctuations", and that "Differentiating between these requires serial assessments and consideration of potential changes in the non-GFR determinants of creatinine". Finally, "Use of validated prediction models for progression of kidney disease may be able to incorporate numerous clinical factors and provide a single prognostic metric, which can guide decisions", and "Incorporation of such models into laboratory systems may facilitate their use".

The laboratory had independently decided that nitromethane was an interfering substance and did not repeat the creatinine level. The anion gap was now 13 mmol/L and the calculated osmolality was 282 mmol/kg. Serum osmolality determined by freezing point depression was 430 mmol/kg (reference range 275–295 mmol/kg). The osmolar gap was estimated to be 148 mmol/kg.

Is this Patient's Presentation Consistent with Methanol Poisoning?

After ingestion, the hepatic enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase converts methanol to formaldehyde, which is then converted to formic acid by formaldehyde dehydrogenase. Although formaldehyde is more toxic than formic acid, it does not accumulate during poisoning on account of its short half-life of about 1.5 min. Formic acid, an inhibitor of cytochrome oxidases c and aa3, primarily contributes to the toxic sequelae of methanol poisoning, including ocular toxicity and the fall in plasma bicarbonate concentration and consequent increase in anion gap. Ocular toxicity essentially identical to that produced in methanol poisoning has been described after formate administration in animals. Also, results suggest that formaldehyde is not a major factor in the toxic syndrome produced by methanol. The clinical manifestations of methanol ingestion include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, weakness, and epigastric pain, as well as developing an elevated anion gap acidosis. The severity of symptoms secondary to methanol poisoning appears to correlate with the degree of metabolic acidosis. Mortality correlates with the severity of acidosis and the formate concentration rather than with serum methanol concentration.

### Advances in the diagnosis of early biomarkers for acute kidney injury: a literature review [^112DoURG]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous group of conditions, typically occurring in the context of acute or chronic illness, characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), accompanied by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or a decrease in urine output. The term "acute" refers to kidney dysfunction occurring within hours to days, while "kidney injury" implies a potentially reversible condition that, if not promptly addressed, may progress to acute kidney disease (AKD) and even chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI affects 15–20% of hospitalized patients, doubling the risk of in-hospital mortality and increasing the risk of CKD by fourfold. Current clinical diagnosis relies on serum creatinine levels, but its lagging nature limits the early diagnosis and treatment of AKI. As a marker of GFR, creatinine only increases when there is a significant drop in GFR or substantial parenchymal damage, and it does not reflect specific pathological processes. AKI primarily affects the tubules, with changes in GFR typically occurring only after tubular damage has progressed. The absence of changes in creatinine levels may lead to false reassurance, resulting in inappropriate medication dosing or delays in discontinuing nephrotoxic agents, thereby increasing the risk of worsening kidney injury.

Biomarkers are defined and categorized according to the BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) resource from the joint task force of the FDA and NIH, covering functions such as diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis, and prediction, and guiding the application of clinical and surrogate endpoint biomarkers. Ideally, biomarkers should be validated in multicenter and prospective cohorts, and tested in clinical trials for their impact on patient outcomes. As many researchers have advocated, in AKI, an ideal biomarker may not replace serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output but should be considered of additional value. In recent years, biomarkers for tubular injury, inflammation and repair, renal filtration, and oxidative stress have shown significant potential in the early detection and prognosis of AKI (Fig. 1). However, their clinical implementation faces challenges in terms of technology and validation, requiring large-scale studies to confirm their effectiveness. This review summarizes the current state of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AKI, exploring their prospects in clinical practice and providing guidance to improve the diagnosis and treatment of AKI.

### Acute kidney injury [^115sSaVq]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a rapid increase in serum creatinine, decrease in urine output, or both. AKI occurs in approximately 10–15% of patients admitted to hospital, while its incidence in intensive care has been reported in more than 50% of patients. Kidney dysfunction or damage can occur over a longer period or follow AKI in a continuum with acute and chronic kidney disease. Biomarkers of kidney injury or stress are new tools for risk assessment and could possibly guide therapy. AKI is not a single disease but rather a loose collection of syndromes as diverse as sepsis, cardiorenal syndrome, and urinary tract obstruction. The approach to a patient with AKI depends on the clinical context and can also vary by resource availability. Although the effectiveness of several widely applied treatments is still controversial, evidence for several interventions, especially when used together, has increased over the past decade.

### Creatinine… [^115pcTQX]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Biological relevance Serum creatinine is an important indicator of kidney function, because it is an easily measured byproduct of muscle metabolism that is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Creatinine itself is produced via a biological system involving creatine, phosphocreatine, and adenosine triphosphate. Creatinine is removed from the blood chiefly by the kidneys, primarily by glomerular filtration, but also by proximal tubular secretion. Little or no tubular reabsorption of creatinine occurs. If filtration in the kidney is deficient, blood creatinine concentrations rise. Therefore, creatinine concentrations in blood and urine may be used to calculate the creatinine clearance, which correlates approximately with the glomerular filtration rate. Blood creatinine concentrations may also be used alone to calculate the estimated GFR.

The GFR is clinically important as a measurement of kidney function. However, in cases of severe kidney dysfunction the CrCl rate will overestimate the GFR, because hypersecretion of creatinine by the proximal renal tubules will account for a larger fraction of the total creatinine cleared. Ketoacids, cimetidine, and trimethoprim reduce creatinine tubular secretion and therefore increase the accuracy of the GFR estimate, in particular in severe kidney dysfunction. An alternative estimation of kidney function can be made when interpreting the blood plasma concentration of creatinine along with that of urea. BUN-to-creatinine ratio can indicate other problems besides those intrinsic to the kidney; for example, a urea concentration raised out of proportion to the creatinine may indicate a prerenal problem, such as volume depletion.

Counterintuitively, supporting the observation of higher creatinine production in women than in men, and putting into question the algorithms for GFR that do not distinguish for sex, women have higher muscle protein synthesis and higher muscle protein turnover across their life span. As HDL supports muscle anabolism, higher muscle protein turnover links increased creatine to the generally higher serum HDL in women compared with serum HDL in men and the HDL associated benefits, such as reduced incidence of cardiovascular complications and reduced COVID-19 severity. Diagnostic use Serum creatinine is the most commonly used indicator of renal function. A raised creatinine is not always representative of a true reduction in GFR. A high reading may be due to: increased production of creatinine, interference with the assay, or reduced tubular secretion of creatinine.

An increase in serum creatinine can be due to increased ingestion of cooked meat or excessive intake of protein and creatine supplements, taken to enhance athletic performance. Intense exercise can increase creatinine by increasing muscle breakdown. Dehydration secondary to an inflammatory process with fever may cause a false increase in creatinine concentrations not related to actual kidney impairment, as in some cases associated with cholecystitis. Several medications and chromogens can interfere with the chemical assay. Creatinine secretion by the renal tubules can be blocked by some medications, again increasing measured creatinine. Serum creatinine Diagnostic serum creatinine studies are used to determine renal function. The reference interval is 0. 6–1. 3 mg/dL. It is simple to measure serum creatinine, and it is the most commonly used indicator of renal function.

### Serum creatinine levels and renal insufficiency… [^111fzoVp]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The sixth report of the Joint National Committee has recommended that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors be used for lowering blood pressure in patients with diabetes mellitus and in persons with renal insufficiency. Blood pressure reduction is known to slow renal disease regardless of the antihypertensive agent used, but ACE inhibitors may further slow renal disease progression in patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, only one half of the 53 percent of hypertensive patients treated actually achieve blood pressure reduction to less than 140/90 mm Hg. Some patients may experience a transient rise in serum creatinine level after starting treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, or after blood pressure is adequately controlled.

A rise in serum creatinine or potassium level may result in discontinuation of the drug or use of lower dosages than what is recommended because of concerns about safety and tolerability in patients with renal insufficiency. Bakris and Weir reviewed 12 randomized trials to determine if an initial reduction in the glomerular filtration rate or elevation of serum creatinine levels from use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs results in long-term protection against decline in renal function in patients with renal insufficiency. Renal disease progression among patients with preexisting renal insufficiency was evaluated over a three-year period. The evaluations included patients with and without diabetes mellitus or systolic heart failure. GFR data was used if serum creatinine values were unavailable.

A limited elevation in serum creatinine level was seen following initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB in patients who achieved their blood pressure goal. The increase usually occurred within two weeks of therapy. Regardless of the serum creatinine value, manifestations of renal failure were not apparent until the GFR was well below 30 mL per minute. Patients with the greatest degree of renal insufficiency experienced the greatest protection from renal disease progression. As renal disease increases, there is a loss of renal reserve as well as the autoregulatory ability of the kidney, resulting in a more acute fall in GFR following ACE inhibition. The studies also indicated that there is a low risk of hyperkalemia with use of drugs that block the reninangiotensin system. Results indicated that use of drugs that block the RAS is appropriate in patients with renal insufficiency.

Once marked elevations in serum creatinine levels are present and renal reserve is lost, the unique benefits of ACE inhibitors may not exceed that of achieving the recommended level of blood pressure reduction alone. Data from these studies in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease demonstrated that if an elevation in the serum creatinine level does occur, it stabilizes quickly and does not progressively worsen. In addition, this reduction in GFR is reversible. The authors conclude that no one should be denied a long-term trial of an ACE inhibitor because of a preexisting elevation of serum creatinine level or one that increases up to 30 percent from baseline and then stabilizes within two to three weeks. If elevations in serum creatinine of more than 30 percent occur on a chronic basis within the first month or if hyperkalemia occurs, the drug should be withdrawn.

### Serum creatinine levels during hospitalization and long-term outcomes… [^113wYnRs]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The findings of this study suggest that reversible reduction in kidney function among hospitalized patients is associated with an increased long-term risk for end-stage kidney disease and mortality. Importance Acute kidney injury is associated with poor outcomes, but the clinical implication of reversible serum creatinine level fluctuations during hospitalization not necessarily defined as acute kidney injury is poorly understood. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients hospitalized in a large tertiary hospital in Israel between September 1, 2007, and July 31, 2022. The study included patients admitted to an internal medicine ward. Patients had not undergone dialysis during the index hospitalization, had at least 3 creatinine tests performed during hospitalization, and had a discharge estimated glomerular filtration rate exceeding 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2. Patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease were excluded.

Exposure Glomerular filtration rate was estimated from serum creatinine values using the updated 2022 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula, and eGFR greater than 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 was regarded as normal. Exposure was defined based on the association between the first and last values determined during hospitalization. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes staging system defines AKI as an increase in the serum creatinine level over hours to days or a decrease in urine output. 11 Therefore, AKI may only partially represent the prognostic importance of serum creatinine level fluctuations during hospitalization.

Although our primary analysis focused on the first and last creatinine values, by mandating 3 or more creatinine level determinations, we indirectly ensured sufficient monitoring of kidney function during the patients' hospitalizations. For patients admitted multiple times during the study period, only the first hospitalization was retained. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated from creatinine values using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula, updated for the year 2022. 17 Only patients with discharge estimated GFR values over 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 were included. Exposure was defined based on the association between the first and last eGFR measurements performed during hospitalization. Patients for whom both the first and last values were over 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 were defined as having normal to normal kidney function. Patients for whom the first value was under 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 and the last value was over 60 mL/min/1.

73 m2 were defined as having low to normal kidney function. Several additional analyses were performed. First, subgroup analyses were performed for groups defined by age, sex, background diseases, and treatment with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. We then considered the exposure in a more refined manner, separating patients with a first eGFR value between 45 and 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 and patients with a first eGFR value of less than 45 mL/min/1. 73 m2. We further adjusted for discharge eGFR to directly compare patients with the same discharge kidney function. We also performed the main analysis allowing a different baseline hazard across age groups. For a sensitivity analysis, we changed the normal eGFR threshold to 90 mL/min/1. 73 m2. We explored temporal trends in mortality and ESKD over the study period by estimating the interaction between primary exposure and calendar time.

Stage 1: Increase in serum creatinine of more than or equal to 0. 3mg/dl or increase to more than or equal to 150% to 200% from baseline or urine output less than
0. 5 mg/kg per hour for more than 6 hours. Stage 2: Increase in serum creatinine to more than 200%-300% from baseline or urine output less than 0. 5 mg/kg per hour for more than 12 hours. Stage 3: Increase in serum creatinine to more than 300% from baseline or urine output less than 0. 3 mg/kg per hour for 24 hours or anuria for 12 hours. Note that only the serum creatinine criteria were used for this measure
