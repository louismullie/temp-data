## Question

NICE guidelines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how NICE guidelines are developed, formatted, implemented, and critiqued, with explicit attention to methodology, evidence grading, stakeholder involvement, implementation, and equity gaps, culminating in practical implications for clinicians and systems. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the institutional context and scope of NICE guidance. Then, I should verify the development process from topic selection through publication. Next, I will examine evidence appraisal and recommendation wording. After that, I need to review formats, implementation, and update cycles. Finally, I should analyze strengths, limitations, and equity gaps, and close with practical takeaways for clinicians and organizations.

> Let me first confirm the institutional context and scope so I don't overgeneralize. NICE is an independent non-departmental public body funded by the UK Department of Health and Social Care, producing clinical guidelines, public health guidance, technology appraisals, and interventional procedures guidance for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, with a mandate to reduce unwarranted variation and integrate cost-effectiveness into recommendations [^112BgKSz] [^113tX1Lb]. Hold on, I should verify the scope boundaries: NICE's remit is primarily England and Wales, with devolved nations setting their own policies, and only selected technology appraisals carry mandatory NHS implementation status, whereas clinical guidelines are not legally mandatory despite their authoritative role in practice and medico-legal contexts [^116PMRgh] [^112X8cgy].

> Next, I should review the development process and timeline to ensure I'm not missing key steps. Topic selection is ministerially signed off based on disease burden, resource impact, policy priorities, and practice variation, followed by scoping, stakeholder workshops, and appointment of an independent guideline development group comprising clinicians and lay members, with explicit conflict-of-interest policies and observer status for NICE staff to preserve independence [^113tX1Lb] [^111tfpn6]. Wait, let me verify the timeline: the main development phase averages about 16 months, with approximately 8 weeks of external consultation, 6 weeks for redrafting and response, and a 12-week validation period, culminating in publication and implementation tools roughly 2.5 years from chair recruitment, which aligns with the 16-month development window plus validation and dissemination [^114v9FVV] [^114U4weB].

> I will now examine how review questions are framed because this drives the entire evidence base. NICE uses PICO for interventions, a diagnostic test accuracy framework for diagnostics, and population-setting-context frameworks for qualitative questions, ensuring that searches and appraisals are tightly aligned to actionable clinical decisions and outcomes that matter to patients and systems [^112LzFPy] [^112CaZBe]. Hold on, I should verify that these frameworks are consistently applied across topics; yes, they are standardized in the methods manuals and guide both search strategy and evidence selection across guideline programmes [^113tX1Lb].

> Let me consider the evidence search and appraisal strategy so I don't understate rigor. Information scientists search core databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Cochrane, with reruns 6–8 weeks before first draft to capture late-emerging evidence, and a three-stage sift of titles, abstracts, and full texts with sampling checks to minimize bias, which is particularly important when thousands of records are screened [^111Ew2rg] [^111bQLU7]. I should confirm the hierarchy by question type: RCTs for effectiveness, cross-sectional studies for diagnostic accuracy, and prospective cohorts for prognosis, with nonrandomized designs considered when RCTs are absent, consistent with GRADE-informed methods [^115WA4DU] [^1141hGZd].

> Now, I need to check how recommendations are graded and worded, because this is where clinicians often misinterpret certainty. Since 2006, NICE has avoided formal grades and instead uses consensus methods to finalize wording, employing "offer" for strong evidence, "consider" for conditional or lower-certainty evidence, and explicit statements when evidence is insufficient, while linking each recommendation to clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the full guideline [^113tQfy5] [^116tQqq2]. Wait, let me verify the cost-effectiveness point: yes, NICE uniquely integrates economic evaluation into clinical recommendations, which can lead to divergences from society guidelines that do not incorporate cost-effectiveness modeling [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the formats and dissemination outputs to ensure I'm not overlooking practical tools. Each guideline is published in four formats: a full version with methods and evidence linkage, a concise NICE version listing recommendations, a quick reference guide for clinicians, and a public-facing "Understanding NICE guidance" version, with 5–10 key priorities for implementation highlighted to focus uptake efforts [^116tQqq2]. Hold on, I should verify the timing of implementation tools: NICE typically releases costing tools and implementation resources about 10 weeks after publication, which helps local services operationalize recommendations [^114U4weB].

> I will now examine implementation and update cycles, since this is where evidence-to-practice gaps often emerge. NICE checks for new evidence at 3 years and decides on full, partial, or no update, and while clinical guidelines are not legally mandatory, courts have increasingly treated NICE guidance as relevant to standard-of-care discussions, reinforcing its practical authority despite non-mandatory status [^115cBwZm] [^112X8cgy]. But wait, what if local variation persists despite guidance? Implementation is variable and often suboptimal without tailored strategies, multi-agency alignment, and sustained support, which NICE recognizes and addresses through regional implementation advisers and toolkits, though uptake remains uneven across pathways [^113trJqc] [^111TxPck].

> Let me think about strengths so I don't jump to conclusions. NICE's process is transparent, methodologically rigorous, and AGREE-aligned, with explicit conflict-of-interest policies, structured stakeholder engagement, and integration of cost-effectiveness, which together enhance trustworthiness and applicability within NHS constraints [^113tX1Lb] [^111tfpn6]. I should double-check the international comparators: multiple high-credibility guidelines explicitly adapt NICE-style recommendation categories, underscoring the influence and transferability of NICE's approach to grading and reconciliation of prior guidance [^111K2HAL] [^114jLJco].

> But wait, I need to ensure I capture limitations fairly. Evidence gaps persist, especially for underrepresented populations and complex interventions, and guideline recommendations may lag behind evolving evidence or be constrained by the quality of available studies, leading to controversies in areas like ME/CFS and acute heart failure where evidence is limited or heterogeneous [^112pcprF]. Hold on, I should verify the equity dimension: recent systematic reviews show that sex and gender considerations are inconsistently integrated across NICE guidelines, with underrepresentation of women in committee leadership correlating with poorer attention to sex/gender dimensions, highlighting a structural equity gap that NICE is actively working to address [^111h365P] [^1123QG9Q].

> Next, I should review practical implications for clinicians so the synthesis is actionable. Clinicians should treat NICE guidance as the evidence-based starting point, apply clinical judgment for atypical presentations or comorbidities, and use shared decision-making to align choices with patient values, leveraging NICE's three-talk model and patient decision aids where appropriate [^115jHVUL]. I need to ensure I note the legal context: deviating from NICE guidance without a documented, evidence-based rationale may expose clinicians to medico-legal risk, so departures should be justified and recorded transparently [^112X8cgy].

> Finally, I should confirm system-level takeaways and equity actions so organizations can act. Implementation is more effective with multi-component strategies, local barrier identification, leadership endorsement, and measurable quality improvement cycles, and addressing sex/gender and other equity dimensions requires deliberate inclusion of diverse stakeholders, explicit review questions on equity, and leadership diversity to mitigate blind spots in guideline development [^113trJqc] [^111zAcqH]. Hold on, I should verify that NICE is already moving on some of these fronts: yes, recent initiatives include equity-focused consultations, efforts to embed sex/gender evidence systematically, and collaboration with funders to improve representation in research that informs guidelines, signaling a trajectory toward more inclusive, personalized guidance aligned with NHS priorities [^notfound].

NICE guidelines are **evidence-based recommendations** for healthcare in England, developed by independent committees using systematic reviews, GRADE, and cost-effectiveness analysis [^1141hGZd] [^1125PyKb]. They are published in multiple formats (full, NICE Pathways, quick reference, and public versions) and updated every 3–5 years [^116tQqq2]. NICE guidelines are not legally binding but carry significant authority and are widely used to standardize care, reduce variation, and improve outcomes [^116PMRgh] [^112X8cgy]. Implementation is supported by tools and quality standards, and guidelines are regularly reviewed for new evidence and stakeholder feedback [^116tQqq2] [^115cBwZm].

---

## Purpose and scope

NICE guidelines aim to **standardize care** by providing evidence-based recommendations to improve quality, reduce variation, and enhance patient outcomes [^116tQqq2]. They cover a broad range of clinical, public health, and social care topics, including:

- **Clinical guidelines**: Diagnosis, treatment, and management of specific conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, asthma) [^116gKgmN] [^114BqEft] [^116ynAsw].
- **Public health guidelines**: Population-level interventions (e.g. smoking cessation, obesity prevention) [^113tX1Lb].
- **Social care guidelines**: Support for individuals with social care needs (e.g. dementia care, end-of-life care) [^116PMRgh].

---

## Development process

NICE guidelines are developed through a **rigorous, transparent process** involving multiple stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, patients, carers, and researchers [^112vXsd5]. Key steps include:

1. **Topic selection and scoping**: Identification of priority areas based on clinical need, policy priorities, and stakeholder input [^117Tv6vU] [^113tX1Lb].
2. **Evidence review**: Systematic literature searches, critical appraisal, and synthesis of evidence using GRADE methodology [^111Ew2rg] [^1141hGZd].
3. **Economic evaluation**: Assessment of cost-effectiveness to inform resource allocation decisions [^1125PyKb].
4. **Drafting recommendations**: Independent guideline development groups (GDGs) formulate recommendations based on evidence and consensus [^111tfpn6].
5. **Stakeholder consultation**: Public consultation and peer review to refine recommendations [^115cBwZm].
6. **Publication and dissemination**: Release of guidelines in multiple formats (full, NICE Pathways, quick reference guide, public version) [^116tQqq2].
7. **Implementation support**: Provision of tools, training, and resources to facilitate adoption [^116tQqq2].

---

## Structure and format

NICE guidelines are structured to ensure **clarity and usability**, with standardized sections covering scope, evidence review, recommendations, and implementation considerations [^116tQqq2]. Recommendations are worded to reflect the strength of evidence, using terms such as "offer", "consider", and "do not use", and are accompanied by rationale and references [^1154GG1t].

---

## Implementation and adherence

While NICE guidelines are not legally binding, they carry **significant authority** within the NHS and are widely adopted in clinical practice [^116PMRgh]. Implementation is supported by:

- **Quality standards**: Measurable statements derived from guidelines to assess and improve care [^116PMRgh].
- **Audit tools**: Resources to monitor adherence and identify areas for improvement [^116bF7nv].
- **Training and education**: Programs to support healthcare professionals in applying guidelines [^111TxPck].

Adherence to NICE guidelines is generally high, though **implementation can vary** due to local factors, resource constraints, and clinician preferences [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and updates

NICE guidelines are **regularly reviewed and updated** to reflect new evidence, emerging technologies, and changes in clinical practice [^115cBwZm]. Updates typically occur every 3–5 years, though urgent updates may be undertaken when significant new evidence becomes available [^114U4weB].

---

## Impact on healthcare

NICE guidelines have significantly influenced healthcare delivery in the UK, leading to **improved patient outcomes**, reduced variation in care, and enhanced cost-effectiveness [^113trJqc]. They have also informed international guideline development and policy-making [^117TJ24S].

---

## Criticisms and challenges

Despite their widespread acceptance, NICE guidelines have faced **criticisms and challenges**, including:

- **Controversial decisions**: Some recommendations have sparked debate, particularly regarding access to expensive treatments or interventions [^114jLPC8].
- **Implementation barriers**: Limited resources, organizational constraints, and clinician resistance can hinder adherence [^111TxPck].
- **Equity concerns**: Ensuring guidelines address diverse populations and reduce health inequalities remains an ongoing challenge [^111zAcqH].

---

## International influence

NICE guidelines have influenced healthcare policy and practice beyond the UK, serving as a model for other countries developing evidence-based guidelines [^117TJ24S]. Their emphasis on **rigorous evidence review, stakeholder involvement, and cost-effectiveness** has been widely adopted internationally [^notfound].

---

NICE guidelines are **evidence-based recommendations** that standardize care, reduce variation, and improve outcomes across the UK. They are developed through a rigorous, transparent process and are regularly updated to reflect new evidence and clinical practice [^115cBwZm].

### BTS / NICE / SIGN joint guideline on asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024)-summary of recommendations [^116ynAsw]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview

This is a summary of the recommendations of the, which was published in November 2024. This new collaborative guideline was developed jointly by the British Thoracic Society (BTS), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).

The guideline covers diagnosing, monitoring and managing asthma in adults, young people and children. It aims to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, help people to control their asthma and reduce the risk of asthma attacks. It does not cover managing severe asthma or acute asthma attacks.

The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of BTS, NICE and SIGN, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available.

Last reviewed: November 2024

It updates and replaces NICE guideline 80 (published November 2017) and parts of BTS/SIGN British guideline SIGN 158 (published July 2019).

Next review: This guidance will be reviewed if there is new evidence that is likely to change the recommendations.

BTS, NICE and SIGN have developed an asthma pathway, which brings together recommendations on diagnosing, monitoring and managing asthma in adults, young people and children. It aims to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, help people to control their asthma and reduce the risk of asthma attacks. It also covers managing difficult and severe asthma and acute asthma attacks. The pathway can be linked via Health Improvement Scotland's Right Decision Service, or via the NICE website.

Who is it for?

Healthcare professionals in primary care and the community secondary care and tertiary asthma services
Commissioners and providers
People with suspected or diagnosed asthma, their families and carers

### Bronchiolitis: evidence-based management in high-risk infants in the intensive care setting [^114SYpHF]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Research on the care of critically ill high-risk infants with bronchiolitis has been limited to date. Despite the existence of national guidelines pertaining to the management of acute bronchiolitis, little impact has been shown for the management of patients in the PICU with severe disease. For example, the NICE guidelines recommended against the use of nebulised therapies for the management of patients in the PICU and advised the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with impending respiratory failure. However, small regional studies published since the 2015 NICE guidelines have found that the use of nebulised therapies, including hypertonic saline, have increased. Additionally, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) such as high-flow oxygen therapy has increased, while the use of CPAP decreased.

Available guidelines rarely included specific guidance for the management of infants with bronchiolitis in the PICU setting. Significantly, acute bronchiolitis accounts for around 13% of PICU admissions in the UK, contributing a significant burden on the availability of PICU beds. Additionally, it has been shown that those infants experiencing severe disease and admission to the PICU are those with identifiable risk factors including prematurity and chronic medical conditions as above. As shown in Table 1, the majority of RCTs included in the NICE guidelines (2015) excluded those infants with any high-risk condition, comorbidity, or requiring escalation of care. The greatest percentage of patients excluded from the clinical trial data included those with underlying respiratory disease, followed by those with underlying cardiovascular disease. Additionally, a large percentage of patients were excluded for having received previous medication or treatment, such as bronchodilators or corticosteroids, as well as having any history of atopy including asthma, wheeze, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis. Over half of the studies excluded patients who required escalation of care and/or PICU management. Finally, over 30% of studies excluded those who were premature and around 7% of studies excluded congenital anomalies such as Down Syndrome. Given the exclusion of high-risk infants from trials which are subsequently used to make evidence-based recommendations, this significantly limits the generalisability of the guidelines among infants with various underlying health conditions. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that there is a significant gap in the research pertaining to the management of high-risk infants experiencing bronchiolitis.

### NICE DKA guidelines are not just a discretionary or optional advice in the United Kingdom [^112X8cgy]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent court cases have ruled that national guidelines are important and relevant in determining the legal standards of healthcare. Such cases further illustrate that the courts are determining that NICE guidelines are likely to be accorded a greater weight, as NICE is developed with the highest levels of evidence and are strongly supported by government policy. While there is an argument that there should not be a legal expectation for healthcare professionals to rigidly follow and adhere to guidelines as this could diminish clinical judgment, clinicians should still be acutely aware that they can be open to legal challenge if they choose not to adhere to national guidance because they simply disagree with the recommendations in the guideline without strong evidence backing such a decision.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^116exKa6]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Closing the evidence-to-practice gap

Given the current challenges in offering guideline recommendations, closing the evidence-to-practice gap is key. From 2002 the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance in the UK developed standards of care for OA, building on what a person with OA should expect to receive but their implementation has been lacking. With the advent of NICE OA guidelines and NICE Quality Standards we now have a set of recommendations that can be adopted, but as yet there has been no UK audit of these.

These gaps in knowledge are recognized, and yet closing the gap is complex. The evidence we produce regarding how to deliver best care has its own limitations. The individual studies themselves can be methodologically outstanding and serve to increase knowledge, but transferring this knowledge to real world settings is difficult. Evidence underpinning the recommendations for clinical guidelines is predominantly derived from studies of knee OA, with fewer studies for the hip and even fewer for the hand and foot. Single treatment approaches are often studied in isolation and there is a lack of studies of integrated packages of care.

Lau et al. described the causes of the evidence-to-practice gap in primary care and the ways in which the evidence gap could be addressed, although even the most effective interventions such as clinical opinion leaders show at best only small effects, and there is no certainty that multiple approaches work better. What Lau and colleagues did highlight was the importance of context and the role of organizations in influencing the uptake of best practice. Context means policy such as NICE guidelines, public awareness of OA and its care, economic climate and funding, stakeholder buy-in (e.g. Sustainability Transformation Partnerships), technological advances and infrastructure to deliver best care.

For health services, Clinical Networks can offer an approach to knowledge mobilization between 'what we know' and 'what we do'. The National Clinical Director for Long Term Conditions with NHS England and the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance have made musculoskeletal health a priority across the four key regions in England with the development of musculoskeletal knowledge networks to embody the potential for sharing models of care and good practice with trusted partners within a geographic boundary.

### NICE cancer guidance: a description of the institute's clinical guideline programme [^117Tv6vU]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

GUIDELINE TOPICS

The Department of Health for England and the Welsh Assembly Government select topics for the Institute's work programme. Topics are selected on the basis of whether a guideline would:
have significant health benefits (e.g. reduce illness, disability or premature death);
have a significant impact on NHS resources;
complement one or more of the Institute's technology appraisals;
link with key Government priorities for health; and
help to resolve unacceptable variation in practice across England and Wales.

### Key recommendations and evidence from the NICE guideline for the acute management of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^115VeY6i]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

The acute management of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has seen significant changes in the past decade. Although the incidence has been declining in the UK, STEMI still gives rise to around 600 hospitalised episodes per million people each year, with many additional cases resulting in death before hospital admission. In-hospital mortality following acute coronary syndromes has fallen over the past 30 years from around 20% to nearer 5%, and this improved outcome has been attributed to various factors, including timely access to an expanding range of effective interventional and pharmacological treatments. A formal review of the acute management of STEMI is therefore appropriate. The recently published NICE clinical guideline (CG167: The acute management of myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation) provides evidence-based guidance on the acute management of STEMI, including the choice of reperfusion strategies, procedural aspects of the recommended interventions, the use of additional drugs before and longside reperfusion therapies, and the treatment of patients who are unconscious or in cardiogenic shock. The guideline development methods and detailed reviews of the evidence considered by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) can be found in the full version of the guideline (http://www.nice.org.uk/CG167), and the priority recommendations are summarised in box 1. Other related NICE clinical guidelines deal with the diagnosis of recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin http://www.nice.org.uk/CG95), the early management of unstable angina and non-STEMI (http://www.nice.org.uk/CG94), and secondary prevention after myocardial infarction (http://www.nice.org.uk/CG48, currently being updated with publication expected end of 2013).

### NICE guidelines and the epilepsies: how should practice change? [^114MTg73]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2006). Low credibility.

The care and provision for children and adults with epilepsy and their carers has recently been under scrutiny with a series of reports highlighting concerns and calling for change. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published recommendations for management of adults and children in October 2004. Although recommendations were often specific and practical they did not include precise details regarding their implementation. Key recommendations and their implications are discussed in this review.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^115cBwZm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline external review and updating — For new guidelines, external review usually takes 8 weeks (or 4 weeks for a short guideline); updated guidelines may have a shorter consultation period, depending on the scope of the update. All NICE guidelines have a validation phase that involves a consultation period for stakeholders, with the first draft posted on the NICE Web site and stakeholders invited to submit comments; the guideline center and the guideline development group respond to all comments and make changes. A guideline review panel convened by NICE reviews responses to stakeholder comments to check they have been answered appropriately and that the scope has been covered, and before publication stakeholders are invited to check for factual errors or inaccuracies in the full version; corrections are made and the final guideline is published on the NICE Web site. A check for new evidence is made 3 years after publication, after which NICE decides whether to commission a full update, a partial update, or no update.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^111imYyH]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to healthcare providers, CPGs are often leveraged by regulatory and insurance policymakers to inform access strategies for implementing recommendations and resource allocation. Similar to above, the lack of an authoritative positions on treatment recommendations within ophthalmology CPGs and their variability present a potential challenge for reimbursement. Additionally, most of the CPGs assessed failed to address issues of applicability and resource constraints, which are key barriers to optimally implementing CPGs. In the absence of CPGs, formulary management decisions may be more heavily influenced by policymaker budgets than clinical best practice.

The NICE CPG had the highest overall quality AGREE II score, as it successfully incorporated the criteria in most of the AGREE II domains. The NICE CPG could serve as a prime example of how future CPGs should be developed. The NICE CPG not only included the views and preferences of the patients, but the systematic methods to search for evidence along with clearly defined criteria for evidence selection used in its development.

### NICE cancer guidance: a description of the institute's clinical guideline programme [^114jLPC8]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This is an ambitious programme. The wide range of its portfolio makes the Institute's guidance programme among the largest in the world. Its sustainability will depend on liaising with many professional and patient organisations within the UK as well as initiating international collaborations. The Institute is looking forward to contributing to a European-wide approach to developing cancer guidelines. NICE'S responsibility for providing guidance on cost-effectiveness as well as clinical effectiveness will ensure that it will continue to be controversial and to challenge the status quo.

### Are sex and gender dimensions accounted for in NICE guidelines? A systematic review of 223 clinical guidelines [^1123QG9Q]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Similarly, when sex and gender differences in medical conditions are mentioned in clinical guidelines, this is often done in reference to how that condition interacts with pivotal stages of the female lifecourse, such as menarche and menopause, or the multiple examples of pregnancy highlighted above. This evidence underlines the clear need for a lifecourse approach in medical research and practice that foregrounds how age and sex and/or gender intersect to shape women's health. However, women's health encompasses far more than life course transitions, and it is vital that the health of all women beyond these pivotal junctures, and crucially outside of fertility and childbearing, is adequately addressed through research and healthcare delivery.

For some NICE guidelines, recommendations had changed over time, from stating that there should be sex-specific diagnostic criteria or management practices to stating that the sexes should not be assessed differently. This trend was particularly prevalent across cardiovascular guidelines, for instance the acute coronary syndrome (NG1850) or recent onset chest pain (CG95) guidelines. These instances signify that in-depth study of sex and/or gender differences has been conducted and that new evidence has been used to update guidelines in relation to sex and/or gender. However, more widely, it is not possible to identify which NICE guidelines have paid attention to and taken up new evidence on sex and/or gender dimensions and which have not. Greater clarity is needed to convey whether sex-specific guidance is due to up-to-date evidence, a lack of evidence or existing evidence not having been integrated into guideline recommendations.

### NICE cancer guidance: a description of the institute's clinical guideline programme [^114JgcUS]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

THE CLINICAL GUIDELINE PROGRAMME

NICE produces clinical guidelines (defined as systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances that cover all aspects of patient care from prevention and self-care through primary and secondary care to more specialised services.

In the past, while there have been many professional groups and organisations producing guidelines, these were of variable quality and none addressed cost-effectiveness. A guideline development programme has been designed that is evidence based, consultative, transparent and inclusive, and adheres to internationally recognised standards of practice (The). Details of the process are described in a series of manuals available at the following Internet address: The principles underlying the Institute's clinical guidelines are given in Table 2.

The main role of the Institute is to commission, coordinate and quality assure the process. To achieve this, it relies on its commissioning managers and the Guidelines Advisory Committee (to be reconfigured as guideline review panels from 1st April 2003). The members provide external validation for the guidelines by overseeing the development process, advising on the commissioning of work and monitoring the quality of the guidelines. These members have a range of backgrounds and knowledge, including guideline expertise, clinical experience, patient/carer involvement and health economics.

### National Institute for Health and Care Excellence clinical guidelines development principles and processes [^1125PyKb]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines are developed by professional societies and also, in England, by an independent non-departmental public body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Similarities and differences between these guidelines should be viewed in the context of different objectives, responsibilities and roles of guideline developers. This review describes the NICE clinical guidelines development principles and processes with the aim to provide the reader an informed perspective on the recommendations made. NICE clinical guidelines are developed by an appointed independent advisory committee comprising healthcare professionals as well as lay members, supported by a professional team comprising project managers, information specialists, systematic reviewers and health economists. Furthermore, registered stakeholders comprising organisations that have an interest in the guideline topic, or represent people whose practice or care may be directly affected by the guideline, are consulted on the draft scope and draft guidelines. NICE selects a limited number of high impact questions to be answered by the review of evidence, rather than cover a certain topic exhaustively as the clinical guidelines developed by professional societies may do. NICE clinical guidelines recommendations reflect both the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of interventions.

### Mandatory implementation of NICE guidelines for the care of bipolar disorder and other conditions in england and wales [^115fo8EH]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The case for the mandatory implementation of NICE guidelines

Box 2 summarises the potential benefits of the mandatory implementation of NICE clinical guidelines. Legislation was passed to promote the consideration of NICE clinical guidelines for health conditions by all NHS organisations in England under the Health and Social Care Act (2012), and set up a number of other bodies such as Academic Health Science Networks and strategic clinical networks to help implement evidence-based care and innovation, including NICE clinical guidelines, into practice (Fig. 1). NICE clinical guidelines are best considered as a starting point for clinical care and are not designed to cover every clinical situation that may arise, so health professionals and NHS organisations must use their judgement to optimise clinical care for each patient they see; these may be useful in other countries who wish to adopt the approach. Like most NICE clinical guidelines, the 2006 NICE Clinical Guideline for Bipolar Disorder seems to have been incompletely and variably implemented. For instance, the 2006 NICE Clinical Guideline for Bipolar Disorder recommendations concerning lithium monitoring were followed in 48–70% patients in a recent national audit, while counselling about teratogenic risk and contraception in women of childbearing age taking anticonvulsants was only 22%. There is great variation in the implementation of NICE guidelines not only between organisations but also within the same organisation over time. In particular, NICE recommendations that require changes in the organisation of care or are conflicting to established practice are poorly implemented. A more standardised and systematic approach to care as outlined by the NICE clinical guideline that is still patient centred should reduce one source of variability of outcome in patients with bipolar disorder, a condition with a highly variable outcome due to its natural history.

### Achieving high-quality care: a view from NICE [^113trJqc]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) was established in 1999 to provide evidence-based guidance. The task of producing guidance by reviewing primary research data and using an advisory committee to develop evidence-based recommendations, is not straightforward. Guidance production is, however, less challenging than the task of putting evidence-based recommendations into practice.NICE is very sensitive to this challenge as, since 1999, over 1500 pieces of NICE guidance have been published. A number of pieces of guidance relate to heart disease, including pharmaceutical agents, new medical technologies and clinical guidelines. Examples include guidelines on acute heart failure and atrial fibrillation, and advice on technologies including edoxaban and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. The research evidence is clear that a change in practice rarely comes about as a result of simply disseminating guidance on best practice. Simple dissemination is particularly ineffective if the guidance has not been produced by a well-respected, credible organisation. It is also clear from the literature that implementation is more successful when more than one approach is taken, and when there is alignment between efforts at organisational, local and national levels. At an organisational level, there should be support from the Board for quality improvement, with ongoing measurement of progress. Resources should be provided for targeted change programmes, particularly where new guidance suggests improvements are required. A systematic process for putting change in place should include identifying barriers to change, agreeing interventions to overcome the barriers and drive forward improvement and planning for implementation and evaluation.

### Are sex and gender dimensions accounted for in NICE guidelines? A systematic review of 223 clinical guidelines [^111h365P]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The importance of sex and gender in the diagnosis and management of health conditions is well established, but the extent to which sex and gender disaggregated evidence is integrated into UK clinical practice guidelines remains unknown. Recent reviews of clinical guidelines in Canada and Europe identified that limited and inconsistent attention was paid to sex and gender dimensions of health and illness. This study aimed to determine how the UK's National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines account for sex and gender.

Methods

The study reviewed all NICE guidelines categorised as 'clinical guidelines' by NICE (223), excluding those solely linked to single-sex conditions (26). Reviewers evaluated whether they included information on sex and/or gender dimensions of disease risk, presentation, investigations and management. They also examined if sex and/or gender dimensions were considered outside of pregnancy, and how the gender of guideline committee chairs and members corresponded to how well sex and/or gender were accounted for.

Results

Of 197 guidelines reviewed, 120 (61%) referenced sex and/or gender dimensions, with 81 (41%) referencing these dimensions outside of pregnancy and childbearing. A minority of guidelines mentioned sex and/or gender dimensions related to disease pathophysiology (2%), clinical presentation (9%), investigations (15%) and epidemiology (19%). 162 guidelines published details of their committee chairs, and 126 (76%) were men. Committees chaired by women tended to produce guidelines, which scored better for consideration of sex and gender.

Conclusion

This study highlights key gaps in NICE guidelines which must be addressed through systematic, whole-sector progress to integrate sex and gender disaggregated research into clinical guidelines. As the single focal point responsible for guideline development in England and Wales, NICE has a unique opportunity to establish robust mechanisms to routinely embed this important evidence in guidelines. Multiple initiatives are recommended to identify relevant existing evidence across all clinical specialties.

NICE review question formulation — The areas in scope are developed into specific review questions using the PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) framework to ensure questions are specific enough for successful literature searches, and questions may address interventions, the accuracy or clinical value of diagnostic tests, or prognostic factors; prognostic evidence may help determine risk categories or subgroups and inform patients.

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^117NmJ5y]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Whilst renaming PA as AIG can add confusion and uncertainty, the name PA has its own shortcomings, which is perhaps why NICE proposed to change it. The term 'pernicious anaemia' suggests that anaemia is a defining characteristic of the disease. However, anaemia is present in only 15–20% of PA diagnoses. Practitioners unfamiliar with PA are commonly misled by the term 'anaemia', as all ICD-10 (D51.0–9) codes for B deficiency incorrectly include the term anaemia. The term 'pernicious' is also an anachronism, predating the 1948 discovery of B as an effective treatment. It was first coined by Anton Biermer in 1871 to describe the fatal anaemia cases seen prior to the discovery of effective treatments. It is important to note that even though anaemia occurs in a minority of PA patients, this represents an important subgroup of patients that requires a different management approach. The current guidelines do not address how to specifically diagnose and manage this subgroup of patients, representing a significant gap in knowledge and warranting further research.

The definition and our understanding of the condition has evolved significantly since Biermer's original description. We now know that PA often presents with predominantly neurological symptoms. Therefore, if a name change is warranted, it should be one that better reflects the current clinical presentation of the disease.

The persistent use of the term 'pernicious anaemia' in both clinical practice (primary, secondary and tertiary care) and state-of-the-art research highlights a disconnect between these guidelines and current clinical practice. It is important to highlight that the adoption of new and more appropriate terminology would require universal acceptance by clinicians, carers and patients who would have lived with the name PA for most of their lives. While changing established medical terminology may take decades — potentially one to two generations of doctors — before it is fully adopted in clinical language, emphasising that such a change, if it were to happen, would be gradual and require effective dissemination.

However, a name change could offer significant advantages by reflecting the current understanding of PA and encouraging clinicians to investigate neurological symptoms associated with PA. This would be achieved through a concerted effort to educate doctors by incorporating this knowledge into the curriculum, which will dispel misconceptions commonly ascribed to PA patients by doctors and promote a deeper understanding of PA's complexity.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and quality assessment study [^112zT44z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review using a prospectively registered protocol (CRD42018116809) and reported in line with the PRISMA CPGs.

Literature Search

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases within the NICE Healthcare Database Advanced Search platform (hdas.nice.org.uk) using the following search terms to identify eligible CPGs on PCOS from inception until December 2020: clinical, CPGs, consensus statement, position statement, recommendation?, polycystic ovary, polycystic ovary syndrome, hyperandrogen*, anovulation, *menorrhea, wom?n, female, pregnan*. Complementary searches were conducted in Google Scholar, Tripdatabase, and Scopus. We searched the websites of established regulatory bodies on the topic of care for women with PCOS to identify relevant CPGs. We did not apply any search filters or language limitations.

Guideline Selection and Inclusion Process

Two independent reviewers (BHA and MF) completed the study selection and inclusion process in 2 stages. Discrepancies were resolved in consensus with a third reviewer (LB). We included all purpose-developed evidence-based clinical CPGs and consensus statements addressing the diagnosis and/or management of PCOS across different clinical disciplines and populations. We excluded position or opinion statements that did not make direct recommendations linked to specific evidence and systematic reviews from scientific societies. All other designs of primary or secondary studies evaluating a particular scientific question were excluded.

Data Collection

Two independent reviewers (LB and MF) extracted data in duplicate into an electronic Excel sheet, which was piloted for its face validity. Data integrity was double-checked by a third reviewer (BHA). We extracted data on the following guideline characteristics: producing authority, named authors, country of origin, year of publication, consensus method, stakeholders involved, disease domain addressed in the CPG, description of the search strategy to identify evidence, inclusion/exclusion criteria of evidence, quality assessment instruments used, and grading system used. We mapped out the clinical recommendations in each guideline and tabulated them into the following prespecified domains: diagnosis in adolescents and adults; lifestyle interventions; management of menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, acne, and infertility; and risk assessment for metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, mental health, and cancer.

### The American Society of Addiction Medicine clinical practice guideline development methodology [^112kB1et]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stakeholders — A stakeholder is any individual or group who has an interest in the guideline; or who is responsible for implementing the guideline; or is affected by the research-informed decisions of the guideline (e.g. ASAM members, people with lived experience (PWLE), clinicians, public and private funders, and policy makers). The inclusion of stakeholders in research and guideline development has been recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). People with lived experience (PWLE) of a health issue, including patients and family members, are a key stakeholder group that should be included in the design, implementation, and translation of health research within and outside addiction medicine, and the US Department of Health and Human Services recently recognized the importance of this topic and released a report on methods to engage PWLE. The report noted that "lived experience" helps to develop a deeper understanding of the conditions affecting certain populations, the solutions that are most appropriate for those impacted by the issue, and the potential harmful unintended consequences of the current and past actions taken by the existing system on the people it aims to serve.

### National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on myocardial revascularisation [^116fLngo]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiologists in the UK predominantly use the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European Society of Cardiology guidelines to help guide decision-making. This article will appraise the current recommendations from NICE regarding myocardial revascularisation and compare them with other major international guidelines. While there are many similarities, subtle differences exist. These differences arise in part due to the evidence base at time of publication, as well as from the different healthcare systems that they are designed for, and from the cost-effectiveness models that dominate the methodology used by NICE. The clinical implications of the differences between the international guidelines will be analysed.

### Comparison between National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of stable angina: implications for clinical practice [^1137Lqf8]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Two sets of guidelines: implications for practice

The NICE diagnostic guidelines changed clinical practice in the UK, most cardiologists moving away from the exercise ECG towards more accurate testing modalities for the diagnosis of CAD. The use of more sophisticated tests which, unlike the exercise ECG, cannot readily be undertaken at the initial assessment introduced logistical problems regarding their timely delivery. The ESC's diagnostic algorithm is based around stress imaging where facilities are available and the exercise ECG where stress imaging is not available.

The UK cardiologist moving to Europe would need to make few adjustments to his/her usual pharmacological management of patients with stable angina, though patients with hypertension would more often be treated with ACE inhibitors in Europe. It is probable that UK cardiologists will move towards the use of high-intensity statin therapy (specifically, atorvastatin 80 mg) in patients with stable angina following the 2014 update to NICE guidance on lipid modification, rather than reserving such therapy for patients after an ACS, and they will need to become familiar with a target based on lowering non-HDL blood cholesterol concentration rather than LDL-cholesterol lowering.

The contrasting recommendations regarding revascularisation place UK cardiologists in a quandary; should they refer only patients with left main stem and/or proximal 3-vessel disease for revascularisation for prognostic reasons, as NICE recommends, or should they also refer patients with a lower burden of CAD if the proximal left anterior descending artery is affected, particularly if there is evidence of myocardial ischaemia? Clinical decision-making in multidisciplinary team meetings is heavily influenced by the consensus view on this point. Patients with stable angina who have disease involving the proximal left anterior descending artery are less likely to be referred for myocardial revascularisation if they are managed according to NICE guidance compared with ESC guidance.

### Mandatory implementation of NICE guidelines for the care of bipolar disorder and other conditions in england and wales [^114TECsv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The case against mandatory implementation of NICE clinical guidelines

Box 3 summarises the potential harms resulting from the mandatory implementation of NICE clinical guidelines. A key issue is that the guideline accurately reflects the balance of evidence and in particular is cautious about recommendations that are very directive (i.e. "offer" or "do not do" should be used only in the face of compelling evidence versus "consider"), otherwise care may be misguided, wasteful, or harmful. Clinical guidelines for bipolar disorder and other conditions vary considerably in what they recommend, although such variation may not matter provided the guideline is used only as a starting point for clinical decision-making rather than constraint of patient-centred care. Despite efforts to achieve objectivity, consensus among clinicians, patients, and carers, and transparency of decision-making, criticism of NICE guideline recommendations remain. For instance, the recent NICE guideline on psychosis and schizophrenia has been criticised because its recommendations on cognitive behaviour therapy for schizophrenia became more directive despite no updated review of research evidence since 2009. An issue of central importance is therefore more frequent review by NICE of its evidence base for its recommendations, perhaps by an ongoing meta-analysis and a standing committee to review NICE clinical guidelines if there is sufficient evidence to potentially overturn recommendations and issue an update to the guideline. Furthermore, NICE clinical guidelines may be seen as over-reliant on the results of randomised controlled trials that often exclude most of the patients that the guideline would be applied to and extrapolate average group effects to individuals. Some critics would argue that randomised controlled trials should not be accepted as evidence unless they are complemented by evidence from routine clinical practice such as multi-centre observational cohort studies.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^1114HNHo]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to affect 3% of pregnant women in high-income countries, (Piccoli et al. 2018, #13860) which equates to between 15,000–20,000 pregnancies per year in England. The prevalence of CKD in pregnancy is predicted to rise in the future due to increasing maternal age and obesity.

Although CKD is not a barrier to reproduction in most women, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes is increased in women with CKD including pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery and accelerated loss of maternal renal function. CKD impacts on communication, decision-making, and the surveillance and management of women before, during, and after pregnancy.

Existing guidance on the management of CKD in pregnancy includes the UK Consensus Group on Pregnancy in Renal Disease (ISBN 978–1,107,124,073) and expert review. Neither Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) or National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have produced specific guidance on the management of renal disease in pregnancy. Published guidance containing information relevant to the care of women with CKD in pregnancy includes:

### Comparison between National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of stable angina: implications for clinical practice [^116poHox]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Comparison of guidelines

Guideline development

NICE published separate guidelines for diagnosis in 2010, and for the management of stable angina in 2011 (table 1). Its recommendations regarding lipid modification and hypertension are specified in its own (separate) guidelines in these areas, both of which have been updated since the publication of the NICE guidance on stable angina. The ESC guidance incorporates diagnosis and management into a single document, which was published in 2013. It refers to its own guidelines on myocardial revascularisation, which were updated in 2014.

Table 1
Summary of methodology used in the development of the clinical practice guidelines for the management of stable angina/stable coronary artery disease from NICE and the ESC

NICE includes in its diagnostic guideline adults with or without a prior diagnosis of cardiovascular disease who have recent onset chest pain suspected to be stable angina. Its management guideline is for adults who have been diagnosed with stable angina due to atherosclerotic disease. The ESC guidance incorporates a broader group which also includes patients with asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) and low-risk acute coronary syndromes.

In its guideline development, NICE posed 'key clinical questions', undertook a review of the relevant literature, critically appraised the quality of evidence, and made recommendation statements. The ESC made recommendations supported by a class of recommendation and level of evidence. Analyses of health economic data were considered by NICE but not by the ESC.

### Management of hypertensive crisis: British and Irish hypertension society position document [^116iTPTt]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure (BP) is the most prevalent and important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and disability, worldwide. In 2015, Public Health England reported that high BP affects more than 1 in 4 adults in England. The disease burden is even larger in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). There is ample, robust evidence supporting the use of antihypertensive drugs in reducing the risks of cardiovascular disease and another organ damage. In contrast, acute severe elevation in BP is much less common now than in previous decades. This may be attributed to more widespread screening, awareness, and better management and care models for chronic hypertension (HTN) especially in developed countries. Nevertheless, patients still present with hypertensive crises, which may be life-threatening, resulting in rapid end organ damage and/or death.

There is a lack of robust outcome data specifying BP targets, the speed of BP reduction and specific medications in patients with hypertensive crises (NICE, 2019). Management is largely based on expert opinion. Predictably, there is considerable heterogeneity and inconsistency in how severe HTN is managed in clinical practice, and often scant coverage in national and international HTN guidelines. Although the need to lower markedly elevated BP is widely appreciated, several factors need considering before initiating anti-hypertensive therapy. In this position paper, we aim to provide a framework for diagnosing, evaluating, and managing patients with hypertensive crisis, based on the available evidence.

An extensive literature search using PubMed and Embase was undertaken using keywords (see supplementary text). Relevant national, international guidelines and systematic reviews in disease-specific states were reviewed and where conflicting evidence was present individual clinical trial results were evaluated. Consensus-based positions were sought from hypertension specialists within the British and Irish Hypertension Society (BIHS).

### Mandatory implementation of NICE guidelines for the care of bipolar disorder and other conditions in england and wales [^111TxPck]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Responsibility for the implementation of NICE clinical guidelines is shared according to the Health and Social Care Act (2012) across a complex network involving over 620 different professional, healthcare, and social care organisations in the NHS (Fig. 1), each of whom may unilaterally decide which recommendations they choose to implement or not. Given that the care pathway runs across multiple organisations in one locality and there are multiple independently functioning localities, such an approach inevitably results in more variation in care and inefficient and ineffective care compared with the care outlined in the guideline unless the implementation of NICE clinical guidelines was mandatory. Nationally, there are no clear strategies for their implementation and no organisation is responsible for their implementation, jointly or separately. Policy in mental health is also extremely complex and might contradict itself, e.g. the draft Bipolar Disorder Quality Standards 2015, document refers to 18 other policy documents for the reader to consider at the same time. NICE itself confines its implementation efforts to its own website and a minimal workforce who work regionally on implementation of all their guidelines. NICE has developed many resources that may help the implementation of guidelines, such as guides for commissioners, and have also considerably improved the internal consistency of the guidelines so that they are increasingly compatible with each other and with other NHS policies.

Research on the implementation of any innovation provides few consistencies. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of tailored approaches to the implementation of single interventions taking into consideration the local context of care by involving local practitioners and service users, showed evidence of benefits to patients. A locally-tailored approach systematically identifying and addressing barriers and drivers to the implementation of NICE clinical guidelines has shown promise. However, the evidence on the cost effectiveness of these implementation approaches towards NICE clinical guidelines across a whole clinical pathway is lacking. One approach to achieving such implementation at a local level has been involving networks of professionals and service users working together under umbrella organisations such as the National Institute of Health Research Collaborations for Leadership in Health Research and Care, Academic Health Science Networks, and strategic clinical networks. Implementing evidence-based care in the local context so that it is effective and efficient through these networks can be experienced as an enjoyable challenging and productive experience. Such approaches require training and support, for instance, through knowledge brokers with implementation and quality assurance expertise working alongside teams of clinicians, service users, commissioners, and managers.

### The utility of the classification tools in national institute of health and clinical excellence's clinical knowledge summaries for primary care [^1154GG1t]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) provides a web-based resource of guidance, Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS), for primary care practitioners and student. It is available in the United Kingdom, Crown Dependencies, and British Territories Overseas. NICE describes CKS's purpose as, 'Providing primary care practitioners with a readily accessible summary of the current evidence base and practical advice on best practice'. The content is created by a team of experts who search for and summarise guidance. The basis for recommendations is cited at the end of each page: NICE guidelines, which have an evidence-based approach; other guidelines, from institutions other than NICE, mostly specialist societies and which may or may not have an evidence-based approach; research evidence in peer-reviewed publications; and published expert opinion.

The organisation and presentation of information are designed to facilitate rapid retrieval and reading. There is a standardised but flexible structure for each topic with sections, for example, background, assessment, and management.

Each section is displayed on a page and has subsections, such as diagnostic and referral criteria. The reader can navigate within a topic and between topics through hyperlinks. The content is displayed clearly with headings and bullet points. The content is focussed on primary care. The introduction of CKS was hailed as a most valuable resource on behalf of several primary care disciplines, dentists, general practitioners, and nurses.

CKS uses similar language to NICE for its recommendations: offer and consider (Box 1). NICE defines them thus: 'Some recommendations are made with more certainty than others. We word our recommendations to reflect this. Where there is clear and strong evidence of benefit, we will use the word 'offer'. Where the benefit is less certain we use the word 'consider'.

### Why is it so difficult to govern mobile apps in healthcare? [^116LUoWG]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2019). High credibility.

Apps are highly versatile

The versatility of apps means they can be used to support a wide variety of health information or communication services at all levels of care delivery and in the community. As apps can support a single service or a combination of services, their function may not be clear at the outset to designers. A fundamental problem here is that there is no standard use cases for apps of any type and therefore the implementation of information and communication services is ad hoc. While NICE's guidelines for digital health technologies distinguish broad categories of functionality, their implementation is left to developers. For instance, asthma management: the use case for what specific functions apps must support, including information provision, peak flow and symptom diaries, and medication tracking, is fluid and currently evolving with developments in technology and medical research. While the functionality of apps, or any other software to support health services, should be based on clinical standards that provide evidence-based requirements for information and communication, the slow rate at which such standards are produced presents a challenge for clinical governance because without standardised use cases, apps are providing functionality where there is no clear understanding of risk.

The lack of standard use cases makes it difficult to lay down clear rules for clinical governance of apps. With current regulations for medical devices, there is only a subtle difference between apps which are considered medical devices and those that are not. For example, symptom checkers are considered to be a medical device if they provide a subset of medical conditions matching the symptoms entered by users, indicate the likelihood of a match, or provide treatment recommendations. Yet, those that list all conditions matching the symptoms entered by users and provide signposts to suitable care are not considered medical devices.

Apps also pose challenges for applying clinical governance processes because they are used at all levels of care delivery and in the community. For instance, consumer health information is the purview of public health where the reliability and credibility of information is a prime consideration. In contrast, prevention and management of disease involve formal care delivery settings often with treatment by health professionals. This raises complex issues in processes to assess and manage risk because across these contexts, there is no consensus about the level of acceptable safety among health service providers, clinicians and regulators.

### NICE to HELP: operationalizing national institute for health and clinical excellence guidelines to improve clinical practice [^115h5qXb]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom developed guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of delirium in July 2010 that included 10 recommendations for delirium prevention. The Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) is a targeted multicomponent strategy that has proven effective and cost-effective at preventing functional and cognitive decline in hospitalized older persons. HELP provided much of the basis for seven of the NICE recommendations. Given interest by new HELP sites to meet NICE guidelines, three new protocols addressing hypoxia, infection, and pain that were not previously included in the HELP program were developed. In addition, the NICE dehydration guideline included constipation, which was not specifically addressed in the HELP protocols. This project describes the systematic development of three new protocols (hypoxia, infection, pain) and the expansion of an existing HELP protocol (constipation and dehydration) to achieve alignment between the HELP protocols and NICE guidelines. Following the Institute of Medicine recommendations for developing trustworthy guidelines, an interdisciplinary group of experts conducted a systematic review of current literature, rated the quality of the evidence, developed intervention protocols based on the highest-quality evidence, and submitted the protocols first to internal review and then to external review by an interdisciplinary panel of experts. The protocols were revised based on the review process and incorporated into the HELP materials. Inclusion of these protocols enhances the scope of the HELP program and allows fulfillment of NICE guideline recommendations for delirium prevention. The rigorous process applied may provide a useful example for updating existing guidelines or protocols that may be applicable to a broad range of clinical applications.

### Depression and cardiovascular disease: mind the gap in the guidelines [^116pzFcp]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study has several strengths. It is the first to evaluate how CVD CPGs address depression. In particular, we identified inconsistencies across CPGs in the extent to which depression is addressed, with fewer than one in four providing comprehensive screening and treatment recommendations for its management. Furthermore, our findings show that recommendations often lack a systematic approach, and vary widely in scope and depth, even among guidelines for the same cardiovascular condition. Our study has some limitations. We may have missed some guidelines in databases we did not search. We did not include CPGs published before 2013 or in languages other than English. However, our search covered all major medical societies issuing CVD CPGs, and we therefore believe our results adequately illustrate how depression is currently addressed in the evaluated CVD conditions. This review did not cover all CVDs, which may narrow the scope of our findings. Other conditions, including congenital heart disease, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart diseases, or cardiomyopathies, undoubtedly warrant the same detailed attention in relation to their guidance on depression and should be the focus of a future dedicated systematic review. We did not analyse regional differences between CPGs; however, the widespread adoption of ESC, AHA, or NICE CPGs across different regions may complicate such an analysis. The analysis of pathology-specific disparities across cardiovascular conditions and their interactions with depression fell outside the scope of this review, as did the analysis of how mental health CPGs address CVD. All these areas warrant further investigation for improved cardiovascular condition-specific management strategies. Detailed analysis of recommendations, including variations in grading across guidelines for similar recommendations and the impact of different grading methodologies was beyond the scope of this review. These aspects, together with the clinical applicability of recommendations, consistency in recommendations across CPGs, and potential gaps in guidance for comorbid conditions warrant further investigation. We did not use the AGREE II toolas the aim was not to assess the quality of the guidelines, compare them against established criteria, or identify strengths and weaknesses in their development processes. Instead, our aim was solely to determine whether CVD CPGs currently available to clinicians address depression and provide recommendations on its management, which falls outside the scope of the AGREE II framework.

### Can we measure whether asthma guidelines lead to improved care? [^111NdquG]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) and Scottish Intercollege Guidelines Network (SIGN), as well as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), have previously produced separate asthma guidance differing in some key aspects in diagnosis and management leading to confusion, potentially hampering guideline dissemination and uptake. While there are inherent challenges, the upcoming release of new joint BTS/SIGN/NICE asthma guidance presents an opportunity to assess guideline adoption and its impact on clinical practice. The use of prescription data via databases such as OpenPrescribing can be used as a surrogate for guideline adoption and potentially linked to clinical outcomes such as hospital episode statistics (HES). The potential recommendation for anti-inflammatory reliever therapy (AIR) and maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) with inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol combination therapy in the next iteration of UK asthma guidance will require the accurate coding for the respective therapeutic approaches on prescribing platforms in order to assess their impact in real-life clinical practice. This could then direct targeted measures to improve wider guidance adoption leading to better clinical care in asthma based on up to date evidence.

### Comparison between National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of stable angina: implications for clinical practice [^1143MHHV]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The clinical practice guidelines most relevant to cardiologists in the UK are those produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Contemporary guidance is based on the same (or a very similar) evidence base, yet recommendations from the two bodies may differ. The aim of this review was to compare the main recommendations from NICE and the ESC regarding the management of stable angina.

### Occupational health advice in NICE guidelines [^115WbE1G]. Occupational Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sickness absence is a major concern for society costing > pound 13 billion annually. Seeking medical advice is highly recommended in managing sickness absence. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) provides guidance on treating ill-health and promoting public health. NICE has published > 500 guidelines. There are three versions of each guideline including full (comprehensive version), NICE (summary of recommendations) and public version.

Aims

To evaluate the availability of occupational health advice within relevant NICE guidelines.

Methods

Guidelines were selected on the basis of the impact of the disease and its treatment on work ability. All selected guidelines were reviewed for occupational health advice. The findings were categorized in five main domains: impact of the disease on work, impact of work on the disease, rehabilitation, fitness to work and modifications.

Results

Thirty-one published guidelines met the inclusion criteria. Advice on rehabilitation is most frequently referred to with 12 (39%) full, 8 (26%) NICE and 4 (13%) public information guidelines offering advice on this domain. Advice on return to work is the least frequent. The public versions of guidelines rarely offer advice on the studied domains. Occupational health organizations are enlisted as stakeholders in one guideline only. Two occupational health professionals have contributed to the development of two guidelines.

Conclusions

This study suggests that occupational health professionals and organizations should participate more actively in developing NICE guidelines to integrate work-related issues and occupational health advice into NICE guidelines.

### Mandatory implementation of NICE guidelines for the care of bipolar disorder and other conditions in england and wales [^116PMRgh]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

NICE was formed in 1999 by the United Kingdom government to develop national standards of healthcare to reduce variation in clinical care across different parts of England and Wales, but not Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the devolved government sets health policy. NICE now produces different types of guidance: clinical guidelines for healthcare, public health guidelines, social care guidelines, technology appraisal, and guidance on interventional procedures, medical technologies, and diagnostic agents. Only some technology appraisals are mandatory for implementation by publicly funded healthcare organisations, namely the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales. Clinical guidelines consider the whole care pathway for a condition from primary care to secondary care. NICE Quality Standards (Box 1) are specific measurable statements derived principally from the NICE clinical guidelines when practice is variable, but the evidence base for recommendations from the guideline is robust. They are auditable for quality improvement so that commissioners and services can demonstrate whether practice has improved. Neither clinical guidelines nor quality standards are mandatory for implementation by healthcare organisations or health professionals. It is the author's view that they should be the starting point for all clinical care and, with respect to all recommendations concerning safety, the minimum standard of care expected in the NHS. Their implementation should be a mandatory responsibility for all healthcare commissioners, providers, inspection bodies, health professionals, and professional bodies responsible for licensing, registration, training, and revalidation. Otherwise, access to high standards of practice will remain variable, patients and carers are not empowered because they do not know what to expect, and care is less clinically safe, effective, and cost-effective than it should be.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^114jLJco]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hypertension guideline — recommendation strength and categories are based on confidence in the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes: "If the Work Group is more confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a strong recommendation", whereas "If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation". A recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure "indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences", and a recommendation against "indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences". When evidence is insufficient, "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a specific therapy or preventive measure", and "the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum" including Strong For, Weak For, No recommendation for or against, Weak Against, and Strong Against. Weak (For or Against) recommendations "may also be termed "Conditional", "Discretionary", or "Qualified", and "may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented". Recommendation categorization was "adapted from those used by NICE".

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder [^111tM38L]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Categorization and updating of recommendations — evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) "should be current", and except for an original version of a new CPG, staying current typically requires revision of previous versions "based on new evidence or as scheduled subject to time-based expirations". As an example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force "aims to review each topic at least every five years for either an update or reaffirmation". The guideline states that "Recommendation categories were used to track how the previous CPG's recommendations could be reconciled", and that these categories and their definitions are "similar to those used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, England)".

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^116c7P8k]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The publication of the 2024 NICE guidelines on B 12 deficiency represents progress but falls short by proposing to rename 'pernicious anaemia' with 'autoimmune gastritis'.This change does not adequately address the distinct nature of PA as an advanced stage of AIG, characterised by IF deficiency requiring lifelong B 12 treatment. Although severe and life-threatening anaemia due to PA is rare today, PA remains a specific condition that requires recognition and appropriate management. The guidelines currently lack detailed protocols for diagnosing PA, especially in patients without typical gastrointestinal symptoms, and rely on tests with limited sensitivity and specificity. Despite these limitations, the guidelines do highlight the importance of a symptom-based approach and prioritise critical research initiatives to address many of the current shortcomings associated with the patient journey. Future revisions should better distinguish PA from AIG, incorporate comprehensive diagnostic pathways that can be implemented in practice, and emphasise educating medical students and professionals to improve diagnosis, effective management and prognosis of PA.

### NICE cancer guidance: a description of the institute's clinical guideline programme [^111fmnbd]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES

Each clinical guideline is developed in a process comprising seven phases: initiation, scoping, elaboration of a work plan, development, validation, publication and dissemination, review and update.

Initiation

The Department of Health and the Welsh Assembly Government formally refer the guidelines work programme to the Institute. Once referred, notification of the programme is given through a press release and via the Institute's web site. A topic is allocated to a National Collaborating Centre, which begins the scoping exercise for the guidelines producing a provisional timetable for the work programme, drawing up timelines and identifying potential stakeholders for each guideline. A provisional timetable and details of the work programme are posted on the Institute's web site.

For the purposes of the Institute's clinical guideline development, stakeholders are:
the national patient and carer organisations that represent people whose care is described in the guideline;
the national organisations that represent the healthcare professionals who are directly providing the services described in the guideline;
the companies or manufacturers of the medicines or devices used in the clinical area covered by the guideline and whose interests are may be significantly affected by the guideline;
a number of primary care organisations and acute trusts–these organisations are invited to act as NHS stakeholders for a particular guideline; and
the Department of Health and Welsh Assembly Government.

Scoping

The scoping document is then drawn up. It describes the aspects of care that the guideline will cover, the background epidemiology, the population, the healthcare setting, and inclusions and exclusions of interventions and treatments. This goes through a period of external consultation following which the final scope is posted on the Institute's web site.

During the scoping phase, there is a meeting with all stakeholder organisations. In addition, the Patient Involvement Unit arranges a meeting for patient/carer stakeholder organisations to describe the opportunities for them to contribute to guideline development (including opportunities to nominate patient/carer representatives to sit on the Guideline Development Group) and to discuss the scope of the guideline and what this might mean to patients and carers.

Elaboration of a work plan

Following agreement of the scope with the Collaborating Centre, the Institute works with the NCC to prepare a detailed work plan. This will follow a standard template and includes information on costs, timelines, methodology and the proposed membership of the Guideline development Group.

### National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on monitoring and management of Barrett's oesophagus and stage I oesophageal adenocarcinoma [^112CaZBe]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

3. NICE guideline processes and methods

The guideline was developed using the methods described in the.NICE develops evidence-based guidelines based on the best available clinical and health economic evidence.

A scope was developed detailing the topic areas and clinical questions to be addressed within the guideline. A consultation to seek the views of stakeholders was held, and the scope was amended based on the stakeholder comments received.

A committee to develop the guideline was appointed through an open application process, consisting of clinicians with experience in management of Barrett's oesophagus and stage 1 oesophageal adenocarcinoma, as well as lay members. The committee included gastroenterologists, upper GI surgeons, radiologist, pathologist, oncologist, nurse endoscopist, general practitioners (GP), dietician and lay members.

Developing clinical questions and literature searches

Fourteen review questions were developed based on the key areas of the guideline scope (online supplementary table 1). A review protocol was developed for each question using a framework defining the different aspects making up the review question. The PICO framework was used to define: the population, the intervention, the comparator and the outcomes for intervention reviews. The population, index test, reference standard and target condition framework was used for diagnostic test accuracy reviews, and population, setting and context for qualitative reviews. The frameworks guided the systematic literature searches undertaken for each review question, to identify relevant published clinical and health economic evidence and inform the recommendations made by the guideline committee.

Electronic databases were searched using relevant medical subject headings, free-text terms derived from the protocol frameworks and, where appropriate, study-type filters to prioritise the inclusion of evidence of the highest available quality. For intervention reviews, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) considered the most appropriate type of study to assess the effectiveness of interventions, were searched for using Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and Epistemonikos electronic databases. Where no evidence from RCTs was available, non-randomised studies were subsequently searched for and included as appropriate. For diagnostic accuracy reviews, a search was made for observational studies. Qualitative studies, questionnaires and surveys were searched for qualitative reviews using Medline, Embase, Current Nursing and Allied Health, Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO electronic databases.

### Review of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on chronic heart failure [^115YvQt8]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines are more accessible than ever and represent an important tool in clinical practice. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has developed recommendations for heart failure diagnosis and management based not only on morbidity and mortality trial outcome data but also in-depth economic analysis, with a focus on generalisability to UK National Health Service clinical practice. There is broad consistency in structure and content between NICE guidelines and those produced by major cardiovascular organisations such as the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology. However, important differences do exist-largely attributable to publication timing-a factor that is enhanced by the rapid pace of heart failure research. This article reviews the most recent iteration of NICE chronic heart failure guidelines and compares them with major guidelines on an international scale. Variations in recommendations will be explored including implications for NICE guideline updates in the future.

### Asthma diagnosis: a comparison of established diagnostic guidelines in adults with respiratory symptoms [^112WrqaG]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The heterogenous nature of asthma makes it unlikely that there will be a single diagnostic test for the condition, hence the need for diagnostic guidance and algorithms. Current guidance for diagnosing asthma also shows significant heterogeneity both in the tests included, the order of these tests and diagnostic thresholds recommended. Further, there is little evidence that the performance or feasibility of published guidance has been tested prior to implementation. We have evaluated three sets of guidance (ERS, NICE and GINA) within a population of adults with symptoms suggestive of asthma who underwent extensive diagnostic tests before and after starting treatment with ICS. Guidelines from NICE and GINA provided excellent specificity but lacked sensitivity for the diagnosis of asthma, thus affording excellent utility for ruling-in asthma, but limited ability to rule it out. In contrast, ERS guidelines provided reasonable sensitivity and specificity, but resulted in misdiagnosis (both under- or over-diagnosis) in 1 in 6 people with suggestive symptoms and so left a problematic degree of uncertainty. Importantly, and irrespective of the gold standard used in this study (EPOER), concordance between the three published guidelines being tested was only moderate (≤ 0.5), so that even where sensitivity and specificity were similar, different individuals were diagnosed with asthma. These original observations have significant implications for the diagnosis, and therefore management, of asthma.

### Are sex and gender dimensions accounted for in NICE guidelines? A systematic review of 223 clinical guidelines [^111zAcqH]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

It is essential that NICE identifies where genuine evidence gaps persist, and where high-quality evidence is already published but has not been systematically integrated into relevant clinical guidelines. We call on NICE to undertake several initiatives to identify the existing key evidence on sex and/or gender dimensions across all clinical specialties. Recommended initiatives include a large-scale consultation, systematic review of the relevant literature and engagement with leading experts, all to identify existing key evidence. Based on the findings from these exercises, NICE should publish recommendations to highlight the most urgent data gaps. NICE should also establish a mechanism to regularly embed relevant sex and/or gender disaggregated evidence in guidelines and flag this to users. In particular, NICE should include a mandatory specific question on sex and/or gender in all future guideline consultations published. We further encourage NICE to expand their equity responsibilities beyond sex and gender to consider race, ethnicity, age and how these intersect.

In summary, this systematic review demonstrates considerable gaps in how NICE clinical guidelines account for sex and gender dimensions of health and illness, suggesting NICE has not accounted for these critical dimensions throughout guideline development in a standardised way. It also highlights that increased representation of women among guideline development committee chairs is likely to improve guidelines' consideration of sex and gender dimensions. As a single body dedicated to clinical guideline development — a rarity in most health systems — NICE has a unique opportunity to pioneer robust and consistent mechanisms to ensure and promote more accurate, inclusive and evidence-based healthcare recommendations that can reduce health inequities and improve patient outcomes for all. The NHS has a long-term goal to provide personalised medicine, but until these critical aspects of evidence generation and clinical management are accounted for, providing intersectional and personalised healthcare remains a distant possibility.

This article calls on NICE to invest in addressing these critical gaps, including running a consultation to identify and embed key evidence on sex and/or gender dimensions across all guidelines wherever relevant.

### Diagnosing and managing acute heart failure guidelines: NICE… [^112pcprF]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question How should new onset acute heart failure be identified and treated. Bottom Line There is not much new in these guidelines except some caveats on what not to do. Diagnose new acute heart failure with a natriuretic peptide measurement and, if the level is high, follow with transthoracic echocardiography. Do not routinely treat with opiates, nitrates, inotropes, vasopressors, or continuous positive airway pressure ventilation. Almost all of their recommendations are based on very low quality evidence, often from nonrandomized studies. It is not that their recommendations are suspect; it is more of a comment on the state of the evidence for treatment of a very common problem. Synopsis These guidelines come from the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

They suggest a two-step method of diagnosing suspected acute heart failure: Perform a single measurement of either serum natriuretic peptides and, if greater than 100 pg per mL for B-type natriuretic peptide or 300 pg per mL for N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, follow with transthoracic echocardiography within 48 hours. Treat with a diuretic and a beta blocker, and consider starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in patients with reduced ejection fraction. Consider an aldosterone antagonist only in patients who cannot tolerate either of these approaches. The guidelines specifically recommend against several treatment approaches: routine use of opiate, nitrate, inotrope, or vasopressor therapy, and routine noninvasive ventilation.

### Shared decision-making: guidelines from the national institute for… [^115jHVUL]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

|From the AFP Editors| Shared decision-making between physicians and patients is a vital component of effective health care. Shared decision-making can improve patient experience and satisfaction, increase trust, and improve understanding of the risks and benefits of available options. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published guidelines to offer practical advice for incorporating shared decision-making into everyday encounters. DURING THE VISIT NICE recommends the use of evidence-based models to enhance shared decision-making in clinical practice. The three-talk model is a shared decision-making framework with strong supporting evidence for all of the components. Specifically, the stages include team talk, option talk, and decision talk, and they help clinicians structure the shared decision-making process during the visit. Table 1 lists recommendations for effectively communicating risks and benefits.

Risks can be presented using infographics containing numbers and pictures to display positive and negative effects together. Patient decision tools reliably enhance patient understanding if they are quality-assured and relevant. Quality clinical support tools are discussed in a standards framework from NICE. FOLLOWING THE DISCUSSION Patients should be given resources to review after the discussion. These could include information about the diagnosis, options for treatment, and a summary of the conclusion of the discussion. Physicians should provide links to high-quality online resources and inform patients whom to contact for other questions after the visit. In addition, sending a letter summarizing the details of the discussion to the patient and other physicians involved in the patient's care is helpful.

Editor's Note: Shared decision-making is recommended by nearly every clinical practice guideline, yet it is rarely explained in any detail. Although we understand shared decision-making as respecting patient autonomy, this is the first evidence-based guideline addressing techniques. This NICE guideline is proposed as a roadmap for the British National Health Service and suggests a path for our own health care organizations. –Michael J. Arnold, MD, Contributing Editor.

### Mandatory implementation of NICE guidelines for the care of bipolar disorder and other conditions in england and wales [^111yz3DB]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Box 3. Potential harms of mandatory implementation of NICE Clinical Guidelines in bipolar disorder

Poor recommendations because scientific evidence is lacking, misleading or misinterpreted.
Recommendations influenced by personal opinion of key members of clinical guideline, professional interest, financial or professional conflict of interest.
Lack of consistency in recommendations between national clinical guidelines for the same conditions.
Institutionalise delivery of ineffective, harmful, or wasteful interventions.
Professionals and NHS organisations unfairly judged by quality standards or other measures that are not in their control.
Uncertainty over cost and impact of NICE clinical guidelines if there are unanticipated effects; costs may sometimes increase if, for instance, more patients are referred to secondary care without any improvement in outcome.
Perceived threat to independence of health professionals and their ability to personalise care of people with atypical presentations.
Perceived threat to patient-centred care because clinical guidelines are thought to predetermine clinical decision-making without consideration of patient preference.
Professional disagreement over the nature of evidence underlying clinical decision-making.
NICE guidelines discount learning from clinical practice and non-random controlled trial evidence on interventions that nevertheless may be informative for practice.
Increased demand for training, time and other resources among health professionals on how to use and what to deliver in NICE clinical guidelines.
Lack of consideration of comorbidity, atypical presentation, and clinical uncertainty since clinical guidelines cannot predict every clinical situation.
Discourage individual innovation that is inconsistent with NICE clinical guideline care except in research.
Complexity of information in NICE clinical guidelines seen as a potential barrier to obtaining care by some patients who lack confidence or trust in dealing with NHS professionals or organisations.
Relative absence of research to understand why some clinicians seem to ignore clinical guidelines so a mandatory requirement for implementation may not be effective.
Mandatory implementation of guidelines may open NHS bodies to additional legal challenges and complaints if NICE clinical guidelines are not followed by them.

### British thoracic society community acquired pneumonia guideline and the NICE pneumonia guideline: how they fit together [^112VLedx]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The larger number of recommendations in the BTS Guideline compared with the NICE Pneumonia Guideline is partly due to differences in the scope of these two guidelines. Some of the areas covered in the BTS Guideline that were not evaluated for the NICE Guideline include the management of specific pathogens commonly associated with CAP, failure to improve and complications related to CAP.

Where the two guidelines overlap, there is considerable harmony. No major differences are evident in relation to the main pillars supporting the management of CAP. The NICE Guideline accordingly updates and strengthens the importance of these aspects of care. The BTS CAP Guideline remains valid with respect to these recommendations as does the BTS CAP Care Bundle, which contains these key elements.

For the five BTS recommendations where major differences with the NICE Pneumonia Guideline exist, adherence to the NICE Pneumonia Guideline is recommended in preference to the BTS Guideline. With respect to the duration of antibiotic therapy for low severity CAP, in the UK many local hospital antibiotic guidelines currently already advocate a 5-day course as opposed to a 7-day course. This is in keeping with the broader objective of avoiding antibiotic overuse. The NICE Guideline adds valuable evidence-based support for this action.

The topic of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) in patients with respiratory failure due to CAP was evaluated for the NICE Guideline and a NICE research recommendation was made but no practice recommendation. This stance from NICE is similar to the tone of the BTS Guidelines which recommends that 'Neither non-invasive ventilation (NIV) nor continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) support is routinely indicated in the management of patients with respiratory failure due to CAP', and 'If a trial of non-invasive support is considered indicated in CAP, it must only be conducted in a critical care area where immediate expertise is available to enable a rapid transition to invasive ventilation'.

Many recommendations included in the BTS CAP Guideline covered topic areas that were not evaluated for the NICE Guideline. A review of the evidence base related to these recommendations is desirable in order to bring these recommendations up to date. In the meantime, these recommendations remain valid.

To help users clearly identify areas of overlap between the two guidelines, an annotated version of the BTS CAP Guideline has been produced and is available on the BTS website:

### NICE guideline on ME / CFS: robust advice based on a thorough review of the evidence [^116fAKtc]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2021, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence produced an evidence-based guideline on the diagnosis and management of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a disabling long-term condition of unknown cause. The guideline provides clear support for people living with ME/CFS, their families and carers, and for clinicians. A recent opinion piece published in the journal suggested that there were anomalies in the processing and interpretation of the evidence when developing the guideline and proposed eight areas where these anomalies were thought to have occurred. We outline how these opinions are based on a misreading or misunderstanding of the guideline process or the guideline, which provides a balanced and reasoned approach to the diagnosis and management of this challenging condition.

### Comparison between National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of stable angina: implications for clinical practice [^113NubeD]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiologists in the UK use clinical practice guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) to aid clinical decision-making. This review compares their recommendations regarding stable angina. NICE's diagnostic algorithm changed clinical practice in the UK, with most cardiologists moving from the exercise ECG towards newer, more accurate imaging modalities such as CT and MRI for diagnostic testing in patients with a low or medium probability of coronary artery disease (CAD), and directly to invasive coronary angiography in patients with a high probability of CAD. ESC guidelines are based around stress imaging for most patient groups. Both guidelines stress the importance of optimal medical therapy for patients with stable angina. NICE recommends coronary artery bypass graft surgery to improve prognosis for patients with left main stem and/or proximal 3-vessel disease, whereas the ESC also includes proximal left anterior descending artery disease among its indications for revascularisation to improve prognosis, particularly if there is evidence of myocardial ischaemia. The relation between disease complexity and 5-year clinical outcomes after revascularisation in patients with left main stem and/or 3-vessel CAD has been integrated into ESC guidance through the use of the SYNTAX score to aid treatment selection in this group of patients. Patients with stable angina who have disease involving the proximal left anterior descending artery are less likely to undergo myocardial revascularisation if they are managed according to NICE's guidance compared with the ESC's guidance.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^111tfpn6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Clinical Guideline Centre methods — editorial independence and conflicts of interest state that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence provides funding for the National Clinical Guideline Centre and the other guideline-developing centers; however, the guideline development group develops the draft guidelines independently of NICE, and representatives from NICE may attend guideline development group meetings as observers. During the validation process for the guideline, NICE conducts assurance checks that correct processes have been followed and that the guideline meets expected standards of quality, and the guidance executive for NICE signs off the guideline recommendations before they go forward for publication. All members of the guideline development group and the staff of the guideline center declare any potential conflicts of interest; interests are declared at every meeting and are categorized as personal pecuniary, family pecuniary, nonpersonal pecuniary, and personal nonpecuniary interests; guideline development group members are not permitted to take part in discussions relating to areas for which they have a serious conflict of interest, including those regarding evidence, drafting of specific recommendations, and writing particular sections of the guideline document; decisions about whether a conflict of interest exists are made by the chair of the guideline and the director of the guideline center; the staff of the guideline center cannot work on a guideline area for which they have a conflict of interest; and these declarations of interest are published in the minutes of the meeting and in the full version of the final guideline.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^116vzj7L]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ACP clinical guidelines — grading certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) — defines certainty levels and links them to recommendation strength. High is defined as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate as "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low as "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) "grades the strength of each recommendation as strong or conditional", and "Strong recommendations are generally based on high or moderate certainty in evidence", though "In rare and extenuating circumstances, a strong recommendation may be based on low-certainty evidence–for example, when the evidence indicates a substantial net benefit in a life-threatening situation". For Strong recommendations, certainty is "High or moderate", the balance is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", they "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered for use as performance measures". For Conditional recommendations, certainty can be "High, moderate, or low", benefits "probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", applicability "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and policymaking "will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### Are sex and gender dimensions accounted for in NICE guidelines? A systematic review of 223 clinical guidelines [^114vdhdf]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

The importance of sex and gender in the diagnosis and management of health conditions is well established, but the extent to which sex and gender disaggregated evidence is integrated into UK clinical practice guidelines remains unknown. Recent reviews of clinical guidelines in Canada and Europe identified that limited and inconsistent attention was paid to sex and gender dimensions of health and illness. This study aimed to determine how the UK's National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines account for sex and gender.

Methods

The study reviewed all NICE guidelines categorised as 'clinical guidelines' by NICE (223), excluding those solely linked to single-sex conditions (26). Reviewers evaluated whether they included information on sex and/or gender dimensions of disease risk, presentation, investigations and management. They also examined if sex and/or gender dimensions were considered outside of pregnancy, and how the gender of guideline committee chairs and members corresponded to how well sex and/or gender were accounted for.

Results

Of 197 guidelines reviewed, 120 (61%) referenced sex and/or gender dimensions, with 81 (41%) referencing these dimensions outside of pregnancy and childbearing. A minority of guidelines mentioned sex and/or gender dimensions related to disease pathophysiology (2%), clinical presentation (9%), investigations (15%) and epidemiology (19%). 162 guidelines published details of their committee chairs, and 126 (76%) were men. Committees chaired by women tended to produce guidelines, which scored better for consideration of sex and gender.

Conclusion

This study highlights key gaps in NICE guidelines which must be addressed through systematic, whole-sector progress to integrate sex and gender disaggregated research into clinical guidelines. As the single focal point responsible for guideline development in England and Wales, NICE has a unique opportunity to establish robust mechanisms to routinely embed this important evidence in guidelines. Multiple initiatives are recommended to identify relevant existing evidence across all clinical specialties.

### Are sex and gender dimensions accounted for in NICE guidelines? A systematic review of 223 clinical guidelines [^112BgKSz]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Sex and gender play fundamental roles in shaping individual and population health. Across a spectrum of medical conditions, from dementia and cardiovascular disease to neurodivergence and autoimmunity, sex and gender impact disease risk, presentation and progression, as well as treatment efficacy, side effects and dosing.

Historically and today, limited attention has been paid to sex and gender dimensions in medical research, leading to inequities in clinical care and health outcomes. For example, women with acute myocardial infarction are 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed than men, experiencing higher early mortality and reduced long-term survival. Men experience substantially higher mortality than women after a hip fracture, where cumulative mortality at 12 months compared with the general population is 37.1% higher in men and 26.4% higher in women.41% of transgender people report that healthcare staff lack understanding about their health needs, particularly regarding how gender-affirming hormone therapies may interact with other medical conditions or treatments. Similar gaps exist for patients who are intersex or have variations of sex characteristics.

Clinical guidelines synthesise evidence across a range of medical specialties to set the standard for clinical best practice and to promote uniformly high-quality care. Guidelines aim to remove subjectivity and associated room for bias and assumptions in favour of evidence-based care. In the UK since 1999, guidelines are developed by expert committees and hosted by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), an executive non-departmental public body that is funded by and accountable to the UK Government's Department of Health and Social Care.

Recent reviews of clinical practice guidelines in Canadaand Europeidentified that limited attention is paid to sex and gender dimensions. There are also inconsistencies in how sex and gender dimensions are integrated across these guidelines. Canadian and European government funders have led the way in promoting a sex and gender lens in health and illness through adoption of policies for research design in 2011 and 2016, respectively. In the UK, the Government's Medical Research Council introduced the first sex and gender policy in 2023. Since 2023, over 16 funders, including the government's National Institute for Health and Care Research, are collaborating through the Medical Science Sex and Gender Equity (MESSAGE) project to improve practice through sector-wide design and implementation of policies.

This study sought to understand how sex and gender considerations are currently integrated into NICE guidelines, which steer UK clinical practice.

### NICE-accredited commissioning guidance for weight assessment and management clinics: a model for a specialist multidisciplinary team approach for people with severe obesity [^1136PyBH]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Despite increasing prevalence of obesity, no country has successfully implemented comprehensive pathways to provide advice to all the severely obese patients that seek treatment. We aimed to formulate pathways for referral into and out of weight assessment and management clinics (WAMCs) that include internal medicine/primary care physicians as part of a multidisciplinary team that could provide specialist advice and interventions, including referral for bariatric surgery. Using a National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-accredited process, a Guidance Development Group conducted a literature search identifying existing WAMCs. As very few examples of effective structures and clinical pathways existed, the current evidence base for optimal assessment and management of bariatric surgery patients was used to reach a consensus. The model we describe could be adopted internationally by health services to manage severely obese patients.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^1168mW9e]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

This clinical practice guideline provides recommendations on the management of anaemia of chronic kidney disease (ACKD) and serves as an update of the 5th edition module published online in 2010. The recommendations in this update have been graded using the modified GRADE system to indicate both the strength of each recommendation (strong or weak) and level of evidence for the recommendation (A-D). As in the previous module The Renal Association (RA) endorses the NICE Guideline for anaemia management in chronic kidney disease 2015 and adopts in this guideline update the nomenclature for classifying CKD from the NICE Guideline for chronic kidney disease in adults 2014.

This guideline update covers the management of anaemia in adults, children and young people with anaemia associated with CKD. While there is no universally accepted classification for categorising the population with anaemia of CKD by age, this guideline adopts the classification set out in NICE Guideline defined as follows:
children: 0–13 years
young people: 14–17 years
adults: 18 years and over

For this guideline update systematic literature searches were undertaken to identify all published clinical evidence relevant to the review questions. Databases were searched for all published papers between January 2009 and November 2016, using relevant medical subject headings, free-text terms and study-type filters where appropriate. All searches were conducted in MEDLINE, PUBMED, Embase, and The Cochrane Library. Data search used the following search terms:
Anaemia and CKD
Anaemia and dialysis
Blood transfusion and dialysis
Erythropoietin, EPO, ESA
ESA Resistance
Immunosuppression and anaemia
Immunosuppression and EPO
Immunosuppression and blood transfusion
Iron deficiency
Iron therapy
Iron toxicity
Pure red cell aplasia
Anaemia and dialysis
Renal anaemia
Renal transplant and anaemia
Renal transplant and blood transfusion
Renal transplant and EPO

This guideline is an update on previous Renal Association guidelines published in November 2010. The search covered the period from January 2009 to November 2016. The previous guidelines covered the periods prior to the above dates. Articles not written in English were not assessed. Articles available in abstract forms; letters; case reports; editorials or review articles were also excluded. Articles were assessed for relevance to the guideline topic, eligibility for inclusion in the evidence base for that guideline and methodological quality.

### Review of the role of NICE in promoting the adoption of innovative cardiac technologies [^112YNWbT]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

NICE publishes TA Guidance for single or multiple technologies, including a recently introduced fast-track appraisal for those that offer exceptional value for money. The publication of a TA follows a request from the Department of Health and potential topics for TA assessment are mostly identified by the National Institute for Health Research Innovation Observatory. Suitable technologies include those that are likely to offer health benefits or contribute to health-related government policy but where implementation is likely to be cost incurring. The appraisal comprises an evidence-based assessment of clinical and cost-effectiveness, and recommendations about adoption result from a consideration of possible health benefits as well as the opportunity costs associated with the displacement of other treatments. There have been seven TAs published for medical devices that relate to the heart or circulation (table 5).

Table 5
A summary of NICE Technology Appraisals (TAs) relating to the heart or circulation

The relatively small number of cardiac device-related TAs is reflective of the current priority of the programme to use resources most effectively in publishing guidance on pharmacological technologies where the cost implications of adoption across the NHS are usually considerably greater than for medical devices and where (because of regulatory requirements) the published evidence is often of high quantity and quality to support an assessment of comparative effectiveness. NICE Guidelines (NG) (published as Clinical Guidelines (CG) before January 2015) provide evidence-based summaries of the diagnosis and management of specific clinical conditions, clinical or social circumstances. All the guidance documents described above may be considered in the evidence base that supports NG preparation. The emphasis, however, is on the description of the whole care pathway in which medical devices and diagnostic technologies may play a part.

### National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on heart valve disease [^113kwysE]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines are evidence-based recommendations for health and care in England. In late 2021, NICE published its first ever guidance on the investigation and management of adults with heart valve disease. This followed on from recent updates to the international societal practice guidelines on heart valve disease produced by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (in 2020) and the European Society of Cardiology and European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (in 2021). The purpose of the NICE guidance has significant differences from societal guidelines, as NICE guidance is designed for implementation within the UK's taxpayer-funded National Health Service and thus must account not just for clinical effectiveness of treatments but cost-effectiveness also. This explains some of the differences between recent recommendations from these bodies, most notably in the treatment of patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, in which NICE clearly explains that cost implications influenced their final guidance (which differs from the recently published European and North American guidelines). The aims of this review article are to provide an overview of the scope and recommendations of the NICE guideline and to compare and contrast the guidelines, highlighting reasons for differences between the guidance from professional societies and NICE and discussing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the NICE guideline.

### Hallucinations in older adults: a practical review [^111BUjLk]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Management and Treatment Approaches

Current guidelines and treatment recommendations are largely based on expert consensus. The focus is typically on the overall management of a specific clinical condition, with hallucinations one of the symptoms covered, eg, NICE Guidelines for Parkinson's disease. To date, few guidelines have focused on hallucinations specifically (eg,) and the forthcoming SHAPED (Study of Hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, Eye disease, and Dementia) consensus guidelines will be the first to focus on visual hallucinations in older adults.

All guidelines for hallucinations take the view that different treatments for hallucinations are required at different disease or hallucination stages and that experiencing hallucinations may not, in itself, require a specific treatment beyond general measures (eg, education, reassurance, physical, and medication review). For example, the SHAPED guidelines suggest including a review of cognitive and ophthalmological health, given that these may be masked by other conditions: ie, cognitive impairment may be missed in a patient with eye disease with their decline in functional ability attributed to visual loss. Early provision of information about the risk of hallucinations is emphasized as a way of reducing stigma and for healthcare professionals to routinely ask about hallucinations — to shift the onus of reporting hallucinations away from the patient. The point at which specific pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for hallucinations are required is not clearly defined in guidelines but based on clinical judgment.

Differential Diagnosis

Before commencing treatment, it must be clear that hallucinations are causing distress, ie, that there is a need for treatment. If this is the case, the second point of attention is whether it is indeed hallucinations. Especially in older adults with cognitive dysfunction, it can be difficult to disentangle hallucinations from obsessions, misperceptions/misunderstandings (ie, illusions), or involuntary mental imagery, such as the so-called "earworms" (ie, songs in the mind that continually repeat).

### Clinical practice guidelines: towards better quality guidelines and increased international collaboration [^115oJNuy]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The final AGREE instrument consists of 23 key items (Table 1

Table 1
The AGREE instrument) categorised into six domains (see:). Each domain is intended to measure a separate dimension of guideline quality.

Scope and purpose (items 1–3): These items are concerned with the overall aim of the guideline, the specific clinical questions and the target patient population.

Stakeholder involvement (items 4–7): These items focus on the extent to which the guideline represents the views of its intended users. Guideline development needs to be carried out by a multidisciplinary group involving all stakeholders whose clinical activities are likely to be covered in the proposed guideline. This also includes patient groups.

Rigour of development (items 8–14): These items relate to the process used to gather and synthesise the evidence, and the methods used to formulate the recommendations and to update them. The recommendations should be explicitly linked to the supporting evidence. However, because most current guidelines use a mixture of 'expert' judgement and literature review, disclosure of disagreement or uncertainties encountered during the development may help to clarify the process. Guidelines should be reviewed externally before publication, and the process used clearly described. They should also always include a date of publication, and because guidelines need to reflect current research, they should contain a clear statement about the updating procedures.

Clarity and presentation (items 15–18): These items deal with the language and format of the guidelines. Since the main role of guidelines is to help clinicians and patients make better decisions, busy clinicians need simple, patient-specific, user-friendly guidelines that are easy to understand. Good guidelines present clear information about the management options available and the likely consequences of each. This information can be presented in a variety of formats to suit the needs of the user.

Applicability (items 19–21): These items cover the likely organisational, behavioural and cost implications of applying the guidelines. Guidelines should be feasible to use in the current organisation of care and must fit into routine practice and the time constraints present. In addition, review criteria should be developed that link the guideline use to audits and other quality improvement initiatives.

### RAAS inhibitors in pregnancy, breastfeeding and women of childbearing potential: a review of national and international clinical practice guidelines [^1132Rx61]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation of RAAS blockers upon notification of pregnancy and suitable replacements

The 2019 NICE guidance for hypertension advises discontinuing RAAS blockers within "2 working days of notification of pregnancy". Similarly, The Renal Association recommends the same timeframe of two days of notification of pregnancy for women with CKD. In contrast, the 2023 ESH hypertension guidance suggests discontinuation of RAAS blockers in the first trimester (Supplementary Table 2). The 2021 and 2018 heart failure guidance from ESC advises that RAAS blockers should be stopped prior to conception and includes recommendations for situations where the medication may have been unknowingly taken during the first trimester (Supplementary Table 3). KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend discontinuation of ACEis and ARBs during pregnancy with no specific timeframe indicated. A 2010 UK survey found that 86% of women sought prenatal care by gestational week 12, indicating a potential delay in care for 14% of participants until after the first trimester.

Research suggests that there may be potential risks even in early pregnancy stages, aligning with NICE's specific timeline for discontinuation. In terms of an unplanned pregnancy, the lack of clear directives from NICE in other condition-specific guidelines, specifically for heart failure, IHD and CKD may lead to delays in appropriate care (Supplementary Tables 3–5). Additionally, the absence of precise timelines in these guidelines may cause variations in clinical decision-making.

The recommended replacement medication for women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy shows some uniformity across guidelines and conditions. The NICE hypertension guidelines currently recommend labetalol, nifedipine and methyldopa as equally suitable replacements for RAAS blocker medication during pregnancy. This recommendation from NICE is similar to the corresponding European and US hypertension guidelines. However, the European hypertension guidelines expand on this by evaluating the safety evidence for each medication, with labetalol and nifedipine being reported to have the most safety evidence.

The ongoing Giant PANDA trial aims to further inform treatment by comparing the effect of labetalol and nifedipine for managing high blood pressure during pregnancy. This currently recruiting trial may have the potential to shape future NICE guidance on this topic.

Categorization and updating of clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations emphasize currency and reconciliation of prior guidance, stating that evidence-based CPGs should be current and that staying current typically requires revision of a CPG's previous versions based on new evidence or as scheduled subject to time-based expirations. As an example of monitoring and updating, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force aims to review each topic at least every five years for either an update or reaffirmation, and recommendation categories were used to track how the previous CPG's recommendations could be reconciled, with definitions similar to those used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, England).

### The utility of the classification tools in national institute of health and clinical excellence's clinical knowledge summaries for primary care [^113azcNG]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Surveys of clinicians consistently report high satisfaction with guidelinesand UK GPs are no exception, welcoming guidelines as a means of improving care although they have some reservations. Several features of CKS ought to make it attractive to end users, although no specific study has been conducted to test if this is so. Features of guidelines that are attractive to GPs include: credibility of the source, relevance, clarity of communication, and transparency.NICE is perceived as an authoritative bodyand CKS's navigation bars and bullet point presentation facilitate clear communications. CKS's consistent citation of the source of its recommendations ensures transparency. It is the issue of relevance that is CKS's weakest point. Given that nearly half of its tools appear to not have utility in guiding management and unless other uses for them exist, CKS may need to consider whether extraneous information should be disposed of or retained.

### Mandatory implementation of NICE guidelines for the care of bipolar disorder and other conditions in england and wales [^116ziSk7]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

While there is evidence particularly in mental health that NICE guideline care improves recovery and service user experience, such care may not be sufficient to improve clinical outcomes. Over-adherence to NICE guidelines can be associated with a lack of patient-centred care, poor clinical outcomes, and poor service user experience unless clinicians use their judgement and listen to patient preferences when they apply NICE guideline care. For these reasons, NICE clinical guidelines tend to outline factors for the clinician to consider and are not and should not be prescriptive, allowing care to be tailored to individual patient needs and preferences.

While NICE clinical guidelines might reduce variability in care, they may raise expectations of health professionals beyond their ability to deliver care given financial and other constraints, inform articulate rather than disadvantaged patients on how to obtain the care they want thus increasing health inequalities, and restrict health professionals from personalising care when necessary, particularly in the face of other mental and physical comorbidities. NICE clinical guidelines contain a mixture of aspirational or developmental and mature recommendations; these may need clearer justification and separation in the NICE clinical guidelines between aspirational or development, and mature recommendations, plus investment and a timetable for implementation from NHS England for key recommendations that require investment. Mandatory implementation of NICE guidelines might be seen to discourage the development and uptake of new technologies in the NHS. However, the issue is complex. Some technology would enable NICE clinical guideline care to be delivered more widely, e.g. mobile phone apps enabling self-completion of standardised measures of severity of depression. The biggest problem for technology companies in working with the NHS is the complexity and unpredictability of decision-making on commissioning and utilisation of technology within it. National clinical guidelines and processes may provide clarity and greater certainty, improving market conditions for the development, uptake, and sustainability of technology and other innovation within the NHS.

### Quality of guidelines on the management of diabetes in pregnancy: a systematic review [^116bF7nv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

The majority of the guidelines described their scope and purpose quite specific. Four guidelines adequately described both objectives and patient groups. In the other guidelines description of objectives was incomplete. Moreover, specific clinical questions were only provided by the NICE guideline.

Regarding stakeholder involvement, seven guidelines scored below 50%. Patients' view and preferences were often not included in the development of the guideline. Moreover, the guidelines had not been piloted among target users, with the exception of the NICE guideline.

Seven guidelines had a low score on rigour of development. This was mainly because most guidelines did not describe explicitly how they had identified, selected and summarized the available evidence. Also information on updating was not reported adequately in most guidelines; only the NICE guideline provided a procedure for updating.

In contrast, except for the guideline from the BCRCP, all guidelines provided information on health benefits, side effects or adverse effects. In addition, most guidelines provided an explicit link between recommendations and evidence by references or a summary of the evidence. Only the CCGC guideline did not provide adequate information on the relation between evidence and recommendation.

Regarding clarity and presentation, seven guidelines scored over 50%. Key recommendations were easily identifiable and different options for management were given. It should be noted that only the CCGC guideline and NICE guideline were supported with tools for application, such as a quick reference guide.

On applicability, five guidelines scored over 50%. All guidelines presented key review criteria for monitoring and/or audit purposes. Considerations on costs or additional resources were described by four guidelines. The guidelines of the DSOG, IDF and NICE also provided information on potential organizational barriers.

Regarding editorial independence, all eight guidelines scored at or below 50%. Five guidelines did not report anything on both independency of funding body and conflicts of interest. The other three guidelines only fulfilled one of the two items.

### Cardiovascular health technology assessment: recommendations to improve the quality of evidence [^112Rh3ew]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Wider implications of NICE for cardiovascular healthcare

NICE acts at the interface where innovative cardiovascular technologies meet the NHS. The healthcare landscape is broad and complex, extending across primary and secondary care, academia, industry, government, patients and the public, and realistic medicine is increasingly advocated.

Key strengths of the NICE approach include involvement of experts from relevant disciplines and engagement with stakeholders including professional societies, industry and the public. However, the variable quality of evidence, for example, from open-label trials, advances in technology and turnover of trials, present key challenges for HTA organisations when developing guidance on cardiovascular healthcare technologies. Open-label trials are the norm opening the door to bias and impaired clinical evidence. Blinded, sham (placebo)-controlled trials of technologies (or linked strategies) are rare but all the more impactful. By contrast, a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design is the established norm for evaluating medicines. This disparity inevitably reduces the quality of evidence for cardiovascular technologies compared with medicines and becomes problematic when the quality of the evidence is discounted by HTA organisations and practice guideline committees. For example, the classes of guideline recommendations (I–III) and levels of evidence (A–C) are directly influenced by the number of trials but calibration based on the quality of evidence is unclear.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^116tQqq2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline formats, recommendation wording, and implementation — Each guideline is produced in 4 formats, including a full version detailing methods, evidence, and the link between evidence and recommendations; a NICE version that lists the recommendations; a quick reference guide summarizing recommendations for health care professionals; and an "understanding NICE guidance" version for patients, carers, and the general public. The wording of each recommendation is considered carefully to ensure that it is clear and concise, and recommendations are action-based and attempt to be specific about the intervention and the population to which the recommendation applies; justifications are not normally included because they are available in the full version's section describing the link between evidence and recommendations. The guideline development group selects 5 to 10 recommendations as key priorities for implementation; these are not necessarily all "strong" and are chosen as being likely to do at least 1 of the following: result in significant benefits for patients, reduce variation in care and outcomes, lead to more efficient use of National Health Service resources, promote patient choice, or promote more equitable access to health care. The guideline development group also identifies recommendations likely to benefit from implementation support, with criteria including not being part of routine care, requiring changes in service delivery or retraining, needing implementation across several agencies or settings, being potentially contentious, or being difficult to implement. While assessing the evidence and making recommendations for best practice, the group also considers how the recommendations will be implemented, and NICE has set up a team to assist with implementation that helps disseminate guidelines and provides tools to put them into practice.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^112vXsd5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Stakeholder involvement and guideline development group (GDG) composition — stakeholders register with NICE through the Web site and may include patient and carer organizations; national organizations that represent health care professionals; clinicians; manufacturers; providers and commissioners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; and statutory and research organizations. All registered stakeholders are involved during development, being invited to a workshop to discuss the proposed scope, to comment on the draft scope during a consultation period, and to comment on the first draft and a prepublication check version posted on the NICE Web site. An independent guideline review panel assesses the scope and whether stakeholder comments have been answered. The center recruits an independent GDG of health care professionals and patient and carer representatives regarded as an advisory group to the Department of Health, with each group having 10 to 12 members, and if voting is used the technical team has a maximum of 3 votes.

The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for hypertension management has recently been updated. This review article summaries the main recommendations in NICE guidelines, and compares them with the American and European guidelines. NICE and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend diagnosing hypertension at a higher level than the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA). NICE treats to less stringent targets than both the ACC/AHA and the ESC, while using similar, although non-combination pill based, treatment regimens.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1156rEKg]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^116ZiQJs]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

This report comments on the relevance and utility of the recently published (2017) KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline Update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention and treatment of mineral bone disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD-MBD) with respect to UK clinical practice. This document replaces all previously published Renal Association guidelines on the topic.

In each case, we have included the guideline from the original 2009 KDIGO Report, followed by the updated recommendation or suggestion from the 2017 Update and a summary of the rationale behind each change. This is, of course, covered more comprehensively in the original documents.

Where UK guidance also exists from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concerning individual recommendations, we have highlighted key similarities and differences before making a summary recommendation of how the Guideline Update may influence UK clinical practice.

The most significant change in the update is a move away from treating to specific targets towards a more pragmatic and personalised approach to management. It is worth noting that of the 21 updated recommendations / suggestions reviewed here, 8 of them (38%) remain 'ungraded' and all of the others are graded Level 2 which, according to the KDIGO nomenclature and description for rating guideline recommendations, means that 'Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his vaand preferences' and reflects the relative lack of evidence on which clinical practice is based in this area. As a result, management of CKD-MBD in patients should be individualised, multi-professional and often pragmatic in its approach.

This represents a significant shift in the way that data are reported and interpreted by both health care professionals and patients here in the UK. As mentioned, the KDIGO working group highlighted the relative paucity of high-quality data from clinical trials that has underpinned these changes and recommend a number of priority research areas in their document. This reinforces the importance of supporting, and recruiting to, new and ongoing clinical trials wherever and whenever practically possible.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^113tQfy5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Recommendation grading and consensus process — current practice avoids grades and uses consensus methods to finalize wording: "Recommendations have not been given a grade since 2006" because grading systems "confused the quality of evidence with the strength of recommendation", and consensus methods are used to make recommendations in all circumstances, with formal methods favored when evidence is lacking or there is disagreement, occasional voting to make final decisions, several iterations before finalization, and processes conducted through face-to-face meetings and online discussions.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^1141hGZd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Evidence assessment — GRADE approach guides decision-making: the guideline development group "uses the GRADE approach to consider clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence before deciding on the best recommendation to make", and in this system "the quality of evidence is assessed for each relevant outcome and is based on study design, limitations, and consistency and directness of the evidence", which guides interpretation of evidence quality and confidence in making a clinical recommendation.

### NICE: guessing is not guidance. national institute for clinical excellence [^114ThayF]. Heart (2002). Low credibility.

A preliminary assessment of the extent to which the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has achieved its goals within cardiovascular medicine is presented. NICE is a government sponsored agency operating in the UK which attempts to assess the value of medical therapies, devices, and surgery for a wide range of medical and surgical problems. Its recommendations determine whether a particular therapy can be adopted in the National Health Service.

### Commentary on the NICE guideline on renal replacement therapy and conservative management [^114J4nq4]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

NICE Guideline NG107, "Renal replacement therapy and conservative management" (Renal replacement therapy and conservative management (NG107); 2018:1–33) was published in October 2018 and replaced the existing NICE guideline CG125, "Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage 5): peritoneal dialysis" (Chronic kidney disease (stage 5): peritoneal dialysis | Guidance | NICE; 2011) and NICE Technology Appraisal TA48, "Guidance on home compared with hospital haemodialysis for patients with end-stage renal failure"(Guidance on home compared with hospital haemodialysis for patients with end-stage renal failure (Technology appraisal guideline TA48); 2002) The aim of the NICE guideline (NG107) was to provide guidance on renal replacement therapy (RRT), including dialysis, transplant and conservative care, for adults and children with CKD Stages 4 and 5. The guideline is extremely welcomed by the Renal Association and it offers huge value to patients, clinicians, commissioners and key stakeholders. It overlaps and enhances current guidance published by the Renal Association including "Haemodialysis" (Clinical practice guideline: Haemodialysis; 2019) which was updated in 2019 after the publication of the NICE guideline, "Peritoneal Dialysis in Adults and Children" (Clinical practice guideline: peritoneal Dialysis in adults and children; 2017) and "Planning, Initiation & withdrawal of Renal Replacement Therapy" (Clinical practice guideline: planning, initiation and withdrawal of renal replacement therapy; 2014) (at present there are no plans to update this guideline). There are several strengths to NICE guideline NG107 and we agree with and support the vast majority of recommendation statements in the guideline. This summary from the Renal Association discusses some of the key highlights, controversies, gaps in knowledge and challenges in implementation. Where there is disagreement with a NICE guideline statement, we have highlighted this and a new suggested statement has been written.

### Guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment and issues of implementation [^115cUyw5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment advances over the last decade, although limited, have precipitated the development of clinical practice guidelines, with the aim of improving the quality of care received by patients through fostering evidence-based decision making and accelerating the application of new advances to everyday practice. Of the COPD guidelines that have been developed, those developed through the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), initially a joint activity between the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom have both published their methods for evaluation of evidence. These comprehensive guidelines cover all aspects of the disease, with the aim of providing the basis for local care pathways. The guideline development process includes evaluation of the evidence, development of the guideline, and dissemination of the findings. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have focused on improving the methods and approaches to implementation, which requires an appreciation of the issues that stop translation of guideline definitions of best practice into improved patient care. A variety of questions remain unanswered in the clinical management of COPD, including the definition of outcome measures that move beyond lung function, the potential application of multidimensional grading systems that assess respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD and that could possibly better categorize and predict outcome in these patients, and the impact of new clinical trial findings. Large ongoing outcome studies may also have an effect on defining best practice within future guideline recommendations.

NICE preferred study designs by question type — The information scientist searches for evidence appropriate to each review question; for effectiveness of an intervention, a randomized, controlled trial is usually the best study design; questions on the clinical value of a diagnostic test are best answered by randomized, controlled trials, while questions on test accuracy are best answered by cross-sectional studies in which the index test and reference standard are performed in the same patients; questions on prognoses are best answered by prospective cohort studies.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^113tX1Lb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline development — NICE "produces clinical guidelines and guidance on public health and health technologies for the National Health Service in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland" and commissions "4 external centers and an internal center" to produce them. The National Clinical Guideline Centre is "the largest of these centers; it was established in 2009 from a merger of 4 smaller guideline-producing centers", alongside "the National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, the National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, and the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health". NICE "has been publishing clinical guidelines since 2001, and more than 100 guidelines have been completed", with methods "fundamentally focused on providing clear recommendations that are based on the best available evidence" and based on "review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments and, for some guidelines, diagnostic and prognostic evidence, to support clinical decision making". Method standards are described in "The Guidelines Manual 2009 (1)", with the exception that "For guidelines for which the scoping process started before 5 January 2009, the 2007 version of the guidelines manual applies (2)", and quality is assessed using "The AGREE instrument (3)… to assess the quality of clinical guideline development process and reporting". Topic generation and scoping involve broad engagement: suggestions come "from diverse sources, including health care professionals, patients, carers, the general public, and the Department of Health or the Welsh Assembly Government"; "National panels then formally prioritize these topics" and "ministers at the Department of Health sign off on which topics should have guidelines commissioned"; selection considers "the burden of disease, the impact on resources, the importance of policy, whether there is inappropriate variation in practice across the country, and factors that affect the timeliness of or urgency for guidance to be produced"; subsequently, "NICE refers each topic to the appropriate guideline developing center" and "The center then develops a scope for each guideline".

MART pathway

Consider paediatric low-dose MART for children with asthma that is not controlled on paediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed, as long as they are assessed to have the ability to manage a MART regimen. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] In November 2024, no asthma inhalers were licensed for MART in children under 12, so this use would be off-label. The current evidence supporting the use of MART in children aged 5 to 11 is based on the use of a dry powder inhaler. Seeor.

Consider increasing to paediatric moderate-dose MART if asthma is not controlled on paediatric low-dose MART. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

### A fine balance: developing clinical practice guidelines in areas where evidence is lacking [^115vNhCf]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Over the last 15 years, numerous clinical practice guidelines have been developed by clinicians driven by national societies and funders of healthcare services. Writing and publication of guidelines have been refined such that a transparent and robust process has evolved. The main purpose of clinical practice guidelines is to provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations to assist clinical decision-making and reduce variability in clinical practice: this benefits patients and the healthcare system. When evidence is abundant and robust, guideline development is relatively straightforward. However, in areas where evidence is lacking, there is a tension between providing advice based on expert opinion while maintaining a clinical equipoise that will facilitate the design and execution of clinical trials, so that new information is gained, and that will ultimately inform care. In this commentary, we explore these problems and suggest an alternative approach to the development of clinical guidance in areas where evidence is lacking.
