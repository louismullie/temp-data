## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which next step is most appropriate for an 89-year-old woman with diarrhea, vomiting, headache, blurry vision, chronic kidney disease, and on digoxin, with potassium 5.2 mEq/L and creatinine 1.3 mg/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and whether this fits digoxin toxicity. Then, I should verify the key risk factors and whether they are present. Next, I will review why the alternatives fail to address the immediate clinical question. Finally, I will confirm the correct next step and outline immediate management priorities, including when to consider digoxin immune Fab and how to handle the potassium and renal context.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. The combination of gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), neurologic symptoms (headache), and visual disturbances (blurry vision) in a patient on digoxin is classic for digoxin toxicity, especially in the setting of renal impairment and potential electrolyte shifts from recent vomiting and diarrhea, which can precipitate toxicity even at "therapeutic" levels [^116bwSqH] [^115ACyRb] [^111cu1k1].

> Wait, let me verify the risk factors. Advanced age, chronic kidney disease, and recent gastrointestinal losses all increase digoxin toxicity risk; importantly, toxicity can occur at serum digoxin concentrations below 2 ng/mL when hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or renal dysfunction coexist, so a "normal" level does not exclude toxicity in this context [^116bwSqH] [^115ACyRb] [^115Ctcbc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the alternatives. Hemodialysis is not effective for digoxin removal because of its large volume of distribution, and guidelines recommend against extracorporeal treatment for digoxin poisoning, so option A is incorrect [^114QrxhQ] [^117EXBzG]. A C. difficile test is reasonable in someone with new diarrhea, but it does not address the immediate threat of digoxin toxicity and is not the most urgent next step here, making option B less appropriate right now. Activated charcoal is indicated for acute ingestions due to enterohepatic recirculation, but this presentation is chronic toxicity, so charcoal won't help and could worsen vomiting, so option D is not appropriate [^111bg81Q] [^113VDukJ].

> I should double-check the correct next step. Given suspected digoxin toxicity, the most appropriate immediate action is to obtain a serum digoxin concentration to confirm the diagnosis and guide severity assessment, ideally drawn just before the next dose or at least 6 hours after the last dose to avoid falsely elevated results, while concurrently stopping digoxin and monitoring the ECG for arrhythmias [^112EvfXt] [^116bwSqH] [^111bg81Q].

> Next, I should review immediate management priorities. Stop digoxin now, place the patient on continuous cardiac monitoring, correct electrolytes (especially potassium and magnesium), and assess renal function; if there are life-threatening arrhythmias, hyperkalemia, or hemodynamic instability, administer digoxin immune Fab promptly, as it is highly effective in reversing toxicity and is first-line in severe cases [^111bg81Q] [^111MQCnq] [^112k7ADD].

> But wait, what if the digoxin level is "normal"? I need to ensure I don't anchor on a number; toxicity can still be present with levels under 2 ng/mL in high-risk patients, so clinical judgment and the full picture remain paramount, and Fab should still be given if there are life-threatening arrhythmias or severe hyperkalemia regardless of the exact level [^115ACyRb] [^111bg81Q].

> Final answer: C. Measure serum drug concentration, because the presentation is most consistent with digoxin toxicity and confirming the level will guide severity assessment and management, while the other options either do not address the immediate threat or are contraindicated in this context [^116bwSqH] [^114QrxhQ] [^111bg81Q].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **measure serum digoxin concentration** [^112EvfXt] because the patient's symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, blurred vision) and risk factors (advanced age, chronic renal failure, recent GI losses) are classic for digoxin toxicity [^116bwSqH], and confirming the level will guide immediate management [^115ACyRb]. Hemodialysis is ineffective for digoxin removal [^114QrxhQ], C. difficile testing is not urgent in this context, and activated charcoal is not indicated for chronic toxicity [^111bg81Q].

## Clinical reasoning and evidence

### Clinical presentation and risk factors

- **Symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and blurred vision are classic manifestations of digoxin toxicity [^116bwSqH] [^111cu1k1].
- **Risk factors**: Advanced age, chronic renal failure, and recent gastrointestinal losses (vomiting, diarrhea) significantly increase the risk of digoxin toxicity [^115ACyRb] [^115Ctcbc].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyperkalemia (5.2 mEq/L) is concerning and can exacerbate digoxin toxicity, although it is not yet life-threatening [^116uaScc].

---

### Diagnostic approach

- **Serum digoxin concentration**: Measuring serum digoxin concentration is the most appropriate next step to confirm toxicity and guide management [^112EvfXt] [^115ACyRb].
- **Interpretation**: Toxicity can occur even at "therapeutic" levels, especially in the presence of risk factors such as renal impairment and electrolyte disturbances [^115ACyRb] [^115Ctcbc].
- **ECG monitoring**: Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect arrhythmias, which are common in digoxin toxicity [^111bg81Q].

---

### Management implications

- **Discontinuation**: Immediate discontinuation of digoxin is indicated if toxicity is confirmed or strongly suspected [^111bg81Q].
- **Electrolyte correction**: Hyperkalemia and other electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected promptly [^111bg81Q].
- **Digoxin immune Fab**: Consider administration of digoxin immune Fab (antidote) if there are life-threatening arrhythmias, severe hyperkalemia, or significant clinical instability [^111MQCnq] [^112k7ADD].

---

### Why other options are not appropriate

- **Hemodialysis**: Digoxin is not effectively removed by hemodialysis due to its large volume of distribution and protein binding [^114QrxhQ] [^117EXBzG].
- **C. difficile toxin assay**: There is no clear indication for C. difficile testing in this patient, as there is no recent antibiotic use or suggestive clinical features.
- **Activated charcoal**: Not indicated for chronic digoxin toxicity, as it is primarily useful for acute ingestions within a few hours [^111bg81Q].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is to **measure serum digoxin concentration** [^112EvfXt] to confirm toxicity and guide subsequent management, including discontinuation of digoxin, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and consideration of digoxin immune Fab if indicated [^111bg81Q].

### A case of primary aldosteronism revealed after renal transplantation [^1174wb3t]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Background

A 57-year-old woman was referred to a nephrology clinic because of chronic hypokalemia. She had a history of polycystic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and end-stage renal disease, and had received a kidney transplant from a deceased donor at the age of 48 years. At presentation, the patient described symptoms of chronic fatigue and muscle aches, but she did not report pareses. Her medications included four antihypertensive agents, glucose-lowering drugs, immunosuppressants, digoxin, a coumarin derivative, and potassium chloride.

Investigations

Full history, physical examination, laboratory testing of blood and urine, including aldosterone-torenin ratio, and a saline infusion test.

Diagnosis

Primary aldosteronism.

Management

Treatment with spironolactone resulted in prompt control of hypertension and hypokalemia, allowing discontinuation of potassium chloride and reduction in antihypertensive medication.

### Digitalis toxicity: a fading but crucial complication to recognize [^117Bm8dH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Digoxin usage has decreased in the treatment of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation as a result of its inferiority to beta-adrenergic inhibitors and agents that interfere with the deleterious effects of the activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. As a result of reduction of usage and dosage, glycoside toxicity has become an uncommon occurrence but may be overlooked when it does occur. Older age, female sex, low lean body mass, and renal insufficiency contribute to higher serum levels and enhanced risk for toxicity. Arrhythmias suggesting digoxin toxicity led to its recognition in the case presented here.

### Digoxin –' a friend or foe' [^115FDrKz]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The authors report about a patient who was admitted after developing nausea, vomiting, change in vision and lethargy. She was on digoxin 250 mcg once daily among all her other medications in the wake of a recent stroke that was accompanied by atrial fibrillation (AF). Her digitalis levels shortly before and on admission were 3.4 and 2.9 ng/ml, respectively. Her admission rhythm was slowly conducted AF at an average of 35 bpm. After a careful assessment by the cardiology consultant in charge, she received Digibind infusion for a chronic digitalis toxicity with the digoxin immune Fab dose based on the formula recommended in the product literature.(3) A few days observation on the ward ensured that her resting heart rate rose to 65 bpm and that she did not need a pacemaker for a slow AF. Her functional status remained reasonably good as she enjoyed a satisfactory recovery postthrombolysis for her recent stroke.

### An unusual cause of metabolic alkalosis: hiding in plain sight [^114BPZGW]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 80-year-old woman with a past medical history of long-standing hypertension leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage G3bA1 (baseline serum creatinine 1.4–1.78 mg/dL [123.7–157.35 umol/L], eGFR 33–45 mL/min), hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and gastroesophageal reflux disease was referred to the Nephrology clinic by her primary care provider for evaluation of chronic metabolic alkalosis.

During her initial clinic visit, the patient endorsed decreased appetite and poor oral intake with resultant 5-pound weight loss over the course of 6 weeks. She denied any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Her home medications included metoprolol tartrate 50 mg twice daily, pravastatin 10 mg daily, pantoprazole 40 mg daily, rivaroxaban 15 mg daily, and calcium carbonate 600 mg daily. She specifically denied taking any additional medications, either prescribed or over-the-counter. On physical examination, the patient had a BMI of 17.2 kg/m 2, blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg and heart rate of 80 beats per minute. She was clinically euvolemic on exam, particularly, there was no peripheral edema. Table 1 summarizes the patient's initial serum laboratory findings. Notably, her serum bicarbonate was elevated to 44 mmol/L, urinalysis was unremarkable, with no proteinuria or active urine sediment, and urine pH of 6.0, which was somewhat lower than expected for her degree of metabolic alkalosis. Based on the arterial blood gas result with a pH of 7,50, CO2 53 mmHg (7.06 kPa) and bicarbonate 41 mEq/L, the patient was diagnosed with a primary compensated metabolic alkalosis. Spot urine electrolytes revealed the following: urine sodium of 41 mmol/L (fractional excretion of 0.3%), potassium 13.0 mmol/L (fractional excretion 3.87%) and chloride 48 mmol/L (fractional excretion of 0.5%), with a urine creatinine of 128 mg/dL (11,317 umol/L). Her random urine chloride level greater than 20 mmol/L was indicative of a predominantly chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis. In the setting of the patient's hypertension associated with metabolic alkalosis and tendency to hypokalemia, further workup was obtained after her serum potassium level was repleted to 3.8 mEq/L, to rule out secondary causes of hypertension. Laboratory workup showed a serum renin level of 0.2 ng/mL/h (reference: 0.25–5.82 ng/mL) with normal serum aldosterone level of 3.6 ng/dL supine (Ref: if supine 3–16 ng/dl, upright less or equal to 28 ng/dl) and AM cortisol level of 13.4 mcg/dL (Ref at 7–9 am: 4.6–23.4 mcg/dL). A computed tomography scan of her abdomen was obtained and showed normal-appearing adrenal glands. Further, renal vascular ultrasound was unremarkable with no evidence of renal artery stenosis.

10.2 Treatment

Chronic Overdose

If there is suspicion of toxicity, discontinue digoxin and place the patient on a cardiac monitor. Correct factors such as electrolyte abnormalities, thyroid dysfunction, and concomitant medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Correct hypokalemia by administering potassium so that serum potassium is maintained between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L. Potassium is usually administered orally, but when correction of the arrhythmia is urgent and serum potassium concentration is low, potassium may be administered by the intravenous route. Monitor electrocardiogram for any evidence of potassium toxicity (e.g., peaking of T waves) and to observe the effect on the arrhythmia. Avoid potassium salts in patients with bradycardia or heart block. Symptomatic arrhythmias may be treated with Digoxin Immune Fab.

Acute Overdose

Patients who have intentionally or accidently ingested massive doses of digoxin should receive activated charcoal orally or by nasogastric tube regardless of the time since ingestion since digoxin recirculates to the intestine by enterohepatic circulation. In addition to cardiac monitoring, temporarily discontinue digoxin until the adverse reaction resolves. Correct factors that may be contributing to the adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. In particular, correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Digoxin is not effectively removed from the body by dialysis because of its large extravascular volume of distribution. Life threatening arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, high degree A-V block, bradyarrhythma, sinus arrest) or hyperkalemia requires administration of Digoxin Immune Fab. Digoxin Immune Fab has been shown to be 80 to 90% effective in reversing signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Bradycardia and heart block caused by digoxin are parasympathetically mediated and respond to atropine. A temporary cardiac pacemaker may also be used. Ventricular arrhythmias may respond to lidocaine or phenytoin. When a large amount of digoxin has been ingested, especially in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalemia may be present due to release of potassium from skeletal muscle. In this case, treatment with Digoxin Immune Fab is indicated; an initial treatment with glucose and insulin may be needed if the hyperkalemia is life-threatening. Once the adverse reaction has resolved, therapy with digoxin may be reinstituted following a careful reassessment of dose.

### Digoxin toxicity with normal digoxin and serum potassium levels: beware of magnesium, the hidden malefactor [^116TmFDT]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years, digoxin use has been on the decline, with decreased incidence of digoxin toxicity. Hence, digoxin toxicity, when it occurs, remains an elusive diagnosis to emergency physicians.

Objective

To present a case of digoxin toxicity with normal levels of digoxin and serum potassium, but with severe hypomagnesemia.

Case Report

A 66-year-old woman presented with junctional tachycardia and ectopic atrial tachycardia. She was known to have congestive cardiac failure on diuretic therapy. Her serum digoxin level was within the normal range (2.4 nmol/L [normal = 1.9–2.6]) along with a normal serum potassium level (3.9 mmol/L [normal = 3.5–5]). However, there was severe hypomagnesemia (0.39 mmol/L [normal = 0.65–1.25]) precipitating digoxin-induced dysrhythmia, which responded well to intravenous magnesium therapy.

Conclusion

This case reiterates that digoxin toxicity can occur in patients with normal digoxin and potassium levels, and in such patients, magnesium needs to be checked and treated to prevent potentially life-threatening dysrhythmias.

Management of hyperkalemia — background and definition notes that potassium abnormalities predispose to abnormal cardiac conduction and arrhythmias, decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is associated with increased potassium, and additional risks include diabetes, hyperglycemia, constipation, higher albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and drugs such as ACEI/ARB, MRAs, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, trimethoprim, and calcineurin inhibitors, as well as volume depletion; an acute episode is a potassium result above the upper limit of normal that is not known to be chronic, and there is no consensus on thresholds that define chronicity.

### Digoxin (digox) [^1112c4N1]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Adults: Cardiac: Therapeutic doses of digoxin may cause heart block in patients with pre-existing sinoatrial or AV conduction disorders; heart block can be avoided by adjusting the dose of digoxin. Prophylactic use of a cardiac pacemaker may be considered if the risk of heart block is considered unacceptable. High doses of digoxin may produce a variety of rhythm disturbances, such as first-degree, second-degree (Wenckebach), or third-degree heart block (including asystole); atrial tachycardia with block; AV dissociation; accelerated junctional (nodal) rhythm; unifocal or multiform ventricular premature contractions (especially bigeminy or trigeminy); ventricular tachycardia; and ventricular fibrillation. Digoxin produces PR prolongation and ST segment depression which should not by themselves be considered digoxin toxicity. Cardiac toxicity can also occur at therapeutic doses in patients who have conditions which may alter their sensitivity to digoxin (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Gastrointestinal: Digoxin may cause anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Rarely, the use of digoxin has been associated with abdominal pain, intestinal ischemia, and hemorrhagic necrosis of the intestines.

CNS: Digoxin can produce visual disturbances (blurred or yellow vision), headache, weakness, dizziness, apathy, confusion, and mental disturbances (such as anxiety, depression, delirium, and hallucination).

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the evaluation and management of patients with bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^111MQCnq]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Digoxin-specific antibody (Fab) dosing and response in digoxin toxicity — Each vial of 40 mg of digoxin Fab binds approximately 0.5 mg of digoxin, and clinical response rates are as high as 80% to 90%, particularly in the acute setting. Patients with hyperkalemia or arrhythmias in the setting of digoxin serum levels of > 2 ng/mL are at increased risk of death, and potassium levels should be monitored; adverse events attributable to digoxin Fab therapy are described as rare and usually clinically insignificant.

### Digoxin (digox) [^116YY1Qo]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Administration of Potassium: Every effort should be made to maintain the serum potassium concentration between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L. Potassium is usually administered orally, but when correction of the arrhythmia is urgent and the serum potassium concentration is low, potassium may be administered cautiously by the intravenous route. The electrocardiogram should be monitored for any evidence of potassium toxicity (e.g., peaking of T waves) and to observe the effect on the arrhythmia. Potassium salts may be dangerous in patients who manifest bradycardia or heart block due to digoxin (unless primarily related to supraventricular tachycardia) and in the setting of massive digitalis overdosage (see Massive Digitalis Overdosage subsection).

Massive Digitalis Overdosage: Manifestations of life-threatening toxicity include ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, or progressive bradyarrhythmias, or heart block. The administration of more than 10 mg of digoxin in a previously healthy adult, or more than 4 mg in a previously healthy child, or a steady-state serum concentration greater than 10 ng/mL often results in cardiac arrest.

DIGIBIND should be used to reverse the toxic effects of ingestion of a massive overdose. The decision to administer DIGIBIND to a patient who has ingested a massive dose of digoxin but who has not yet manifested life-threatening toxicity should depend on the likelihood that life-threatening toxicity will occur (see above).

Patients with massive digitalis ingestion should receive large doses of activated charcoal to prevent absorption and bind digoxin in the gut during enteroenteric recirculation. Emesis or gastric lavage may be indicated especially if ingestion has occurred withing 30 minutes of the patient's presentation at the hospital. Emesis should not be induced in patients who are obtunded. If a patient presents more than 2 hours after ingestion or already has toxic manifestations, it may be unsafe to induce vomiting or attempt passage of a gastric tube, because such maneuvers may induce an acute vagal episode that can worsen digitalis-related arrhythmias.

Severe digitalis intoxication can cause a massive shift of potassium from inside to outside the cell, leading to life-threatening hyperkalemia. The administration of potassium supplements in the setting of massive intoxication may be hazardous and should be avoided. Hyperkalemia caused be massive digitalis toxicity is best treated with DIGIBIND; initial treatment with glucose and insulin may also be required if hyperkalemia itself is acutely life-threatening.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise patients to contact their doctor or a health care professional if they experience nausea, vomiting, persistent diarrhea, confusion, weakness, or visual disturbances (including blurred vision, green-yellow color disturbances, halo effect) as these could be signs that the dose of LANOXIN may be too high.
Advise parents or caregivers that the symptoms of having too high LANOXIN doses may be difficult to recognize in infants and pediatric patients. Symptoms such as weight loss, failure to thrive in infants, abdominal pain, and behavioral disturbances may be indications of digoxin toxicity.
Instruct the patient to monitor and record their heart rate and blood pressure daily.

### Of little yellow men and a fear of the light [^111JAfkU]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a 65-year-old woman presenting with recurrent vomiting for 3 days. She had been previously diagnosed with an atrial septal defect and was on treatment with diuretics and digoxin for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The clinical examination was consistent with an atrial septal defect with severe pulmonary hypertension. Electrocardiography showed complete heart block with ST-segment changes suggestive of digitalis toxicity. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed Eisenmengerisation. Serum digoxin levels were elevated. Following hospitalisation, she was diagnosed with photophobia when she persistently asked for ambient lighting to be switched off. Most interestingly, the patient kept reporting seeing little yellow men, which was how she perceived the attending doctors. Cessation of digoxin therapy led to progressive abatement of her symptoms.

### A woman with nausea, vomiting, and confusion | NEJM resident 360… [^114j8aWj]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published May 16, 2018 The digoxin level is frequently monitored because of the narrow therapeutic range and the potential for serious adverse drug events. Read the latest NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital here. Clinical Pearls Q: What are some of the risk factors for digoxin toxicity. A: The major route of elimination of digoxin is through renal excretion, and the blood level of digoxin can rise in the context of a reduced glomerular filtration rate. Approximately 20 to 30% of digoxin is bound to blood albumin, and factors such as older age, congestive heart failure, and renal failure reduce the volume of distribution, contributing to an increased risk of toxic effects. Q: What are some of the adverse events associated with digoxin toxicity. A: Digoxin toxicity is characterized by confusion, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, and visual disturbances.

Life-threatening consequences of digoxin toxicity include ventricular tachycardia, severe bradycardia, complete heart block, and shock. A: The term digoxin-like immunoreactive substance encompasses a broad range of substances, both exogenous and endogenous in origin, that may interfere with digoxin immunoassays. Endogenous digoxin-like immunoreactive substances may be found in patients with volume expansion and appear to have natriuretic effects. Exogenous digoxin-like immunoreactive substances include spironolactone, canrenone, and Chinese herbal medications. However, spironolactone and related medications are not known to cause interference with the current generation of digoxin immunoassays that are available. Treatment with digoxin immune Fab fragments, which bind to digoxin and clear the drug from tissues, is indicated for the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias and shock, as well as for the prevention of these events when hyperkalemia is present.

From patients for whom the desired diagnostic test is a digoxin immunoassay, a blood sample must be obtained before the administration of digoxin-binding antibody fragments. The digoxin level cannot be meaningfully measured until these antibody fragments are eliminated from the body, which may take days to more than a week in patients with severe kidney dysfunction. A: Cardiac glycosides, such as digoxin, were first used for the treatment of heart failure many years ago, well before the molecular actions of these drugs were understood. The use of digoxin therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation has decreased as alternative therapeutic approaches with greater efficacy and reduced toxic effects have been recognized. Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers slow the ventricular response at rest and during exertion. Digoxin is sometimes added if these agents do not adequately control the heart rate at maximal doses.

However, the vagotonic effect of digoxin is overcome by the adrenergic surge that occurs during exercise, and therefore, digoxin is of limited use in preventing uncontrolled heart rates during exercise. The use of digoxin for the treatment of heart failure has also decreased because of the rise of more effective and less toxic therapies, including angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, neprilysin–angiotensin-receptor inhibitors, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists. A trial conducted by the Digitalis Investigation Group did not show a benefit from digoxin with respect to mortality in patients with symptomatic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, and the trial results also suggested harm from digoxin when it was present at high blood levels.

A hypersensitivity reaction to other digitalis preparations usually constitutes a contraindication to digoxin. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5. 1 Ventricular Fibrillation in Patients With Accessory AV Pathway. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation are at high risk of ventricular fibrillation. Treatment of these patients with digoxin leads to greater slowing of conduction in the atrioventricular node than in accessory pathways, and the risks of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation are thereby. increased.
5. 2 Sinus Bradycardia and Sino-atrial Block Digoxin may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block particularly in patients with pre-existing sinus node disease and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre-existing incomplete AV block.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise patients that many drugs can interact with digoxin tablets. Instruct patients to inform their doctor and pharmacist if they are taking any over the counter medications, including herbal medication, or are started on a new prescription.
Advise patients to contact their doctor or a health care professional if they experience nausea, vomiting, persistent diarrhea, confusion, weakness, or visual disturbances (including blurred vision, green-yellow color disturbances, halo effect) as these could be signs that the dose of digoxin tablets may be too high.
Advise parents or caregivers that the symptoms of having too high digoxin tablets doses may be difficult to recognize in infants and pediatric patients. Symptoms such as weight loss, failure to thrive in infants, abdominal pain, and behavioral disturbances may be indications of digoxin toxicity.
Instruct the patient to monitor and record their heart rate and blood pressure daily.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 bradycardia guideline — digoxin-specific antibody (Fab) dosing and clinical considerations: Digoxin-specific antibody (Fab) is a monovalent immunoglobulin that rapidly binds to intravascular digoxin. Each vial of 40 mg of digoxin Fab binds approximately 0.5 mg of digoxin, repeat dosing may be necessary particularly in the setting of chronic use attributable to the large volume of distribution, and clinical response rates to digoxin Fab are as high as 80% to 90%. Patients with hyperkalemia or arrhythmias in the setting of digoxin serum levels of > 2 ng/mL are at increased risk of death; signs and symptoms of toxicity can manifest at lower serum levels; and adverse events attributable to digoxin Fab therapy are rare and usually clinically insignificant; potassium levels should be monitored.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

PRECAUTIONS

Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function: Digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, patients with impaired renal function require smaller than usual maintenance doses of digoxin (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Because of the prolonged elimination half-life, a longer period of time is required to achieve an initial or new steady-state serum concentration in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function. If appropriate care is not taken to reduce the dose of digoxin, such patients are at high risk for toxicity, and toxic effects will last longer in such patients than in patients with normal renal function.

Use in Patients with Electrolyte Disorders: In patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, toxicity may occur despite serum digoxin concentrations below 2.0 ng/mL, because potassium or magnesium depletion sensitizes the myocardium to digoxin. Therefore, it is desirable to maintain normal serum potassium and magnesium concentrations in patients being treated with digoxin. Deficiencies of these electrolytes may result from malnutrition, diarrhea, or prolonged vomiting, as well as the use of the following drugs or procedures: diuretics, amphotericin B, corticosteroids, antacids, dialysis, and mechanical suction of gastrointestinal secretions.

Hypercalcemia from any cause predisposes the patient to digitalis toxicity. Calcium, particularly when administered rapidly by the intravenous route, may produce serious arrhythmias in digitalized patients. On the other hand, hypocalcemia can nullify the effects of digoxin in humans; thus, digoxin may be ineffective until serum calcium is restored to normal. These interactions are related to the fact that digoxin affects contractility and excitability of the heart in a manner similar to that of calcium.

5.3 Digoxin Toxicity

Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, visual changes and cardiac arrhythmias [first-degree, second-degree (Wenckebach), or third-degree heart block (including asystole); atrial tachycardia with block; AV dissociation; accelerated junctional (nodal) rhythm; unifocal or multiform ventricular premature contractions (especially bigeminy or trigeminy); ventricular tachycardia; and ventricular fibrillation]. Toxicity is usually associated with digoxin levels greater than 2 ng/ml although symptoms may also occur at lower levels. Low body weight, advanced age or impaired renal function, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Obtain serum digoxin levels in patients with signs or symptoms of digoxin therapy and interrupt or adjust dose if necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Overdosage (10)]. Assess serum electrolytes and renal function periodically.

The earliest and most frequent manifestation of digoxin toxicity in infants and children is the appearance of cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia. In children, the use of digoxin may produce any arrhythmia. The most common are conduction disturbances or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial tachycardia (with or without block) and junctional (nodal) tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias are less common. Sinus bradycardia may be a sign of impending digoxin intoxication, especially in infants, even in the absence of first-degree heart block. Any arrhythmias or alteration in cardiac conduction that develops in a child taking digoxin should initially be assumed to be a consequence of digoxin intoxication.

Given that adult patients with heart failure have some symptoms in common with digoxin toxicity, it may be difficult to distinguish digoxin toxicity from heart failure. Misidentification of their etiology might lead the clinician to continue or increase digoxin dosing, when dosing should actually be suspended. When the etiology of these signs and symptoms is not clear, measure serum digoxin levels.

5.4 Risk of Ventricular Arrhythmias During Electrical Cardioversion

It may be desirable to reduce the dose of or discontinue digoxin for 1 to 2 days prior to electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to avoid the induction of ventricular arrhythmias, but physicians must consider the consequences of increasing the ventricular response if digoxin is decreased or withdrawn. If digitalis toxicity is suspected, elective cardioversion should be delayed. If it is not prudent to delay cardioversion, the lowest possible energy level should be selected to avoid provoking ventricular arrhythmias.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: digitalis toxicity [^113eWNyJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Toxicity from the digitalis family of cardiac glycoside medications remains common. Successful treatment depends on early recognition; however, the diagnosis of potentially life-threatening toxicity remains difficult because the clinical presentation is often nonspecific and subtle. The hallmark of cardiac toxicity is increased automaticity coupled with concomitant conduction delay. Though no single dysrhythmia is always present, certain aberrations such as frequent premature ventricular beats, bradydysrhythmias, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block, junctional tachycardia, and bidirectional ventricular tachycardia are common. Treatment depends on the clinical condition rather than serum drug level. Management varies from temporary withdrawal of the medication to administration of digoxin-specific Fab fragments for life-threatening cardiovascular compromise.

If digitalis toxicity is suspected, elective cardioversion should be delayed. If it is not prudent to delay cardioversion, the lowest possible energy level should be selected to avoid provoking ventricular arrhythmias.

10.1 Signs and Symptoms in Adults and Children

The signs and symptoms of toxicity are generally similar to those described in the Adverse Reactions (6.1) but may be more frequent and can be more severe. Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity become more frequent with levels above 2 ng/mL. However, in deciding whether a patient's symptoms are due to digoxin, the clinical state together with serum electrolyte levels and thyroid function are important factors [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Adults: The most common signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity are nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue that occur in 30 to 70% of patients who are overdosed. Extremely high serum concentrations produce hyperkalemia especially in patients with impaired renal function. Almost every type of cardiac arrhythmia has been associated with digoxin overdose and multiple rhythm disturbances in the same patient are common. Peak cardiac effects occur 3 to 6 hours following ingestion and may persist for 24 hours or longer. Arrhythmias that are considered more characteristic of digoxin toxicity are new-onset Mobitz type 1 A-V block, accelerated junctional rhythms, non-paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with A-V block, and bi-directional ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac arrest from asystole or ventricular fibrillation is usually fatal.

Digoxin toxicity is related to serum concentration. As digoxin serum levels increase above 1.2 ng/mL, there is a potential for increase in adverse reactions. Furthermore, lower potassium levels increases the risk for adverse reactions. In adults with heart disease, clinical observations suggest that an overdose of digoxin of 10 to 15 mg results in death of half of patients. A dose above 25 mg ingested by an adult without heart disease appeared to be uniformly fatal if no Digoxin Immune Fab (DIGIBIND®, DIGIFAB®) was administered.

### Chronic digoxin toxicity precipitated by dronedarone [^1175AqXH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the case of a patient who presented with chronic symptoms attributable to dronedarone-induced digoxin toxicity. A review of the literature is also provided.

Case Summary

This case report details a case of a 77-year-old male patient who presented to the hospital with multiple ambiguous symptoms that lasted several weeks. The patient was later hospitalized for symptoms of chronic digoxin toxicity, including prolonged nausea, diarrhea, weakness, and lack of appetite. The patient had a long history of digoxin use for control of his atrial fibrillation but experienced signs and symptoms of toxicity only after the addition of dronedarone.

Discussion

Both the Naranjo and Drug Interaction Probability Scales indicated a "probable" relationship between the development of digoxin toxicity and dronedarone. Due to a p-glycoprotein-mediated interaction, dronedarone is able to decrease the renal clearance of digoxin, thus putting patients at risk for potentially fatal digoxin toxicity.

Conclusion

This is the second case report detailing dronedarone-induced digoxin toxicity and the first to focus on chronic digoxin toxicity. The presentation, possible causes, and drug-drug interactions associated with digoxin toxicity are described. This report aims to increase clinicians' awareness of this possible complication. It is recommended that digoxin be discontinued prior to initiating dronedarone. If concomitant therapy is absolutely necessary, the dose of digoxin should be halved prior to initiating dronedarone. Digoxin plasma levels should be monitored closely, with frequent patient evaluation for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2005 chronic heart failure guideline — digoxin adverse effects, toxicity thresholds, and drug interactions: When administered with attention to dose and to factors that alter its disposition, digoxin is well tolerated by most patients with HF, but principal adverse reactions occur primarily with large doses, and the major side effects include cardiac arrhythmias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurological complaints. Overt digitalis toxicity is commonly associated with serum digoxin levels greater than 2 ng per mL, though toxicity may occur with lower levels, especially if hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypothyroidism coexists. The concomitant use of clarithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone, itraconazole, cyclosporine, verapamil, or quinidine can increase serum digoxin concentrations and may increase the likelihood of digitalis toxicity, and the dose of digoxin should be reduced if treatment with these drugs is initiated. Spironolactone does not inhibit the disposition of digoxin; cross‑reactivity of some digoxin antibody assays with spironolactone confounded earlier attempts to assess the effect of spironolactone on digoxin clearance. In addition, a low lean body mass and impaired renal function can elevate serum digoxin levels, and one analysis suggested that women may not benefit from digoxin therapy and may be at increased risk for death with such therapy.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication-induced arrhythmias — digoxin toxicity: Administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended for patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmia (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity. Typical digoxin toxicity arrhythmias include enhanced atrial, junctional, or ventricular automaticity often with atrioventricular block, and management in mild cases can include discontinuing the medication, monitoring rhythm, and maintaining normal serum potassium, with intravenous magnesium often administered if VAs are present; temporary pacing may be needed for atrioventricular block or asystole. For more severe intoxication defined by serum digoxin concentrations exceeding 4 ng/mL with serious arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), the treatment of choice is digoxin-specific Fab antibody, and in one series of 150 severely intoxicated patients, 54% of those presenting with a cardiac arrest survived hospitalization.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are included in more detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label:

Cardiac arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]
Digoxin Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

The overall incidence of adverse reactions with digoxin has been reported as 5 to 20%, with 15 to 20% of adverse events considered serious. Cardiac toxicity accounts for about one-half, gastrointestinal disturbances for about one-fourth, and CNS and other toxicity for about one-fourth of these adverse events. (6.1)

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

In general, the adverse reactions of digoxin are dose-dependent and occur at doses higher than those needed to achieve a therapeutic effect. Hence, adverse reactions are less common when digoxin is used within the recommended dose range, is maintained within the therapeutic serum concentration range, and when there is careful attention to concurrent medications and conditions.

In the DIG trial (a trial investigating the effect of digoxin on mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure), the incidence of hospitalization for suspected digoxin toxicity was 2% in patients taking digoxin compared to 0.9% in patients taking placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The overall incidence of adverse reactions with digoxin has been reported as 5 to 20%, with 15 to 20% of adverse events considered serious. Cardiac toxicity accounts for about one-half, gastrointestinal disturbances for about one-fourth, and CNS and other toxicity for about one-fourth of these adverse events.

Gastrointestinal: In addition to nausea and vomiting, the use of digoxin has been associated with abdominal pain, intestinal ischemia, and hemorrhagic necrosis of the intestines.

CNS: Digoxin can cause headache, weakness, dizziness, apathy, confusion, and mental disturbances (such as anxiety, depression, delirium, and hallucination).

Other: Gynecomastia has been occasionally observed following the prolonged use of digoxin. Thrombocytopenia and maculopapular rash and other skin reactions have been rarely observed.

In patients with chronic heart failure, spironolactone added to conventional treatment may lead to serious and, occasionally, fatal hyperkalaemia. In some cases this seems to happen because spironolactone causes diarrhoea. Four cases involving men with New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure are presented. As these cases revealed, close monitoring of blood chemistry is mandatory after starting spironolactone, and patients should be advised to stop spironolactone immediately if diarrhoea develops.

10.1 Signs and Symptoms in Adults and Children

The signs and symptoms of toxicity are generally similar to those previously described [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] but may be more frequent and can be more severe. Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity become more frequent with levels above 2 ng/mL. However, in deciding whether a patient's symptoms are due to digoxin, the clinical state together with serum electrolyte levels and thyroid function are important factors [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Digoxin toxicity is related to serum concentration. As digoxin serum levels increase above 1.2 ng/mL, there is a potential for increase in adverse reactions. Furthermore, lower potassium levels increases the risk for adverse reactions. In adults with heart disease, clinical observations suggest that an overdose of digoxin of 10–15 mg results in death of half of patients. A dose above 25 mg ingested by an adult without heart disease appeared to be uniformly fatal if no Digoxin Immune Fab (DIGIBIND®, DIGIFAB®) was administered.

Aldosterone antagonist therapy — hyperkalemia risk minimization: Impaired renal function is a risk factor for hyperkalemia during treatment with aldosterone antagonists, and risk increases when serum creatinine exceeds 1.6 mg per dL; in patients in whom creatinine may not reflect filtration, determination that glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance exceeds 30 mL per min is recommended. Aldosterone antagonists should not be administered to patients with baseline serum potassium in excess of 5.0 mEq per liter. An initial dose of spironolactone 12.5 mg or eplerenone 25 mg is recommended, with possible increase to spironolactone 25 mg or eplerenone 50 mg as appropriate. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased with concomitant higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (captopril greater than or equal to 75 mg daily; enalapril or lisinopril greater than or equal to 10 mg daily); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be avoided, and potassium supplements should be discontinued or reduced. Close monitoring is required: potassium levels and renal function should be checked in 3 days and at 1 week after initiation of therapy and at least monthly for the first 3 months, and diarrhea or other causes of dehydration should be addressed emergently. Although trial entry allowed creatinine greater than 2.5 mg per dL, in 1 trial 95% of patients had creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg per dL, indicating most studied patients had better renal function than the entry limit.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

In general, the adverse reactions of LANOXIN are dose-dependent and occur at doses higher than those needed to achieve a therapeutic effect. Hence, adverse reactions are less common when LANOXIN is used within the recommended dose range, is maintained within the therapeutic serum concentration range, and when there is careful attention to concurrent medications and conditions.

In the DIG trial (a trial investigating the effect of digoxin on mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure), the incidence of hospitalization for suspected digoxin toxicity was 2% in patients taking LANOXIN compared to 0.9% in patients taking placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The overall incidence of adverse reactions with digoxin has been reported as 5–20%, with 15–20% of adverse events considered serious. Cardiac toxicity accounts for about one-half, gastrointestinal disturbances for about one-fourth, and CNS and other toxicity for about one-fourth of these adverse events.

Gastrointestinal: In addition to nausea and vomiting, the use of digoxin has been associated with abdominal pain, intestinal ischemia, and hemorrhagic necrosis of the intestines.

CNS: Digoxin can cause headache, weakness, dizziness, apathy, confusion, and mental disturbances (such as anxiety, depression, delirium, and hallucination).

Other: Gynecomastia has been occasionally observed following the prolonged use of digoxin. Thrombocytopenia and maculopapular rash and other skin reactions have been rarely observed.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The clearance of digoxin can be primarily correlated with the renal function as indicated by creatinine clearance. Tables 3 and 5 provide the usual daily maintenance dose requirements for digoxin based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, patients with impaired renal function require smaller than usual maintenance doses of digoxin [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Because of the prolonged elimination half-life, a longer period of time is required to achieve an initial or new steady-state serum concentration in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function. If appropriate care is not taken to reduce the dose of digoxin, such patients are at high risk for toxicity, and toxic effects will last longer in such patients than in patients with normal renal function.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Plasma digoxin concentrations in patients with acute hepatitis generally fall within the range of profiles in a group of healthy subjects.

8.8 Malabsorption

The absorption of digoxin is reduced in some malabsorption conditions such as chronic diarrhea.

Digitalis (digoxin) intoxication — clinical presentation and management note that certain arrhythmias are typical and diagnosis relies on characteristic rhythm disturbances with ancillary symptoms and elevated serum concentrations. In mild cases, management includes discontinuing the drug, monitoring rhythm and maintaining normal serum potassium, and temporary pacing may be needed. For more severe intoxication (serum digoxin concentration greater than 4 to 5 ng/mL with serious arrhythmias), the treatment of choice is digoxin-specific Fab antibody. In one series of 150 severely intoxicated patients, response was rapid (30 min to 4 h), and 54% of patients presenting with a cardiac arrest survived hospitalization. Side effects include worsening of the underlying disease and hypokalemia; digoxin concentration monitoring is unreliable after antidigoxin antibody, and previously used therapies such as lidocaine or phenytoin have little role.

### Digoxin-specific fab and therapeutic plasma exchange for digitalis intoxication and renal failure [^111SuNXV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment of chronic digitalis intoxication includes suspension of drug intake, which may be sufficient in case of mild manifestations, and supportive measures. Severe bradycardia requires the administration of atropine or isoproterenol; placement of a temporary pacemaker may be required in case of absent response to pharmacological therapy. Severe and life-threatening manifestations should be treated with digoxin-specific fragment antigen binding antibodies (Fab). Therapeutic plasma exchange has been suggested, in addition to Fab therapy, to maximize the clearance of Fab-digoxin complexes in patients with renal failure. To date, few case reports have described the use of such a therapeutic approach; currently, extracorporeal methods are not recommended as part of the treatment of digitalis intoxication, and stronger evidence is required to establish their benefit.

Adverse effects related to angiotensin suppression in heart failure (HF) with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy include hypotension and dizziness, and symptomatic hypotension with first doses may not recur with repeated administration; the doses of other hypotensive agents can be reduced or staggered, and most patients remain excellent candidates for long-term ACE inhibition if appropriate measures minimize recurrence. Severe hyponatremia is identified as a risk factor, defined as serum sodium concentration less than 130 mmol per liter. Worsening renal function is described, with a significant increase in serum creatinine (greater than 0.3 mg per dL) observed in 15% to 30% of patients with severe HF and in only 5% to 15% of those with mild to moderate symptoms; renal function usually improves after reduction of concomitantly administered diuretics, and if diuretics cannot be reduced because of fluid retention, mild to moderate degrees of azotemia may need to be tolerated to maintain ACEI therapy. Hyperkalemia can occur and may be sufficiently severe to cause cardiac conduction disturbances, particularly when renal function deteriorates or with oral potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, or aldosterone antagonists, especially in diabetes mellitus.

ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline — Digoxin dosing, adverse effects, and cautions: Initial IV bolus is 0.25–0.5-mg; can repeat 0.25-mg IV bolus, up to maximum dose of 1.0 mg over 24 h (ie, maximum loading dose 8–12 mcg/kg), given at 6–8 h intervals; maintenance dose is based on patient factors (IV 2.4–3.6 mcg/kg/d). Adverse effects include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, visual changes, and cardiac arrhythmias if digoxin toxicity, associated with levels > 2 ng/mL (although symptoms may also occur at lower levels). Precautions include renal dysfunction, WPW with AF/atrial flutter, and AV block greater than first degree or SA node dysfunction (in absence of pacemaker). Digoxin is a P-glycoprotein substrate; with dronedarone reduce dose by at least 50% and with amiodarone reduce dose by 30%–50%; for verapamil, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, erythromycin, flecainide, itraconazole, posaconazole, propafenone, and voriconazole, monitor digoxin levels. A large retrospective study suggested an increased risk in mortality in patients who were treated with digoxin for newly diagnosed AF or atrial flutter; although the data were collected from a population that was different from SVT patients, digoxin should be used with caution.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In general, the adverse reactions of digoxin are dose-dependent and occur at doses higher than those needed to achieve a therapeutic effect. Hence, adverse reactions are less common when digoxin is used within the recommended dose range or therapeutic serum concentration range and when there is careful attention to concurrent medications and conditions.

Because some patients may be particularly susceptible to side effects with digoxin, the dosage of the drug should always be selected carefully and adjusted as the clinical condition of the patient warrants. In the past, when high doses of digoxin were used and little attention was paid to clinical status or concurrent medications, adverse reactions to digoxin were more frequent and severe. Cardiac adverse reactions accounted for about one-half, gastrointestinal disturbances for about one-fourth, and CNS and other toxicity for about one-fourth of these adverse reactions. However, available evidence suggests that the incidence and severity of digoxin toxicity has decreased substantially in recent years. In recent controlled clinical trials, in patients with predominantly mild to moderate heart failure, the incidence of adverse experiences was comparable in patients taking digoxin and in those taking placebo. In a large mortality trial, the incidence of hospitalization for suspected digoxin toxicity was 2% in patients taking digoxin compared to 0.9% in patients taking placebo. In this trial, the most common manifestations of digoxin toxicity included gastrointestinal and cardiac disturbances; CNS manifestations were less common.

A hypersensitivity reaction to other digitalis preparations usually constitutes a contraindication to digoxin. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5. 1 Ventricular Fibrillation in Patients With Accessory AV Pathway. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation are at high risk of ventricular fibrillation. Treatment of these patients with digoxin leads to greater slowing of conduction in the atrioventricular node than in accessory pathways, and the risks of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation are thereby. increased.
5. 2 Sinus Bradycardia and Sino-atrial Block Digoxin may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block particularly in patients with pre- existing sinus node disease and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre- existing incomplete AV block. Consider insertion of a pacemaker. before treatment with digoxin.
5.

3 Digoxin Toxicity Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, visual changes and cardiac arrhythmias. Toxicity is usually associated with digoxin levels greater than 2 ng/ml although symptoms may also occur at lower levels. Low body weight, advanced age or. impaired renal function, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Obtain serum digoxin levels in patients with signs or symptoms of digoxin therapy and interrupt or adjust dose if necessary. Assess serum electrolytes and renal function periodically.

The earliest and most frequent manifestation of digoxin toxicity in infants and children is. common. Sinus bradycardia may be a sign of impending digoxin intoxication, especially in infants, even in the absence of first-degree heart block. Any arrhythmias or alteration in cardiac conduction that develops in a child taking digoxin should initially be assumed to be a consequence of digoxin intoxication. Given that adult patients with heart failure have some symptoms in common with digoxin toxicity, it may be difficult to distinguish digoxin toxicity from heart failure. Misidentification of their etiology might lead the clinician to continue or increase Digoxin dosing, when dosing should actually be suspended. When the etiology of these signs. arrhythmias, but physicians must consider the consequences of increasing the ventricular response if digoxin is decreased or withdrawn. If digitalis toxicity is suspected, elective cardioversion should be delayed.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication-induced arrhythmias — digoxin toxicity management (COR I, LOE B-NR) states that administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended for patients who present with sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity; typical toxicity produces enhanced atrial, junctional, or ventricular automaticity often with atrioventricular block, fascicular or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (VT) suggests digoxin toxicity, and severe overdose causes hyperkalemia and cardiac standstill; mild cases may be managed by discontinuing the medication, monitoring rhythm, and maintaining normal serum potassium, with intravenous magnesium often used if VAs are present and temporary pacing sometimes needed for atrioventricular block or asystole; for more severe intoxication with serious arrhythmias such as VT and serum digoxin concentrations exceeding 4 ng/mL, the treatment of choice is digoxin-specific Fab antibody, with one series of 150 severely intoxicated patients showing rapid response (30 minutes to 4 hour) and 54% survival to hospital discharge among those presenting with cardiac arrest, while adverse effects can include worsening of underlying disease and hypokalemia and doses lower than the full neutralizing dose may be effective if cardiac arrest is not imminent.

Assess CLcr in all patients prior to initiating therapy and daily during therapy with ZEMDRI, particularly in those at increased risk of nephrotoxicity, such as those with renal impairment, the elderly, and those receiving concomitant potentially nephrotoxic medications. In the setting of worsening renal function, the benefit of continuing ZEMDRI should be assessed.
5.

6 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial drugs alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B that contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial drugs. The median age of patients treated with ZEMDRI in Trial 1 was 62 years and 45. 2% of patients were 65 years of age or older.

### Digoxin (digox) [^111rN88x]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Treatment of Adverse Reactions Produced by Overdosage: Digoxin should be temporarily discontinued until the adverse reaction resolves. Every effort should also be made to correct factors that may contribute to the adverse reaction (such as electrolyte disturbances or concurrent medications). Once the adverse reaction has resolved, therapy with digoxin may be reinstituted, following a careful reassessment of dose.

Withdrawal of digoxin may be all that is required to treat the adverse reaction. However, when the primary manifestation of digoxin overdosage is a cardiac arrhythmia, additional therapy may be needed.

If the rhythm disturbance is a symptomatic bradyarrhythmia or heart block, consideration should be given to the reversal of toxicity with DIGIBIND® [Digoxin Immune Fab (Ovine)] (see Massive Digitalis Overdosage subsection), the use of atropine, or the insertion of a temporary cardiac pacemaker. However, asymptomatic bradycardia or heart block related to digoxin may require only temporary withdrawal of the drug and cardiac monitoring of the patient.

If the rhythm disturbance is a ventricular arrhythmia, consideration should be given to the correction of electrolyte disorders, particularly if hypokalemia (see Administration of Potassium subsection) or hypomagnesemia is present. DIGIBIND is a specific antidote for digoxin and may be used to reverse potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias due to digoxin overdosage.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The clearance of digoxin can be primarily correlated with the renal function as indicated by creatinine clearance. Table 3 and Table 5 provide the usual daily maintenance dose requirements for digoxin based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, patients with impaired renal function require smaller than usual maintenance doses of digoxin [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Because of the prolonged elimination half-life, a longer period of time is required to achieve an initial or new steady-state serum concentration in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function. If appropriate care is not taken to reduce the dose of digoxin, such patients are at high risk for toxicity, and toxic effects will last longer in such patients than in patients with normal renal function.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Plasma digoxin concentrations in patients with acute hepatitis generally fall within the range of profiles in a group of healthy subjects.

8.8 Malabsorption

The absorption of digoxin is reduced in some malabsorption conditions such as chronic diarrhea.

### Should digoxin immune fAb be administered based solely on reported ingested amount in acute digoxin poisoning? [^116o4vwP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute digoxin poisoning is increasingly uncommon in emergency medicine. Furthermore, controversy exists regarding indications for antidotal digoxin immune fab in acute poisoning. In healthy adults, the fab prescribing information recommends administration based on "known consumption of fatal doses of digoxin: ≥ 10mg", while many emergency medicine textbooks suggest fab administration be driven by clinical features or potassium concentration. A 54 kg adult, not on digoxin, presented one hour after ingesting 12.5 mg. Electrocardiogram revealed only ST depression and first degree heart block. Initial pulse was 102 beats/min, systolic blood pressure was 170 mmHg. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic. Poison center recommended immediately obtaining serum potassium and digoxin concentrations; call-back was planned for two hours. The emergency physician was instructed to have ≥ 10 fab vials bedside and to administer if instability ensued. Thirty-five minutes later (≈90 min post-ingestion) ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest occurred; initial serum potassium resulted at this time at 3.3 mEq/L. Bicarbonate, insulin and glucose, amiodarone, magnesium, calcium, and 10 fab vials were administered. Cardioversion resulted in wide-complex tachycardia which became ventricular fibrillation then asystole and the patient died. Serum digoxin concentration drawn on hospital arrival resulted after death at 44 ng/mL. In this fatal case of acute digoxin poisoning, fab was not empirically recommended because the patient initially did not have significant signs or symptoms that accompanied the history of ingesting ≥ 10 mg digoxin. While the bedside team was given clear anticipatory guidance by the regional poison center, the patient died despite fab administration once instability occurred.

### Expert consensus on the diagnosis and management of digoxin toxicity [^1152sAET]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

While there has been a decline in the use of digoxin in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation, acute and chronic digoxin toxicity remains a significant clinical problem. Digoxin's narrow therapeutic window and nonspecific signs and symptoms of toxicity create clinical challenges and uncertainty around the diagnostic criteria of toxicity and responsive treatment choices for the bedside clinician. A systematic review of published literature on digoxin toxicity (34,587 publications over 6 decades, with 114 meeting inclusion criteria) was performed to develop 33 consensus statements on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches which were then evaluated through a modified Delphi process involving a panel of experts in cardiology, nursing, emergency medicine, and medical toxicology. The results demonstrate agreement about the need to consider time of ingestion and nature of the exposure (ie, acute, acute-on-chronic, chronic) and the use of digoxin immune Fab for life-threatening exposure to decrease risk of death. While several areas of continued uncertainty were identified, this work offers formalized guidance that may help providers better manage this persistent clinical challenge.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Heart Failure: Digoxin is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate heart failure. Digoxin increases left ventricular ejection fraction and improves heart failure symptoms as evidenced by exercise capacity and heart failure symptoms as evidenced by exercise capacity and heart failure-related hospitalizations and emergency care, while having no effect on mortality. Where possible, digoxin should be used with a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, but an optimal order for starting these three drugs cannot be specified.

Atrial Fibrillation: Digoxin is indicated for the control of ventricular response rate in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.

Discussion

An unusual manifestation of hypercalcemia, known as HC, can be fatal if left undiagnosed and untreated. Currently, there is no consensus definition of HC. Ahmad et al.define HC as a calcium level that exceeds 3.5 mmol/L and is associated with symptoms of multi-organ dysfunction caused by increased calcium levels. However, patients with severe symptoms should be considered for HC, even if the calcium level has not reached the diagnostic cut-off. Most organ systems are impacted by hypercalcemia, with the digestive system being the most commonly affected. Symptoms may include loss of appetite, bloating, constipation, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Necrotizing pancreatitis can also occur. Acute kidney failure, kidney stones, renal colic, polyuria in the early stages, or oliguria in the later stages are reported. Neurological symptoms, such as agitation, coma, lethargy, confusion, and muscle weakening, can range in severity. In terms of the cardiovascular system, hypercalcemia can lead to QT shortening and arrhythmias. Severe arrhythmias may occur, especially in patients taking digoxin, leading to mortality.

Hypercalcemia results from various etiologies, such as hyperparathyroidism, malignancies, vitamin D toxicity, medications, or genetic disorders. Among these, hyperparathyroidism and malignancies account for nearly 90% of hypercalcemia cases. Hypercalcemia can be asymptomatic or present subtle symptoms. Clinical manifestations become apparent when the calcium level exceeds 3 mmol/L. Hypercalcemia is categorized into three degrees: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild hypercalcemia is defined when the total calcium level ranges from 2.5 to 3 mmol/L, or ionized calcium level is between 1.4 and 2 mmol/L. When the total calcium level is between 3 and 3.5 mmol/L or the ionized calcium level is between 2 and 2.5 mmol/L, moderate hypercalcemia is present. Severe hypercalcemia is considered when the total calcium level exceeds 3.5 mmol/L or ionized calcium concentration exceeds 2.5 mmol/L.

2.5 Monitoring to Assess Safety, Efficacy, and Therapeutic Blood Levels

Monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity and clinical response. Adjust dose based on toxicity, efficacy, and blood levels.

Serum digoxin levels less than 0.5 ng/mL have been associated with diminished efficacy, while levels above 2 ng/mL have been associated with increased toxicity without increased benefit.

Interpret the serum digoxin concentration in the overall clinical context, and do not use an isolated measurement of serum digoxin concentration as the basis for increasing or decreasing the LANOXIN dose. Serum digoxin concentrations may be falsely elevated by endogenous digoxin-like substances [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. If the assay is sensitive to these substances, consider obtaining a baseline digoxin level before starting LANOXIN and correct post-treatment values by the reported baseline level.

Obtain serum digoxin concentrations just before the next scheduled LANOXIN dose or at least 6 hours after the last dose. The digoxin concentration is likely to be 10–25% lower when sampled right before the next dose (24 hours after dosing) compared to sampling 8 hours after dosing (using once-daily dosing). However, there will be only minor differences in digoxin concentrations using twice daily dosing whether sampling is done at 8 or 12 hours after a dose.

2.6 Switching from Intravenous Digoxin to Oral Digoxin

When switching from intravenous to oral digoxin formulations, make allowances for differences in bioavailability when calculating maintenance dosages (see Table 6).

Among the extra-cardiac manifestations, gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, anorexia) are very common (up to 80% incidence) and precede cardiac manifestations in approximately half of the patients in most literature reports. Neurologic manifestations (e.g., dizziness, various CNS disturbances), fatigue, and malaise are very common. Visual manifestations may also occur with aberration in color vision (predominance of yellow green) the most frequent. Neurological and visual symptoms may persist after other signs of toxicity have resolved. In chronic toxicity, non-specific extra-cardiac symptoms, such as malaise and weakness, may predominate.

Children: In pediatric patients, signs and symptoms of toxicity can occur during or shortly after the dose of digoxin. Frequent non-cardiac effects are similar to those observed in adults although nausea and vomiting are not seen frequently in infants and small pediatric patients. Other reported manifestations of overdose are weight loss in older age groups, failure to thrive in infants, abdominal pain caused by mesenteric artery ischemia, drowsiness, and behavioral disturbances including psychotic episodes. Arrhythmias and combinations of arrhythmias that occur in adult patients can also occur in pediatric patients although sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and rapid atrial fibrillation are seen less frequently in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are more likely to develop A-V conduction disturbances, or sinus bradycardia. Any arrhythmia in a child treated with digoxin should be considered related to digoxin until otherwise ruled out. In pediatric patients aged 1 to 3 years without heart disease, clinical observations suggest that an overdose of digoxin of 6 to 10 mg would result in death of half of the patients. In the same population, a dose above 10 mg resulted in death if no Digoxin Immune Fab were administered.
