## Question

t pal positive, rpr neg, tppa posive, interpretation

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interpreting discordant syphilis serology where the treponemal test (TPPA) is positive and the nontreponemal test (RPR) is negative, along with management and follow-up implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how common this discordant pattern is and what it usually represents. Then, I should verify what clinical history and risk factors reframe the pretest probability. Next, I need to check the immediate confirmatory actions and when to repeat testing. After that, I will consider stage-based management pathways, including when no treatment is indicated versus when empiric therapy is warranted. Finally, I should confirm follow-up serologic monitoring, special situations (HIV, pregnancy, neurologic/ocular symptoms), and succinctly summarize the interpretation and plan.

> Let me first confirm the test pattern and its epidemiology. A TPPA-positive, RPR-negative result after treponemal screening is a well-described discordant profile in reverse sequence algorithms; in CDC multi-laboratory data, about 56.7% of EIA/CIA-reactive specimens had a nonreactive RPR, and a substantial fraction of discordance reflected false-positive screens that were clarified by a second treponemal test, whereas in clinical cohorts roughly 72% of CIA-positive, RPR-negative samples were TPPA-positive, frequently indicating prior infection, often previously treated [^114L4tPy] [^112HBXPa].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical anchors before interpreting the labs in isolation. I should confirm any documented prior syphilis treatment, ask about current symptoms (chancre, rash, mucous lesions) and neurologic, ocular, or otologic complaints, determine timing of last sexual exposure to assess for the serologic window period, and check HIV status and pregnancy because these factors influence both serologic performance and urgency of treatment and follow-up.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to consider the leading explanations for TPPA positive with RPR negative. Past treated syphilis is most common in discordant cohorts, with prior therapy documented in about 57% of TPPA-positive discordant cases, where treponemal antibodies persist while RPR reverts to low or nonreactive levels; very early primary syphilis is possible given lower early sensitivity of nontreponemal tests; late latent syphilis can present with nonreactive RPR; and a false-positive treponemal test is less likely when TPPA is reactive because TPPA and related TPHAs are highly specific when used as the second treponemal test [^112HBXPa] [^114XDoqo] [^1169fQAX].

> I should double-check immediate confirmatory steps. First, ensure a quantitative RPR was performed and truly nonreactive, since a low titer (for example 1:1–1:4) reframes interpretation and follow-up; repeat the nontreponemal test in the same lab and method for consistency if needed; confirm that the treponemal screen and TPPA are different assays; and if the exposure was recent or symptoms suggest early syphilis, repeat the serology in 2–4 weeks to detect seroconversion rather than waiting for late complications [^113xSb8X] [^111msfK7] [^1175xqBw].

> Let me think about direct detection and what not to do. If a compatible lesion is present, dark ground microscopy or lesion PCR can identify Treponema pallidum before seroconversion; however, in the absence of neurologic, ocular, or otologic manifestations, CSF examination is not indicated for discordant serology or early disease, and I should avoid subjecting the patient to lumbar puncture unless symptoms mandate it [^117WW5ap] [^111pCp1Q] [^116gKjft].

> Hmm, wait a minute, should I treat everyone with this pattern right away? My first impulse might be to treat to avoid missing early disease, but I should verify history first because past adequately treated syphilis with persistent treponemal positivity requires no additional therapy; this is a classic biologic scar and should be documented clearly for future reference to prevent unnecessary retreatment [^113zggNi] [^112Ba4FA].

> Next, I will examine the management pathways by stage and likelihood. If there is documented prior adequate treatment and no new risk or symptoms, no treatment is indicated; counsel, record baseline serology, and focus future assessments on nontreponemal titers for suspected reinfection. If the patient has no prior treatment and is asymptomatic without recent exposure, treat as latent syphilis of unknown duration with benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM weekly for three doses; if recent exposure within the last month or clinical features suggest primary or early syphilis, treat empirically as early syphilis with a single 2.4 million unit IM dose rather than waiting for RPR seroconversion, given early false-negative RPRs [^112Ba4FA] [^113zggNi].

> But wait, what if risk is low and history is unclear? I should consider repeating both treponemal and nontreponemal serology at about one month if very early infection is not suspected; persistence of TPPA positivity with a nonreactive RPR in an untreated patient would then favor latent infection and justify treatment according to stage, whereas reversion of a weakly positive screen with negative TPPA would support a false-positive screen [^1175xqBw] [^112HBXPa].

> I need to ensure appropriate follow-up and define expected serologic kinetics. After treatment, follow quantitative RPR at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, ideally using the same test and laboratory; a fourfold decline is expected in early disease, and in late latent disease titers may be low and decline more slowly, with a persistent low "serofast" titer (1:1–1:4) considered successfully treated if there is no ongoing risk and clinical stability [^1179fBnf] [^114XDoqo].

> Let me reconsider special circumstances to avoid missing high-stakes conditions. In pregnancy, treat promptly according to stage and avoid delays given risks of adverse fetal outcomes, and document treponemal persistence so future positive screens are not misinterpreted; in persons with HIV, interpretation and follow-up are the same overall, and CSF evaluation is symptom-driven rather than routinely indicated for discordant serology without neurologic, ocular, or otologic findings [^111i73Jg] [^116gKjft] [^113zggNi].

> Finally, I should summarize the interpretation with a clear diagnostic anchor. TPPA positive plus RPR negative most often reflects prior treated syphilis, but I must exclude very early primary infection based on exposure history and symptoms, and consider late latent syphilis if untreated; confirm with quantitative RPR, use a different treponemal assay to resolve screening discordance, repeat serology when early infection is plausible, avoid unnecessary CSF testing, and treat based on stage while monitoring RPR titers systematically for response or reinfection [^114L4tPy] [^113xSb8X] [^1175xqBw] [^116gKjft].

The combination of **TPPA positive, RPR negative** indicates past or treated syphilis, not active infection [^114XDoqo]. Treponemal antibodies **persist for life** [^1176XFWj], while nontreponemal antibodies wane after treatment or in late latent disease [^114XDoqo]. This pattern is common in previously treated patients or late latent syphilis, and does not require treatment unless there is clinical suspicion of early infection, reinfection, or neurosyphilis [^1179fBnf]. If early infection is suspected, **repeat RPR in 2–4 weeks** [^1175xqBw] [^1146BUgA]; if neurosyphilis is suspected, perform CSF analysis [^113zggNi] [^116gKjft].

---

## Clinical interpretation of TPPA positive, RPR negative results

### Treponemal tests (TPPA)

Treponemal tests (TPPA) show **persistence**: treponemal antibodies persist for life after infection or treatment, so a positive TPPA indicates current or past infection [^1176XFWj]. They also have **high specificity**, with TPPA rarely yielding false-positive results [^1169fQAX].

---

### Nontreponemal tests (RPR)

Nontreponemal tests (RPR) show **waning**: RPR detects antibodies that decline after treatment or in late latent disease [^1179fBnf], so a negative RPR with a positive TPPA usually indicates past or treated infection [^114XDoqo]. In early primary syphilis (before seroconversion), late latent syphilis, or after successful treatment, **false negatives** can also occur [^1139g4aE] [^113eqBje].

---

## Clinical scenarios associated with TPPA positive, RPR negative results

| **Clinical scenario** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Previously treated syphilis | - Most common <br/> - Treponemal antibodies persist <br/> - Nontreponemal antibodies wane after treatment [^114XDoqo] [^1179fBnf] |
| Late latent syphilis | Nontreponemal antibodies may be absent or low in late latent disease [^114XDoqo] [^1139g4aE] |
| Early primary syphilis | - RPR may be negative before seroconversion <br/> - Repeat testing recommended [^1139g4aE] |
| False-positive TPPA | - Rare <br/> - TPPA is highly specific [^1169fQAX] |

---

## Clinical management and follow-up recommendations

### Previously treated syphilis

In previously treated syphilis, **no retreatment** is recommended unless there is clinical suspicion of reinfection or treatment failure. Clinicians should **monitor** the patient clinically and with serology if indicated [^114XDoqo] [^1179fBnf].

---

### Late latent syphilis

In late latent syphilis, **treat if untreated** — initiate therapy when there is no documented prior therapy. **No routine CSF** analysis is recommended without neurological symptoms [^116gKjft] [^113zggNi].

---

### Early primary syphilis

In early primary syphilis, **repeat RPR** in 2–4 weeks if early infection is suspected, and **treat if seroconversion occurs** or if clinical suspicion remains high [^1175xqBw] [^1146BUgA].

---

### Neurosyphilis suspicion

When neurosyphilis is suspected, perform **CSF analysis** if neurological symptoms are present [^113zggNi] [^1172vcP2].

---

## Summary of clinical interpretation

- **Past or treated infection**: TPPA positive, RPR negative most often reflects past or treated syphilis.

- **No routine retreatment**: Do not retreat unless reinfection or treatment failure is suspected [^1179fBnf].

- **Repeat if early suspected**: If early infection is possible, repeat RPR in 2–4 weeks [^1175xqBw].

- **CSF if neurological**: Perform CSF analysis if neurological symptoms are present [^113zggNi].

---

The TPPA positive, RPR negative pattern most often reflects **past or treated infection**, not active disease. Management should be **guided by clinical context**, with repeat RPR if early infection is suspected and CSF analysis only if neurological symptoms are present.

In the context of follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, particularly concerning the management of treatment failure or reinfection, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend acknowledging that a negative non-treponemal test can be obtained in a substantial number of patients treated for early syphilis after 1–2 years, although not in all cases. A negative non-treponemal test post-treatment should be regarded as the best confirmation of cure. A strict follow-up is advised for patients with persistent low titers (≤ 4) in a non-treponemal test, known as the serofast state; however, these patients should be regarded as successfully treated in the absence of ongoing risk. Consider performing a CSF assessment to detect asymptomatic neurosyphilis in patients with persistent high titers of a non-treponemal test (≥ 8).

### Performance assessment of treponemal and nontreponemal tests for the diagnosis of acquired syphilis [^113eqBje]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Low credibility.

Nontreponemal tests such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test are based on anticardiolipin antibody detection and are helpful in monitoring the stage of infection and treatment. They are easy to perform, inexpensive, and provide a rapid diagnostic result. However, they have low specificity because of cross-reactivity with antibodies produced in various autoimmune diseases or during pregnancy. Additionally, nontreponemal tests may not reliably detect early primary syphilis because of their lower sensitivity.

On the other hand, treponemal tests such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test, the ELISA, and the chemiluminescent magnetic microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) detect anti-T. pallidum IgG or IgM and are used for screening or as confirmatory tests to exclude false-positive results in nontreponemal tests. Moreover, they prove valuable in detecting early syphilis cases that nontreponemal tests may overlook. Compared to nontreponemal tests, they are costly, cumbersome, automated, require a trained team to perform, and are not recommended for monitoring treatment progress, relapse, or reinfection in individuals previously treated, as they remain reactive for years regardless of treatment.

In light of this scenario, we endeavored to perform a systematic evaluation of the performance of commercial kits for diagnosing acquired syphilis. Statistical tools were used to obtain a robust assessment of the performance of each serological test by determining the following diagnostic test parameters: sensitivity (the probability that a test is positive in the presence…

Following the presentation of the published test performance data at the national consultation, it was noted that many of the treponemal immunoassays had little or no data on test performance published in peer-reviewed literature. Therefore, for the treponemal immunoassays, we obtained 510(k) Premarket Notification data submitted to the FDA and also abstracted these data into the tables of evidence.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: a retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^1169fQAX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

This study demonstrates that TPHAs perform similarly to the TPPA and provides confidence that these assays are an acceptable alternative in settings that no longer have access to the TPPA. Importantly, three TPHAs had equivalent clinical sensitivity to the Serodia TPPA, and two TPHAs had > 99% clinical specificity. This study demonstrates the importance of including clinical data on syphilis status in the assessment of treponemal serology assays, where prior infection may result in persistent reactivity. This study also demonstrates the value of high-quality, independent laboratory evaluations of new tests performed by clinical laboratories when managing critical assay shortages or withdrawals of high-impact tests from the market. Recent global shortages in blood culture bottles and critical antibiotics, such as benzathine penicillin for the treatment of syphilis, have demonstrated the complexity faced by health systems when managing supply-chain and regulatory disruptions. Here, we have demonstrated that commercial TPHAs are an acceptable alternative to the gold-standard TPPA test used for confirmatory treponemal serology testing and that a number of TPHAs have high clinical sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of active untreated syphilis.

### Metaanalysis of the performance of a combined treponemal and nontreponemal rapid diagnostic test for syphilis and yaws [^112ohnnk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The human treponematoses are important causes of disease. Mother-to-child transmission of syphilis remains a major cause of stillbirth and neonatal death. Additionally, there are almost 100,000 cases of endemic treponemal disease reported annually, predominantly yaws. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) would improve access to screening for these diseases. Most RDTs cannot distinguish current from previous infection. The Dual Path Platform (DPP) Syphilis Screen & Confirm test includes both a treponemal (T1) and nontreponemal (T2) component, potentially improving the accuracy of diagnosis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a metaanalysis of published and unpublished evaluations of the DPP-RDT for the diagnosis of syphilis and yaws. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and overall agreement of the test compared with reference laboratory tests.

- **Results**: Nine evaluations, including 7,267 tests, were included. Sensitivity was higher in patients with higher titer rapid plasma reagin (≥ 1:16) for both the T1 component (98.2% vs 90.1%, P < .0001) and the T2 component (98.2% vs 80.6%, P < .0001). Overall agreement between the DPP test and reference serology was 85.2% (84.4%-86.1%). Agreement was highest for high-titer active infection and lowest for past infection.

- **Conclusions**: The RDT has good sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal and nontreponemal components in cases of suspected syphilis and yaws, although the sensitivity is decreased at lower antibody titers.

### Frequency and characteristics of biological false-positive test results for syphilis reported in Florida and New York City, USA, 2013 to 2017 [^115GjmJh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Discordant syphilis test results, characterized by a reactive nontreponemal test and nonreactive treponemal test, are usually considered biological false-positive test results (BFPs). These results can be attributed to other conditions. Syphilis surveillance laws mandate laboratory reporting of reactive syphilis tests, which include many BFPs.

We describe the frequency of BFPs, titer distributions, and titer increases from reported test results in Florida and New York City (NYC). Reactive nontreponemal tests for individuals with at least one nonreactive treponemal test and no reactive treponemal test were extracted from sexually transmitted disease (STD) surveillance systems in Florida and NYC from 2013 to 2017. Characteristics of individuals with BFPs were analyzed after selecting the observation with the highest titer from each individual. We next considered all results from individuals to characterize persons who had a 4-fold titer increase between successive nontreponemal tests.

Among 526,540 reactive nontreponemal tests, there were 57,580 BFPs (11%) from 39,920 individuals. Over 90% (n = 52,330) of BFPs were low titer (≤ 1:4), but 654 (1%) were high-titer BFPs (≥ 1:32). Very high-titer (≥ 1:128) BFPs were more common among individuals over 60 years of age (odds ratio [OR], 2.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 5.91). A 4-fold increase in titer was observed among 1,863 (14%) individuals with more than one reported BFP.

Most BFPs detected by surveillance were low titer, but some were high titer, and some had a 4-fold increase in titer. Review of patient histories might identify underlying causes.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, specifically with respect to laboratory follow-up and serology, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining serum testing at 1 month, 3 months, and every 6 months subsequently. Ideally, these tests should use the same non-treponemal test and be performed in the same laboratory. This process should continue until the non-treponemal test becomes negative or reaches a low plateau (1:1–1:4 sustained for 1 year in the absence of ongoing risk).

### Screening for syphilis with the treponemal immunoassay: Analysis of discordant serology results and implications for clinical management [^112HBXPa]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Screening for syphilis using treponemal chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIA) identifies patients with discordant serology who are not detected by traditional screening methods (e.g. CIA-positive, rapid plasma regain (RPR)-negative). We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and management of patients with discordant syphilis serology.

- **Methods**: From August 2007 to October 2007, patients with CIA-positive, RPR-negative serology were tested with the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Clinical and demographic characteristics, prior syphilis history, and CIA index values were compared for CIA-positive, RPR-negative patients according to TP-PA status.

- **Results**: Out of 21,623 assays, 439 (2%) were CIA-positive, and 255/439 (58%) were RPR-negative; subsequently, 184 (72%) were TP-PA-positive, and 71 (28%) were TP-PA-negative. TP-PA-positive patients were more likely to be male, HIV-positive, homosexual, previously treated for syphilis (57% versus 9%), with higher median CIA index values (9.8 versus 1.6) (all P < .0001). After repeat testing, 7/31 (23%) of CIA-positive, RPR-negative, TP-PA-negative patients seroreverted to CIA-negative.

- **Conclusions**: TP-PA results, in conjunction with clinical and behavioral assessments, helped guide the management of patients with CIA-positive, RPR-negative serology. TP-PA-positive patients were both highly likely to have prior syphilis and major epidemiologic risk factors for syphilis. The CIA-positive, RPR-negative, TP-PA-negative serology may represent a false-positive CIA in low-prevalence settings.

### Improved efficiency using sequential automated immunoassays for syphilis screening in blood donors [^113zgMN8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

For over two decades, Australian Red Cross Lifeblood (Lifeblood) used TPHA (Beckman Coulter PK TP System) for donor screening followed by an RPR test. Positive samples were then sent to local reference laboratories for confirmatory testing where a combination of treponemal and non-treponemal tests was used. The plasma from donations, which are determined to be TPHA-false positive or from donors with adequately treated past syphilis infection, is accepted for fractionation purposes only.

Following a change in the Australian regulation for in vitro diagnostics medical devices in July 2015, Lifeblood was unable to source an appropriately registered RPR test or equivalent test suitable for testing blood donor samples. As a consequence, from April 2016, TPHA-reactive samples were sent to the reference laboratory for confirmatory testing resulting in increased costs, a longer time to obtain results, and plasma wastage as false-positive results could not be determined internally.

Use of sequential screening immunoassays 1 and 2 (IA1 and IA2) to clarify the antibody status of blood donors is successful in viral antibody testing algorithms but has not been applied to syphilis screening. As blood donors have to pass the donor questionnaire which asks about infectious risks, the pre-test probability of the various infections screened for is low, and thus there are a considerable proportion of false-positive tests in blood donors. Using sequential immunoassays that have sufficient differences in detection systems, assay format, and antigens is a cost-effective method to different

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115KRVXF]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that, worldwide, approximately 1.4 million pregnant women had "probable active syphilis" (PAS), referring to syphilis infections sufficiently active to result in mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and with the potential for subsequent adverse pregnancy outcomes. Syphilis in pregnancy can be devastating and is associated with poor fetal or infant outcomes in the majority of cases, with an estimated 52% of PAS cases resulting in an adverse perinatal outcome attributable to syphilis. PAS, defined as seroreactivity for both non-treponemal and treponemal tests, is used as the reporting measure by WHO since surveillance data typically do not include clinical information.

Currently, no single test or combination of tests accurately predicts the extent to which maternal syphilis infection in pregnancy will affect the fetus. However, serologic tests can be suggestive. The combination of a reactive non-treponemal test (e.g. rapid plasma reagin [RPR], venereal disease research laboratory [VDRL]) and a reactive treponemal test (e.g. Treponema pallidum particle agglutination [TP-PA], T. pallidum hemagglutination assay), as defined in the 2008 WHO estimates of PAS, is compelling evidence for an infection that may result in MTCT. Neither type of test is both sensitive and specific on its own. A reactive but unconfirmed non-treponemal test may represent a biological false-positive result, whereas a reactive treponemal test alone may indicate an old or previously treated infection that poses little exposure risk for the fetus.

### Syphilis [^1146BUgA]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

What should I do with inconclusive results? Generally, inconclusive results arise in early infection or from waning antibody levels in late infection. The most common combinations are:

- **Positive RPR with negative treponemal screening (EIA/CLIA) and confirmatory tests (TPPA)**: Suggests the RPR result is a false positive.
- **Positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with negative confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR**: Likely a false positive but could indicate early infection.
- **Positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with indeterminate confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR**: Could represent waning antibody levels following a previous, treated infection or a new infection.

When results are inconclusive, clinicians should inquire about previous syphilis infection and treatment. If early syphilis is possible, retesting in two to four weeks is advisable. If results are unchanged, interpretation is based on history — consider the possibility of late untreated infection, treated infection, or non-venereal treponemal disease in adults from endemic countries in South and Central America, South-East Asia, and Africa.

### Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) versus Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin test (RPR) for screening of syphilis in pregnant women [^114VCVaV]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Low credibility.

To evaluate a treponemal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as an alternative screening test for syphilis in pregnant women, a cross-sectional study of diagnostic test accuracy was carried out in a large-volume laboratory from a tertiary care center. A total of 416 serum samples, including 102 archived syphilis Treponema pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA)-positive samples and 314 samples from pregnant women, were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA. All the samples were subjected to Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), ELISA, and TPHA tests. Performance characteristics of VDRL, RPR, and ELISA were calculated with TPHA as a reference standard test.

VDRL and RPR exhibited higher false positivity of 10.5% and 9.6%, respectively, compared to 2.5% by ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA were 98% and 97.5%, those of VDRL were 71.6% and 89.5%, and of RPR were 73.5% and 90.5%, respectively. Moreover, ELISA had an excellent agreement (kappa = 0.9) with TPHA compared to VDRL/RPR, which had a moderate agreement (kappa = 0.6) only.

In conclusion, ELISA has the potential to replace VDRL/RPR as a screening test for syphilis in centers that can perform ELISA, especially for antenatal screening.

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: The development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^116mpGrU]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). High credibility.

Point-of-care tests (POCT) for syphilis, based on the detection of Treponema pallidum (TP) total antibodies, have limited capacity in distinguishing between active and past/treated syphilis. We report the development and early evaluation of a new prototype POCT based on the detection of TP-IgA antibodies, a novel biomarker for active syphilis.

- **Methods**: The TP-IgA POCT (index test) was developed in response to the World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) for a POCT for confirmatory syphilis testing. Two sub-studies were conducted consecutively using 458 pre-characterized stored plasma samples in China (sub-study one, addressing the criteria for the WHO TPP), and 503 venous blood samples collected from pregnant/postpartum women in South Africa (sub-study two, addressing potential clinical utility). Performance of the index test was assessed against standard laboratory-based serology using a combination of treponemal (TPHA) and non-treponemal (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) tests.

- **Findings**: In sub-study one, the index test demonstrated 96.1% (95% CI = 91.7%-98.5%) sensitivity and 84.7% (95% CI = 80.1%-88.6%) specificity for identification of active syphilis (TPHA positive, RPR positive). It correctly identified 71% (107/150) samples of past-treated syphilis (TPHA positive, RPR negative). In sub-study two, the index test achieved 100% (95% CI = 59%-100%) sensitivity for active syphilis and correctly identified all nine women with past syphilis.

- **Interpretation**: The TP-IgA POCT has met the WHO TPP for a POCT for diagnosis of active syphilis and demonstrates promising results for detecting active infections.

### Novel Treponema pallidum serologic tests: a paradigm shift in syphilis screening for the 21st century [^1176XFWj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The mainstay of diagnosis for Treponema pallidum infections is based on nontreponemal and treponemal serologic tests. Many new diagnostic methods for syphilis have been developed, using specific treponemal antigens and novel formats, including rapid point-of-care tests, enzyme immunoassays, and chemiluminescence assays. Although most of these newer tests are not yet cleared for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration, their performance and ease of automation have promoted their application for syphilis screening. Both sensitive and specific, new screening tests detect antitreponemal IgM and IgG antibodies by use of wild-type or recombinant T. pallidum antigens. However, these tests cannot distinguish between recent and remote or treated versus untreated infections. In addition, the screening tests require confirmation with nontreponemal tests. This use of treponemal tests for screening and nontreponemal serologic tests as confirmatory tests is a reversal of long-held practice. Clinicians need to understand the science behind these tests to use them properly in syphilis management.

The IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining serological screening for syphilis in all pregnant individuals during their first antenatal visit, typically in the first trimester. In high-risk populations and settings with a high prevalence of syphilis, it is advised to repeat serology during the third trimester, ideally between 28–32 weeks of gestation, and again at delivery.

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fyBdF]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

"Probable active syphilis" is defined as seroreactivity in both non-treponemal and treponemal tests. A correction factor of 65%, which represents the proportion of pregnant women reactive in one syphilis test type that were likely reactive in the second, was applied to syphilis seropositivity data reported to WHO for global estimates during pregnancy.

- **Objectives**: To identify more accurate correction factors based on test type reported.

- **Search strategy**: Medline search using: "Syphilis [Mesh] and Pregnancy [Mesh]", "Syphilis [Mesh] and Prenatal Diagnosis [Mesh]", and "Syphilis [Mesh] and Antenatal [Keyword]".

- **Selection criteria**: Eligible studies must have reported results for pregnant or puerperal women for both non-treponemal and treponemal serology.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We manually calculated the crude percent estimates of subjects with both reactive treponemal and reactive non-treponemal tests among subjects with reactive treponemal and among subjects with reactive non-treponemal tests. We summarized the percent estimates using random effects models.

- **Main results**: Countries reporting both reactive non-treponemal and reactive treponemal testing required no correction factor. Countries reporting non-treponemal testing or treponemal testing alone required a correction factor of 52.2% and 53.6%, respectively. Countries not reporting test type required a correction factor of 68.6%.

- **Conclusions**: Future estimates should adjust reported maternal syphilis seropositivity by test type to ensure accuracy.

### Arterial ischemic stroke in HIV: Defining and classifying etiology for research studies [^117RyCVP]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Stroke is a meningovascular complication of syphilis infection. A positive syphilis blood result can be a challenge to interpret in HIV populations. For example, HIV and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) can give false-positive results using nontreponemal methods. Recommendations suggest that a screening blood treponemal test (e.g. enzyme immunoassays) should be followed by an additional confirmatory treponemal test (e.g. Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay), and if both of these are positive, a nontreponemal blood test (e.g. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) should be performed to determine whether this is active or previous disease.

Having established active peripheral disease, neurosyphilis is diagnosed by a positive CSF VDRL or the less sensitive RPR. Because CSF VDRL/RPR can be negative during the early and late stages of neurosyphilis, CSF pleocytosis can be used to make a presumptive diagnosis. However, HIV is also associated with a CSF pleocytosis (≥ 5 cells/mm³), and some have suggested a cutoff of greater than 20 cells be used to diagnose neurosyphilis. The CSF–fluorescence treponemal antibody test is sensitive for neurosyphilis but less specific than CSF VDRL/RPR in symptomatic cases (e.g. those with stroke); this could be useful in ruling out neurosyphilis, especially in asymptomatic cases. However, its utility in the context of HIV infection remains unclear. An additional new approach, which has been validated in an HIV population and may prove useful in the future, is CSF CXCL13 (B cell chemoattractant).

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: A retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^113jhsct]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

There are limited studies of the clinical and laboratory performance of commercial TPHAs; however, our results are consistent with those observed in a study by Cole et al. In this study, 235 treponemal-positive samples, 250 negative blood donor samples, and 3 QC sera were included in an independent laboratory evaluation of four commercial TPHAs compared to the Serodia TPPA. The sensitivity of the commercial TPHAs ranged between 91.7% and 98.3%, and specificity ranged between 99.6% and 100% in this study. The somewhat higher sensitivity of the TPHAs included in our study (95.8–97.2%) may be explained by the inclusion of only individuals with active untreated syphilis in our analysis, compared to the inclusion of 121 positive specimens with unknown disease and treatment categories in the study by Cole et al. The slightly lower specificity observed in our study is likely explained by the difference in the negative cohort included in these studies, with blood donors a much less challenging cohort than the STI clinic/tertiary health care/pregnancy samples included in our study. The negative samples in our study comprised a large proportion of samples with a high CLIA s/co index, consistent with the indication for TPPA and RPR testing of these samples. Importantly, the data set used in this study more closely mimics the sample types that undergo confirmatory treponemal testing when the reverse screening algorithm is used.

### Metaanalysis of the performance of a combined treponemal and nontreponemal rapid diagnostic test for syphilis and yaws [^111tzgqW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The human treponematoses comprise venereal syphilis and the endemic treponematoses yaws, bejel, and pinta. Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum sp. pallidum, remains an important cause of both morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of syphilis is particularly high among women attending antenatal clinics in sub-Saharan Africa, and mother-to-child transmission of syphilis remains a major cause of stillbirth and neonatal death worldwide. It is estimated that mother-to-child transmission of syphilis results in as many as 300,000 stillbirths and neonatal deaths each year in Africa alone. These adverse pregnancy outcomes are entirely preventable through syphilis screening and appropriate treatment.

Yaws is an endemic treponemal infection caused by T. pallidum sp. pertenue. Although closely related to T. pallidum sp. pallidum, yaws is not sexually transmitted and predominantly affects children living in poor, rural, humid communities in the tropics. Untreated yaws progresses to destructive lesions of the bones and soft tissues. Between 2008 and 2012, there were 300,000 cases of yaws reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2012, the WHO launched a global effort to eradicate the disease by 2020. The development of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for yaws has been identified as a priority for the eradication program. As yaws is serologically indistinguishable from syphilis, tests developed for syphilis may also be valuable in diagnosing yaws.

Diagnosis of treponemal infections is based on serological tests that are classified as treponemal specific.

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: Pros and cons [^111GzK27]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

A literature review was conducted to consider factors when deciding to screen for syphilis using either the traditional or reverse algorithm. Searches were performed in the Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane, and Scopus databases, covering the period from January 2000 to June 2017.

The search terms included:

- **Pathogen related**: "Treponema pallidum", "neurosyphilis", "syphilis"
- **Diagnostic procedures**: "sero-diagnose", "serodiagnose", "serology", "test", "exam", "assay", "screen", "lab", "diagnose"
- **Algorithm and testing**: "nontreponemal", "treponemal", "algorithm", "antibody titer", "serofast"

This search resulted in 4702 abstracts. Duplicates, animal studies, non-English-language papers, non-FDA-cleared studies, and non-syphilis-related abstracts were excluded, yielding 1851 abstracts. These were further refined for relevance using terms such as:

- **Diagnostic methods**: "diagnosis", "sero diagnosis", "diagnostics", "serology", "serological test"
- **Test types**: "treponemal", "enzyme immunoassay", "CLIA/CIA", "IgG", "IgM", "TPPA", "TPHA"
- **Screening processes and protocols**: "nontreponemal", "RPR", "VDRL", "laboratory screening", "algorithm"

This curation resulted in 251 abstracts. The subsequent exclusion criteria removed meta-analysis, opinion pieces, guidelines, letters to editors, editorials, concepts, trends, new trends, observations, guidance, reviews, non-FDA-approved tests, and international studies involving non-FDA tests, leaving 69 abstracts. These abstracts became the basis for full article reviews, and findings were summarized in a "table of evidence" related to the key question.

### Serodiagnosis of syphilis: Antibodies to recombinant Tp0453, Tp92, and Gpd proteins are sensitive and specific indicators of infection by Treponema pallidum [^114ZRWxA]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Syphilis serodiagnosis relies on a combination of nonspecific screening tests (antilipoidal antibodies) and Treponema pallidum-specific tests (anti-T. pallidum antibodies). We studied a group of six recombinant T. pallidum antigens for their sensitivities and specificities with sera from individuals with syphilis (n = 43), relapsing fever (n = 8), Lyme disease (n = 8), and leptospirosis (n = 9) and from uninfected individuals (n = 15). Three recombinant proteins, Tp0155, Tp0483, and Tp0751, demonstrated sensitivity values ranging from 28 to 42%. In contrast, three other recombinant proteins exhibited the following sensitivity and specificity values:

- **Tp0453**: 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
- **Tp92 (Tp0326)**: 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity.
- **Gpd (Tp0257)**: 91% sensitivity and 93% specificity.

Tp0453, Tp92, and Gpd were also recognized by sera from individuals with early primary syphilis that were nonreactive with the antilipoidal Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. The reactivities of syphilis patient sera with Tp0453, Tp92, and Gpd were proportional to the titers of these sera with the treponemal test MHA-TP (microhemagglutination assay for T. pallidum). Thus, the recombinant T. pallidum antigens Tp0453, Tp92, and Gpd show promise as diagnostic antigens in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based assay.

### Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of eight commercial assays for the detection of rubella virus-specific IgM antibodies [^117Vu8Wc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment of equivocal results was important in the study. All methods included an indeterminate or equivocal range where the result could not be categorized as either positive or negative. Results in these ranges were handled in two ways for the assessment of test performance: an "always-wrong" approach and a "presumptively positive" approach.

In both scenarios, equivocal results with the non-rubella sera were always considered positive. Thus, only one specificity value was calculated for each method. Sensitivity and accuracy were calculated using both approaches where the equivocal results for the rubella sera were considered negative (always wrong) or positive (presumptively positive). For the accuracy calculations, equivocal results with the non-rubella sera were always considered positive.

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: The development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^112cYzFg]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

The Dual Path Platform (DPP) Syphilis Screen & Confirm test (Chembio Diagnostics, Medford, NY, USA) is the first commercially available rapid point-of-care test (POCT) that provides both treponemal and non-treponemal results, assisting in distinguishing between active and past infections. However, marked variation in the diagnostic performance of the test has been reported, particularly concerning the sensitivity and specificity of the non-treponemal component. A laboratory evaluation in Australia reported that 49.8% (105/211) of presumptive past treated serum samples were misclassified as active syphilis by the DPP test, whereas a field evaluation among pregnant women in Burkina Faso showed that 48.4% (44/91) of women with active syphilis would have been undiagnosed had the DPP test been used.

The difference in test performance can partly be explained by lot-to-lot variation, as a laboratory study in the United States showed a significant difference in the sensitivity for the non-treponemal component of the DPP in two different lots studied: 65.3% (95% CI: 60.5–69.8) and 80.9% (95% CI: 72.6–87.2), respectively.

The re-emergence of a syphilis epidemic among pregnant women and key populations is a global health concern. Thus, innovative assays using a biomarker that can accurately distinguish between past, treated, and active infections at the point of care (POC) are needed. Access to such an assay will improve diagnosis and facilitate appropriate treatment in a timely manner. To promote research and the development of reliable, low-cost POCTs for syphilis, the WHO developed a Target Product Profile (TPP) identifying minimum and preferred criteria.

### Metaanalysis of the performance of a combined treponemal and nontreponemal rapid diagnostic test for syphilis and yaws [^115uRzMR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

There were only minor differences in the performance of the test based on the specimen type used. The sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal component varied depending on the reference treponemal assay used. Compared with using TPPA as the reference treponemal test, the sensitivity of the treponemal component was lower when the reference test was ELISA (P < 0.001) and the specificity was lower when TPHA was taken as the reference standard. The sensitivity of both the treponemal and nontreponemal components was higher in individuals with evidence of clinical disease than in asymptomatic cases.

In multivariable logistic regression, a higher RPR titer was significantly associated with an increased sensitivity of both the treponemal and the nontreponemal components (P < 0.001), after controlling for other variables. The sensitivity was lower for both test components in individuals being tested for yaws than for those tested for syphilis and when the test was performed on serum (P < 0.001 in both cases). The specificity of the treponemal component was higher when the reference standard was either TPPA or TPHA compared with EIA or ELISA (P < 0.0001 in both cases). The specificity of the nontreponemal component was significantly associated with the RPR titer after controlling for other variables (P < 0.023).

Overall agreement between the DPP test and reference serology.

### Serological response to treatment of syphilis according to disease stage and HIV status [^1139g4aE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Our study provides evidence that a combination of the TPPA test and an IgM ELISA is superior to the VDRL test for the diagnosis of syphilis. Furthermore, the syphilis disease stage significantly influences treatment response, whereas HIV coinfection impacts the response only in primary syphilis.

- **Clinical and serological characteristics at the time of diagnosis**: We found a high rate of HIV and syphilis coinfection, which aligns with other reports. This patient group often presented with latent or secondary syphilis, with a substantial proportion being men who have sex with men, as earlier described by the Swiss HIV Cohort Study.

As expected, we found significantly lower VDRL and TPPA titers in early stages of syphilis than in later stages. Interestingly, 38 of 90 patients presenting with primary syphilis symptoms had a negative VDRL test result. In 37 of these patients, the initially positive treponemal IgM declined after therapy, proving that the VDRL result was false-negative. Thus, VDRL test sensitivity was only 58% for primary syphilis, which is lower than previously reported sensitivities of between 66% and 87%. Despite this, the VDRL test has been used for first-line screening in the United States and is recommended in textbooks. However, in recent years, a paradigm shift is ongoing in the United States toward using sensitive and specific enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and chemiluminescence assays for screening. In Europe, treponemal tests (EIA or TPPA), which have been shown to be more sensitive, are recommended as single screening tests.

### Syphilis testing algorithms using treponemal tests for initial screening — four laboratories, New York City, 2005–2006 [^114Ck5T9]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

In the United States, testing for syphilis traditionally consists of initial screening with an inexpensive nontreponemal test, followed by retesting reactive specimens with a more specific, and more expensive, treponemal test. When both test results are reactive, they indicate present or past infection. However, for economic reasons, some high-volume clinical laboratories have begun using automated treponemal tests, such as automated enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) or immunochemiluminescence tests, reversing the testing sequence: first screening with a treponemal test and then retesting reactive results with a nontreponemal test.

This approach has introduced complexities in test interpretation that did not exist with the traditional sequence. Specifically, screening with a treponemal test sometimes identifies individuals who are reactive to the treponemal test but nonreactive to the nontreponemal test. No formal recommendations exist regarding how such results derived from this new testing sequence should be interpreted or how patients with such results should be managed.

To begin an assessment of how clinical laboratories are addressing this concern, the CDC reviewed the testing algorithms used and the test interpretations provided in four laboratories in New York City. Substantial variation was found in the testing strategies used, which might lead to confusion about appropriate patient management. A total of 3,664 (3%) of 116,822 specimens had test results (i.e. reactive treponemal test result and nonreactive nontreponemal test result) that would not have been identified by traditional strategies.

### Discordant results from reverse sequence syphilis screening — five laboratories, United States, 2006–2010 [^114L4tPy]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

The CDC recommends syphilis serologic screening with a nontreponemal test, such as the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, to identify individuals with potential untreated infection. This screening is followed by confirmation using one of several treponemal tests. Recently, the availability of automatable treponemal enzyme and chemiluminescence immunoassays (EIA/CIA) has led some laboratories to adopt a reverse sequence of screening in which a treponemal EIA/CIA is performed first, followed by testing of reactive sera with a nontreponemal test.

To better understand the performance of reverse sequence screening for syphilis, the CDC analyzed data from five laboratories that used reverse sequence screening during 2006–2010. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that among sera reactive on initial screening with a treponemal EIA/CIA, 56.7% had a nonreactive RPR test. Among these discordant sera, 31.6% were also nonreactive by treponemal testing using Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) tests.

Among discordant sera, the rate of nonreactive confirmatory treponemal tests was 2.9 times higher in a population with low prevalence of syphilis, suggesting that the low-prevalence population had a higher percentage of false-positive test results. Although the CDC continues to recommend the traditional algorithm with reactive nontreponemal tests confirmed by treponemal testing, in this report the CDC offers additional recommendations if reverse sequence syphilis screening is used.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: A retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^114zCwrd]. Journal of clinical microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

The primary outcome of the clinical validation study was the performance characteristics — positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) — of each alternative treponemal serological assay compared to the TPPA. Equivocal results were counted as positive for analysis. Any discrepancies between TPPA and the alternative treponemal serological assay were further investigated by reviewing the clinical syphilis stage, *T. pallidum* PCR, and repeat serology results for the patient over a six-month period to determine the true clinical status of the individual. Post hoc sensitivity analyses were also conducted to assess the performance characteristics of each assay if equivocal results were excluded or counted as negative.

- **Predefined subgroup analyses**: These analyses were conducted to determine the performance of these assays by:
	- HIV infection status
	- pregnancy status
	- clinical syphilis stage

Finally, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were calculated for each alternative treponemal serological assay and the Serodia TPPA, compared to the overall clinical syphilis status of the individual (active untreated syphilis compared to no syphilis). Sensitivity of the alternative treponemal serological assays was also determined for the prior syphilis subgroup.

- **Detailed laboratory evaluation of the NewBio TPHA assay**:
	- Currently, the NewBio TPHA (Newmarket Biomedical, Kentford, UK) assay is the only commercially available assay with regulatory approval for use in clinical laboratories.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: A retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^114FJYdw]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay is no longer available in some settings. Here, we report the results of a clinical laboratory evaluation of alternative treponemal assays, including three T. pallidum hemagglutination assays (TPHAs), a T. pallidum IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and a detailed laboratory evaluation of the only TPHA with Australian regulatory approval. The clinical laboratory evaluation comprised 300 sera (120 TPPA reactive and 180 TPPA non-reactive) collected from individuals aged ≥ 18 years between 1 June 2021 and 1 June 2023. The median age was 33, with 92% from a sexually transmitted infection clinic, 71% male, 15.3% living with HIV, and 5% pregnant. Twenty-four percent had active untreated syphilis, 25% had prior treated syphilis, and 50.7% had no syphilis.

- **Positive percent agreement (PPA)**: Compared to TPPA, PPA was 99.2% (95% confidence interval, 95.4–99.9%), 100% (95% CI, 96.9–100%), 99.2% (95% CI, 95.4–99.9%), and 93.3% (95% CI, 87.4–96.6%) for the Arlington, Fortress, and Randox TPHAs, and Euroimmun IgG ELISA.

- **Negative percent agreement (NPA)**: NPA was 97.8% (95% CI, 94.4–99.1%) for each TPHA and 98.9% (95% CI, 96.0–99.8%) for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA.

- **Clinical sensitivity and specificity**: The clinical sensitivity of the Arlington and Fortress TPHAs for active untreated syphilis infection was equivalent to TPPA at 97.2% (95% CI, 90.4–99.5%). The clinical specificity of these assays was 99.3% (95% CI, 96.3–100%).

In the evaluation of the NewBio TPHA, which comprised 322 clinical serum and plasma samples and 22 quality assurance panel samples, results indicate significant potential for use in diagnostic laboratory settings.

### Clinical test performance of a rapid point-of-care syphilis treponemal antibody test: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113KXeVN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

We reviewed prior publications and regulatory data to summarize the performance of the Syphilis Health Check test. We found that the Syphilis Health Check test had over 87% sensitivity and 96% specificity in prospective studies. Additionally, when using nontreponemal results to inform infection status, the Syphilis Health Check demonstrated even higher sensitivity (97%), which is clinically important since those who require treatment are typically those who have both reactive treponemal and nontreponemal results. By combining data from several studies, the precision around sensitivity and specificity estimates increased. Furthermore, we illustrated how the test performed in multiple settings across different specimen types. The sensitivity of the test was notably higher in the FDA trial studies compared with the studies identified in the literature, where the pooled sensitivity was 68.6%. The FDA trials included rigorous training and oversight, while the studies described in the literature did not include methods of quality monitoring. Programs supporting ongoing quality control and quality assurance should be implemented wherever these rapid tests are used. Additionally, the FDA prospective studies used sera for testing on the Syphilis Health Check, whereas the other prospective studies used whole-blood specimens. This difference may have also contributed to the higher sensitivity observed in most of the FDA trials.

The Syphilis Health Check rapid test is currently the only rapid point-of-care whole-blood test for syphilis that has FDA clearance.

### Analytical performance characteristics of a new transcription-mediated amplification assay for Treponema pallidum [^1149DaLT]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

The correlation of the results of TMA testing of the RPR-positive serum specimens with clinical diagnoses is as follows: TMA positivity was 29.7% (11/37) among persons with syphilis diagnoses. TMA was 37.5% (3/8) positive for persons with primary syphilis, 35.7% (5/14) positive for secondary syphilis, and 20% (2/10) positive for persons diagnosed with early latent syphilis. There was one TMA-positive result for a serum specimen from a person with a clinical diagnosis of syphilis with no staging indicated in the medical record. TMA was 0% (0/19) positive with sera from persons with histories of treated syphilis (n = 18) or with a biological false-positive RPR result (n = 1).

### Update on syphilis diagnostics [^111n651Z]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Syphilis is rising globally, leading to increased morbidity and mortality, particularly among underserved populations. Accurate, reliable, affordable, and timely assays for syphilis screening and testing are essential in combating this epidemic. This review provides a brief overview of laboratory methods for syphilis diagnosis, focusing on recent updates in diagnostics and future research directions.

- **Recent findings**: Diagnosing and staging syphilis can be complex and time-consuming. Traditional darkfield microscopy has been replaced by algorithms that include both nontreponemal and treponemal antibody tests for screening and confirmation of active *Treponema pallidum* infection. Newer diagnostic modalities, such as nucleic acid amplification assays (NAATs) and point-of-care testing (POCT), offer promise for increasing the identification of active syphilis but have notable limitations. More development is needed to create accurate, reliable, affordable, and rapid tests to optimize syphilis diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Algorithms utilizing a combination of serological treponemal and nontreponemal assays remain the standard of care for syphilis diagnosis. However, recently developed NAATs and POCT assays present opportunities to enhance syphilis detection. Further research is warranted to improve these testing modalities and explore additional markers that could aid in syphilis diagnosis.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: A retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^111E18bh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay is no longer available in some settings. Here, we report the results of a clinical laboratory evaluation of alternative treponemal assays, including three T. pallidum hemagglutination assays (TPHAs), a T. pallidum IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and a detailed laboratory evaluation of the only TPHA with Australian regulatory approval. The clinical laboratory evaluation comprised 300 sera (120 TPPA reactive and 180 TPPA non-reactive) collected from individuals aged 18 years and older between 1 June 2021 and 1 June 2023. The median age was 33 years. Of the participants, 92% were from a sexually transmitted infection clinic, 71% were male, 15.3% were living with HIV, and 5% were pregnant. Additionally, 24% had active untreated syphilis, 25% had prior treated syphilis, and 50.7% had no syphilis.

Compared to TPPA, the positive percent agreement (PPA) was 99.2% (95% confidence interval, 95.4–99.9%), 100% (95% CI, 96.9–100%), 99.2% (95% CI, 95.4–99.9%), and 93.3% (95% CI, 87.4–96.6%) for the Arlington, Fortress, and Randox TPHAs, and Euroimmun IgG ELISA, respectively. The negative percent agreement (NPA) was 97.8% (95% CI, 94.4–99.1%) for each TPHA and 98.9% (95% CI, 96.0–99.8%) for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA. The clinical sensitivity of the Arlington and Fortress TPHAs for active untreated syphilis infection was equivalent to TPPA at 97.2% (95% CI, 90.4–99.5%), and the clinical specificity of these assays was 99.3% (95% CI, 96.3–100%).

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by *Treponema pallidum* subsp. *pallidum*. In 2019, the estimated global prevalence of syphilis was 49.7 million, a 61% increase from 1990. Rates of syphilis have risen significantly in many high- and middle-income countries over the past decade. In England, notifications more than doubled between 2013 and 2022 (6.2–15.4 per 100,000), while they more than tripled in Australia and the United States (US) (7.6–24.3 per 100,000 and 5.5–17.7 per 100,000, respectively). Rates of congenital syphilis have also surged, with a 755% increase reported in the US between 2012 and 2021. Syphilis can present with numerous symptoms and lead to severe conditions, including neurosyphilis. In pregnancy, syphilis infection can be transmitted vertically, causing neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Serological testing is the primary method for diagnosing syphilis, involving multiple tests to screen, confirm, and stage the infection. The reverse screening algorithm is commonly used in high-volume laboratories. This algorithm begins with a sensitive treponemal antibody immunoassay. If this assay is positive, it is followed by non-treponemal antibody tests. If the treponemal and non-treponemal results are discordant, a second confirmatory treponemal test is performed.

In the United Kingdom and Australia, if the screening treponemal antibody result is positive, national guidelines recommend confirmation with additional tests. The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay is considered the preferred method for performance of non-treponemal and treponemal tests.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: A retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^112PnKQ6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Of the 149 T. pallidum CLIA non-reactive, TPPA, and RPR non-reactive samples, 93 (93 out of 149; 62.4%) had CLIA, TPPA, and RPR testing performed due to an elevated CLIA s/co index (0.7). The median T. pallidum CLIA s/co index value for T. pallidum CLIA, TPPA, and RPR non-reactive samples was 0.7 (IQR: 0.43–0.76). Twenty-one of the 48 (16.0%) concurrently collected swabs for T. pallidum PCR testing (43.8%) were positive for T. pallidum DNA.

- **Performance characteristics of assays**: The PPA, NPA, PPV, and NPV for the assays included in the evaluation of commercially available alternative treponemal antibody assays compared to the Serodia TPPA assay are presented in Table 2. Of the discordant results (TPPA non-reactive and TPHA reactive/equivocal), several were from individuals with prior treated syphilis, including three out of four from the Arlington TPHA, three out of four from the Fortress TPHA, and two out of four from the Randox. None of the two discordant Euroimmun IgG ELISA results (TPPA non-reactive and ELISA reactive) were from individuals with prior treated syphilis. Performance characteristics of the alternative treponemal serological assays compared to the TPPA among pregnant individuals and PLHIV are described in Table S8. No significant difference was detected in these subgroup analyses, noting that the number of pregnant individuals included in the study was limited.

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: The development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^114USEFq]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Point-of-care tests (POCT) for syphilis, based on the detection of Treponema pallidum (TP) total antibodies, have limited capacity in distinguishing between active and past/treated syphilis. We report the development and early evaluation of a new prototype POCT based on the detection of TP-IgA antibodies, a novel biomarker for active syphilis.

- **Methods**: The TP-IgA POCT (index test) was developed in response to the World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) for a POCT for confirmatory syphilis testing. Two sub-studies were conducted consecutively using 458 pre-characterized stored plasma samples in China (sub-study one, addressing the criteria for the WHO TPP), and 503 venous blood samples collected from pregnant/postpartum women in South Africa (sub-study two, addressing potential clinical utility). Performance of the index test was assessed against standard laboratory-based serology using a combination of treponemal (TPHA) and non-treponemal (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) tests.

- **Findings**: In sub-study one, the index test demonstrated 96.1% (95% CI = 91.7%-98.5%) sensitivity and 84.7% (95% CI = 80.1%-88.6%) specificity for the identification of active syphilis (TPHA positive, RPR positive). It correctly identified 71% (107/150) samples of past-treated syphilis (TPHA positive, RPR negative). In sub-study two, the index test achieved 100% (95% CI = 59%-100%) sensitivity for active syphilis and correctly identified all nine women with past syphilis.

- **Interpretation**: The TP-IgA POCT has met the WHO TPP for a POCT for the diagnosis of active syphilis.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^1145sWrh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

We developed a list of key findings in 'Summary of findings' tables and determined the certainty in the summary estimates for each test and findings using the GRADE approach (Schünemann 2020a; Schünemann 2020b). Starting at high certainty, we downgraded meta-analyses by one level when at least half of the studies had a high risk of bias on one or more domains. We downgraded for indirectness when at least half of the studies in the meta-analyses had high concerns regarding applicability on at least one domain. We downgraded for imprecision when fewer people with the target condition were included than would have been needed to achieve the sensitivity estimates listed, with a width of the confidence interval of at most 10 percentage points; and we downgraded for inconsistency when study estimates differed more than 20 percentage points from each other. We did not consider publication bias to be a problem.

We will undertake the searches of published literature, preprints, and new test approvals weekly. Dependent on the number of new and important studies found, we will consider updating each review with each search if resources allow.

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: pros and cons [^116q2j1C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Screening for syphilis is performed using serological assays that detect treponemal and nontreponemal antibodies. The sequence in which these tests are performed differentiates the traditional from the reverse algorithm. In the traditional algorithm, a nontreponemal test (e.g. rapid plasma reagin [RPR] or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test [VDRL]) is used as the initial screen, and reactive samples are confirmed with a treponemal test. Conversely, the reverse algorithm uses a treponemal test for screening, with reactive samples followed by a nontreponemal test. Discordant results between the treponemal screen and the nontreponemal test are resolved with a second confirmatory treponemal test (e.g. Treponema pallidum particle agglutination) that preferably detects different antigens than the treponemal screen. There is no gold standard for serologic syphilis testing; therefore, all screening results must be correlated with clinical presentation for a diagnosis of syphilis.

According to a 2015 College of American Pathologists (CAP) survey, approximately 80% of laboratories perform the traditional algorithm, and 20% perform the reverse algorithm when a single algorithm is offered at their facility. A more recent review of CAP proficiency testing summary data showed a continuing trend toward increased use of the reverse algorithm. In 2019, 35.7% of CAP survey G (syphilis serology) participants reported use of a treponemal assay. The algorithm utilized is primarily driven by the volume of syphilis testing.

### 2020 European guideline on the management of syphilis [^111msfK7]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2021). High credibility.

In regards to diagnostic investigations for syphilis, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend repeating the non-treponemal test quantitatively (if not initially done) in patients with positive or discrepant results. This is especially important when both a treponemal test and a non-treponemal test are utilized for primary screening tests, such as enzyme immunoassay, ELISA, chemiluminescence immunoassay, Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test, Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test, plus VDRL/RPR.

### Retrospective review of Treponema pallidum PCR and serology results: Are both tests necessary [^111pCp1Q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

There has been a resurgence of syphilis diagnoses in Australia. We investigated whether our Treponema pallidum PCR test provides any additional diagnostic information over syphilis serology (chemiluminescence immunoassay [CMIA], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination [TPPA] assay, and the rapid plasma reagin [RPR] flocculation test). A retrospective audit of all T. pallidum PCR requests that came through our laboratory from January 2010 to June 2017 was conducted; data collected included age, gender, site of swab, and results from T. pallidum PCR, syphilis serology, and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 PCRs.

A total of 441 T. pallidum PCR tests were performed; on average, 3 T. pallidum PCRs per month were requested in 2011, and this rate increased to 17.2 requests per month in 2017. A total of 323 patients had both T. pallidum PCR and syphilis serology performed, with 67% of swabs taken from the genitals. T. pallidum PCR gave positive results for 61/323 (19%) patients; of these 61 patients, 59 (97%) also had positive syphilis serology results (T. pallidum PCR sensitivity, 68%; specificity, 99%; positive predictive value, 97%; negative predictive value, 89%).

Syphilis serology was positive for 91/323 patients (28%); of these 91 patients, 61 (66%) were also T. pallidum PCR positive (syphilis serology sensitivity, 97%; specificity, 88%; positive predictive value, 60%; negative predictive value, 99%). The Cohen's kappa value was 0.74, indicating substantial agreement between the two tests. Our results show that most patients with positive T. pallidum PCR results also have…

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: The development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^112hXMVX]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Sub-study 2 – A prospective evaluation**: Using fresh venous blood samples in South Africa.

Specimen collection: Between June and December 2018, venous blood samples were consecutively collected from consenting pregnant or peripartum women (within two weeks of miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, or childbirth), aged 18 years or older, attending the obstetric and gynecology department at the RMMCH in Johannesburg, South Africa. Each participant provided 3 mL of venous blood collected in EDTA tubes for standard syphilis serology reference tests and the index test, performed in duplicate by two independent test operators. Ethics approval was obtained from AHEC (#556/17) and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa (#R14/49). All participants provided signed informed consent.

Reference tests: A combination of a treponemal test (TPHA) and a non-treponemal test (RPR) was used as standard laboratory-based reference testing for the diagnosis of active syphilis infection. For the treponemal component, the ADVIA Centaur Syphilis assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA) was used, and for the non-treponemal component, the RPR (Omega Diagnostics, UK) test was used. As per the standard of care at the study site, a woman who had reactive results for both TPHA and RPR tests (any titre) was defined as having active syphilis; a reactive TPHA and non-reactive RPR indicate past/treated syphilis; a non-reactive TPHA and a reactive RPR is biologically false positive; and non-reactive results to both tests indicate no syphilis.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^1114fkEy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from 1960 to June 30, 2017. Following the consultation in November 2017, we updated the literature search from July 2017 to September 2018 using the following search terms: (Treponema pallidum OR Neurosyphilis OR Syphilis) AND (sero-diagnos* OR serodiagnos* OR (serolog* AND (test* OR exam* OR assay* OR screen* OR lab* OR diagnos* OR nontreponemal OR treponemal OR algorithm* OR antibody titer) OR serofast)). The search was limited to human studies published in English.

The initial search yielded 4851 non-duplicated abstracts. We excluded 4504 abstracts that were not relevant to the key question: studies of nontreponemal testing only, animal studies, direct detection studies, review articles, guidelines, letters to the editor, and other publications that were not primary research studies. We reviewed 347 abstracts and further excluded 230 studies that described obsolete tests, tests not approved by the FDA, those that used a gold standard based exclusively on non-FDA approved tests, studies of prevalence or laboratory technique only (without test performance), any duplicate publications, and abstracts without a full manuscript. After exclusions, 117 full papers were reviewed for potential inclusion. Eighty-one studies with either descriptive data on the use of treponemal tests or actual test performance data were abstracted into Tables of Evidence (Supplementary Table).

Studies with test performance data were prioritized according to their relevance to the key question (Supplementary Table).

### Clinical development and performance of the First to Know syphilis self-test for over-the-counter usage: A rapid test for treponemal antibody [^115sN1hJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

The laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is complex and necessitates a combination of clinical and laboratory criteria to differentiate past infection and absence of infection. Culture for T. pallidum is cumbersome and is available only in selected research laboratories, and there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared PCR test for syphilis at present. Darkfield microscopy is a direct detection test for T. pallidum that can diagnose early primary syphilis (sensitivity 75% to 100%); however, it requires samples from moist lesions or exudates, along with highly trained technicians and specialized equipment. It is not recommended for secondary syphilis due to low sensitivity.

Serological testing remains the mainstay for diagnosing syphilis infection. Serology is divided into two different types of tests: non-treponemal tests (NTTs), such as the rapid plasma regain [RPR] test and the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, and treponemal tests (TTs), such as the T. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS). While TTs are often positive for life, NTT titers usually decrease after treatment. However, in certain cases, especially in late stages of syphilis, non-treponemal antibodies may persist at low levels for extended periods. The traditional NTTs are cost-effective and useful for initial screening and monitoring of syphilis treatment; however, they can be affected by false-positive and false-negative results. TTs provide higher specificity and sensitivity for confirming syphilis but cannot effectively…

### Laboratory assay evaluation demystified: A review of key factors influencing interpretation of test results using different assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis [^114VW5mi]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests are an integral part of the diagnosis and management of patients; however, these tests are far from perfect. Their imperfections can be due to patient health condition, specimen collection, and technological difficulty with performing the assay and interpretation. To be clinically useful, testing requires calculation of positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs).

During the global pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), multiple assays with unknown clinical sensitivity and specificity have been rapidly developed to aid in the diagnosis of the disease. Due to a lack of surveillance testing, the prevalence of COVID-19 remains unknown. Using this situation as a clinical example, the goal of this article is to clarify the key factors that influence the PPV and NPV yielded by diagnostic testing. By doing so, we hope to offer healthcare providers information that will help them better understand the potential implications of utilizing these test results in clinical patient management.

### Clinical test performance of a rapid point-of-care syphilis treponemal antibody test: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114D2fhV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature and conducted a meta-analysis to address the question: "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check, a rapid qualitative test for the detection of human antibodies to Treponema pallidum?" The Syphilis Health Check is the only rapid syphilis test currently cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis using Bayesian bivariate random-effects and fixed-effect models to create pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check. We identified five test evaluations published in the literature and ten studies submitted to the FDA for a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments waiver application.

- **Laboratory evaluations**: The pooled sensitivity (95% CI) from the laboratory evaluations (n = 5) was 98.5% (92.1–100%), while pooled specificity was 95.9% (81.5–100.0%).
- **Prospective studies**: The pooled sensitivity for prospective studies (n = 10) was 87.7% (71.8–97.2%), while pooled specificity was 96.7% (91.9–99.2%).

Using nontreponemal supplemental testing, the sensitivity improved to a pooled sensitivity of 97.0% (94.8–98.6%). The Syphilis Health Check may provide accurate detection of treponemal antibody.

**Standard laboratory-based and proposed point-of-care testing algorithms**: Fig. 2 presents the algorithms for diagnosing active syphilis among pregnant women. The second aspect examined is the diagnosis of syphilis infection with low RPR titres. Specifically, the RPR, capable of detecting samples with high RPR titres (≥ 8), does not appear to reduce overtreatment of syphilis.

### An evaluation of a novel dual treponemal/nontreponemal point-of-care test for syphilis as a tool to distinguish active from past treated infection [^112kwTiW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Most syphilis point-of-care (POC) tests detect treponemal antibodies, which persist after successful treatment. This causes subsequent POC tests to be positive despite no active infection and can lead to unnecessary treatment. We evaluated a new POC test incorporating a nontreponemal component to distinguish active from past infection.

- **Methods**: Sera stored at two Australian laboratories were tested with the DPP Screen and Confirm Assay. Treponemal and nontreponemal test lines were compared to corresponding conventional treponemal and nontreponemal reference test results, namely immunoassays and rapid plasma reagin (RPR), respectively, with RPR quantification by endpoint titration. The concordance of the POC test outcome with conventional test results was assessed according to serological and clinical categories.

- **Results**: Among 1,005 serum samples tested, DPP treponemal line sensitivity was 89.8% (95% confidence interval, 87.3%-91.9%) and specificity was 99.3% (95% CI, 97.0%-99.9%). DPP nontreponemal line sensitivity was 94.2% (95% CI, 91.8%-96.0%) and specificity was 62.2% (95% CI, 57.5%-66.6%). DPP test outcomes (pair of test lines) were concordant with both reference test results for 94.3% of 404 high-titer infections, 90.1% of 121 low-titer infections, 27.5% of 211 past/treated infections, and 78.1% of 242 infections classified as not syphilis. Among 211 past/treated infections, 49.8% were incorrectly identified as active infection, and a further 22.8% as not syphilis.

- **Conclusions**: DPP test use would result in the identification of over 93% of active syphilis infections, whereas just over half of past/treated infections were incorrectly classified.

### Syphilis infection prevalence in the Middle East and North Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115yBfEp]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Another limitation lies in the diverse diagnostic tests used in the identified studies, which may exhibit variations in sensitivity and specificity. Although our analyses were stratified based on broad testing modalities (non-treponemal, treponemal, or a combination of both), we were unable to account for potential individual-test diagnostic biases within each category. Some studies did not explicitly specify the particular biological assay employed for infection ascertainment, and therefore a characterization of the syphilis diagnosis cannot be made. These studies were included for completeness but were analyzed separately. We noted an increase in the use of point-of-care tests in the last decade, which are increasingly recognized as reliable, accessible, and convenient options, particularly in resource-limited settings and in underserved and key populations.

- **Small-study effect and publication bias**: A strong small-study effect was evident and confirmed by the analysis that demonstrated the presence of publication bias. Studies featuring a sample size of at least 200 for populations at high risk and STI clinic attendees, and at least 500 for all other population groups, reported 60% lower prevalence levels (Table 2). This observation remained consistent in a sensitivity analysis investigating the small study effect separately for programmatic data (ANC and blood donor data) versus all other epidemiological studies among the other population groups (data not shown). However, the majority of studies included in the analyses had large sample sizes (Table S16), enhancing the precision of the estimates.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^116GZYvr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Sixty-five individuals (widely available) or 62 (epidemiological exposure) would have a positive test result, of which 40 and 30 would be false positives, yielding positive predictive values (PPVs) of 38% and 52%, respectively. Meanwhile, 25 individuals (widely available) and 18 (epidemiological exposure) with negative test results would be falsely negative, with negative predictive values (NPVs) of 99.7% and 99.8%.

The confidence intervals for the average sensitivity estimates used in these calculations are relatively wide, indicating that the number of false negatives observed in practice could differ from these figures, as shown by the estimates derived from the confidence intervals. However, at very low prevalence of disease, as might occur in a mass screening scenario, the effect on the absolute number of false negatives observed could be small (e.g. from 21 to 29 using the 95% confidence intervals for the average sensitivity where testing was widely available). In contrast, although the 95% confidence intervals for average specificities were only 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points wide, the absolute numbers of false positives ranged between 20 and 50.

Increasing the prevalence of confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection to 1% or 2% makes little difference to the absolute number of false positive results, but has a large relative effect when considered in relation to the total number of positive test results (true and false positives). The PPVs increase to 72% for widely available testing and 81% for testing contacts of confirmed cases at 2% prevalence.

### Clinical development and performance of the First to Know Syphilis Self-Test for over-the-counter usage: A rapid test for treponemal antibody [^111yjXLM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

The overall test results for the various laboratory comparator tests and the First to Know Syphilis Test are summarized in Table S1. Among the 106 true positives determined by the composite reference standard, 99 tested positive with the First to Know Syphilis Test. Of the 41 participants who tested positive on all three reference tests (Bioplex +, RPR +, TPPA +), 40 (97.6%) tested positive with the First to Know test (Table 3). Additionally, of the 64 participants who were positive for both treponemal tests (Bioplex and TPPA) but negative for RPR, 59 (92.2%) tested positive with the First to Know test (Table 3).

There was no significant difference in First to Know test positivity between those positive by both treponemal and non-treponemal tests (40/42, 95.2%) and those positive only on the two treponemal tests (59/64, 92.2%). The seven false negatives included five positives by both Bioplex and TPPA, one positive across all laboratory comparator tests, and one positive by TPPA and RPR. We speculate that the false negatives could be due to low antibody levels in early or low-level infections. The IFU recommends that individuals who test negative but still suspect infection should retest 10 days after symptom onset or consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation. Additionally, differences in specimen types, such as purified serum or plasma used for the laboratory comparator tests versus whole blood specimens tested by the First to Know test, could also have contributed to missed detections.
