## Question

Does gadolinium dye affect gfr

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) affect glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and if so, how and under what circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of GBCAs and whether they are cleared by glomerular filtration. Then, I should verify whether GBCAs themselves impair renal function or if the relationship is unidirectional (impaired GFR alters GBCA clearance). Next, I will examine evidence for nephrotoxicity versus confounding by indication and dose. After that, I should review guideline positions and risk stratification by GFR and agent class. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable conclusion and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and clearance. GBCAs are small, hydrophilic, extracellular agents that distribute into plasma and interstitial fluid and are eliminated unchanged almost entirely by the kidneys via glomerular filtration; renal impairment prolongs their half-life and increases systemic exposure, which is why exposure scales inversely with GFR, but this reflects impaired clearance rather than GBCAs causing GFR decline per se [^114hji7H] [^115wRHTi] [^112ppCuQ].

> Wait, let me verify the directionality of the relationship. The dominant clinical signal is that reduced GFR increases GBCA exposure and residence time, not that GBCAs reduce GFR; for example, with gadopiclenol, AUC rises as renal function declines, and elimination half-life lengthens with decreasing eGFR, consistent with linear pharmacokinetics and unchanged renal clearance as the primary route of elimination, which argues against a primary nephrotoxic effect on GFR from the agent itself [^115wRHTi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about nephrotoxicity. I initially thought GBCAs might be broadly nephrotoxic like iodinated agents, but I should double-check the strength of evidence. Case reports and small series describe acute kidney injury temporally associated with GBCA exposure, including biopsy evidence of tubular injury in some cases, yet causality is uncertain and many events occurred in patients with preexisting CKD, diabetes, or high-risk settings; larger observational data in renally insufficient patients have not shown consistent increases in creatinine after macrocyclic agents, and a prospective study of gadoterate in CKD found no signal for clinically meaningful renal function decline versus non-contrast MRI, suggesting that when AKI occurs, it is likely multifactorial rather than a direct GBCA nephrotoxin effect [^1165fgNK] [^111Uagjr] [^115NnrCX] [^1148gTBt].

> I need to check the dose context, because off-label high-dose intra-arterial GBCA use for radiography has been linked to renal dysfunction in older series. In a cohort receiving high-dose gadodiamide for angiography or CT, clinically relevant nephrotoxicity occurred in a minority, and importantly, the doses used exceeded typical MRI diagnostic doses, reinforcing that risk is dose dependent and amplified in CKD rather than reflecting inherent GFR suppression at standard MRI doses [^115VCfhQ] [^115xX5kU].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. Contemporary KDIGO and KDOQI guidance emphasize that in patients with eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² who require GBCA, preferred agents are ACR Group II/III macrocyclics, with careful risk–benefit assessment; they do not assert that GBCAs directly lower GFR, but they do warn about NSF risk in impaired elimination and recommend minimizing dose and avoiding high-risk linear agents, which supports the view that the primary renal concern is delayed clearance and NSF, not direct GFR toxicity from modern agents at standard doses [^116EmEfJ] [^114Nkqss] [^1177AdDu].

> Let me consider agent class, because stability matters. Linear agents, especially older nonionic formulations like gadodiamide, have higher NSF risk and have been associated with more tissue gadolinium deposition. Macrocyclic agents have much lower NSF risk even in stage 4–5 CKD, with pooled incidence estimates near zero in large series, which further reduces concern for renal functional harm when guidelines are followed and doses are minimized [^113CbREH] [^114UfEJU].

> I should confirm practical recommendations. For patients with eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or AKI, if GBCA is essential, use the lowest effective dose of a Group II macrocyclic agent, document the indication, and avoid closely spaced redosing. Routine prophylactic dialysis is not recommended for Group II agents, though in patients already on hemodialysis, some guidance suggests timing the scan before a scheduled session, whereas other guidance advises against altering dialysis solely for contrast, underscoring that the balance of evidence does not support dialysis solely to mitigate NSF with modern agents [^116EmEfJ] [^112QdxSJ] [^1174QzLt].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is about measuring GFR with gadolinium tracers? Does that imply GBCAs change GFR? MRI-based GFR estimation uses freely filtered gadolinium chelates as markers to calculate clearance, which is a measurement method and does not imply that the contrast agent itself impairs filtration; rather, it leverages the known glomerular handling of these agents to estimate kidney function, reinforcing that their clearance is GFR dependent rather than GFR altering [^11697VnK] [^111cY5YS].

> In summary, I should double-check that my conclusion matches the data. GBCAs do not directly reduce GFR in clinically meaningful ways at standard MRI doses. The observed relationships reflect impaired renal function prolonging GBCA elimination and increasing exposure, with rare AKI events likely multifactorial and dose/context dependent, particularly with older linear agents or off-label high-dose intra-arterial use. With modern macrocyclic agents and guideline-concordant dosing, the renal risk is very low, and the dominant concern remains NSF in those with severely reduced GFR rather than direct nephrotoxic suppression of GFR [^1148gTBt] [^115NnrCX] [^115wRHTi] [^1174QzLt] [^113CbREH].

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) **do not directly reduce GFR** in patients with normal renal function. In patients with **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** or acute kidney injury, GBCAs can cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) [^114gZZp9] — a serious, potentially fatal condition — but they do not directly impair GFR. The main renal risk is **NSF**, not acute kidney injury, and this risk is minimized by using macrocyclic agents [^112kUiGC] and the lowest effective dose [^112QdxSJ]. For patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², prefer ACR Group II/III agents [^116EmEfJ] and avoid Group I agents; no prophylactic dialysis is needed for Group II/III agents [^1174QzLt] [^112QdxSJ].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of gadolinium contrast agents

GBCAs are eliminated unchanged by the kidneys via glomerular filtration [^115wRHTi]; **impaired renal function prolongs their half-life** and increases systemic exposure [^112ppCuQ], but this reflects reduced clearance rather than a direct GFR-lowering effect [^115NnrCX].

---

## Evidence regarding gadolinium contrast and GFR

### Patients with normal renal function

In patients with normal renal function, **no evidence** shows that GBCAs directly reduce GFR or cause acute kidney injury (AKI) [^115NnrCX].

---

### Patients with impaired renal function

In patients with impaired renal function, **NSF risk rises as eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^116EmEfJ], especially with linear agents; however, GBCAs do not directly reduce GFR [^1148gTBt]. Rare case reports describe AKI after GBCA [^1165fgNK], but causality is unclear and often confounded by other factors [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **KDIGO 2024**: Prefer ACR Group II/III GBCAs in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² who require GBCA [^116EmEfJ] [^114Nkqss].
- **ACR/NKF**: Group II GBCAs can be used in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² when indicated; NSF risk is very low (< 0.07%) [^113CbREH] [^1174QzLt].
- **VA/DoD**: Use Group II/III agents in CKD; avoid Group I agents if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or with AKI [^1113Y3b9] [^112QdxSJ].

---

## Risk factors and precautions

- **Risk factors**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², AKI, linear agents, high doses, repeated exposures [^1129QJ1A] [^1123zaUx].
- **Precautions**: Use lowest effective dose, prefer macrocyclic agents, avoid Group I agents in severe CKD or AKI, and screen for renal dysfunction before administration [^116EmEfJ] [^112QdxSJ].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Patient population** | **Effect on gfr** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Normal renal function | No effect | No evidence of GFR reduction or AKI |
| Impaired renal function (eGFR < 30) | No direct effect | - NSF risk increased <br/> - But no direct GFR reduction |
| Acute kidney injury | No direct effect | NSF risk increased, but no direct GFR reduction |

---

Gadolinium contrast agents **do not directly reduce GFR**; the main renal risk is NSF in patients with severe CKD or AKI, mitigated by using macrocyclic agents and the lowest effective dose [^115NnrCX] [^113CbREH].

WARNING: RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INTRATHECAL USE and NEPHROGENIC SYSTEMIC FIBROSIS

Risk Associated with Intrathecal Use

Intrathecal administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) can cause serious adverse reactions including death, coma, encephalopathy, and seizures. Gadoteridol injection is not approved for intrathecal use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis

GBCAs increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of Gadoteridol injection in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. NSF may result in fatal or debilitating systemic fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs.

The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with:

chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m), or
acute kidney injury

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g. age greater than 60 years, hypertension or diabetes), estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.

For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended gadoteridol dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug from the body prior to re-administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Glomerular filtration rate

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a parameter that is used to assess renal function. The serum creatinine level is a rough indicator of the glomerular filtration rate, it is easy and cheap to obtain, but it provides no information about each individual kidney. For the measurement of the GFR by MRI, several techniques have been investigated. The first technique used MR spectroscopy to measure the T1 relaxation times of urine and serum samples taken at intervals after intravenous gadolinium administration. Calculation of the glomerular filtration rate was based on the linear relationship of 1/T1 to the serial dilution measurements of the serum and urine samples. This technique still had the disadvantage of measuring the GFR of both kidneys together.

Another MR technique assessing each individual kidney was developed by calculating the extraction fraction (EF) of Gd-DTPA, which is the difference between renal arterial and renal venous Gd-DTPA concentration, normalized to the arterial Gd-DTPA concentration:The gadolinium concentrations can be calculated after measurement of the T1 relaxation time of arterial and venous blood before and after intravenous gadolinium administration, using the formulawhere R is the relaxivity of gadolinium, and T1 pre and T1 post are the T1 relaxation times before and after intravenous gadolinium. The glomerular filtration rate can then be calculated according to the formulawhere RBF is renal blood flow, which can be measured by phase contrast flow quantification, and Hct is hematocrit.

An alternative MRI technique to measure glomerular filtration rate also uses contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI and is based on a the time-dependent concentrations of Gd-DTPA in the cortex and the medulla — a two compartment model. The different techniques to measure glomerular filtration rate still need to be validated, and their role in clinical practice needs to be established.

### State of practice: ASNR statement on gadolinium-based contrast agent use in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115A7PKP]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Beginning in 2006, neuroradiologists became increasingly aware of the risk of nephrogenic system fibrosis (NSF) when patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) received gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in conjunction with MRI scans. Radiology practices began withholding GBCAs from MRI patients with substantial CKD and instated a variety of safety measures to ensure that these individuals did not inadvertently receive GBCAs. As a result, the worldwide incidence of NSF was dramatically reduced. Since that time, a wealth of research on NSF and its etiology has found few unconfounded cases associated with those GBCAs categorized as group II agents by the American College of Radiology.

Methods

In 2023 and 2024, members of the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR) Standards and Guidelines Committee reviewed new research evidence on GBCA safety and its relevance to current MRI contrast administration guidelines for patients with CKD. This focused on systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted during the past 5 years. Upon consideration of this literature, recommendations for the administration of GBCAs to patients with CKD were formulated.

Key Message

For neuroimaging applications, the ASNR recommends that group II GBCAs no longer be withheld in patients with CKD when these agents are medically indicated for diagnosis. Moreover, if group II GBCAs are exclusively used in an MRI practice, other safety measures, such as checking renal function or querying patients about CKD, can be discontinued.

### Revisiting the risks of MRI with gadolinium based contrast agents-review of literature and guidelines [^115BdS1n]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) have been linked to the occurrence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in renal impaired patients. The majority of studies that report on their use in the renal impaired population were published prior to the publications that prompted the alert on NSF. This association has triggered public health advisory bodies to issue guidelines and best practice recommendations on its use in renal insufficiency. Since then, this has all but halted the rapid progression and uptake of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in this population that was seen in the early to mid 2000s. Understanding of the events that led to these recommendations can increase clinical awareness and the implications of the use of GBCAs in daily imaging practice. We conducted an electronic database search [PubMed/Medline, EMBASE] to collate the evidence in published literature on the occurance of NSF in the renal impaired. We also carried out a forward citation and bibliographic search of identified studies. Published studies were reviewed for reported pathophysiological and clinical manifestations, proposed diagnostic pathway, treatments options and reported incidence. We also reviewed practice recommendations, guidelines and published manuals on contrast safety.

### Lesion visualization of an oral manganese contrast agent compared to unenhanced MRI and gadobenate dimeglumine in patients undergoing liver magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of colorectal cancer metastases: centralized assessment of a randomized, crossover, phase II study [^116s9Bu1]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Early detection of liver metastases, particularly before the development of extrahepatic disease, can significantly impact patient outcomes and potentially lead to curative treatment. If these are detected early and deemed eligible for surgical resection, the survival rate can be improved, and sometimes, full recovery is possible. In patients who underwent resection for colorectal liver metastases, the 5-year overall survival rate was reported to be 46%, whereas it was only 6% for patients who were not subjected to surgical treatment for liver metastases.

Imaging plays a pivotal role in managing patients with focal liver lesions (primary tumors or metastases). Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly used in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), providing enhanced image contrast and improved visualization of tissues and pathological conditions through intravenous (IV) administration. However, their use has raised important safety concerns, particularly in patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2), according to FDA black box warning, who have a reduced ability to clear GBCA from their circulation. This is especially problematic with linear GBCAs, which are less stable and more likely to release free gadolinium, leading to an increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a rare but potentially fatal condition, due to prolonged exposure time and complex dissociation. In these patients, literatureand international guidelines recommend using only macrocyclic GBCAs with lowest risk of NSF, and to separate at least 7 days between 2 injections, and administration in high-risk patients should only occur when the diagnostic information is essential and cannot be obtained through other means. Additionally, there are 2 separate concerns: the presence of gadolinium deposits in brain tissue, which has been observed regardless of renal function but with no known clinical consequences to date, and symptoms reported after gadolinium exposure (sometimes referred to as Symptoms Associated with Gadolinium Exposure or SAGE), although a clear causal relationship has not been established. While gadoxetate disodium (Eovist/Primovist) has recently been reclassified in clinical guidelines reflecting its favorable safety profile due to its lower dose (0.025 mmol/kg vs 0.1 mmol/kg for multipurpose GBCAs) and lack of reported NSF cases, there remain other considerations beyond patient safety, including environmental concerns regarding gadolinium accumulation in water systems, that support the development of alternative contrast agents. For these reasons, a significant unmet medical need exists for a safe and effective liver MRI contrast agent for patients with severe renal impairment, particularly considering that renal insufficiency is common in cancer patients.

### Ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in late-stage CKD [^1133XDpi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Ferumoxytol is a superparamagnetic iron oxide particle encapsulated by a semisynthetic carbohydrate with properties that can be used by the nephrologist for diagnosis and therapy. Ferumoxytol is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating iron deficiency anemia in the setting of chronic kidney disease, but not for clinical diagnostic imaging. It has gained appeal as a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates < 30mL/min/1.73 m² in whom gadolinium-based contrast magnetic resonance imaging agents are relatively contraindicated because of the association with gadolinium deposition and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Ferumoxytol metabolism is not dependent on kidney function, but rather is removed from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Additionally, the prolonged intravascular half-life (> 14 hours) of ferumoxytol allows for longer image acquisition and repeat imaging, if necessary. In patients with contraindications for gadolinium contrast agents, ferumoxytol is an alternative agent for vascular assessment, including patency and course.

### Are gadolinium-based contrast media nephrotoxic? A renal biopsy study [^1165fgNK]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast media were originally introduced as alternatives to iodinated media for magnetic resonance imaging. Although originally thought to be nonnephrotoxic, gadolinium-based contrast media have recently been reported to be associated with acute renal failure; the mechanism and the underlying renal injury are not completely understood. We report what is, to our knowledge, the first renal biopsy in this context. A 56-year-old patient underwent 2 consecutive vascular imaging procedures in conjunction with gadolinium-based contrast medium administration. A few days later, the patient developed acute renal failure. A renal biopsy showed acute tubular cell injury including patchy tubular cell necrosis, tubular cell degeneration, and marked proliferation of tubular cells, together with mild interstitial edema and interstitial inflammation, but without significant glomerular or vascular changes. During supportive therapy, renal function was partially regained. This case emphasizes the potential nephrotoxicity of gadolinium-based contrast media and suggests that the nephrotoxicity is related to potentially reversible acute tubular cell injury.

### Gadolinium in humans: a family of disorders [^115SPDXx]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The literature informs us that gadolinium can cause health issues. At least four major gadolinium disorders, including the two well-recognized nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and severe acute adverse event, have been identified.

Conclusion

We propose naming the histopathologically proven presence of gadolinium in brain tissue "gadolinium storage condition", and we describe a new entity that represents symptomatic deposition of gadolinium in individuals with normal renal function, for which we propose the designation "gadolinium deposition disease".

Chronic kidney disease — NSF risk with Group 2 gadolinium-based contrast media (GBCM) shows no NSF cases among 4,931 stage G4–G5 CKD or ESKD patients on dialysis, with an upper 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.07%; subgroup upper 95% CIs were 0.2% for stage G5 on dialysis (n = 1,849), 0.5% for stage G5 not on dialysis (n = 732), and 0.19% for stage G4 (n = 1,955). Based on these data, an ACR/NKF workgroup concluded that the risk of NSF is very low for the standard dose (0.1 mmol/kg) of group 2 GBCM, even in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or AKI, and they further recommend that dialysis should not be initiated or altered following administration of group 2 GBCM.

Imaging studies and contrast agents in CKD — Balance the risk of acute impairment in kidney function due to contrast agent use against the diagnostic value and therapeutic implications of the investigation (Not Graded). For intravascular iodinated radiocontrast, we recommend that all people with GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² (GFR categories G3a-G5) undergoing elective investigation be managed according to the AKI guideline, including avoidance of high osmolar agents (1B), use of lowest possible radiocontrast dose (Not Graded), and measurement of GFR 48–96 hours after the procedure (1C). For gadolinium-based contrast media, we recommend not using gadolinium-containing contrast media in people with GFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m² (GFR category G5) unless there is no alternative appropriate test (1B), and we suggest that people with a GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² (GFR categories G4-G5) who require gadolinium-containing contrast media are preferentially offered a macrocyclic chelate preparation (2B). We recommend not to use oral phosphate-containing bowel preparations in people with a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (GFR categories G3a-G5) or in those known to be at risk of phosphate nephropathy (1A).

### The impact of NSF on the care of patients with kidney disease [^1175pnps]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The association of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) with the use of gadolinium-based magnetic resonance contrast agents (GBMCAs) has greatly affected the care of patients with kidney disease. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis has been reported in patients with end-stage renal disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury. The majority of cases have occurred in patients with end-stage renal disease, but cases of NSF have been reported in CKD patients with glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Odds ratios have ranged between 8.97 and 32.5 among patients exposed to GBMCAs. Given the significant morbidity, disability, and mortality associated with NSF, it is imperative to properly and preemptively identify those patients at risk. Patients with end-stage renal disease seem to be at highest risk, particularly those maintained on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Although there are no data to support a role for hemodialysis in reducing the risk for NSF after the administration of GBMCAs, hemodialysis is recommended within 2 to 3 hours. Patients maintained on PD and those with CKD present a challenge, as they do not typically have vascular access for hemodialysis, yet the clearance of GBMCAs is very low, and it may be prudent to consider hemodialysis especially for PD patients. Gadolinium-based magnetic resonance contrast agents are removed by dialysis, with estimates that about 99% of a dose is removed after 3 to 4 sessions of hemodialysis. The elimination half-life averaged 9 hours in patients with stage 4 CKD (glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) compared with 1.5 hours in those with normal glomerular filtration rates. This prolonged elimination and longer exposure may be important factors in predisposing to NSF.

### Gadolinium-associated nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [^113NH59U]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a progressive, potentially fatal multiorgan system fibrosing disease related to exposure of patients with renal failure to the gadolinium-based contrast agents used in magnetic resonance imaging. Because of this relationship between nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and gadolinium-based contrast agents, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently warns against using gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, or any acute renal insufficiency related to the hepatorenal syndrome or perioperative liver transplantation. There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis developing in patients not exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents, but most patients have the triad of gadolinium exposure through contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, renal failure, and a proinflammatory state, such as recent surgery, endovascular injury, or sepsis. Development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis among patients with severe renal insufficiency following exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents is approximately 4 percent, and mortality can approach 31 percent. The mechanism for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is unclear, and current treatments are disappointing. Prevention with hemodialysis immediately following gadolinium-based contrast agents has been recommended, but no studies have shown this to be effective. Because of the large number of patients with clinically silent renal impairment and the serious consequences of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis related to gadolinium exposure, physicians should use alternative imaging modalities for patients who are at risk.

1 INTRODUCTION

The early diagnosis and characterization of kidney diseases is a nontrivial task due to hyperfiltration, a compensatory mechanism in which the overall filtration rate is initially maintained despite a decreased function of 1 of the kidneys. 1, 2 Conventional methods to assess kidney function rely on the quantification of glomerular filtration rates that reflect the filtration efficiency of both kidneys, overlooking compensation mechanisms. These exams involve the administration of a marker whose concentration is monitored in plasma or urine for several hours to evaluate the clearance achieved by the kidneys. Tracers can be chelated with radioisotopes to allow detection by imaging. However, imaging‐based methods have been proven to be less accurate than clearance methods with the additional disadvantage of the ionizing radiation dose. 3 Several MR‐based methods have been used to study renal physiology with the purpose of finding biomarkers that reflect early changes in kidney diseases. Notable examples include dynamic contrast‐enhanced MRI (DCE‐MRI) 4, 5 and arterial spin labeling (ASL). 6, 7

DCE‐MRI allows for the measurement of perfusion and filtration, both of which are key parameters in the assessment of renal function. DCE‐MRI, however, is an invasive technique that requires an injection of gadolinium as a contrast agent. Historically, some cases of nephrogenic system fibrosis in kidney patients have been reported after the use of gadolinium, 8 and it is contraindicated for renal studies in several institutions. Moreover, new evidence suggests that gadolinium is deposited in the brain. 9

ASL is a noninvasive alternative to study renal physiology where the blood entering the kidneys is used as a contrast agent. Recently, it has been reported that the perfusion in the cortex measured with ASL is affected by kidney diseases. 10 This promising technique is safe and noninvasive but it has not been established in the clinical routine and there is considerable variability among perfusion values reported in the literature. 11, 12 There are several challenges that are involved in ASL in the kidneys. For instance, the method relies on image subtraction (control and label), which affects the contrast‐to‐noise ratio of the output data. This is normally alleviated by averaging multiple images that require adequate motion correction and registration of the input images to account for breathing motion and pulsation. Additionally, apart from the sequence and imaging parameters, there are a multitude of parameters that need to be accurately adjusted, such as position and characteristics of the labeling plane (delay, duration, B 1, and thickness), T 1 of blood, and background suppression, to name the most relevant. 13

### Impact of kidney function on CNS gadolinium deposition in patients receiving repeated doses of gadobutrol [^113CPp6s]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Studies associate repeat gadolinium-based contrast agent administration with T1 shortening in the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus, indicating CNS gadolinium deposition, most strongly with linear agents but also reportedly with macrocyclics. Renal impairment effects on long-term CNS gadolinium deposition remain underexplored. We investigated the relationship between signal intensity changes and renal function in patients who received ≥ 10 administrations of the macrocyclic agent gadobutrol.

Materials and Methods

Patients who underwent ≥ 10 brain MR imaging examinations with administration of intravenous gadobutrol between February 1, 2014, and January 1, 2018, were included in this retrospective study. Dentate nucleus-to-pons and globus pallidus-to-thalamus signal intensity ratios were calculated, and correlations were calculated between the estimated glomerular filtration rate (minimum and mean) and the percentage change in signal intensity ratios from the first to last scan. Partial correlations were calculated to control for potential confounders.

Results

One hundred thirty-one patients (73 women; mean age at last scan, 55.9 years) showed a mean percentage change of the dentate nucleus-to-pons of 0.31%, a mean percentage change of the globus pallidus-to-thalamus of 0.15%, a mean minimum estimated glomerular filtration rate of 69.65 (range, 10.16–132.26), and a mean average estimated glomerular filtration rate at 89.48 (range, 38.24–145.93). No significant association was found between the estimated glomerular filtration rate and percentage change of the dentate nucleus-to-pons (minimum estimated glomerular filtration rate, r = -0.09, P = 0.28; average estimated glomerular filtration rate, r = -0.09, P = 0.30,) or percentage change of the globus pallidus-to-thalamus (r = 0.07, P = 0.43; r = 0.07, P = 0.40). When we controlled for age, sex, number of scans, and total dose, there were no significant associations between the estimated glomerular filtration rate and the percentage change of the dentate nucleus-to-pons (r = 0.16, P = 0.07; r = 0.15, P = 0.08) or percentage change of the globus pallidus-to-thalamus (r = -0.14, P = 0.12; r = -0.15, P = 0.09).

Conclusions

In patients receiving an average of 12 intravenous gadobutrol administrations, no correlation was found between renal function and signal intensity ratio changes, even in those with mild or moderate renal impairment.

### Safety in magnetic resonance units: an update [^111wKmJP]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis

There has been recent attention to reports that patients with renal failure are at risk of developing a rare, potentially life-threatening condition with Gd-CAs called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis or nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NSF/NFD). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be estimated in all patients with kidney disease to identify those at risk of developing NSF/NSD. If the GFR is estimated at less than 30 mL·min⁻¹ per 1.73 m⁻², the risk of Gd-CAs should be balanced against benefit, and a minimal dose of Gd-CAs only administered if an unenhanced scan proves insufficient. The Gd-CA should not be administered again for at least 7 days. Current evidence suggests that contrast agents may be classified as high-risk, e.g. gadopentelic acid, medium-risk, e.g. gadobenic acid, and low-risk e.g. gadoteridol. The use of high-risk agents is contra-indicated in neonates and during the peri-operative period in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The Gd-Cas are not recommended in pregnancy unless absolutely necessary.

### Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy [^115bdYKE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a newly recognized disorder occurring exclusively in patients with renal failure. Exposure to gadolinium-based magnetic resonance (MR) contrast media has been associated with subsequent development of NSF. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is characterized by skin induration preferentially affecting the extremities. In addition, involvement of internal organs occurs, which leads ultimately to death. Skin biopsy is important for confirmation of the diagnosis. The main therapeutic goal is restoration of renal function. To reduce the risk of NSF, renal function must be determined before exposure to gadolinium-containing MR contrast agents. Gadolinium-based MR contrast media should be avoided in the presence of advanced renal failure with estimated glomerular filtration rate below 30 ml/min/1.73 m2, unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The recommended dose of contrast agent should not be exceeded. In addition, a sufficient period of time for elimination of the contrast agent from the body should be allowed before readministration of the contrast agent.

### Safety of gadolinium contrast angiography in patients with chronic renal insufficiency [^111cYpS4]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To prevent iodinated contrast medium-induced nephrotoxicity, gadolinium has been used increasingly for magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to visualize arterial anatomy in patients undergoing vascular surgery who are considered at high risk because of chronic renal insufficiency. We assessed the safety of gadolinium-based contrast medium as a substitute for iodinated contrast medium-enhanced examinations. We determined the incidence of gadolinium-induced nephrotoxicity in a clinical setting and searched for contributing risk factors. Patients and methods In a single-center retrospective study from December 1999 to January 2001, 218 inpatients underwent MRA and 42 inpatients underwent DSA, with gadolinium as the sole contrast agent. Patient comorbid conditions, indications for vascular imaging, contrast dose, urine output, baseline and post-procedure serum creatinine concentration (SCr), and outcome were recorded for all patients in whom gadolinium-induced renal failure developed.

Results

Of 260 patients who received gadolinium-based contrast agents, at a dose of 0.25 mmol/kg or more, 195 patients (75%) had pre-test baseline chronic renal insufficiency. In 7 of 195 patients (3.5%) acute renal failure developed after gadolinium-based contrast medium administration, for MRA (n = 153) in 3 patients (1.9%) and DSA (n = 42) in 4 patients (9.5%). Average baseline SCr in the 195 patients with chronic renal insufficiency was 38.2 ± 1.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and in the 7 patients in whom acute renal failure developed, baseline SCr was 32.5 ± 7.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (P = 0.33). Respective intravenous and intra-arterial gadolinium doses in these 7 patients ranged from 0.31 to 0.41 mmol/kg for MRA and 0.27 to 0.42 mmol/kg for DSA. Acute renal failure did not develop in any of 65 patients with normal baseline SCr.

Conclusion

Despite reports of negligible nephrotoxicity, rarely gadolinium-based contrast agents can cause acute renal failure in patients with underlying chronic renal insufficiency. Estimation of creatinine clearance alone does not enable prediction of which patients are likely to have acute renal failure. Patients at high-risk should be identified, and prophylactic measures should be taken to reduce the risk for nephrotoxicity.

Glomerular filtration rate

Absolute GFR (mL/min)

Plasma clearance of an injected filtration marker such as iohexol is illustrated in Fig. 1. It illustrates a one-compartment model where the plasma concentration of the marker is obtained at four time points when equilibrium has been achieved after the initial redistribution into the interstitial space followed by the excretion phase. GFR may then be calculated accordingly:where AUC denotes the area under the plasma concentration–time curve.

Fig. 1
Plasma clearance of an externally injected biomarker such as iohexol at time zero based on the plasma concentration curve (solid line) as a function of time. The plasma concentration rapidly reaches a peak followed by an exponential fall as the biomarker is diluted in circulating plasma, diffuses into the interstitial space (volume distribution), and reaches an equilibrium after about 2 h at normal renal function. Thereafter follows the elimination phase where the plasma concentration of the biomarker falls at a constant rate. According to the one-compartment model, the area under the plasma concentration time-curve (AUC, dashed line) can be calculated based on four plasma samples (diamond points) obtained 100–250 min after the bolus injection. The absolute glomerular filtration rate (GFR ABS, mL/min) can be calculated by injected dose (μg) / AUC (min × μg/mL) from which follows that AUC = dose/GFR ABS, a measure of systemic exposure of the injected agent

The calculated measure describes GFR in absolute terms (GFR ABS, mL/min), i.e. regardless of body size, and represents the excretion capacity of the individual. Since absolute GFR (GFR ABS) equals injected dose/AUC, then AUC equals injected dose/GFR ABS.

AUC = systemic exposure

According to the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are distributed and eliminated according to linear kinetics such as contrast media, AUC represents a measure of systemic exposure. From Eq. 1, it can be deduced that AUC is equal to injected dose/GFR ABS. Systemic exposure is often well correlated with the toxicity of a drug and hence generally used as an index for dose optimization. Thus, the toxicity of a drug is related to the total injected dose and the excretion capacity (absolute GFR) of the individual. The higher the injected dose and the lower the excretion capacity, the longer time is required until the elimination of the offending drug and the higher the risk of side effects. When it comes to CM, this relation may be summarized as gram-iodine/GFR ratio based on absolute GFR.

### Gadolinium-containing contrast media for radiographic examinations: a position paper [^115xX5kU]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Recently, it has been suggested that gadolinium-based contrast media could be used for radiological examinations in patients with significant renal impairment, previous severe generalized reaction to iodinated contrast media or thyroid disease about to undergo radioactive iodine treatment; however, the indications for and risks of using gadolinium agents in this way are not well known; hence, the Contrast Media Safety Committee of The European Society of Urogenital Radiology reviewed the literature to issue a position paper on this subject. A comprehensive literature review was performed and the resulting report was discussed at the Ninth European Symposium on Urogenital Radiology in Genoa, Italy, June 2002. Review of the literature indicates that according to experimental data on animals gadolinium-based contrast media have more nephrotoxic potential than iodinated contrast media in equivalent X-ray attenuating doses; therefore, gadolinium-based contrast media should not replace iodinated contrast media in patients with renal insufficiency for radiographic examinations. For patients with previous severe generalized reactions to iodinated contrast media, and in patients about to undergo thyroid treatment with radioactive iodine gadolinium-based contrast media in approved intravenous doses, up to 0.3 mmol/kg body weight will not give diagnostic radiographic information in most cases. Gadolinium-based contrast media are not approved for radiographic examinations.

5.1	Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis

Gadolinium-based contrast agents increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) and in patients with acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to the hepato-renal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period. In these patients, avoid use of gadolinium-based contrast agents unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRA. For patients receiving hemodialysis, physicians may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination. VASOVIST binds to blood albumin and use of a high-flux dialysis procedure is essential to optimized VASOVIST elimination in patients receiving chronic hemodialysis. The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a gadolinium-based contrast agent and the degree of renal function impairment at the time of exposure.

Post-marketing reports have identified the development of NSF following single and multiple administrations of gadolinium-based contrast agents. These reports have not always identified a specific agent. Prior to marketing of Vasovist®, where a specific agent was identified, the most commonly reported agent was gadodiamide (OmniscanTM), followed by gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist®) and gadoversetamide (OptiMARK®). NSF has also developed following sequential administrations of gadodiamide with gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance®) or gadoteridol (ProHance®). The number of post-marketing reports is subject to change over time and may not reflect the true proportion of cases associated with any specific gadolinium-based contrast agent.

### Current status of gadolinium toxicity in patients with kidney disease [^113wL23k]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast (GBC) agents have recently been the subject of intense interest for physicians across numerous specialties. These agents are widely used as contrast for magnetic resonance imaging and have been generally considered safe. Early on, phase III trials and small studies in low-risk patients suggested a benign renal profile; however, more recent studies raised the possibility of nephrotoxicity, although it is not clear whether it approaches the incidence of nephropathy associated with iodinated radiocontrast. In 2006, reports of a rare systemic fibrosing condition called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) were recently linked to exposure of patients with advanced kidney disease to GBC agents. Analysis of the data suggests that certain GBC agents are more likely to be associated with NSF. Also, not all patients with kidney disease are at risk for developing NSF, only those with advanced acute or chronic kidney disease. Avoidance of GBC exposure is the best approach for high-risk patients. When GBC is required to obtain optimal images, use of low dosages of more stable macrocyclic agents is safer and preferred. This article reviews the current status of GBC agents as nephrotoxins and causes of NSF and provides opinions on how to use these agents in patients with underlying kidney disease.

Strengths and limitations — Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is described as ideally suited for assessment of repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) because it allows comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular morphology and physiology, is independent of acoustic windows, provides excellent image quality across a wide range of body sizes, and is not adversely affected by most surgical and catheter-based interventions; additional advantages include the absence of harmful ionizing radiation, suitability for longitudinal follow-up, and the ability to provide accurate and reproducible measurements of right ventricular (RV) size and function, valve regurgitation, pulmonary and systemic flows, differential pulmonary artery (PA) flow, and detection of ventricular scar tissue; limitations noted include higher cost versus echocardiography, lack of portability, limited availability, artifacts from stainless steel implants, and relative contraindication with pacemakers or implantable defibrillators; many older stainless-steel devices have been replaced by minimally or nonferromagnetic materials; the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis from gadolinium-based contrast has been mitigated by avoiding its use in patients with reduced glomerular filtration rates, and for right heart evaluation a contrast agent is not required.

NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs.

Do not administer OMNISCAN to patients with:

chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m), or
acute kidney injury [see Contraindications (4)].

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g., age > 60 years, hypertension or diabetes), estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.

Do not exceed the recommended OMNISCAN dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug from the body prior to any readministration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Measurement of glomerular filtration rate with magnetic resonance imaging: principles, limitations, and expectations [^11697VnK]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most useful quantitative index of renal function and is used clinically as the gold standard of renal dysfunction. Follow-up of patients with impaired renal function requires reliable measurements of GFR. Thus, serial GFR values estimated from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be worthwhile if easy to obtain, accurate, and reproducible. Nuclear medicine-based techniques remain at present the reference method for quantification of GFR, but MRI should be able to compete in the near future. Several methods are available for measurement of GFR using MRI and freely filtered Gd-chelates: (1) measurement of the clearance of the agent using blood samplings; (2) measurement of the plasma clearance of the agent using signal intensity changes within abdominal organs; (3) measurement of the extraction fraction of the agent; and (4) monitoring of tracer intrarenal kinetics. A high heterogeneity of protocols (e.g., in acquisition mode, dose of contrast, postprocessing techniques) is noted in the literature, reflecting the number of technical challenges that will have to be solved before to reach a consensus, and the reported accuracy and reproducibility are insufficient for justifying their use in clinical practice now.

Gadolinium-based contrast media in chronic kidney disease — Gadolinium-based contrast media (GBCM) are used to enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but Gd as a free ion (Gd3+) is highly toxic due to interference with calcium-dependent biological processes, and Gd3+ may have been demonstrated to be deposited in a variety of tissues, including brain, bone, and skin, even in individuals with preserved kidney function. In 2006, Grobner reported the association of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), an irreversible systemic fibrotic disease, in dialysis patients. NSF is a systemic fibrotic disease seen only in patients with kidney dysfunction who received GBCM, and the predominant risk factors for NSF are reduced kidney function (including dialysis dependence and severe acute or chronic kidney dysfunction) and the type and dose of GBCM.

### Extracellular gadolinium-based contrast media: an overview [^112YgJzD]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Increasing use is made of extracellular MRI contrast agents that alter the image contrast following intravenous administration; they predominantly shorten the T1 relaxation time of tissues. The degree and location of these changes provide substantial diagnostic information. However gadolinium-based contrast agents (Gd-CA) are not inert drugs. They may cause acute non-renal adverse reactions (e.g. anaphylactoid reactions), acute renal adverse reactions (e.g. contrast induced nephropathy), delayed adverse reactions (nephrogenic systemic fibrosis) and problems at the site of injection (e.g. local necrosis). This review describes the current status of Gd-CA, their mechanism of action, chemical structure, pharmacokinetics, dosage, elimination, nephrotoxicity and adverse events.

Colon cancer — principles of imaging for initial workup/staging center on C/A/P CT to evaluate local extent and metastatic spread; CT should use intravenous iodinated contrast and oral contrast material unless contraindicated, and intravenous contrast is not required for the chest CT (but usually given if performed with abdominal CT). If IV iodinated contrast material is contraindicated because of significant contrast allergy, then MRI examination of the abdomen and pelvis with IV gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) can be obtained instead; in patients with chronic renal failure (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30 mL/min) who are not on dialysis, IV iodinated contrast material is also contraindicated, and IV GBCA can be administered in select cases. If iodinated and gadolinium contrast are both contraindicated due to significant allergy or chronic renal failure without dialysis, then consider MRI without IV contrast or consider FDG-PET/CT imaging. Consider an abdomen/pelvis MRI to assist with the diagnosis of rectal cancer versus colon cancer (eg, low-lying sigmoid tumor), noting that the rectum lies below a virtual line from the sacral promontory to the upper edge of the symphysis as determined by MRI. Consider MRI of liver for liver metastases if potentially resectable. FDG-PET/CT is not routinely indicated and does not supplant a contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT or MRI and should only be used to evaluate an equivocal finding on a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI or in patients with strong contraindications to IV contrast administration. Consider FDG-PET/CT (skull base to mid-thigh) if potentially surgically curable M1 disease in selected cases or in selected patients considered for image-guided liver-directed therapies (ie, thermal ablation, radioembolization). If liver-directed therapy or surgery is contemplated, a hepatic MRI with intravenous routine extracellular or hepatobiliary GBCA is preferred over CT to assess exact number and distribution of metastatic foci for local treatment planning. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Optimal dose of Gd-DTPA in dynamic MR studies [^113hKC8u]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The relationship between the administered dose d of Gd-DTPA and the accuracy of measurements of the glomerular filtration rate G and the cardiac output O was investigated. For a wide range of values the concentration of Gd-DTPA can be uniquely derived from MR signals and precontrast longitudinal relaxation time. Fixed and random errors in these measured variables were analyzed. Depending on noise level and the level of renal function, errors in G reach a minimum for d = 1.4–2.8 mmol. Random errors in G are relatively insensitive to d as long as d > 1.5 mmol. These results establish the feasibility of dynamic MR measurements using doses of Gd-DTPA that are several times lower than current standards.

### Absolute and relative GFR and contrast medium dose / GFR ratio: cornerstones when predicting the risk of acute kidney injury [^116t3UDC]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Contrast medium dose/GFR ratio

Mounting evidence from PCA/PCI studies (Table S1 and S2) indicate that a ratio between CM-volume (mL) or gram-iodine (g-I) and estimated GFR represents a significant and independent predictor of post-contrast medium AKI (PC-AKI), first suggested by Altmann et al 1997. Though the CM dose/GFR ratio indicating an increased risk of PC-AKI may vary substantially between studies, from a g-I/GFR ratio of about 0.5 to 2.0. The weighted mean cut-off value to predict an increased risk of PC-AKI was 1.0 for the entire group, 1.24 for studies based on absolute GFR with the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation, and 0.77 for studies based on relative GFR with the MDRD and CKD-EPI equations (Table S2). The variation among the studies may be the result of differences in e.g. study design, indication, patient selection, and variation in comorbidities.

To merge data from studies using absolute and relative GFR to establish a weighted cut-off dose/GFR ratio to predict PC-AKI may be questioned. However, a comparison of the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve demonstrated no difference in predicting AKI between CM-dose/absolute GFR based on the CG equation and CM-dose/relative GFR based on the 186-MDRD equation. This may be explained by the fact that though the difference between relative and absolute GFR varies with BSA, the difference was relatively small in the majority of patients and with an average difference of only about five units in a Western population with a median BSA of 1.84 kg/m 2 (Fig. 2 A). In three of the Asian CM-dose/GFR ratio studies, BSA was reported or calculated by us to be 1.67–1.70 kg/m 2 indicating an even smaller average difference between absolute and relative GFR. Still, when applying the ratio to small and large individuals to predict the risk of CI-AKI, significant ratio differences may occur depending on whether relative or absolute GFR (Fig. 2 B). The ratio should express the amount of potentially toxic CM (systemic exposure) relative to injected dose and individual kidney function. This is not reflected by relative GFR since it is adjusted to a fixed body size, 1.73 m 2 BSA. Only absolute GFR gives the true excretion capacity of the individual.

### Urinary gadolinium levels after contrast-enhanced MRI in individuals with normal renal function: a pilot study [^111fXXXr]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) have been used to enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since 1985. Recently, the media and online groups have voiced concerns about gadolinium deposition in patients with normal renal function based on "elevated" urinary gadolinium levels. The determination of increased urinary gadolinium levels is based on reference ranges developed in individuals with normal renal function who were never exposed to GBCA. Studies suggest an elevated gadolinium urinary elimination greater than 72 h post GBCA scan. We evaluated urine gadolinium concentrations over a 30-day period in patients administered GBCA.

Methods

In this prospective, observational pilot study, we enrolled subjects between 18 and 65 years of age with normal renal function who received GBCA for the first time. Urinary gadolinium was measured at days zero (prior to GBCA exposure), 3, 10, and 30 after GBCA exposure. We compared urinary gadolinium levels after GBCA exposure to the current reference range and calculated an estimated duration of "elevated" gadolinium urine levels in the average patient.

Results

All 13 subjects had 24-h urinary gadolinium levels higher than 0.7 μg/24 h with means of 1944 (± 1432) μg/24 h on day 3, 301 (± 218) μg/24 h on day 10, and 34 (± 33) μg/24 h on day 30. Based on calculated urinary gadolinium elimination kinetics, we estimate urinary gadolinium levels will often remain above the current reference range for > 50 days.

Conclusion

The current reference range of 0.7 μg/24 h for 24 h urinary gadolinium is not applicable to patients for at least 30 days following GBCA exposure.

### Gadolinium retention, brain T1 hyperintensity, and endogenous metals: a comparative study of macrocyclic versus linear gadolinium chelates in renally sensitized rats [^111EGzsn]. Investigative Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

This model seems to be translationally and clinically relevant, as the estimated prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients 70 years or older in the United States (estimated with the CKD-EPI equation) is 46.8%, and the vast majority of these patients present stage 3 CKD, that is, moderate renal failure (glomerular filtration rate between 30 and 59 mL/min per 1.73 m 2).

Older people represent a population of major concern, in which contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations are commonly performed. This population of patients may be repeatedly exposed to linear Gd chelates, which are not contraindicated for patients with stage 3 CKD.

The purpose of this study was therefore to compare all categories of GBCAs, that is, a linear ionic GBCA (gadobenate), a linear nonionic GBCA (gadodiamide), and an M-GBCA (gadoterate), in a rat model of moderate renal failure mimicking a substantial population of patients exposed to GBCAs.

### Gadolinium and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: have we overreacted? [^116rDYRv]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Imaging is an increasingly important part of clinical medicine and contrast enhancement adds valuable diagnostic information. Prior to 2006 gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA) were used in patients with kidney disease in an attempt to avoid the adverse consequences of iodinated contrast agents. The amount administered often exceeded the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended dosing. After the association between GBCA and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) was reported, usage of GBCA was markedly reduced in patients with kidney disease. As a result, iodinated contrast was often used in place of GBCA. Recently, several studies showed that the risk of NSF using GBCA with increased thermodynamic and kinetic stability or increased relaxivity along with a restricted use policy has dramatically reduced NSF risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We discuss the risks of GBCA and iodinated contrast use in different stages of CKD and suggest that in some situations GBCA use may pose less overall risk to the patient with advanced kidney disease.

### Establishing reference intervals for gadolinium concentrations in blood, plasma, and urine in individuals not previously exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents [^114Qops1]. Investigative Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Over the recent years, there have been increasing concerns that exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) may be associated with retention of Gd within the skin, bones, and solid organs in patients with normal renal function, although the clinical implications of this deposition remain to be established. There are no published data available to guide the development of reference intervals for Gd concentrations in biological samples from healthy people. The aims of this study were to (1) determine whether healthy individuals who have not received GBCAs have detectable concentrations of Gd in their blood and urine, and (2) to develop a reference range for Gd concentrations in blood and spot urine samples for healthy individuals.

Materials and Methods

Whole blood, plasma, and spot urine samples were taken from 120 healthy volunteers with estimated glomerular filtration rate 70 mL/min per 1.73 m or greater. Gd concentrations were measured in these samples using inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry. The reference intervals for Gd concentrations in whole blood, plasma, and urine were estimated as the 2.5th percentile and the upper reference limit as the 97.5th percentile.

Results

Ten (8.33%) of the 120 subjects had detectable concentrations of Gd in their whole blood (n = 5) or spot urine (n = 5) samples; no subjects had detectable concentrations of Gd in their plasma samples. Our proposed reference intervals for Gd are as follows: whole blood, < 0.008 ng/mL or < 0.050 nmol/L; plasma, < 0.009 ng/mL or < 0.057 nmol/L; spot urine, < 0.036 μg/g or < 0.0250 nmol/mmol.

Conclusions

The results of this study provide reference intervals for whole blood, plasma, and urine Gd concentrations in healthy subjects who have not previously received GBCAs and will assist clinicians in assessing patients who have concerns regarding potential Gd retention postexposure and help guide further clinical studies to explore the pharmacokinetics of GBCAs in patients with normal renal function.

### Risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease receiving a group II gadolinium-based contrast agent: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113CbREH]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) to individual patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD; defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) who receive a group II gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) is not well understood or summarized in the literature.

Objective

To assess the pooled risk of NSF in patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD receiving a group II GBCA.

Data Sources

A health sciences informationist searched the Ovid (MEDLINE and MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citation, and Daily and Versions), Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Open Grey databases from inception to January 29, 2019, yielding 2700 citations.

Study Selection

Citations were screened for inclusion in a multistep process. Agreement for final cohort inclusion was determined by 2 blinded screeners using Cohen κ. Inclusion criteria consisted of stage 4 or 5 CKD with or without dialysis, administration of an unconfounded American College of Radiology classification group II GBCA (gadobenate dimeglumine, gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, or gadoteridol), and incident NSF as an outcome. Conference abstracts, retracted manuscripts, narrative reviews, editorials, case reports, and manuscripts not reporting total group II GBCA administrations were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction was performed for all studies by a single investigator, including publication details, study design and time frame, patient characteristics, group II GBCA(s) administered, total exposures for patients with stage 4 or stage 5 CKD, total cases of unconfounded NSF, reason for GBCA administration, follow-up duration, loss to follow-up, basis for NSF screening, and diagnosis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Pooled incidence of NSF and the associated upper bound of a 2-sided 95% CI (risk estimate) for the pooled data and each of the 4 group II GBCAs.

Results

Sixteen unique studies with 4931 patients were included (κ = 0.68) in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of NSF was 0 of 4931 (0%; upper bound of 95% CI, 0.07%). The upper bound varied owing to different sample sizes for gadobenate dimeglumine (0 of 3167; upper bound of 95% CI, 0.12%), gadoterate meglumine (0 of 1204; upper bound of 95% CI, 0.31%), gadobutrol (0 of 330; upper bound of 95% CI, 1.11%), and gadoteridol (0 of 230; upper bound of 95% CI, 1.59%).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study's findings suggest that the risk of NSF from group II GBCA administration in stage 4 or 5 CKD is likely less than 0.07%. The potential diagnostic harms of withholding group II GBCA for indicated examinations may outweigh the risk of NSF in this population.

### Impact on hospital policy: yale experience [^113tKs5P]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

To limit patients who may be at risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis from exposure to gadolinium-based magnetic resonance contrast agents, new policies and procedures have been implemented at Yale-New Haven Hospital. These changes include screening patients for low estimated glomerular filtration rates and risk factors for chronic kidney disease, giving increased attention to the types and doses of contrast agent administered, agreement on alternative imaging algorithms, and education at all levels of the medical community. The rationale for these changes is discussed.

### Gadofosveset trisodium (Vasovist) [^112ppCuQ]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Renal Insufficiency: Administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents, including VASOVIST to patients with severe renal insufficiency increases the risk for NSF. Administration of these agents to patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency may increase the risk for worsened renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 and 5.3)]. Prior to use of VASOVIST in these patients, ensure that no satisfactory diagnostic alternatives are available. In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/kg/m2), administer VASOVIST at a dose of 0.01 mmol/kg to 0.02 mmol/kg. Consider follow-up renal function assessments following VASOVIST administration to any patients with renal insufficiency.

A clinical study of gadofosveset, at a dose of 0.05 mmol/kg, was conducted in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment. The clearance decreased substantially as renal function decreased and the systemic exposure (AUC) increased almost 1.75-fold in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance: 30 to 50 mL/min) and 2.25-fold in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). The elimination half-life increased from 19 hours in normal subjects to 49 hours in patients with moderate and 70 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. The volume of distribution at steady state and plasma protein binding of gadofosveset were not affected by renal impairment. Fecal elimination of gadofosveset increased as a function of increasing renal impairment (6.5% in normal subjects to 13.3% in patients with severe renal impairment).

Hemodialysis: Gadofosveset is removed from the body by hemodialysis using high-flux filters. Elimination of the total administered dose of gadolinium in dialysate over 3 dialysis sessions using high-flux filters averaged 46.8%, 12.9%, and 6.11% for the first, second, and third sessions, respectively.

Hepatic Insufficiency: The pharmacokinetics and plasma protein binding of gadofosveset was not significantly influenced by moderate hepatic impairment. A slight decrease in fecal elimination of gadofosveset was seen for the hepatic impaired subjects (2.7%) compared to normal subjects (4.8%).

Gender: No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of gadofosveset.

### Safety of meglumine gadoterate (Gd-DOTA)-enhanced MRI compared to unenhanced MRI in patients with chronic kidney disease (RESCUE study) [^1148gTBt]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively compare the renal safety of meglumine gadoterate (Gd-DOTA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to a control group (unenhanced MRI) in high-risk patients.

Methods

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) scheduled for MRI procedures were screened. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with an elevation of serum creatinine levels, measured 72 ± 24 h after the MRI procedure, by at least 25% or 44.2 μmol/l (0.5 mg/dl) from baseline. A non-inferiority margin of the between-group difference was set at −15% for statistical analysis of the primary endpoint. Main secondary endpoints were the variation in serum creatinine and eGFR values between baseline and 72 ± 24 h after MRI and the percentage of patients with a decrease in eGFR of at least 25% from baseline. Patients were screened for signs of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) at 3-month follow-up.

Results

Among the 114 evaluable patients, one (1.4%) in the Gd-DOTA-MRI group and none in the control group met the criteria of the primary endpoint [Δ = −1.4%, 95%CI = (−7.9%; 6.7%)]. Non-inferiority was therefore demonstrated (P = 0.001). No clinically significant differences were observed between groups for the secondary endpoints. No serious safety events (including NSF) were noted.

Conclusion

Meglumine gadoterate did not affect renal function and was a safe contrast agent in patients with CKD.

Key points

- Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a potential problem following gadolinium administration for MRI.

- Meglumine gadoterate (Gd-DOTA) appears safe, even in patients with chronic kidney disease.

- Gd-DOTA only caused a temporary creatinine level increase in 1/70 such patients.

- No case or sign of NSF was detected at 3-month follow-up.

### Gadolinium-based contrast media may be nephrotoxic even at approved doses [^111Uagjr]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

It is generally believed that gadolinium-based contrast media are not nephrotoxic at the approved doses for MR (< 0.3 mmol/kg body weight). Recently, a patient with diabetic nephropathy required dialysis because of anuria 6–7 days after MR angiography with 0.14 mmol/kg body weight gadolinium-DTPA-BMA to assess renal artery stenosis. No special precautions (e.g., hydration) had been taken. The serum creatinine levels had been within 200 and 300 micromol/l for the last 3 years with a very slow increase. This case highlights that gadolinium-based contrast media can cause contrast medium-induced nephropathy even at doses below 0.2 mmol/kg body weight in patients with multiple risk factors.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis

A decrease in the total number of CE-MRA studies was observed in 2007/08, reducing from 580 to 509 studies (a 12.2% drop). This was largely due to the large relative reduction in renal studies in this period, demonstrated in Fig. 5, attributable to the initial reporting in May 2006 of an association between the use of GBCAs and the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF is a serious disorder characterised by hardening and thickening of the skin and body tissues. Initially described as ' scleromyxoedema-like skin thickening ' affecting the limbs and trunk, it was solely seen in dialysis patients and was first titled nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy, subsequently renamed nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Reviews noted the universal setting of renal failure but not the cause. Prior to this there had been no concerns regarding the use of GBCA in haemodialysis patients, with prompt excretory rates at haemodialysis following GBCA administration and initial research suggesting GBCAs in the doses usually employed had an excellent safety profile and were less nephrotoxic than iodinated contrast. This led to widespread use of CE-MRA in patients with impaired renal function where examinations employing iodine-based contrast media engender significant risk. In 2006, GBCAs were first proposed as a potential factor in the development of NSF, and research indicated an association with the recent use of GBCAs, particularly in high dose on a background of chronic dialysis-dependent renal failure (or less commonly acute renal failure). Further evidence was the discovery of traces of gadolinium in tissue biopsies from affected patients. A United States Food and Drug Administration warning regarding the use of GBCAs was released in June 2006. Currently, the linear chelate compounds (gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadodiamide and gadoversetamide) are contra-indicated in those patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30 ml/min and avoiding GBCA use with other compounds is recommended unless absolutely clinically necessary and then with minimum dose. This has led to a change in clinical practise in order to identify those at risk such as those with diabetes, hypertension or on nephrotoxic medication in whom knowledge of GFR is important prior to decision making on imaging mode. Recent reviews indicate that the risk of NSF can be eliminated by careful management of risk factors, with up to a ten-fold risk reduction by elimination of just one risk factor. This reduction in the applicability of CE-MRA has spurred the development of newer non-enhanced MRA techniques, such as arterial spin labelling for aortic or renal imaging, as well as ECG-gated 3D partial-Fourier fast spin echo sequences in the evaluation of peripheral arterial disease for those patients with end-stage renal disease.

In Europe, it is contraindicated to use gadodiamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, and gadovertisamide in patients who have a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30 mL/min, and these agents may only be used with caution in patients who have a GFR between 30 and 60 mL/min. Similar restrictions have not been introduced for the other six gadolinium-based contrast agents available in the European market. In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration introduced a class ban and warned about the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients who have reduced renal function. However, European and American guidelines about how to avoid NSF are generally not very different.

PC-AKI

Serum creatinine levels within 3 days pre- and post-MRI were available and percentage changes thus calculated for 2,105 contrast and 970 non-contrast scans. After controlling for the dependence of creatinine changes on eGFR category, there was no statistical difference in percentage changes of creatinine between contrast or non-contrast scans (-0.40% vs. 0.61%, p = 0.273). When this analysis was limited to only those scans performed on patients with renal function categorised as stage 4 or 5, those undergoing a non-contrast scan experienced an average serum creatinine increase of 7.31%, while the serum creatinine of those undergoing contrast scans decreased by an average of -4.40% (p = 0.023). There was no statistical difference in cases of a greater than 25% increase in serum creatinine post-MRI observed (Fig. 1) regardless of renal function or whether contrast was administered or not (p = 0.566).

### Glycemia affects glomerular filtration rate in people with type 2 diabetes [^114Qs7H7]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measures an important aspect of kidney function. Measurement of GFR requires infusion of inulin, iothalamate, iohexol, 51 Cr-EDTA, gadolinium-DTPA or gadolinium-DOTA. The adjusted GFR (aGFR) is the measured GFR divided by body surface area (derived from height and weight) and indexed to 1.73m 2.

Many organizations recommend use of estimated aGFR (eGFR) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, which is based on sex, race, age and serum creatinine (SCR), in clinical practice. Since kidney disease caused by T2DM is the most frequent cause of kidney disease in the United States, clinicians often estimate aGFR using the CKD-EPI equation to make healthcare decisions in people with diabetes.

The CKD-EPI equation generally tends to underestimate aGFR, and the higher the aGFR the more severe the extent of underestimation; this underestimation is often attributed to differences between the populations in which the CKD-EPI equation was derived and those in which it has been subsequently applied. Due to this inaccuracy at high aGFRs, when the eGFR is equal to or greater than 60 ml/min/1.73 m², clinical labs often report results as " ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m² ". An additional potential limitation of the CKD-EPI equation for estimating of aGFR in individuals with diabetes is that it does not consider measures of glucose which can drive aGFR up. This inaccuracy in identifying hyperfiltration is a potential limitation of the CKD-EPI equation. Although there is little direct evidence that restraint of hyperfiltration decreases incidence of diabetic kidney disease some studies are suggestive that this is the case. Thus, individuals with hyperfiltration might be candidates for renoprotective therapy.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the extent to which glycemic variables, along with other standard clinical variables, account for the difference between the CKD-EPI eGFR and measured aGFR in diabetic Pima people, a Native American population with a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes. The other purpose of the study was to develop equations that more closely model aGFR to identify hyperfiltration in individuals in this cohort.

### Contrast media controversies in 2015: imaging patients with renal impairment or risk of contrast reaction [^115NqZbF]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The incidence and significance of complications related to intravascular contrast material administration have become increasingly controversial. This review will highlight current thinking regarding the imaging of patients with renal impairment and those at risk for an allergiclike contrast reaction.

Conclusion

The risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury remains uncertain for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2), but if there is a risk, it is greatest in those with estimated GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). In this population, low-risk gadolinium-based contrast agents appear to have a large safety margin. Corticosteroid prophylaxis remains the standard of care in the United States for patients identified to be at high risk of a contrast reaction, but it has an incomplete mitigating effect on contrast reaction rates and the number needed to treat is large.

### Gadopiclenol (vueway) [^112r6AVB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INTRATHECAL USE and NEPHROGENIC SYSTEMIC FIBROSIS

Risk Associated with Intrathecal Use

Intrathecal administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) can cause serious adverse reactions including death, coma, encephalopathy, and seizures. Vueway is not approved for intrathecal use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis

GBCAs increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of Vueway in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs.

The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with:
Chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m), or
Acute kidney injury.
Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g. age > 60 years, hypertension, diabetes), estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.
For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended Vueway dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug from the body prior to any re-administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: what the hospitalist needs to know [^115f6URE]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) has now been linked to gadolinium-based contrast (GBC) exposure in those with compromised kidney function, particularly those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). When ESRD is present, symptoms can be quite devastating for the patient including severe pain and immobility and even death. For those at risk, avoidance of GBC exposure, whenever possible, is absolutely essential to prevent this potentially devastating complication. Identifying those at risk depends in some circumstances on appropriate recognition of renal dysfunction and understanding appropriate use of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation formulas. Although hemodialysis (but not peritoneal dialysis) removes gadolinium, the availability of dialysis should never be used as a justification for GBC use in this high-risk population. Unfortunately there is a lack of a universally effective therapy. Resolution of acute kidney injury (AKI) appears to attenuate disease in most cases, while kidney transplantation has been associated with variable success.

Contrast media use in renal impairment — consensus guidance specifies prophylaxis and safer options by glomerular filtration rate (GFR): patients with acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease and GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² who are not on renal replacement therapy should receive intravenous normal saline prophylaxis before iodinated contrast; patients with GFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m² may be considered for intravenous fluid prophylaxis at physician discretion; second-generation gadolinium-based MRI agents can be given when GFR is above 30 mL/min/1.73m^2, with a reported nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk less than 0.07%, and patients need not be screened for renal function prior to receiving group II gadolinium-based agents. Based on the most recent consensus statement from the ACR and National Kidney Foundation, patients with acute kidney injury or CKD and GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m^2 who are not undergoing renal replacement therapy should receive intravenous normal saline prophylaxis prior to receiving iodinated contrast media. Patients with GFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73m^2 may be considered for intravenous fluid prophylaxis per individual physician discretion based on the patient's risk factor for renal injury. The most recent consensus statement from the ACR and the National Kidney Foundation suggests that such agents can be given to patients with a GFR above 30 mL/min/1.73 m². A recent systematic review of the risks of NSF in patients with CKD 4 and 5 noted that the risks of NSF using group II gadolinium-based agents was less than 0.07%. Current ACR guidelines on the use of contrast media state that patients need not be screened for renal function prior to receiving group II gadolinium-based agents.

### High-dose gadodiamide for catheter angiography and CT in patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency: prevalence of subsequent nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and decline in renal function [^115VCfhQ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) and nephrotoxicity among patients with differing degrees of renal dysfunction who are exposed to high doses of gadodiamide.

Materials and Methods

A search of medical records identified patients who received high-dose IV gadodiamide for catheter angiography or CT between January 2002 and December 2005. The cohort was limited to patients who had received a dose of at least 40 mL of gadodiamide during a single imaging session, who underwent at least 1 year of clinical follow-up, and who had moderate to end-stage renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) established within the previous 48 hours. Any observation suggestive of NSF was recorded, as were all estimated GFR values obtained during the 2 weeks before and the 5 days after gadodiamide administration.

Results

Sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The median estimated GFR was 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (range, 3–57 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). The median gadodiamide exposure was 80 mL (range, 40–200 mL). NSF eventually developed in one of the 61 patients, yielding a prevalence of 1.6%. Among the 33 patients not undergoing dialysis with estimated GFR documented within 5 days after contrast injection, the change in estimated GFR ranged from -8.8 to 42.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), with a statistically significant median improvement of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (p = 0.007).

Conclusion

Although gadolinium exposure appears to be a necessary precondition for NSF, gadolinium-based contrast agents alone are not sufficient to cause the disorder, even in very high doses. Clinically relevant nephrotoxicity of gadolinium-based contrast agents was not found.

### Use of radiocontrast agents in CKD and ESRD [^114dCniK]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Contrast exposure in a population with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires additional consideration given the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after exposure to iodinated contrast as well as systemic injury with exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA). Strategies to avoid CIN, and manage patients after exposure, including extracorporeal removal of contrast media, may differ among an advanced CKD population as compared to a general population. There is strong evidence to support the use of isotonic volume expansion and the lowest dose of low-osmolar or iso-osmolar contrast media possible to decrease CIN. The current literature on other newer prophylactic strategies such as statins, remote ischemic preconditioning, discontinuation of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade, and RenalGuard is limited thus these strategies cannot currently be recommended as routine prophylaxis for CIN. The use of extracorporeal removal of contrast agents as prophylaxis to reduce CIN has been the subject of multiple studies; however, data do not support a beneficial effect in reduction in CIN. Immediate removal of contrast by dialysis in a maintenance dialysis population is also not recommended, unless an individual's cardiopulmonary status is dependent on strict volume management. In patients with reduced renal function, GCBA exposure increases the risk of NSF. In patients with AKI, CKD stage 3 or greater (eGFR < 30 ml/minute/1.73 m 2), or patients on dialysis, we do not recommend the use of GBCA and alternative imaging modalities should be considered. If patients absolutely need magnetic resonance imaging with GBCA, we recommend the use of the lowest dose possible of the newer macrocylic, ionic agents (gadoterate meglumine) as well as immediate postprocedural HD in patients already on HD or peritoneal dialysis or with stage 5 CKD and with a functioning dialysis access already in place.

Gadolinium-based contrast media are important tools in diagnostic and interventional radiology that are particularly useful in patients with renal insufficiency. Recent reports in which exposure to gadolinium compounds has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in this patient population, however, are quite concerning. It is of great importance that radiologists be aware of this serious disease and exercise caution when considering the use of gadolinium-based contrast media in patients with moderate (glomerular filtration rate, < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) to severe (glomerular filtration rate, < 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) renal disease.

### Effect of renal function on gadolinium-related signal increases on unenhanced T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging [^11688ZiH]. Investigative Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine if renal function affects signal changes in the deep brain nuclei on unenhanced T1-weighted images after administration of linear gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs).

Methods

An electronic medical records search of 2 large medical centers identified 25 patients who received linear GBCA while on hemodialysis and had unenhanced T1-weighted images of the brain before and after. The dentate-to-cerebellar peduncle (DCP) ratio, globus pallidus-to-mid thalamus (GPT) ratio, and choroid plexus-to-nearby white matter ratio were measured and compared with 25 age/sex/GBCA exposure-matched control patients with normal or near-normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate > 60 mL/min per 1.73 m). Two additional control groups included 13 patients on hemodialysis without GBCA exposure and 13 age/sex-matched patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m.

Results

Hemodialysis patients (n = 25) with an average of 1.8 linear GBCA administrations had a 4.9% mean increase (1.00 ± 0.04 vs 1.05 ± 0.05; P < 0.001) in DCP, which was greater than the 1.6% change (0.99 ± 0.04 vs 1.00 ± 0.05; P = 0.08) observed in matched controls (P = 0.01). There was no significant signal change in the DCP ratio in the 13 hemodialysis patients (0.99 ± 0.04 vs 0.99 ± 0.04; P = 0.78) and 13 age/sex-matched patients (0.99 ± 0.02 vs 0.99 ± 0.03; P = 0.78) who did not receive GBCA. The hemodialysis patients had a baseline GPT that was higher than nondialysis patients (P < 0.001). However, the GPT change after GBCA administration was not significantly different from controls. Increased signal in the choroid plexus on unenhanced T1-weighted images after GBCA administration was noted in hemodialysis patients (0.72 ± 0.20 vs 0.86 ± 0.23; P = 0.006); however, a multivariate analysis showed this to be primarily related to hemodialysis (P = 0.003) with only a trend toward relating to GBCA exposure (P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Hemodialysis patients receiving linear GBCA have greater dentate nucleus signal increases on unenhanced T1-weighted images, suggesting that renal function may affect the rate of gadolinium accumulation in the brain after linear GBCA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.

### Gadolinium-based contrast agents and nephrotoxicity in patients undergoing coronary artery procedures [^116R1gQX]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

We tested whether gadolinium-based contrast agent is less nephrotoxic than iodinated-contrast media.

Background

Iodinated contrast agents are nephrotoxic. Some data suggest that gadolinium-based contrast agent may be less nephrotoxic than iodinated-contrast media.

Methods

Twenty-five consecutive patients with chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine concentration ≥ 2.0 mg/dl and/or clearance ≤ 40 ml/min), referred to our institution for coronary procedures, were assigned to receive gadolinium-based contrast agents, a solution of gadolinium chelates diluted 3:1 by iso-osmolality contrast media (Gadolinium-based group). A control group of 32 patients with comparable clinical characteristics and treated with iodinated iso-osmolality contrast agent alone (Iodinated-based group) was selected from our database and compared with the Gadolinium-based group. In all cases, prophylactic administration of 0.45% saline intravenously and NAC (1200 mg orally twice daily) was used.

Results

Baseline creatinine levels and creatinine clearance were similar in the 2 groups (Gadolinium-based group = 2.30 [IQR: 2.01–2.68] mg/dl and 33 ± 13 ml/min; Iodinated-based group = 2.24 [IQR: 2.05–2.65] mg/dl and 30 ± 10 ml/min; P > 0.05 for all). Increase of at least 0.5 mg/dl of the creatinine concentration 48 hr after the procedure occurred in 7/25 (28%) patients in the Gadolinium-based group and in 2/32 (6.5%) patients in the Iodinated-based group (P = 0.034; OR = 4.48; 95% CI = 1.01–19.17). Renal failure requiring temporary dialysis occurred in 2 (8%) patients in the Gadolinium-based group and in none in the Iodinated-based group (P = 0.19).

Conclusions

The strategy of gadolinium-based contrast agent administration does not seem to reduce the rate of CAN, as compared to the iodinated iso-osmolality contrast agent in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.

### Revisiting the risks of MRI with gadolinium based contrast agents-review of literature and guidelines [^112jNaBZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract

Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA) have been linked to the occurrence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in renal impaired patients. The exact interaction between the various different available formulations and occurrence of NSF is not completely understood, but has been postulated. This association has triggered public health advisory bodies to issue guidelines and best practice recommendations on its use. As a result, the reported incidence of NSF, as well as the published use of GBCA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in renal impairment, has seen a decline. Understanding of the events that led to these recommendations can increase clinical awareness and the implications of their usage. We present a review of published literature and a brief overview of practice recommendations, guidelines and manuals on contrast safety to aide everyday imaging practice.

Teaching Points

- Low risk gadolinium based contrast agents should be the choice in renal insufficiency.

- Higher doses have been linked to NSF development. Doses should be as low as possible.

- Clear documentation of date, dose and type of formulation used should be noted.

- Post-scan dialysis should be arranged as soon as possible and feasible.

- Pre- existing inflammatory state is a risk factor; liver insufficiency is not a contraindication.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety, and dialyzability of gadoquatrane in patients with impaired renal function: a comprehensive investigation using clinical trial data, modeling and simulation, and in vitro data [^1131zYu3]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

The aims of the study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of gadoquatrane in men and women with mild to moderate renal impairment and in matching participants with normal renal function, to predict the pharmacokinetics of gadoquatrane in patients with severe renal impairment, and to assess the dialyzability of gadoquatrane. Gadoquatrane is a new gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) currently in clinical development.

Materials and Methods:

This evaluation used data from an open-label, nonrandomized, single-dose study in the following 3 parallel cohorts: (i) participants with mild renal impairment, (ii) participants with moderate renal impairment, and (iii) matching controls with normal renal function (3 × 8 = 24 participants between 51 and 79 years of age; 14 women). Each participant received a single IV bolus injection of gadoquatrane (0.025 mmol/kg body weight, corresponding to 0.1 mmol Gd/kg). Study procedures included safety assessments and collection of plasma and urine samples over 6 months. Gadolinium concentrations in plasma and urine were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Modeling and simulation were used to predict the exposure in patients with severe renal impairment. In vitro experiments were used to assess the dialyzability of gadoquatrane.

Results:

Following IV injection, gadolinium plasma concentrations rapidly declined in all cohorts, albeit at different rates depending on renal function. With increasing degree of renal impairment, the exposure increased and the total as well as the renal clearance decreased. The total body weight-normalized clearance was lower by 21% in participants with mild renal impairment (90% confidence interval: 4; 35%) and by 42% in participants with moderate renal impairment (90% confidence interval: 30; 53%) than in participants with normal renal function. Maximum plasma concentration and volume of distribution were similar in all cohorts. The mean effective plasma half-life, which reflects the overall elimination of gadoquatrane, was short, even in participants with moderate renal impairment (4.1 hours; coefficient of variation: 31.2%). In all cohorts, approximately 90% of the injected dose was recovered in urine within the first 24 hours; after 7 days, recovery was practically complete (92%–97% of the dose administered, on average). Only trace amounts of gadolinium continued to be excreted (median recovery in 24-hour urine in all cohorts at 6 months after the injection: < 0.0001% of the dose administered). For patients with severe renal impairment, simulations indicated a continuous decrease in gadoquatrane clearance and increase in exposure with increasing severity of renal impairment. Dialyzability experiments showed that the in vitro kinetic dialysis profile of gadoquatrane is essentially the same as that of gadobutrol.

Conclusions:

Gadoquatrane showed the typical, known pharmacokinetic profile of macrocyclic GBCAs. The clearance of gadoquatrane from plasma decreased with increasing degree of renal impairment, but effective elimination of gadoquatrane was also seen in participants with markedly impaired renal function. Trace amounts of gadolinium continued to be excreted until the last observation time point 6 months after the injection, independent of renal function. No relevant safety findings were observed in this study. Because of the safety profile and the pharmacokinetic profile of gadoquatrane correspond to those of the established GBCAs, no dose adjustment is warranted for patients with any degree of renal impairment. The use of modeling and simulation analysis together with in vitro testing for dialyzability made it possible to predict the pharmacokinetics in patients with severe renal impairment or on dialysis and, with that, to avoid exposing vulnerable participants in a clinical trial.

### Gadolinium use in patients with kidney disease: a cause for concern [^115AjnJ3]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Gadolinium is widely used as a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent and is considered to have a good overall safety profile. Recently, both renal and extra-renal toxicities have been reported following exposure to gadolinium in patients with underlying kidney disease. Gadolinium-related contrast-induced nephropathy appears to be a risk in patients with advanced kidney disease and especially those with diabetic nephropathy. Even more concerning is the strong association of gadolinium with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a devastating fibrosing disorder of the skin and other systemic organs. Although cause and effect have not been proven for the NSF-gadolinium link, the impaired renal elimination of gadolinium in patients with kidney disease and the instability of gadolinium-chelate binding may expose tissues to toxic free Gd(3+) and promote this fibrosing disorder. Caution should be exercised when utilizing gadolinium as a contrast agent in patients with advanced CKD or ESRD.

### Gadolinium-based contrast agent accumulation and toxicity: an update [^1138qXhk]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

In current practice, gadolinium-based contrast agents have been considered safe when used at clinically recommended doses in patients without severe renal insufficiency. The causal relationship between gadolinium-based contrast agents and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with renal insufficiency resulted in new policies regarding the administration of these agents. After an effective screening of patients with renal disease by performing either unenhanced or reduced-dose-enhanced studies in these patients and by using the most stable contrast agents, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis has been largely eliminated since 2009. Evidence of in vivo gadolinium deposition in bone tissue in patients with normal renal function is well-established, but recent literature showing that gadolinium might also deposit in the brain in patients with intact blood-brain barriers caught many individuals in the imaging community by surprise. The purpose of this review was to summarize the literature on gadolinium-based contrast agents, tying together information on agent stability and animal and human studies, and to emphasize that low-stability agents are the ones most often associated with brain deposition.

### Gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with kidney dysfunction… [^1123zaUx]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is requiring changes in the drug label for gadolinium-based contrast agents to minimize the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, a rare, but serious, condition associated with the use of GBCAs in certain patients with kidney dysfunction. GBCAs are intravenous drugs used in diagnostic imaging procedures to enhance the quality of magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance angiography. These label changes are intended to help ensure these drugs are used appropriately, and that patients at risk for NSF who receive GBCAs are actively monitored for the development of NSF. Symptoms of NSF include scaling, hardening and tightening of the skin; red or dark patches on the skin; and stiffness. NSF can also cause fibrosis of internal organs which may lead to death. There is no effective treatment for NSF. 2).

Higher than recommended doses or repeat doses of GBCAs also appear to increase the risk for NSF. The revised labeling will enhance the safe use of GBCAs, by recommending that healthcare professionals:

- Use the clinical history to screen patients for features of AKI or risk factors for chronically reduced kidney function.
- Features of AKI consist of rapid and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury, or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess kidney function in the setting of AKI.
- For patients at risk for chronically reduced kidney function, estimate the kidney function through laboratory testing.
- Avoid use of GBCAs in patients suspected or known to have impaired drug elimination unless the need for the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other alternative imaging modalities. As a result, use of these particular agents is contraindicated in patients with acute kidney injury or chronic, severe kidney disease. FDA has also determined that enhanced screening to identify patients at risk for NSF is necessary, and advises patients and healthcare professionals to report cases of NSF to FDA. Data suggest that NSF may follow the administration of any GBCA and the agency will continue to monitor post-marketing safety data to better characterize the risk of developing NSF following exposure to each GBCA.

### Risks and options with gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with CKD: a review [^114UfEJU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) improve the diagnostic capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging. Although initially believed to be without major adverse effects, GBCA use in patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) was demonstrated to cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Restrictive policies of GBCA use in CKD and selective use of GBCAs that bind free gadolinium more strongly have resulted in the virtual elimination of NSF cases. Contemporary studies of the use of GBCAs with high binding affinity for free gadolinium in severe CKD demonstrate an absence of NSF. Despite these observations and the limitations of contemporary studies, physicians remain concerned about GBCA use in severe CKD. Concerns of GBCA use in severe CKD are magnified by recent observations demonstrating gadolinium deposition in brain and a possible systemic syndrome attributed to GBCAs. Radiologic advances have resulted in several new imaging modalities that can be used in the severe CKD population and that do not require GBCA administration. In this article, we critically review GBCA use in patients with severe CKD and provide recommendations regarding GBCA use in this population.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^112RAS1B]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Gadolinium-enhanced MRI safety and counseling — MRI carries the potential for rare immediate reactions to gadolinium (< 1%) and gadolinium-induced nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; regulators have issued warnings about gadolinium-based contrast agent deposition in the brain even with normal renal function, with no known adverse risks linked so far and ongoing investigation; renal function and risks of contrast should be discussed with the patient before proceeding with an MRI scan in this setting.

### Update on nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [^115tnZdK]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents were for many years considered safe, but this is no longer the case. The least stable agents may trigger the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a generalized fibrotic disorder, in renal failure patients. The use of gadodiamide and gadopentetate dimeglumine is now contraindicated in Europe and Japan in patients who have a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), including those on dialysis. The fear of NSF, however, should not lead to an enhanced MR imaging examination being denied when there is a good clinical indication to give a gadolinium-based contrast agent.

### Gadolinium contrast media are more nephrotoxic than a low osmolar iodine medium employing doses with equal X-ray attenuation in renal arteriography: an experimental study in pigs [^116KtXFv]. Academic Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To investigate in a unilaterally nephrectomized porcine model whether gadolinium contrast media (Gd-CM) are less nephrotoxic than iodine media (I-CM) in x-ray arteriography of a kidney made temporarily ischemic by arterial balloon occlusion.

Materials and Methods

In a noncrossover design, 3 mL of each test solution were injected in eight pigs (mean weight 19 kg) at a rate of 20 mL/min into the right renal artery at the start of a 10-minute period of ischemia. In group 1 (40 pigs) we injected 0.5 M gadopentetate, 0.5 M gadodiamide, 0.5 M iohexol (190 mg I/mL), 0.18 M iohexol (70 mg I/mL; with an x-ray attenuation equal to that of 0.5 M Gd-CM at 80 kV), and saline. In group 2 (24 pigs), we tested 0.18 M iohexol with ischemia and saline with and without ischemia. Gd- and iodine contrast media functioned as markers of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). When saline was tested, a low dose of iohexol (3 mL per pig; 300 mg I/mL) was injected as GFR marker intravenously in group 1 and into the renal artery in group 2. The plasma half-life elimination times of the CM 1–3 hours after injection were used to compare the effects of the different test solutions on GFR. Longer half-life means lower GFR.

Results

Group 1: median plasma half-life elimination time of the GFR marker was 3 340 minutes after injection of 0.5 M gadopentetate, 256 after 0.5 M gadodiamide, 179 after 0.5 M iohexol, 143 after 0.18 M iohexol, and 133 minutes after saline. All differences except that between 0.18 M iohexol and saline were statistically significant (P < .01). Group 2: median plasma half-life was 174 minutes after 0.18 M iohexol with ischemia, 196 minutes after saline with ischemia, and 195 minutes after saline without ischemia. There were no significant differences between the test solutions in group 2 (P > .05).

Conclusion

In pigs, 0.5 M Gd-CM were more nephrotoxic than both equal-attenuating (70 mg I/mL) and equimolar (190 mg I/mL) concentrations of the I-CM iohexol. These results do not support the "off-label" use of Gd-CM for renal x-ray arteriography in man instead of commercially available concentrations of iodine contrast media at 140, 150 and 180 mg I/mL or diluted to 70 mg I/mL.

### Absolute and relative GFR and contrast medium dose / GFR ratio: cornerstones when predicting the risk of acute kidney injury [^112wWAqR]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

A simulated CT contrast medium dose of 500 mg I/mL was applied to a cohort of adult patients in reference with a wide range of GFR and body surface area. The original study concerned the performance of creatinine-based GFR estimating equations in the context of drug dosage adjustment. Mean/median difference between relative and absolute GFR -4/-5 units. Median body surface area women 1.72 m 2 (n = 7328) and men 1.96 m. 2 (n = 7476)

Among the studies, there was only one large retrospective registry study (n = 2306) observing a high ratio threshold (2.15 g-I/GFR ratio), while two other large retrospective registry studies (n > 1000), one large prospective single-center study (n = 3273) and one large multicenter study (n = 4254) all reported lower thresholds, ranging from 0.62 to 1.30. When applying the observed threshold of 0.62 on subsets of patients with different risk factors in the multicenter study by Nie et al, the incidence of PC-AKI in almost all subsets was about 4 times higher in those with a ratio above the threshold (Table 3). In a study on hydration, Liu et al found a higher sensitivity to the g-I/GFR ratio in dehydrated patients with an optimal threshold of 0.69 at insufficient hydration, but of 1.08 in those who were sufficiently hydrated.

### Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: a sufficient reason to avoid gadolinium-based contrast in all patients with renal impairment? [^112N9H6A]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) was recently linked to gadolinium-based contrast (GBC) exposure in patients with renal failure. As result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the UK Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) and the European Pharmacovigilance Working Party Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended that GBC should be avoided in patients with advanced renal failure (GFR < 30 ml/minute/1.73 m2). Ones initial reaction is to advise avoidance of GBC exposure in patients with any level of kidney disease to prevent this awful complication. However, this approach is not based on data nor is it practical for patients who would benefit from this diagnostic modality. Thus, while complete avoidance cannot currently be advocated, GBC-enhanced MRI in renal impairment should be reserved for neurological and vascular cases where the quality of information gained is sufficient to justify the risk of potential devastating adverse effects of NSF.

### Direct mapping of kidney function by DCE-MRI urography using a tetrazinanone organic radical contrast agent [^113zTcMt]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Medical imaging has been investigated as an alternative approach to measure kidney function. Imaging-based GFR assessment is of particular interest because it allows for a direct link between structural alterations (i.e. renal artery stenosis, ureteral obstruction) and changes in kidney filtration. In addition to this, GFR may be measured at the single kidney level. This is of particular interest when monitoring patients after partial nephrectomy or after living kidney donation where early increases in single kidney GFR are predictive of beneficial outcomes. Importantly, imaging-based urographic approaches to GFR measurement mitigate errors associated with plasma sampling-based techniques, including sample timing, decay correction, dilution of standards and the handling of small volumes. Camera-based imaging of GFR is, however, currently limited to 99m Tc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The specificity and sensitivity of camera-based GFR as diagnostic for renal failure was 100% and 47.5% for 99m Tc-DTPA, respectively. 99m Tc-mercaptoazyltriglycerine (MAG3) is another SPECT-based method for imaging-based urography that is primarily cleared by tubular secretion, and is often used to evaluate renal plasma flow. However, clearance of this radiotracer corrected for body surface area correlates well with creatinine-based GFR measurements. These nuclear imaging techniques suffer from two sources of error leading to a wider confidence interval of the determined GFR relative to eGFR: background subtraction necessary for the correct measurement of percentage injected dose, and the estimation of renal depth from a population-derived nomogram based on patient height and weight in order to correct for signal attenuation. Additionally, SPECT is also associated with limited spatial resolution and structural detail, however which is achievable by other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI has been of particular interest as a tool for evaluating GFR in patients with renal artery stenosis, urinary obstruction, and living kidney donors. This technique gives spatial and structural reference to important clinical parameters that can be quantified through contrast enhancement changes over time, such as rate of contrast clearance and time to peak intensity. In comparison to other medical specialties, the advances in imaging technique development in clinical nephrology have been slow. The greatest challenge for kidney DCE-MRI is overcoming both the real and perceived risks associated with the use of traditional gadolinium (Gd)-based MRI contrast agents in patients with suspected or diagnosed renal dysfunction –. Contrast enhanced-MRI in patients with AKI and severe CKD following typical eGFR screens may be delayed or denied in patients with suspected kidney disease due to concerns of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF is a debilitating and sometimes fatal syndrome with no known treatment, and while its mechanism for pathogenic initiation is still poorly understood, it was shown to be linked to the accumulation of Gd in kidney tissue. There is an increased risk of NSF in patients with severe renal dysfunction (AKI, dialysis patients, and stage 5 CKD) where lower rates of Gd clearance lead to higher residence times of the contrast agents. This risk appears to be mitigated in group II Gd-based contrast agent (GBCAs), as defined by the American College of Radiology.

### Brain tissue gadolinium retention in pediatric patients after contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance exams: pathological confirmation [^112j6uVP]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Retained gadolinium from gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) used in MR exams has been inferred based on signal changes on serial brain MRI and subsequently demonstrated pathologically in adults. Retention has been similarly inferred in children but pathological demonstration in pediatric patients is limited. The long-term effects of retained gadolinium are unknown but are potentially of greater concern in children given their increased vulnerability from continuing development and their expected longer period of exposure. Several factors can influence gadolinium retention. In adults as well as in children, greater accumulation has been demonstrated based on MR signal changes with linear compared with macrocyclic gadolinium chelates, attributed to lower chelate affinity with linear agents. Effects of age at exposure on retention are unknown, while differences in GBCA washout rates are still under investigation and might affect gadolinium retention relative to time of GBCA administration.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to confirm whether gadolinium brain deposits are present in pediatric patients who received GBCAs and to quantify the amounts present.

Materials and Methods

Brain autopsy specimens from 10 pediatric patients between 1 year and 13 years of age who underwent at least one contrast-enhanced MR exam were analyzed for elemental gadolinium using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Brain samples included white matter, basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus), thalamus, dentate nucleus and tumor tissue as available. Type and dose of contrast agent, number and timing of contrast-enhanced MR exams and renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) were documented for each child.

Results

Patient exposures ranged from 1 dose to 20 doses of GBCAs including both macrocyclic and linear ionic agents. Gadolinium was found to be present in brain tissue in all children and was generally highest in the globus pallidus. Those who received only macrocyclic agents showed lower levels of gadolinium retention.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates pathological confirmation of gadolinium retention in brain tissue of a series of pediatric patients exposed to GBCAs including not only linear ionic agents but also macrocyclic agents with both nonionic and ionic compounds. The distribution and deposition levels in this small pediatric population are comparable with the findings in adults. While the clinical significance of these deposits remains unknown, at this point it would be prudent to exert caution and avoid unnecessary use of GBCAs in pediatric patients.

Regarding preventative measures for contrast-induced nephropathy, more specifically with respect to restriction of contrast medium use, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to administer IV radiocontrast media in line with consensus statements from radiology societies for patients with AKI or GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (stage G3a-G5) undergoing elective investigation.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: rectal cancer, version 3.2024 [^111Pi5xk]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Rectal cancer — principles of imaging for initial workup/staging specify chest CT and abdominal CT or MRI, with CT performed with intravenous (IV) iodinated contrast and oral contrast material unless contraindicated, and IV contrast is not required for the chest CT. If IV iodinated contrast is contraindicated because of significant contrast allergy, MRI of the abdomen with IV gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) can be obtained instead. In patients with chronic renal failure (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30 mL/min) who are not on dialysis, IV iodinated contrast material is also contraindicated, and IV GBCA can be administered in select cases. If iodinated and gadolinium contrast are both contraindicated due to significant allergy or chronic renal failure without dialysis, consider MRI without IV contrast or consider FDG-PET/CT imaging. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Feasibility and accuracy of dual-layer spectral detector computed tomography for quantification of gadolinium: a phantom study [^114J6us6]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

We found a slightly lower measurement error, and thus higher accuracy, for scans acquired at 140 kVp compared to 120 kVp. When scanning with a higher tube voltage, more high energy X-ray photons are produced. This decreases the spectral overlap between high- and low-energy spectra, and thereby improves the accuracy of material decomposition, which is in accordance with the findings of Gabbai and colleagues. Moreover, 140 kVp acquisitions resulted in higher CT numbers of different gadolinium concentrations at monochromatic 40 keV images (34–464 HU) compared to 120 kVp acquisitions (28 to 416 HU), indicating a superior spectral separation at a higher tube voltage.

Even though gadolinium chelates are generally considered to be safe contrast agents, with acute reaction rates of approximately 0.001–0.07%, recently concerns have arisen about their long-term safety after the discovery that administration of multiple doses has led to detectable gadolinium levels in the brain. In addition, gadolinium contrast has been linked to an increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with impaired renal function. In both conditions the linear non-ionic and linear ionic contrast agents have primarily been implicated, whereas macrocyclic gadolinium agents, such as used in the current study, have not been linked conclusively to either of these conditions. Although both iodine and gadolinium contrast agents pose a risk for patients with impaired renal function, gadolinium is thought to be preferred in patients with renal failure and a glomerular filtration rate greater than 30 mL/min since the risk of NSF is low in these patients, while the risk of iodine contrast-induced nephropathy clearly exists. Furthermore, using gadolinium could potentially obviate the need for pre- and post-imaging hydration as well as premedication protocols that are commonly used in patients with impaired renal function who undergo contrast-enhanced CT scanning, or patients with known allergies to iodinated contrast agents. In the current study a relatively simple method for material decomposition using in-house-developed software is proposed. Our method is based on the mass attenuation coefficient across monochromatic energies. Monochromatic reconstructions take into account the function of two independent factors: the photoelectric and the Compton effect. The photoelectric effect is strongly related to the atomic number of a material in the CT energy range and is therefore material-specific. Our method takes into account this material-specific effect by evaluating the attenuation across monochromatic energies.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety, and dialyzability of gadoquatrane in patients with impaired renal function: a comprehensive investigation using clinical trial data, modeling and simulation, and in vitro data [^117HGiPd]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of the study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of gadoquatrane in men and women with mild to moderate renal impairment and in matching participants with normal renal function, to predict the pharmacokinetics of gadoquatrane in patients with severe renal impairment, and to assess the dialyzability of gadoquatrane. Gadoquatrane is a new gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) currently in clinical development.

Materials and Methods

This evaluation used data from an open-label, nonrandomized, single-dose study in the following 3 parallel cohorts: (i) participants with mild renal impairment, (ii) participants with moderate renal impairment, and (iii) matching controls with normal renal function (3 × 8 = 24 participants between 51 and 79 years of age; 14 women). Each participant received a single IV bolus injection of gadoquatrane (0.025 mmol/kg body weight, corresponding to 0.1 mmol Gd/kg). Study procedures included safety assessments and collection of plasma and urine samples over 6 months. Gadolinium concentrations in plasma and urine were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Modeling and simulation were used to predict the exposure in patients with severe renal impairment. In vitro experiments were used to assess the dialyzability of gadoquatrane.

Results

Following IV injection, gadolinium plasma concentrations rapidly declined in all cohorts, albeit at different rates depending on renal function. With increasing degree of renal impairment, the exposure increased and the total as well as the renal clearance decreased. The total body weight-normalized clearance was lower by 21% in participants with mild renal impairment (90% confidence interval: 4; 35%) and by 42% in participants with moderate renal impairment (90% confidence interval: 30; 53%) than in participants with normal renal function. Maximum plasma concentration and volume of distribution were similar in all cohorts. The mean effective plasma half-life, which reflects the overall elimination of gadoquatrane, was short, even in participants with moderate renal impairment (4.1 hours; coefficient of variation: 31.2%). In all cohorts, approximately 90% of the injected dose was recovered in urine within the first 24 hours; after 7 days, recovery was practically complete (92%-97% of the dose administered, on average). Only trace amounts of gadolinium continued to be excreted (median recovery in 24-hour urine in all cohorts at 6 months after the injection: < 0.0001% of the dose administered). For patients with severe renal impairment, simulations indicated a continuous decrease in gadoquatrane clearance and increase in exposure with increasing severity of renal impairment. Dialyzability experiments showed that the in vitro kinetic dialysis profile of gadoquatrane is essentially the same as that of gadobutrol.

Conclusions

Gadoquatrane showed the typical, known pharmacokinetic profile of macrocyclic GBCAs. The clearance of gadoquatrane from plasma decreased with increasing degree of renal impairment, but effective elimination of gadoquatrane was also seen in participants with markedly impaired renal function. Trace amounts of gadolinium continued to be excreted until the last observation time point 6 months after the injection, independent of renal function. No relevant safety findings were observed in this study. Because of the safety profile and the pharmacokinetic profile of gadoquatrane correspond to those of the established GBCAs, no dose adjustment is warranted for patients with any degree of renal impairment. The use of modeling and simulation analysis together with in vitro testing for dialyzability made it possible to predict the pharmacokinetics in patients with severe renal impairment or on dialysis and, with that, to avoid exposing vulnerable participants in a clinical trial.

### Modeling systemic and renal gadolinium chelate transport with MRI [^114MFBof]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The advent of modern MRI scanners and computer equipment permits the rapid sequential collection of images of gadolinium chelate (Gd) transit through the kidney. The excellent spatial and temporal (0.9 s) resolution permits analyzing the shape of the recovered curves with a sophisticated model that includes both space and time. The purpose of this manuscript is to present such a mathematical model. By building into the model significant physical processes that contribute to the shape of the measured curve, quantitative values can be assigned to important parameters. In this work, quantitative values are determined for blood dispersion through the cardio-pulmonary system, systemic clearance rate of Gd, blood flow into each kidney, blood transit time in each kidney, the extraction rate of Gd across the capillary membrane, interstitial distribution volume, and the GFR for each kidney.

### Revisiting the risks of MRI with gadolinium based contrast agents-review of literature and guidelines [^1129QJ1A]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines

From 2006 onwards, international agencies such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Society for Urological Radiology (ESUR), the US Federal Drugs Agency (FDA), American College of Radiology (ACR) and the UK Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) have published alerts, precautions and recommendations on the use of GBCAs. Multiple publications, have since been gathered to form the body of evidence for NSF; however, the vast majority have been linked to the earlier types of contrast agents. The incidence of NSF has been reported to be on the decline after these recommendations were implemented.

While various different formulations are available on the market, not all have been associated with NSF. Linear GBCAs are considered the least stable, and have been linked to most cases of the development of NSF. These have often been linked to the background of an inflammatory process. Macrocyclic GBCAs for MRI have also been developed.

A recent systematic review of MRI studies in the renal impaired noted that the majority of included studies were published prior to the FDA alert. Half of the studies reported use of contrast types now mentioned by the EMA as having high incidence of NSF (Table 3).

Table 3
European Medicines Agency: categorisation of GBCAs according to NSF risk, based on their thermodynamic and kinetic properties

*Gadopentetic acid generics

In December 2007, the EMA recognized that the risk of developing NSF depends on the type of gadolinium-containing contrast agent used, and advised that these agents should be categorized into three groups. Following this categorization, if a GBCA is to be used in a high-risk patient, then the low risk category agents should be used. Risk and benefit analysis assessment and informed consent should be obtained. Always record the name and dose of the contrast agent used in the patient records. The use of high risk GBCAs in patients with acute kidney injury, end-stage renal disease or stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease is not recommended. Caution is advised in patients with stage 3 disease (eGFR between 30 and 59 ml/min/1.73 m 2). A minimal 7-day interval should be observed between administrations.

### Pharmacokinetics, dialysability, and safety of gadopiclenol, a new gadolinium-based contrast agent, in patients with impaired renal function [^115wRHTi]. Investigative Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of gadopiclenol, a new macrocyclic gadolinium based-contrast agent, in subjects with impaired renal function, and to assess its dialysability in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Methods and Materials

This 2-center, open-label, phase 1 study included 5 successive cohorts of 8 adult subjects: healthy subjects (cohort 1), subjects with mild (cohort 2), moderate (cohort 3), severe (cohort 4) renal impairment, or ESRD (cohort 5), who received a single intravenous injection of gadopiclenol (0.1 mmol/kg). Blood and urine samples were collected at different time points in cohorts 1 to 4, and blood and dialysate samples were collected at each hemodialysis session (4-hour session on day 1, day 3, and day 5) in cohort 5. Gadopiclenol elimination and safety were assessed for up to 6 months. Pharmacokinetics parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis.

Results

A total of 40 subjects were included, with a mean age of 51.5 years (range, 18–71 years). No significant difference in the mean maximum concentration values and the distribution volume was observed among cohorts 1 to 4. Urinary excretion of unchanged gadopiclenol was delayed with the degree of renal impairment and ranged between 96% and 84% in subjects with mild to severe renal impairment. Compared with that of healthy subjects, the mean area under the plasma concentration curve was 54%, 148%, and 769% higher in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, respectively. The mean terminal half-life was prolonged with the degree of renal impairment (1.9, 3.3, 3.8, and 11.7 hours for cohorts 1–4). In ESRD subjects, gadopiclenol was effectively removed from the plasma (95% to 98%) after the first hemodialysis session. Gadopiclenol concentration in plasma was below the limit of quantification for all subjects after the second hemodialysis session. Gadopiclenol concentration was below limit of quantification in all plasma and urine samples collected at 1, 3, and 6 months. Five subjects (12.5%) experienced adverse events related to gadopiclenol, none serious and all resolved. Laboratory measurements, vital signs, and electrocardiography did not raise any safety concern.

Conclusions

Gadopiclenol elimination half-life was prolonged in subjects with mild to severe renal impairment, yet its renal clearance remains complete or nearly complete. In ESRD subjects, gadopiclenol was effectively removed from the plasma after 1 hemodialysis session, and up to 3 hemodialysis sessions were sufficient to completely clear it. No safety concern was raised. Therefore, no dose adjustment seems necessary in this patient population.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: a KDIGO (kidney disease: improving global outcomes) controversies conference [^111mvJrk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Imaging

There are a variety of imaging modalities available for the diagnosis of ARVD, each with different strengths and limitations (Fig 2; Table 1). Duplex ultrasound is frequently used for screening because it is inexpensive and noninvasive and provides flow data such as peak systolic velocity (PSV) and renal-to-aorta PSV ratio, as well as assessment of intrinsic kidney disease through the renal resistive index. – A renal-to-aorta PSV ratio of ≥ 3.5 strongly correlates with > 60% stenosis on catheter angiography. Baseline resistive index < 0.7–0.8 in the ipsilateral kidney before revascularization has been found to correlate with a higher likelihood of improved blood pressure control. Unlike duplex ultrasound, multidetector computed tomographic angiography also reliably detects accessory renal arteries that are important when considering the potential value of revascularization. Contrast medium — induced nephropathy risks are low (~ 5%), even with GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The sensitivity and specificity are higher for gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography. Historically, the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis limited the use of certain gadolinium agents in cases of GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², but newer group II gadolinium agents have shown excellent safety profiles when used in patients with CKD. More recent protocols using high field strength (3-T) magnets, and blood-pool contrast agents, may enable higher resolution and accuracy. For example, blood oxygen level — dependent (BOLD) MR imaging has the potential to identify kidneys in which revascularization can reverse abnormal function by detecting preserved tissue oxygenation levels.

### Contrast agents for functional and cellular MRI of the kidney [^114hji7H]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Low-molecular-weight gadolinium (Gd) chelates are glomerular tracers but their role in evaluation of renal function with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is still marginal. Because of their small size, they diffuse freely into the interstitium and the relationship between measured signal intensity and concentration is complex. New categories of contrast agents, such as large Gd-chelates or iron oxide particules, with different pharmacokinetic and magnetic properties have been developed. These large molecules could be useful for both functional (quantification of perfusion, quantification of glomerular filtration rate, estimation of tubular function) and cellular imaging (intrarenal phagocytosis in inflammatory renal diseases). Continuous development of new contrast agents remains worthwhile to get the best adequacy between the physiological phenomenon of interest and the pharmacokinetic of the agent.

### Glomerular filtration rate in evaluation of the effect of iodinated contrast media on renal function [^112KLAog]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to use measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the reference standard of renal function, to assess the deleterious effect of iodinated contrast media on renal function. Such an effect has been traditionally defined as a greater than 0.5-mg/dL increase in serum creatinine concentration or a 25% or greater increase 24–72 hours after the injection of iodinated contrast medium.

Subjects and Methods

This pilot investigation was focused on the consequences of clinically indicated IV injection of iodinated contrast media; intraarterial injection was excluded. One hundred thirteen patients with normal serum creatinine concentrations were enrolled in an approved protocol. At random, as chosen by one of the investigators, patients underwent imaging with one of three monomeric agents (iopamidol 300, iopromide 300, iohexol 300) and one dimeric agent (iodixanol 320). Measured GFR was determined immediately before CT and approximately 3 and 72 hours after the contrast injection for the CT examination. Iodinated contrast medium, a glomerular filtrate with no tubular excretion or reabsorption, was the GFR marker. Measured GFR was determined by x-ray fluorescence analysis with nonisotopic iodinated contrast media.

Results

Monomeric and dimeric contrast agents in diagnostic CT volumes (based on bodyweight and imaging protocol) did not induce a significant change in measured GFR (95% confidence by Wilcoxon test), suggesting that use of the evaluated contrast media will not lead to more than a 12% variation.

Conclusion

The three monomeric agents studied and the one dimeric agent were equivalent in terms of lack of a significant effect on measured GFR when administered to patients with a normal GFR.
