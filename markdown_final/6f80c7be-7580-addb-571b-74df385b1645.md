afib rvr management in depth

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about in-depth management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic assessment and when to cardiovert. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic rate control choices and dosing. Next, I will examine special populations such as heart failure, pre-excitation, and critical illness. After that, I need to check adjuncts like magnesium and digoxin, and when to escalate to rhythm control. Finally, I should confirm anticoagulation strategy, disposition tools, and long-term planning including AV nodal ablation and CRT considerations, making sure each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and a 12-lead ECG to distinguish AF with RVR from mimics, while rapidly assessing hemodynamic stability and ischemia, because instability mandates immediate synchronized cardioversion and ongoing ischemia or decompensated heart failure lowers the threshold for urgent cardioversion as well [^4c050e27] [^78614778].

> Wait, let me verify the cardioversion specifics before moving on: for unstable AF with RVR, immediate synchronized cardioversion is recommended, and if the device allows, starting at 200 J biphasic for AF is reasonable with escalation if needed; for flutter, 200 J is commonly used, and double sequential cardioversion is a rescue strategy with uncertain benefit as an initial approach, so I should not overstate its routine use [^78614778] [^9bd193a0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about rate control in stable patients; I need to ensure I anchor first-line therapy to guidelines. In hemodynamically stable patients without decompensated heart failure, intravenous beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are first-line for acute rate control, with typical choices being metoprolol 5 mg IV every 5 minutes to 15 mg, diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus with a second 0.35 mg/kg bolus if needed, or verapamil 0.075–0.15 mg/kg IV, while monitoring blood pressure and heart rate closely [^114aa20a] [^8960babd].

> I should double-check comparative effectiveness because it influences agent selection; diltiazem tends to achieve rate control faster than metoprolol in ED studies, though both are effective and safe, and magnesium as an adjunct improves rate control success, so if initial therapy is insufficient, adding IV magnesium is reasonable and guideline-supported [^ec29167e] [^d3210a0b] [^f035e3db] [^4fe0c2d4].

> But wait, what if the patient has heart failure or reduced ejection fraction; I need to check contraindications carefully. In moderate or severe LV systolic dysfunction or decompensated HF, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are harmful and should be avoided, so beta-blockers are preferred if tolerated, and if beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, IV amiodarone or digoxin are alternatives; in critically ill or decompensated HF, amiodarone is reasonable for rate control with awareness of potential cardioversion and stroke risk [^8960babd] [^1cc67200] [^d171daab] [^931181f2].

> Let me consider pre-excitation syndromes because mistreatment can be catastrophic; in AF with WPW, AV nodal blockers such as diltiazem, verapamil, digoxin, and beta-blockers are contraindicated because they may accelerate conduction over the accessory pathway, so preferred acute therapy is procainamide or ibutilide for stable patients and immediate synchronized cardioversion if unstable, with catheter ablation of the accessory pathway as definitive therapy [^c901b061] [^0eef61c6].

> Next, I should review magnesium more closely; I initially thought the effect size was modest, but wait, the meta-analysis shows IV magnesium increases successful rate control from 40% to 63% versus standard care and also improves rhythm conversion, with lower doses appearing more favorable for rhythm outcomes, so I should correct my earlier understatement and consider magnesium early as an adjunct when rate control is suboptimal [^f035e3db] [^4fe0c2d4].

> I will now examine digoxin, since it is often misused; digoxin has a slow onset of action and limited efficacy for rapid control, so it is not first-line for acute rate control in stable patients without HF, but it remains reasonable in HF or when beta-blockers and CCBs are ineffective or contraindicated, and it can be combined with other agents for additive effect, albeit with vigilance for toxicity and drug interactions [^bb53d2e0] [^40961365].

> Hold on, I should verify when to pivot to rhythm control; if rate control fails or symptoms persist despite adequate rate control, electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion is appropriate, with electrical cardioversion more effective but requiring sedation, and both require anticoagulation planning if AF duration is uncertain or exceeds 48 hours; in selected patients, early rhythm control improves outcomes, particularly in those with HF or tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, so I need to ensure I do not delay indicated rhythm restoration [^9bd193a0] [^ec00d4b4].

> I need to ensure anticoagulation decisions are explicit; if AF duration is more than 48 hours or unknown, cardioversion requires therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks before and continued for 4 weeks after, or a transesophageal echocardiogram to exclude left atrial appendage thrombus with immediate cardioversion and continued anticoagulation; for long-term stroke prevention, use CHA2DS2-VASc to guide anticoagulation with DOACs as first-line when not contraindicated [^9bd193a0] [^8a305e2a].

> Let me think about disposition and follow-up; risk stratification tools such as RED-AF, AFFORD, and AFTER can assist ED disposition decisions, and given high recurrence after acute AF, arranging close cardiology follow-up and rhythm monitoring is essential; in patients with persistent rapid rates despite medical therapy, AV nodal ablation with pacemaker implantation is a reasonable strategy, with initial pacemaker lower rate programming at 80–90 bpm to mitigate early sudden death risk, and in CRT-eligible patients with AF, maximizing biventricular pacing percentage via AV nodal ablation can improve outcomes [^8a305e2a] [^0cae4e94] [^2eca7864] [^01df560b].

> I should confirm long-term rate targets and strategy; in patients without HF, a lenient resting heart rate target of less than 100–110 bpm is acceptable, whereas in HF, stricter targets around 80 bpm at rest are reasonable, and shared decision-making should guide rate versus rhythm strategy with periodic reassessment; importantly, persistent AF with rapid ventricular response can cause tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy that may reverse with rate or rhythm control, so I need to maintain a low threshold to escalate therapy when LV dysfunction is present [^65462c60] [^2cc73de4] [^af8ba738].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed special contexts; in sepsis-associated AF, beta-blockers may achieve faster rate control than amiodarone or calcium channel blockers at 1 hour, though differences attenuate by 6 hours, so agent selection should be individualized; in postoperative settings, aggressively treating triggers such as pain, anemia, and sepsis is essential while using standard rate control agents; and in ICD or CRT patients, rapid AF responses can trigger inappropriate shocks, so optimizing rate control and device programming is critical to reduce shocks and ensure effective pacing therapy [^56f0dd5e] [^a371bb05] [^e085b0aa] [^192f04b1].

Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) requires **immediate hemodynamic assessment** and **rapid rate control** to prevent ischemia, heart failure, and shock [^4c050e27]. For unstable patients, **immediate synchronized cardioversion** is indicated [^78614778]; for stable patients, use IV beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as first-line agents, with magnesium as an adjunct when needed [^114aa20a] [^d3210a0b]. Avoid CCBs in HFrEF or decompensated HF, and use amiodarone or digoxin in those settings [^1cc67200] [^78972c71]. Address reversible causes, start anticoagulation based on CHA2DS2-VASc, and monitor for complications; **early rhythm control** is reasonable in selected patients, especially with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^ec00d4b4].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Hemodynamic assessment**: Immediately assess for instability (hypotension, ischemia, heart failure, altered mental status) [^4c050e27].

- **Immediate cardioversion**: For unstable patients, perform synchronized cardioversion without delay (start at 200 J biphasic, escalate if needed) [^78614778].

- **Stable patients**: Proceed with pharmacologic rate control and evaluation for reversible causes (e.g. sepsis, anemia, electrolyte imbalance, thyroid dysfunction) [^5225257f].

---

## Pharmacologic rate control

### First-line agents (hemodynamically stable patients without decompensated HF)

| **Medication** | **Dose** | **Onset** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Metoprolol | 2.5–5 mg IV q5min; max 15 mg | 2–5 min | Avoid in decompensated HF |
| Diltiazem | 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus; repeat 0.35 mg/kg if needed | 2–5 min | Avoid in HFrEF |
| Verapamil | 0.075–0.15 mg/kg IV bolus | 2–5 min | Avoid in HFrEF |
| Magnesium sulfate | 2 g IV over 10–20 min | 10–20 min | Adjunct; improves rate control [^f035e3db] |

---

### Second-line agents (decompensated HF or contraindications to first-line)

- **Amiodarone**: 150 mg IV over 10 min, then 1 mg/min for 6 h, then 0.5 mg/min for 18 h; use when beta-blockers/CCBs are contraindicated or ineffective [^1cc67200] [^d171daab].

- **Digoxin**: 0.25 mg IV q2h; max 1.5 mg; slower onset, useful in sedentary patients or as adjunct [^40961365].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pre-excitation (WPW)**: Avoid AV nodal blockers (beta-blockers, CCBs, digoxin); use procainamide or ibutilide for stable patients, and immediate cardioversion if unstable [^c901b061] [^0eef61c6].

- **Critical illness/sepsis**: Beta-blockers are preferred; amiodarone or magnesium are alternatives if beta-blockers are contraindicated [^56f0dd5e].

- **Postoperative AF**: Treat triggers (pain, anemia, electrolytes) and use standard rate control agents [^a371bb05].

---

## Anticoagulation

Assess stroke risk with **CHA2DS2-VASc** and initiate anticoagulation unless contraindicated; for cardioversion, anticoagulate for ≥ 3 weeks before and ≥ 4 weeks after, or use TEE if early cardioversion is planned [^9bd193a0].

---

## Monitoring and complications

Continuously monitor for **hypotension, bradycardia, and proarrhythmia**, and watch for ischemia, heart failure, and thromboembolism. Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy may reverse with rate/rhythm control [^af8ba738].

---

## Long-term management

- **Rate vs rhythm control**: Tailor to symptoms, age, comorbidities, and patient preference; early rhythm control may benefit selected patients [^ec00d4b4].

- **Catheter ablation**: Consider for symptomatic AF refractory to medical therapy, especially in tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^78972c71].

- **AV nodal ablation**: For refractory rate control with CRT consideration [^01df560b].

---

AF with RVR management centers on **rapid rate control**, anticoagulation, and addressing triggers, with therapy individualized to hemodynamics, comorbidities, and patient factors.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) may lead to stroke, heart failure, and death. When AF occurs in the context of a rapid ventricular rate/response (RVR), this can lead to complications, including hypoperfusion and cardiac ischemia. Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this dysrhythmia.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning AF with RVR for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Differentiating primary and secondary AF with RVR and evaluating hemodynamic stability are vital components of ED assessment and management. Troponin can assist in determining the risk of adverse outcomes, but universal troponin testing is not required in patients at low risk of acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease - especially patients with recurrent episodes of paroxysmal AF that are similar to their prior events. Emergent cardioversion is indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients. Rate or rhythm control should be pursued in hemodynamically stable patients. Elective cardioversion is a safe option for select patients and may reduce AF symptoms and risk of AF recurrence. Rate control using beta blockers or calcium channel blockers should be pursued in those with AF with RVR who do not undergo cardioversion. Anticoagulation is an important component of management, and several tools (e.g. CHA₂DS₂-VASc) are available to assist with this decision. Direct oral anticoagulants are the first-line medication class for anticoagulation. Disposition can be challenging, and several risk assessment tools (e.g. RED-AF, AFFORD, and the AFTER (complex, modified, and pragmatic) scores) are available to assist with disposition decisions.

Conclusion

An understanding of the recent updates in the literature concerning AF with RVR can assist emergency clinicians in the care of these patients.

### What is the best agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response? [^ec29167e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common dysrhythmia associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although many patients have stable AF, some patients can present with a rapid ventricular response (RVR). In these patients, it is important to lower their heart rate. However, there are several options available for rate control in the emergency department setting.

Clinical Question

What is the most effective agent for rate control for the patient with AF in RVR?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included two prospective, randomized, double-blind studies and six retrospective cohort studies. These studies provide estimates of the efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers and β-blockers for rate control in those with AF with RVR.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, diltiazem likely achieves rate control faster than metoprolol, though both agents seem safe and effective. Clinicians must consider the individual patient, clinical situation, and comorbidities when selecting a medication for rate control.

### Update on medical management of atrial fibrillation in the modern era [^d608efb9]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation involves control of the ventricular response rate, anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke and attempts to maintain sinus rhythm. The approach to patients with atrial fibrillation has become increasingly complex as therapeutic options have expanded. The ultimate reasons to treat atrial fibrillation include improvement in symptoms, reduction in adverse outcomes and improvement in survival. Despite increasing interest in non pharmacological approaches to treat and potentially cure atrial fibrillation, drugs remain the primary method to treat most patients. This review updates the present state-of-the-art regarding medical management of atrial fibrillation based on present and emerging evidence.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — definition and electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics — is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function. On the ECG, AF is characterized by the replacement of consistent P waves by rapid oscillations or fibrillatory waves that vary in amplitude, shape, and timing, associated with an irregular, frequently rapid ventricular response when atrioventricular (AV) conduction is intact, and regular cardiac cycles (R-R intervals) are possible in the presence of AV block or ventricular or AV junctional tachycardia. The ventricular response to AF depends on electrophysiologically (EP) properties of the AV node and other conducting tissues, the level of vagal and sympathetic tone, the presence or absence of accessory conduction pathways, and the action of drugs, and in patients with implanted pacemakers, diagnosis of AF may require temporary inhibition of the pacemaker to expose atrial fibrillatory activity. A rapid, irregular, sustained, wide-QRS-complex tachycardia strongly suggests AF with conduction over an accessory pathway or AF with underlying bundle-branch block, and extremely rapid rates (over 200 beats per minute) suggest the presence of an accessory pathway or ventricular tachycardia.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — mechanisms, efficacy, and practical considerations for rate control: The main determinants of ventricular rate during AF are the intrinsic conduction characteristics and refractoriness of the AV node and autonomic tone, and drugs that prolong the AV nodal refractory period are generally effective. The efficacy of pharmacological interventions designed to achieve rate control in AF has been about 80% in clinical trials. There is no evidence that pharmacological rate control has any adverse influence on LV function, but bradycardia and heart block may occur, particularly in patients with paroxysmal AF, especially the elderly. When rapid control is required or oral administration is not feasible, medication may be administered intravenously; otherwise, in hemodynamically stable patients with a rapid ventricular response, negative chronotropic medication may be administered orally. Combinations may be necessary to achieve rate control in both acute and chronic situations, some patients may require permanent pacing for symptomatic bradycardia, and nonpharmacological therapy should be considered when pharmacological measures fail.

### Atrial fibrillation: is rhythm control required, and If so, how, and what is the internist's role? [^34e70567]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation-no primary care physician can escape it! Atrial fibrillation is the most common tachyarrhythmia encountered in clinical practice-whether family practice, internal medicine, cardiology, pulmonology medicine, etc. Moreover, with growth of the older segment of our population and better survival of patients with cardiovascular disorders, the incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation are both increasing progressively. Currently, a review of major guidelines shows that the treatment approach to atrial fibrillation involves 4 "pillars"-treatment of contributory comorbidities ("upstream therapy"), control of the ventricular response to the rapid atrial rates during atrial fibrillation, prevention of thromboembolism with oral anticoagulation or left atrial appendage occlusion (except in the minority of patients at too low a thromboembolic risk), and rhythm control in those patients who require it. The latter is the most complex of the 4, and many, if not most, primary care physicians currently prefer to leave this "pillar" to the care of a cardiologist or electrophysiologist. Nonetheless, it is important for the primary care physician to be familiar with the rhythm treatment components and choices (both overall and, specifically, the ones in which they must participate) as they will impact many interactions with their patients in multiple ways. This review details for the primary care physician the components of care regarding rhythm control of atrial fibrillation and the areas in which the primary care physician/internist must be knowledgeable and proactively involved.

Management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure (HF) — key guideline recommendations state that in patients with a new diagnosis of HFrEF and AF, arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy should be suspected, and an early and aggressive approach to AF rhythm control is recommended; in appropriate patients with AF and HFrEF on guideline-directed medical therapy and with reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation is beneficial to improve symptoms, quality of life (QOL), ventricular function, and cardiovascular outcomes; in symptomatic AF with HFpEF and reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation can be useful to improve symptoms and QOL; for AF with HF, digoxin is reasonable for rate control, either with other rate-controlling agents or as monotherapy if others are not tolerated; when AF with HF presents with rapid ventricular rates and beta blockers or calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for acute rate control; in AF, HF, HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 50%) with refractory rapid ventricular response and not candidates for or failing rhythm control, atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with biventricular pacing can be useful to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; in AF and HF with implanted biventricular pacing where effective pacing percentage cannot be achieved pharmacologically, AVNA can be beneficial to improve functional class, reduce ICD shock risk, and improve survival; after recovery of LV function from AF‑induced cardiomyopathy, long-term surveillance can be beneficial to detect recurrent AF; for suspected AF‑induced cardiomyopathy or refractory HF symptoms on pharmacological rate control, a stricter rate-control strategy (target heart rate ≤ 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm during moderate exercise) may be reasonable; in AF and HFrEF undergoing AVNA, His bundle or left bundle branch area pacing may be reasonable as an alternative to biventricular pacing to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; and in AF with known LVEF < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered because of the potential to exacerbate HF.

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^4c050e27]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular response — synopsis: Treating AF/flutter with rapid ventricular rates depends on hemodynamic stability, and unstable patients and those with rate-related ischemia often need urgent electrical cardioversion. Stable patients can be treated pharmacologically to achieve rate or rhythm control. Conversion of AF/flutter greater than 48 hours in nonanticoagulated patients risks thromboembolic events. For acute AF/flutter assessed as less than 48 hours, decision making is more nuanced, requiring expert consultation unless emergent cardioversion is needed. Pre-excited AF/flutter (Wolff–Parkinson–White) is covered under Wide-Complex Tachycardias.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Direct-current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter — recommendations: When a rapid ventricular response does not respond promptly to pharmacological measures in AF with ongoing myocardial ischemia, symptomatic hypotension, angina, or HF, immediate R-wave synchronized direct-current cardioversion is recommended (Level of Evidence: C). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended for AF with preexcitation when very rapid tachycardia or hemodynamic instability occurs (Level of Evidence: B). Cardioversion is recommended in patients without hemodynamic instability when AF symptoms are unacceptable, and in case of early relapse after cardioversion, repeated direct-current attempts may be made following administration of antiarrhythmic medication (Level of Evidence: C). As Class IIa, direct-current cardioversion can be useful to restore sinus rhythm as part of a long-term management strategy in AF (Level of Evidence: B), and patient preference is a reasonable consideration for infrequently repeated cardioversions in symptomatic or recurrent AF (Level of Evidence: C). As Class III, frequent repetition of direct-current cardioversion is not recommended when periods of sinus rhythm are relatively short after multiple procedures despite prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Level of Evidence: C), and electrical cardioversion is contraindicated in patients with digitalis toxicity or hypokalemia (Level of Evidence: C).

### Rationale, considerations, and goals for atrial fibrillation centers of excellence: a Heart Rhythm Society perspective [^6bdc71b1]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation centers of excellence — clinical roles, resources, and access pathways — require appropriate staffing and dedicated clinics, with centers committing to multidisciplinary and broad-based development. Relying on a single clinician to manage AF patients is no longer feasible in most, if not all, health care systems, and providing comprehensive AF care is best accomplished through a team-based approach that enables identification, referral, and management in a coordinated fashion. Timely access is particularly important when patients are acutely symptomatic, and pathways and systems are needed to help ensure continuity of care across encounters, while newly diagnosed asymptomatic AF or rapid ventricular rate may be detected in preoperative settings, outpatient clinics, or at home with wearable monitors or smartphone-based or direct-to-consumer applications.

Implantable cardioverter–defibrillator recipients with paroxysmal or chronic atrial fibrillation and inappropriate ICD firing — rate control: Control of the rapid ventricular response to atrial tachyarrhythmias is essential, and combination therapy with a beta blocker and/or a calcium channel blocker is useful. Amiodarone has been used off-label for rate control if other therapies are contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective, and ablation of the atrioventricular node may be required when pharmacological therapy is not effective.

### Management of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: a systematic review [^c8be0fa6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological management options for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (AFRVR) in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in the acute care setting.

Methods

This study was a systematic review of observational studies or randomized clinical trials (RCT) of adult patients with AFRVR and concomitant ADHF in the emergency department (ED), intensive care unit, or step-down unit. The primary effectiveness outcome was successful rate or rhythm control. Safety outcomes were adverse events, such as symptomatic hypotension and venous thromboembolism.

Results

A total of 6577 unique articles were identified. Five studies met inclusion criteria: one RCT in the inpatient setting and four retrospective studies, two in the ED and the other three in the inpatient setting. In the RCT of diltiazem versus placebo, 22 patients (100%) in the treatment group had a therapeutic response compared to 0/15 (0%) in the placebo group, with no significant safety differences between the two groups. For three of the observational studies, data were limited. One observation study showed no difference between metoprolol and diltiazem for successful rate control, but worsening heart failure symptoms occurred more frequently in those receiving diltiazem compared to metoprolol (19 patients [33%] vs. 10 patients [15%], p = 0.019). A single study included electrical cardioversion (one patient exposed with failure to convert to sinus rhythm) as nonpharmacological management. The overall risk of bias for included studies ranged from serious to critical. Missing data and heterogeneity of definitions for effectiveness and safety outcomes precluded the combination of results for quantitative meta-analysis.

Conclusions

High-level evidence to inform clinical decision making regarding effective and safe management of AFRVR in patients with ADHF in the acute care setting is lacking.

Atrioventricular nodal ablation (AVNA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) — recommendations: In patients with AF and a persistently rapid ventricular response who undergo AVNA, initial pacemaker lower rate programming should be 80 to 90 bpm to reduce the risk of sudden death. In patients with AF and uncontrolled rapid ventricular response refractory to rate-control medications (who are not candidates for or in whom rhythm control has been unsuccessful), AVNA can be useful to improve symptoms and quality of life. In patients with AF who are planned to undergo AVNA, implantation of a pacemaker before the ablation (ie, before or same day of ablation) is recommended to ensure adequate back-up pacing leads before performing ablation. In patients with AF with normal ejection fraction undergoing AVNA, conduction system pacing of the His bundle or left bundle area may be reasonable.

### Efficacy of intravenous magnesium for the management of non-post operative atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f035e3db]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous magnesium (IV Mg), a commonly utilized therapeutic agent in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response, is thought to exert its influence via its effect on cellular automaticity and prolongation of atrial and atrioventricular nodal refractoriness thus reducing ventricular rate. We sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of IV Mg versus placebo in addition to standard pharmacotherapy in the rate and rhythm control of AF in the nonpostoperative patient cohort given that randomized control trials (RCTs) have shown conflicting results.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing IV Mg versus placebo in addition to standard of care were identified via electronic database searches. Nine RCTs were returned with a total of 1048 patients. Primary efficacy endpoints were study-defined rate control and rhythm control/reversion to sinus rhythm. The secondary endpoint was patient experienced side effects.

Results

Our analysis found IV Mg in addition to standard care was successful in achieving rate control (odd ratio [OR] 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–3.11, p = .02) and rhythm control (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04–2.03, p = .03). Although not well reported among studies, there was no significant difference between groups regarding the likelihood of experiencing side effects.

Conclusions

IV Mg, in addition to standard-of-care pharmacotherapy, increases the rates of successful rate and rhythm control in nonpostoperative patients with AF with rapid ventricular response and is well tolerated.

Atrial fibrillation acute rate control — comparative trials report that "Intravenous diltiazem was more effective than intravenous digoxin in 2 small RCTs.6,7" In one emergency department trial, investigators "randomized 150 patients with AF without major comorbidities and a ventricular rate > 120 bpm in a 1:1:1 ratio to intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, and amiodarone.6" with "time to reduce the heart rate < 90 bpm" shorter with diltiazem. Another RCT of "30 patients" found diltiazem "significantly decreased heart rate within 5 minutes versus 3 hours with intravenous digoxin.7" Diltiazem also reduced rate "more rapidly than intravenous digoxin in a double-blinded RCT in 40 patients with rapid AF after CABG, with similar control at 12 to 24 hours". Additional evidence shows "In another RCT of 84 patients in rapid AF who presented to the emergency department, intravenous amiodarone resulted in faster control of the ventricular response compared with intravenous digoxin.8" and "Finally, 52 patients with rapid AF were randomized to receive either an intravenous combination of diltiazem and digoxin or intravenous diltiazem alone, with a more rapid and durable response to the combination.9"

In these 2025 Advanced Life Support Guidelines, the American Heart Association provides comprehensive recommendations for the resuscitation and management of adults experiencing cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, and life-threatening cardiovascular emergencies. Based on structured evidence reviews and the latest clinical research, these guidelines offer evidence-based strategies to optimize survival and patient outcomes. The 2025 guidelines provide guidance for the treatment of cardiac arrest, including ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity, as well as peri-arrest conditions such as atrial fibrillation and flutter with rapid ventricular response. Recommendations are made for defibrillation, electrical cardioversion, advanced airway management, drug therapies, and intravenous access. Additionally, guidelines are provided for the use of double sequential defibrillation, head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and point-of-care ultrasound in the advanced life support setting. Termination of resuscitation rules have been refined to guide decision-making based on the emergency medical services professional's scope of practice. Finally, these guidelines also underscore the importance of identifying causative versus secondary arrhythmias to inform the appropriate timing of therapeutic strategies.

### Atrial fibrillation in the ICU [^343e1fcb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in the ICU. Preexisting AF is highly prevalent among older patients with chronic conditions who are at risk for critical illness, whereas new-onset AF can be triggered by accelerated atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenic triggers encountered during critical illness. The acute loss of atrial systole and onset of rapid ventricular rates that characterize new-onset AF often lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise. Thus, new-onset AF is both a marker of disease severity as well as a likely contributor to poor outcomes, similar to other manifestations of organ dysfunction during critical illness. Evaluating immediate hemodynamic effects of new-onset AF during critical illness is an important component of rapid clinical assessment aimed at identifying patients in need of urgent direct current cardioversion, treatment of reversible inciting factors, and identification of patients who may benefit from pharmacologic rate or rhythm control. In addition to acute hemodynamic effects, new-onset AF during critical illness is associated with both short- and long-term increases in the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death, with AF recurrence rates of approximately 50% within 1 year following hospital discharge. In the absence of a strong evidence base, there is substantial practice variation in the choice of strategies for management of new-onset AF during critical illness. We describe acute and long-term evaluation and management strategies based on current evidence and propose future avenues of investigation to fill large knowledge gaps in the management of patients with AF during critical illness.

Supraventricular arrhythmias in chronic heart failure — The course of patients with HF is frequently complicated by supraventricular tachyarrhythmias; the most common treatable atrial arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which affects 10% to 30% of patients with chronic HF and is associated with reduced exercise capacity and worse long-term prognosis. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias may exert adverse effects by 4 different mechanisms, including loss of atrial enhancement of ventricular filling with compromised output, rapid heart rate increasing demand and decreasing coronary perfusion, diminished contraction and relaxation with rapid ventricular response, and stasis in fibrillating atria predisposing to emboli. In most patients with an ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, the rapidity of ventricular response is more important than the loss of atrial support, because restoration of sinus rhythm does not result in predictable clinical benefits, and rapid supraventricular arrhythmias may actually cause or exacerbate a cardiomyopathy.

Atrial fibrillation — digoxin provides limited rate control with delayed onset, is not first-line for rapid management, and has important adverse effects and interactions. Although intravenous digoxin may slow the ventricular response to AF at rest, there is a delay of at least 60 min before onset and the peak effect does not develop for up to 6 h; digoxin is no more effective than placebo in converting AF to sinus rhythm, in a review of 139 episodes of paroxysmal AF there was no difference between those taking digoxin and those not, and digoxin is no longer considered first-line therapy for rapid management of AF except in patients with HF or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or in very sedentary patients. According to a systematic review, digoxin alone slows resting heart rate by an average of 4 to 21 beats per minute but does not slow heart rate during exercise in AF; the most frequent adverse effects are ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular (AV) block, and sinus pauses, and serum digoxin concentration may rise with verapamil or antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone or amiodarone.

### Atrial fibrillation occurring during acute hospitalization: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^bc86f5ce]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute atrial fibrillation is defined as atrial fibrillation detected in the setting of acute care or acute illness; atrial fibrillation may be detected or managed for the first time during acute hospitalization for another condition. Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery is a distinct type of acute atrial fibrillation. Acute atrial fibrillation is associated with high risk of long-term atrial fibrillation recurrence, warranting clinical attention during acute hospitalization and over long-term follow-up. A framework of substrates and triggers can be useful for evaluating and managing acute atrial fibrillation. Acute management requires a multipronged approach with interdisciplinary care collaboration, tailoring treatments to the patient's underlying substrate and acute condition. Key components of acute management include identification and treatment of triggers, selection and implementation of rate/rhythm control, and management of anticoagulation. Acute rate or rhythm control strategy should be individualized with consideration of the patient's capacity to tolerate rapid rates or atrioventricular dyssynchrony, and the patient's ability to tolerate the risk of the therapeutic strategy. Given the high risks of atrial fibrillation recurrence in patients with acute atrial fibrillation, clinical follow-up and heart rhythm monitoring are warranted. Long-term management is guided by patient substrate, with implications for intensity of heart rhythm monitoring, anticoagulation, and considerations for rhythm management strategies. Overall management of acute atrial fibrillation addresses substrates and triggers. The 3As of acute management are acute triggers, atrial fibrillation rate/rhythm management, and anticoagulation. The 2As and 2Ms of long-term management include monitoring of heart rhythm and modification of lifestyle and risk factors, in addition to considerations for atrial fibrillation rate/rhythm management and anticoagulation. Several gaps in knowledge related to acute atrial fibrillation exist and warrant future research.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: translating clinical trial data into clinical practice [^b9c82eb5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with significant consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. In light of the limitations of available pharmacologic treatment options (suboptimal efficacy plus safety and tolerability issues), atrial fibrillation management should be individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities that could influence response to specific management approaches. The importance of adequate anticoagulation should not be overlooked. This review provides a practical guide for primary care physicians, internists, and cardiologists on current management strategies for atrial fibrillation, based on recent guidelines and current clinical data.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular response — electrical therapies: In adult patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates, immediate electrical cardioversion should be performed to restore sinus rhythm (1 C-LD). Urgent direct-current cardioversion of new onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is recommended for adult patients with hemodynamic compromise, ongoing ischemia, or inadequate rate control (1 C-LD). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults using any currently US-approved biphasic wave form defibrillator, an initial energy setting of at least 200 J is reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2a B-R). The usefulness of double synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults as an initial treatment strategy is uncertain (2b B-R). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial flutter in adults, an initial energy setting of 200 J may be reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2b C-LD). The usefulness of double synchronized cardioversion as a rescue treatment for shock-refractory atrial fibrillation in adults is uncertain (2b C-LD).

### Comparative effectiveness of heart rate control medications for the treatment of sepsis-associated atrial fibrillation [^56f0dd5e]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response frequently complicates the management of critically ill patients with sepsis and may necessitate the initiation of medication to avoid hemodynamic compromise. However, the optimal medication to achieve rate control for AF with rapid ventricular response in sepsis is unclear.

Research Question

What is the comparative effectiveness of frequently used AF medications (β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and digoxin) on heart rate (HR) reduction among critically ill patients with sepsis and AF with rapid ventricular response?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study among patients with sepsis and AF with rapid ventricular response (HR > 110 beats/min). We compared the rate control effectiveness of β-blockers to calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and digoxin using multivariate-adjusted, time-varying exposures in competing risk models (for death and addition of another AF medication), adjusting for fixed and time-varying confounders.

Results

Among 666 included patients, 50.6% initially received amiodarone, 10.1% received a β-blocker, 33.8% received a calcium channel blocker, and 5.6% received digoxin. The adjusted hazard ratio for HR of < 110 beats/min by 1 h was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.34–0.74) for amiodarone vs β-blocker, 0.37 (95% CI, 0.18–0.77) for digoxin vs β-blocker, and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.51–1.11) for calcium channel blocker vs β-blocker. By 6 h, the adjusted hazard ratio for HR < 110 beats/min was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47–0.97) for amiodarone vs β-blocker, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.36–1.004) for digoxin vs β-blocker, and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.71–1.49) for calcium channel blocker vs β-blocker.

Interpretation

In a large cohort of patients with sepsis and AF with rapid ventricular response, a β-blocker treatment strategy was associated with improved HR control at 1 h, but generally similar HR control at 6 h compared with amiodarone, calcium channel blocker, or digoxin.

Atrioventricular conduction in atrial fibrillation (AF) with preexcitation syndromes — Conduction over an accessory pathway during AF can cause dangerously rapid ventricular responses and, in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, may degenerate to ventricular fibrillation with risk of death; intravenous digitalis, verapamil, or diltiazem do not block the accessory pathway and may accelerate ventricular rate, and "these agents are contraindicated in this situation", while "caution should be exercised" with beta blockers in AF associated with preexcitation.

Intravenous magnesium and rate-control agents — evidence in AF with rapid ventricular response: A meta-analysis including '6 RCTs (n = 745 patients)' reported intravenous magnesium superior for rate control '(63% versus 40%; OR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.80–3.45])' and modestly effective for rhythm conversion '(21% versus 14%; OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.08–2.84])' versus standard methods, with subgroup results favoring a lower dose '(≤ 5 g) (24% versus 13%; OR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.22–3.61])' over a higher dose '(> 5 g) (16% versus 13%; OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.65–2.32])' for rhythm control compared with placebo. In critically ill patients, a retrospective series 'of 38 patients' found intravenous amiodarone decreased heart rate without BP decrease versus intravenous diltiazem and digoxin, and a study of '60 critically ill patients' randomized to diltiazem 'a 25-mg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/h for 24 hours', amiodarone 'a 300-mg bolus', or amiodarone 'a 300-mg bolus followed by 45 mg/h for 24 hours' showed a ' > 30% rate reduction within 4 hours' was not different, with diltiazem achieving better 24-hour rate control but more hypotension requiring discontinuation. In HFrEF populations, retrospective analyses associated diltiazem with increased acute kidney injury within 48 hours when 'LVEF ≤ 50%' compared with normal EF '(10% versus 3.6%; P = 0.002)' and with a higher incidence of worsening HF symptoms '(33% versus 15%; P = 0.019)', while 'Neither analysis noted an increase in the in-hospital mortality rate, need for a higher level of care, or hypotension'.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) preexcitation syndromes with atrial fibrillation — treatment recommendations are: Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is recommended in symptomatic patients with AF who have WPW syndrome, particularly those with syncope due to rapid heart rate or those with a short bypass tract refractory period (Level of Evidence: B). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended to prevent ventricular fibrillation in patients with a short anterograde bypass tract refractory period in whom AF occurs with a rapid ventricular response associated with hemodynamic instability (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous procainamide or ibutilide is recommended to restore sinus rhythm in patients with WPW in whom AF occurs without hemodynamic instability in association with a wide QRS complex on the ECG (greater than or equal to 120-ms duration) or with a rapid preexcited ventricular response (Level of Evidence: C). Intravenous flecainide or direct-current cardioversion is reasonable when very rapid ventricular rates occur in patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). It may be reasonable to administer intravenous quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, ibutilide, or amiodarone to hemodynamically stable patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous administration of digitalis glycosides or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists is not recommended in patients with WPW syndrome who have preexcited ventricular activation during AF (Level of Evidence: B).

Management overview — Management of patients with AF involves 3 objectives — rate control, prevention of thromboembolism, and correction of the rhythm disturbance, and these are not mutually exclusive. The initial management decision involves primarily a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy; under the rate-control strategy, the ventricular rate is controlled with no commitment to restore or maintain sinus rhythm, while the rhythm-control strategy attempts restoration and/or maintenance of sinus rhythm and also requires attention to rate control. Depending on the patient's course, the strategy initially chosen may prove unsuccessful and the alternate strategy is then adopted.

### Prognostic significance of ventricular rate at discharge in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and HF [^5474a69b]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with an increased risk of heart failure (HF), systemic thromboembolism, and mortality. It is seen in 10% to 45% of patients with congestive HF at initial presentation. Its presence in HF patients is associated with worse prognosis in terms of morbidity and mortality. Frequently, cause-effect relationship cannot be established at the time of presentation, as persistent atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate can lead to HF, and on the contrary, severe HF can be complicated by atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.

In atrial fibrillation, the relationship between ventricular rate and congestive HF is complex. Optimal management of HF, through neuro-hormonal influences, decreases sympathetic activity and thus slows ventricular rate. Slowing ventricular rate by atrioventricular blockade leads to improved ventricular filling and cardiac output. In individual patients, it is very difficult to establish which of the above is more critical; however, controlling ventricular rate is intuitive and is associated with improvement in HF. The optimal ventricular rate that is associated with the best long-term outcome remains a matter of debate.

Managing episodes of bradycardia associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) — AF occurs commonly after cardiac surgery in adults, with a peak incidence 2 to 4 days postoperatively and an overall incidence ranging from 10% to 65%; postoperative AF occurs more frequently in patients undergoing valve surgery than in those undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft; bradycardia may take several forms in these patients, including slow ventricular response during AF and prolonged sinus pauses after sinus rhythm is restored; a slow and regular ventricular response during AF usually indicates complete heart block, and pacing may be required if resolution does not occur; in general, bradyarrhythmias in the setting of postoperative AF should be treated similarly to those occurring in the nonoperative setting, and a period of watchful waiting rather than early PPM implantation is generally used; in occasional patients with refractory AF with rapid ventricular responses associated with significant SND limiting rate control drugs, a PPM may be required for adequate AF management.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — synopsis highlights effective classes and selection considerations. Both nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) and beta blockers are effective for long-term rate control, and these agents are useful in ventricular rate control in the absence of preexcitation. Digoxin may be useful in patients with limited tolerability to other agents, or as adjunct therapy in patients with a difficult to control ventricular rate. Limited data exist comparing various rate control agents, especially in the setting of chronic rate control, and selection of specific agents should consider patient-specific characteristics (ie, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF], reactive airway disease) and response.

5.4 Combined Effects of AF and Rapid Ventricular Rates

Guichard et al. attempted to parse the contributions of AF‐induced atrial tachyarrhythmia versus rapid ventricular rates to atrial remodeling. In their experimental studies in dogs, rapid atrial pacing shortens atrial refractoriness and action potential duration and slows atrial conduction. Rapid ventricular pacing also slows atrial conduction but does not shorten atrial refractoriness or action potential duration (Figure 5). Each component produced discrete features: AF‐induced atrial arrhythmia caused accelerated repolarization and abbreviated refractoriness, strongly increased vulnerability to AF induction by premature ectopic beats, conduction slowing, and moderate atrial fibrosis, whereas ventricular tachyarrhythmia, that is, mimicked by rapid ventricular pacing, slightly increased vulnerability, slowed conduction, and induced moderate fibrosis without affecting repolarization/refractoriness. Combined atrial and ventricular arrhythmia abbreviated refractoriness, strongly increased vulnerability and fibrosis, and greatly increased AF stability/duration. This study suggests that in the absence of ventricular rate control, the rapid ventricular response itself can cause AF‐promoting atrial remodeling without overt HF.

Beta blockers — evidence note states intravenous beta blockade options and perioperative comparison: "Intravenous beta blockade with propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol, or esmolol is effective for control of the rate of ventricular response to AF". These agents "may be particularly useful in states of high adrenergic tone (e.g., postoperative AF)". It also reports that "After noncardiac surgery, intravenous esmolol produced more rapid conversion to sinus rhythm than diltiazem, but rates after 2 and 12 h were similar with both treatments".

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to atrioventricular nodal ablation, pacemaker placement, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to set initial pacemaker lower rate programming at 80–90 bpm to reduce the risk of sudden death in patients with AF and a persistently rapid ventricular response undergoing atrioventricular node ablation.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) management in advanced heart failure — advanced HF often necessitates adjustment of ICD settings, and the HF specialist or a member of the HF team should be prepared to adjust (or recommend adjustment of) ICD settings in response to changes in the patient's HF status; examples include onset of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, symptomatic bradycardia, need for CRT, increasing frequency of ventricular tachycardia and other arrhythmias leading to ICD discharges, or irreversible deterioration in HF symptoms warranting hospice care, which mandate changes in HF therapy and discussion with the ICD clinician about detection algorithms and potential upgrading or inactivation.

### Pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation: current therapeutic strategies [^f11ba6da]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common form of sustained arrhythmia, is associated with a frightening risk of embolic complications, tachycardia-related ventricular dysfunction, and often disabling symptoms. Pharmacologic therapy is the treatment used most commonly to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, to prevent recurrences, or to control ventricular response rate.

Methods

This article reviews published data on pharmacologic treatment and discusses alternative systems to classify AF and to choose appropriate pharmacologic therapy.

Results

AF is either paroxysmal or chronic. Attacks of paroxysmal AF can differ in duration, frequency, and functional tolerance. In the new classification system described, 3 clinical aspects of paroxysmal AF are distinguished on the basis of their implications for therapy. Chronic AF usually occurs in association with clinical conditions that cause atrial distention. The risk of chronic AF is significantly increased by the presence of congestive heart failure or rheumatic heart disease. Mortality rate is greater among patients with chronic AF regardless of the presence of coexisting cardiac disease. The various options available for the treatment of chronic AF include restoration of sinus rhythm or control of ventricular rate. Cardioversion may be accomplished with pharmacologic or electrical treatment. For patients in whom cardioversion is not indicated or who have not responded to this therapy, antiarrhythmic agents used to control ventricular response rate include nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists, digoxin, or beta-blockers. For patients who are successfully cardioverted, sodium channel blockers or potassium channel blockers such as sotalol, amiodarone, or a pure class III agent such as dofetilide, a selective potassium channel blocker, may be used to prevent recurrent AF to maintain normal sinus rhythm.

Conclusions

The ultimate choice of the antiarrhythmic drug will depend on the presence or absence of structural heart disease. An additional concern with chronic AF is the risk of arterial embolization resulting from atrial stasis and the formation of thrombi. In patients with chronic AF the risk of embolic stroke is increased 6-fold. Therefore anticoagulant therapy should be considered in patients at high risk for embolization. Selection of the appropriate treatment should be based on the concepts recently developed by the Sicilian Gambit Group (based on the specific channels blocked by the antiarrhythmic agent) and on clinical experience gained over the years with antiarrhythmic agents. For example, termination of AF is best accomplished with either a sodium channel blocker (class I agent) or a potassium channel blocker (class III agent). In contrast, ventricular response rate is readily controlled by a beta-blocker (propranolol) or a calcium channel blocker (verapamil). Alternatively, antiarrhythmic drug therapy may be chosen based on the Vaughan-Williams classification, which identifies the cellular electrophysiologic effects of the drug.

Tachycardia-mediated ventricular dysfunction in atrial fibrillation may improve with rate control. In one study, the median LV ejection fraction increased with rate control from 25% to 52%, and conduction disturbances may exacerbate mitral regurgitation and limit ventricular filling. Controlling the ventricular rate may reverse these effects.

### Review of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on the management of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias [^594bf772]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines present a synopsis of extensive internal evidence and technology reviews, with a particular focus on clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness within the NHS in England. This approach has delivered a novel perspective on arrhythmia management, with important distinctions from other policymakers' recommendations. For example, when compared with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines on atrial fibrillation (AF), NICE advocates unique strategies regarding arrhythmia detection, stroke and bleeding risk stratification, and rhythm control (NICE CG 196). Likewise, for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death, NICE TA314 not only recommends device therapy based on New York Heart Association class and ECG findings, but also incorporates quality-adjusted life year data from analysis of key randomised controlled trials. This review examines the NICE guidelines, together with those from the AHA/HRS/ACC and ESC, on the management of AF and ventricular arrhythmias and highlights the key common features and discrepancies between these important documents.

Atrial fibrillation — electrical and pharmacological cardioversion overview is described as follows: Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is a mode of acute rhythm control and can be achieved electrically or pharmacologically. Electrical cardioversion, given rapidity and efficacy, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, and cardioversion should also be considered for hemodynamically stable AF intolerant of atrioventricular dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, or unable to achieve adequate rate control. In stable AF, both electrical and pharmacological cardioversion are acceptable, safe, and efficacious; electrical cardioversion is more effective than pharmacological cardioversion alone but involves the trade-off of anesthesia or sedation. Thromboembolic risks and considerations for anticoagulation apply to both pharmacological and electrical cardioversion.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF)–associated bradycardia in adults after cardiac surgery commonly occurs, with a peak incidence 2 to 4 days postoperatively and an overall incidence ranging from 10% to 65%. Bradycardia may present as slow ventricular response during AF or as prolonged sinus pauses after sinus rhythm is restored; a slow and regular ventricular response during AF usually indicates complete heart block, and pacing may be required if resolution does not occur. In general, bradyarrhythmias in the setting of postoperative AF should be treated similarly to those occurring in the nonoperative setting, and a period of watchful waiting rather than early PPM implantation is generally used; in occasional patients with refractory AF with rapid ventricular responses associated with significant SND limiting rate control drugs, a PPM may be required for adequate AF management.

### Practice implications of the atrial fibrillation guidelines [^69a61efe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^192f04b1]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Device therapy and management of advanced heart failure

Cardiac resynchronization therapy decreases mortality and prevents hospitalizations in patients with symptomatic HF, LVEF ≤ 35%, and QRS duration ≥ 120 ms. Between 25 and 50% of patients eligible for CRT have AF, although patients with AF are not well represented in randomized trials of CRT. At present, CRT is a class IIa recommended therapy in patients with HF and concomitant AF. Loss of AV synchrony and rapid ventricular rates in AF may impair benefit from CRT and small studies have suggested that the beneficial effect is rather due to AV node ablation. A meta-analysis of 23 observational studies including 7495 recipients suggests that patients with AF have a higher rate of non-response to CRT (35 vs. 28%, P = 0.001). Recent data from 8951 patients with AF and HF in the US NCDR registry demonstrated that CRT-D therapy was associated with lower mortality, all-cause, and HF readmissions compared with ICD therapy alone. Thus while response rates are lower in patients with AF, CRT should still be pursued in appropriate patients and every attempt should be made to ensure aggressive rate control. This is important to ensure biventricular pacing is as close to 100% as possible, and avoid inappropriate shocks. AV node ablation should be considered in cases of tachycardia refractory to medical therapy.

Patients with HFrEF and AF often present unique challenges when implanted pump-support is required. Increased hospitalization and mortality have been observed in patients with the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device (adjusted HR for persistent AF 3.54; 95% CI 1.52–8.25; P < 0.01), with more frequent thromboembolic events in AF despite higher INR.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — supportive management of postoperative AF (POAF) after noncardiac surgery notes that postoperative pain, anemia, electrolyte imbalance, fluid shifts, and sepsis can contribute to new-onset POAF and a rapid ventricular response, and aggressive management of these triggers is essential. Hemodynamically stable patients with POAF may require specific therapy to achieve an optimal heart rate (< 110 bpm). Medications that block atrioventricular nodal conduction, such as beta blockers or CCBs, can be used for ventricular rate control, and digoxin can be considered as an adjunct or if other agents are contraindicated. Among patients with AF refractory to rate control with atrioventricular nodal blockers, rhythm control with synchronized electrical direct current cardioversion or pharmacological cardioversion with antiarrhythmic drugs can be considered. Exclusion of left atrial appendage thrombus before implementing rhythm control may be indicated in patients with a prolonged duration (> 48 hours) of AF or in patients at high risk for thromboembolism. Synchronized direct current cardioversion is recommended for hemodynamically unstable AF with a rapid ventricular response associated with hypotension.

In the absence of preexcitation, intravenous beta blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, or propranolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are recommended to slow the ventricular response to AF in the acute setting, with caution in hypotension or heart failure (HF) (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous digoxin or amiodarone is recommended to control heart rate in patients with AF and HF without an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). For patients with activity-related AF symptoms, adequacy of rate control should be assessed during exercise and pharmacological treatment adjusted to keep the rate in the physiologic range (Level of Evidence: C). Oral digoxin is effective to control resting heart rate in AF and is indicated for HF, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or sedentary individuals (Level of Evidence: C).

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and syncope — In patients with AF, GDMT is recommended and listed as "I C-EO". AF can be associated with syncope, but as with other forms of SVT, syncope from a rapid ventricular response (in the absence of preexcitation) is relatively unusual. Patients with chronic AF merit control of the ventricular response or maintenance of sinus rhythm with appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy (in carefully selected patients). Patients with paroxysmal AF are predisposed to an abnormal neural response during both sinus rhythm and arrhythmia, and the onset of AF may trigger vasovagal syncope (VVS). In patients with sinus node dysfunction, syncope could occur upon termination of AF when prolonged pauses are present.

### Early and comprehensive management of atrial fibrillation: executive summary of the proceedings from the 2nd AFNET-EHRA consensus conference' research perspectives in AF' [^66c8ace4]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) causes important mortality and morbidity on a population-level. So far, we do not have the means to prevent AF or AF-related complications adequately. Therefore, over 70 experts on atrial fibrillation convened for the 2nd AFNET/EHRA consensus conference to suggest directions for research to improve management of AF patients (Appendix 1). The group defined three main areas in need for research in AF: 1. better understanding of the mechanisms of AF; 2. Improving rhythm control monitoring and management; and 3. comprehensive cardiovascular risk management in AF patients. The group put forward the hypothesis that successful therapy of AF and its associated complications will require comprehensive therapy. This applies e.g. to the "old" debate of "rate versus rhythm control", since rhythm control is generally added to underlying (continued) rate control therapy, but also to the emerging debate of "antiarrhythmic drugs versus catheter ablation", of which both may be needed in most patients to maintain sinus rhythm, but also to therapy of conditions that predispose to AF and contribute to cardiovascular complications such as stroke, cognitive decline, heart failure, and acute coronary syndromes. We call for research initiatives aiming at a better understanding of the different causes of AF and its complications, and at development and validation of mechanism-based therapies. The future of AF therapy may require a combination of management of underlying and concomitant conditions, early and comprehensive rhythm control therapy, adequate control of ventricular rate and cardiac function, and continuous therapy to prevent AF-associated complications (e.g. antithrombotic therapy). The reasons for these suggestions are detailed in this paper.

### Analysis of current management of atrial fibrillation in the acute setting: GEFAUR-1 study [^f72cac46]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Limited information relative to the management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department (ED) daily practice is available. This study evaluates current management of atrial fibrillation in this setting to identify areas for practice improvement.

Methods

This was a prospective multicenter observational study carried out in 12 EDs. Adults in whom atrial fibrillation was demonstrated in an ECG obtained in the ED were included. Clinical variables and atrial fibrillation management in the ED were prospectively collected by the treating physicians using a standardized questionnaire. Patients with rapid ventricular response (> 100 beats/min) were considered eligible for rate control, and patients with recent-onset episodes (< 48 hours) were eligible for rhythm control.

Results

Of 1,178 patients, 41% presented with a rapid ventricular response and 21% had recent-onset episodes. Rhythm control was attempted in 42% of eligible patients, with antiarrhythmic drugs in 88% of cases (I-C drugs in 44% of patients; amiodarone in 43% of patients). Overall effectiveness of pharmacologic cardioversion was 63% (amiodarone 54.5%, flecainide 93%), whereas electrocardioversion was effective in 87.5% of cases. Rate control was performed in 68.3% of eligible patients (overall effectiveness 47.8%); digoxin was used in 67% of cases (effectiveness 45%). Both strategies were selected in 4.5% of cases, whereas no treatment for atrial fibrillation was performed in 60% of patients.

Conclusion

In our ED population, rate-control effectiveness is poor and rhythm control is not attempted in most recent-onset episodes. Methods to improve rate-control effectiveness, the selection of patients for rhythm control, and the use of electrocardioversion appear warranted.

Atrial fibrillation is the arrhythmia most commonly encountered in family practice. Serious complications can include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Initial treatment is directed at controlling the ventricular rate, most often with a calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or digoxin. Medical or electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is the next step in patients who remain in atrial fibrillation. Heparin should be administered to hospitalized patients undergoing medical or electrical cardioversion. Anticoagulation with warfarin should be used for three weeks before elective cardioversion and continued for four weeks after cardioversion. The recommendations provided in this two-part article are consistent with guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

### Atrial fibrillation (chronic) [^9d111a24]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterised by the presence of fast and uncoordinated atrial activation leading to reduced atrial mechanical function. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, male sex, co-existing cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and co-existing infection.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral medical treatments to control heart rate in people with chronic (defined as longer than 1 week for this review) non-valvular atrial fibrillation? What is the effect of different treatment strategies (rate versus rhythm) for people with persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 23 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta-blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (rate-limiting), digoxin, and rate versus rhythm control strategies.

Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) — early postprocedural sudden death risk and mitigation — Early observational studies showed a concerning incidence of sudden death after AVNA in 3% to 7% of patients, linked to ventricular fibrillation (VF) predominantly due to bradycardia, QT prolongation, and heterogeneity of repolarization, with initiation often pause dependent or occurring during a relatively slow pacing rate. Deaths due to malignant arrhythmias have been minimized by protocols specifying higher lower-rate pacing in the early postprocedure period, followed by lower rate adjustment over several weeks.

### Rhythm control versus rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: insights from get with the guidelines-heart failure [^7d74af7c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for one half of all heart failure (HF) visits and hospital admissions in the United States. Patients with HFpEF have similar risks of morbidity and all‐cause mortality as patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). 1, 2 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in patients with HF, occurring in approximately one third of patients. 3, 4, 5, 6 In patients with HFpEF, the prevalence of AF ranges from 15% to 41% in registries and clinical trials. 6

Patients with HF and AF have worse outcomes than patients with HF without AF. 7 The HF guidelines focus their recommendations on prevention of thromboembolism and symptom control with the goal to correct underlying causes of AF and HF and optimize HF management. The guidelines then differentiate patients who develop HF as a result of AF and patients who have HF and go on to develop AF. 8 Patients with newly diagnosed HF in the presence of AF with rapid ventricular response are recommended to undergo rhythm control, as a rate‐related cardiomyopathy is a reversible cause of HF. There is no other specific recommendation for rate versus rhythm control in the HF guidelines. 8 The AF guidelines recommend rhythm control only in patients who remain symptomatic despite rate control treatment. 9 A recent meta‐analysis revealed that all‐cause mortality is significantly higher in patients with AF and HFrEF compared with patients with AF and HFpEF, yet stroke risk and HF hospitalization rates were similar among both groups. 10 Similar comparisons in the GWTG‐HF (Get With The Guidelines — Heart Failure) registry extends these prior findings, demonstrating that AF is common in patients with HF and associated with higher mortality, readmissions, and HF readmissions. 11

HFpEF and AF have shared risk factors, confer increased risks for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and frequently occur together. 6, 12 Despite accumulating epidemiologic data detailing worse outcomes in patients with HFpEF complicated by AF, there are no medical therapies that have been definitively shown to improve outcomes for patients with HFpEF. As a result, the guideline writing committees limit their scope to treatment of associated comorbidities. 8, 13, 14, 15, 16 To describe current treatment patterns and subsequent outcomes in patients with HFpEF complicated by AF, we analyzed the GWTG‐HF registry linked to Medicare claims data.

### Controversies in atrial fibrillation [^dd73c500]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and contributes greatly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of the management of atrial fibrillation remain controversial. We address nine specific controversies in atrial fibrillation management, briefly focusing on the relations between mechanisms and therapy, the roles of rhythm and rate control, the definition of optimum rate control, the need for early cardioversion to prevent remodelling, the comparison of electrical with pharmacological cardioversion, the selection of patients for long-term oral anticoagulation, the roles of novel long-term anticoagulation approaches and ablation therapy, and the potential usefulness of upstream therapy targeting substrate development. The background of every controversy is reviewed and our opinions expressed. Here, we hope to inform physicians about the most important controversies in this specialty and stimulate investigators to address unresolved issues.

### Differentiating left atrial pressure responses in paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation: implications for diagnosing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and managing atrial fibrillation [^2bc4ef27]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Left Atrial Pressure Dynamics in Response to Pacing and Isoproterenol Infusion

The LAP‐peak serves as an indicator of left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure and represents the physiological left ventricular filling pressure. This pressure is affected by various factors, including volume status, systolic and diastolic function, chamber thickness, and elasticity. Consequently, the LAP‐peak might be influenced by both the dynamic pressure exerted during left ventricular filling and chronic left atrial stiffness or fibrosis.

In our study, we observed an increase in LAP‐peak with an elevated pacing HR from 90 to 120 bpm, whereas a decrease was noted with isoproterenol infusion across the same HR range. These findings align with those reported in a prior small cohort study. The underlying mechanism involves the modulation of LAP via right atrial pacing, which alters LV diastolic filling time without changing LV distensibility, and the effects of isoproterenol, a β‐agonist that enhances LV diastolic distensibility. The LAP response to isoproterenol infusion mirrors the effects of β‐agonist, thus resembling physiological tachycardia, whereas the response to right atrial pacing reflects changes induced by tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia. However, it is important to note that rapid right atrial pacing may not accurately reflect the hemodynamic conditions present during AF with rapid ventricular responses due to differences in AV synchrony, as the loss of AV synchrony in AF with rapid ventricular responses can lead to a more pronounced increase in LAP compared with rapid right atrial pacing at the same ventricular rate. Future studies should consider methods to standardize LAP measurements across different HRs and rhythms to allow for direct comparisons between AF with rapid ventricular responses and rapid right atrial pacing.

DISCUSSION

In this prospective cohort study of 1369 participants undergoing AFCA, we investigated the relationship between LAP and AF types, with specific focus on PAF and PeAF. Notably, patients with PAF exhibited significantly lower LAP‐peak at the baseline pacing rate compared with those with PeAF, a consistent finding across various H₂FPEF score subgroups. These findings highlight a potential limitation of the current H₂FPEF scoring system, which does not differentiate between PAF and PeAF when calculating the probability of HFpEF presence. Furthermore, the patterns of LAP‐peak responses to rapid atrial pacing and isoproterenol infusion differed markedly between the 2 groups. In patients with PAF, there was a more pronounced change in the LAP‐peak between 90 and 120 bpm during pacing. This marked variation in the LAP‐peak may explain why patients with PAF often experience more intense symptoms, particularly during episodes of rapid ventricular response in AF. An overview of the study findings is represented in Figure 6.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence — randomized trials of acute rate control report the following quantitative results: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during AF and AFL, seventeen of the 23 patients (74%) receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 hours. In another randomized clinical trial of intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for ventricular rate control, at 24 hours, rate control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%), and the percentage who achieved rate control was higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). In a randomized, parallel, open-label study of esmolol versus verapamil in acute AF or AFL, fifty percent of esmolol-treated patients with new onset of arrhythmias converted to sinus rhythm, whereas only 12% of those who received verapamil converted, with mild hypotension observed in both treatment groups.

Suppression of atrial fibrillation through pacing — several studies have examined atrial pacing, either in the right atrium (RA) alone or at more than one atrial location, to prevent recurrent paroxysmal AF; in symptomatic bradycardia, the risk of AF is lower with atrial than with ventricular pacing; in sinus node dysfunction with normal atrioventricular conduction, randomized trial data support atrial or dual-chamber rather than ventricular pacing for prevention of AF.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) has gained increasing attention owing to its rising incidence in recent years. Exacerbation of AF symptoms has become a significant concern alongside the deterioration of clinical outcomes such as stroke, systemic embolism, and heart failure. These symptoms manifest in various forms including palpitations, exertional dyspnea, chest discomfort, fatigue, and weakness in patients with AF and constitute common manifestations.

AF can be categorized as paroxysmal AF (PAF), persistent AF (PeAF), or permanent AF based on the burden of AF. Contrary to intuitive expectations, previous studies have indicated that patients with PAF may report more severe symptoms than those with PeAF. These symptoms are mainly related to rapid ventricular responses to AF, and medications aimed at controlling tachyarrhythmias have been found to alleviate these AF‐related symptoms. Conversely, for patients with PeAF, a relatively weak correlation was observed between AF symptoms and heart rate (HR). A greater reduction in HR may be necessary to meaningfully alleviate symptoms in this patient group. However, the precise mechanism behind this phenomenon is yet to be clearly understood.

Dyspnea associated with AF or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is attributed to pulmonary edema resulting from increased left ventricular filling pressure; this is often assessed in terms of left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure. Within this framework, the H₂FPEF score estimating the probability of HFpEF was developed based on the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, while closely approximating left atrial pressure (LAP). Tachycardia significantly influences LAP levels and their fluctuations, thereby exacerbating dyspnea in patients with AF. Therefore, understanding the relationship between LAP changes and tachycardia is critical for elucidating the mechanism underlying varying dyspnea in patients with AF according to AF type, particularly during episodes of rapid ventricular response or under physiological conditions, such as adrenergic stimulation and exercise.

This prospective study focused on a cohort undergoing AF catheter ablation (AFCA) and aimed to directly measure and compare LAP across different types of AF, a range of H₂FPEF scores, and in response to LAP changes triggered by various tachycardia mechanisms, including right atrial pacing and isoproterenol infusion. This study was conducted by indirectly inferring the potential existence of HFpEF and dyspnea symptoms using LAP and H₂FPEF scores.

### Rate-responsive pacing and atrial high rate episodes in cardiac resynchronization therapy patients: is low heart rate the key? [^b2477bb1]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cardiac resynchronization (CRT) is a well‐established therapy for symptomatic heart failure (HF) patients with systolic dysfunction and prolonged QRS. 1, 2 Although implantable CRT devices provide a complete set of pacing options beyond atrio‐biventricular synchronization including rate‐responsiveness (RR), landmark CRT trials were conducted with 30 to 40 bpm lower rate programming to ensure persistent atrial sensing and actual atrial‐tracking (VDD) working mode, as per the EHRA/HRS experts statement. 3 Bernheim et al highlighted that in CRT patients atrial pacing should be avoided to ensure optimal interatrial and atrio‐ventricular synchrony, therefore the role of atrial pacing and RR function in CRT patients is unclear. 4 This impacts on optimization of device programming, and on medical therapy titration, since an important target of medical therapy in HF is to lower the heart rate, although chronotropic response may be depressed. Indeed, β‐blockers up‐titration and ivabradine addition to lower the heart rate below 60 bpm at rest is mandatory to reach optimized medical therapy, on top of which CRT is recommended. 5, 6 The prevalence of sinus node disease, that prevents β‐blockers use, in HF patients is extremely low, as to be unreported in CRT landmark trials and in current guidelines. 1, 2, 6 One single randomized trial comparing RR atrio‐biventricular pacing to atrial‐tracking modes in unselected CRT recipients yielded neutral results in terms of mortality and HF events, 7 yet, RR function may benefit specific HF patients' subgroups with very limited heart rate variability and poor rate increase in daily‐life activity, 8 meaning that this point deserves further investigation. Atrial pacing can prevent atrial fibrillation in sinus node disease patients, whereas no effect on atrial fibrillation has been demonstrated in other settings, as HF. Atrial fibrillation may be a major complication in HF patients, being a well‐known negative prognostic factor associated to increased mortality and HF progression. 9 Modern technologies of remote monitoring (RM) of implantable devices offer an extremely powerful tool to monitor atrial fibrillation and easily provide a detailed documentation of arrhythmia duration and clinical complications. In fact, RM is recommended for early detection and quantification of atrial fibrillation, 10 especially in CRT patients because it causes loss of therapy. In our analysis, we used RM in CRT recipients to investigate the association between atrial RR and the incidence of device‐detected atrial arrhythmias, namely, atrial high rate episodes (AHREs). An effort was made to assess whether any observed effect of RR function should be ascribed to atrial pacing itself or to the increased heart rate related to RR.

Cardiac arrhythmias

There is fairly uniform practice with respect to managing cardiac arrhythmias with serious arrhythmias being uncommon. Sinus tachycardia is to be expected and a new baseline acceptable heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute is generally recorded in the standing orders along with a directive against the use of beta blockers. The rate typically increases after each IL-2 dose, peaks at 2–4 hours and returns to baseline prior to the next dose. It is a compensatory response to hypotension, but is also a consequence of secondary cytokine and stress related epinephrine release and fever. It is important to distinguish the cause in order to avoid unnecessary fluid boluses. The tachycardia seems to become more pronounced and prolonged with an increased number of doses. It usually resolves over time between doses and is back to baseline before the next dose. Some centers extend the time between doses to allow recovery and others hold a dose until the next scheduled administration time.

Isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are not a contraindication to continued IL-2 dosing, but if the frequency increases (above 10/min), or patterns such as quadrigeminy or couplets or greater arise, holding IL-2 doses until recovery may be necessary. Less common cardiac arrhythmias requiring immediate intervention include supraventricular tachycardia with rapid response, atrial fibrillation with rapid response, and ventricular tachycardia. Patients may continue IL-2, if SVT or atrial fibrillation are converted/controlled, sinus rhythm is maintained or heart rate is controlled and there are no signs of cardiac damage. Ventricular tachycardia requires evaluation for cardiac damage and is an absolute contraindication to more IL-2. Rarely, evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis is noted clinically or on an EKG. This may reflect lymphocytic infiltration. If concerns exist regarding myocarditis or ischemia, then cardiac enzymes or troponin should be monitored at least daily and IL-2 discontinued if confirmed.

### Prevention and management of chronic heart failure with electrical therapy [^9b4252c5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death is responsible for > 40% of patients with heart failure losing their lives. Thus, the prevention of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias is a major goal in the management of heart failure. In several randomized clinical trials, electrical therapy with the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has proved superior to medical antiarrhythmic therapy in both the secondary and primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with reduced left ventricular function. In addition to the severity of left ventricular dysfunction, the etiology of the cardiomyopathy appears to be a determinant in the benefit derived from this form of electrical therapy. Whereas patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy clearly show improved survival with ICD therapy, outcome data in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy are less convincing. The major challenge lies in the risk stratification of patients with heart failure for arrhythmic death. Catheter ablation is another form of electrical therapy that can help in the treatment of patients with heart failure. In patients with a tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy because of drug-refractory atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, catheter ablation of the atrioventricular node and pacemaker implantation can effectively restore a physiologic heart rate, often with dramatic regression of left ventricular dysfunction. In patients with frequent ICD therapies because of frequent recurrences of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia can be an effective adjunctive therapy. New catheter ablation techniques and new atrial pacing algorithms can also significantly reduce the atrial fibrillation burden in patients with heart failure who are particularly susceptible to decompensation because of atrial fibrillation. Pacing for hemodynamic benefit in heart failure has evolved from dual-chamber pacing modes with optimized atrioventricular delay to biventricular pacing resulting in cardiac resynchronization. This new treatment modality for advanced heart failure has been shown to result in significant symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement.

### Atrial fibrillation pathophysiology: implications for management [^a7425c13]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is an important contributor to population morbidity and mortality. An arrhythmia that is particularly common in the elderly, AF is growing in prevalence with the aging of the population. Our understanding of the basic mechanisms that govern AF occurrence and persistence has been increasing rapidly. This article reviews the basic pathophysiology of AF over a broad range of levels, touching on the tissue mechanisms that maintain the arrhythmia, the relationship between clinical presentation and basic mechanisms, ion channel and transporter abnormalities that lead to ectopic impulse formation, basic models and tissue determinants of reentry, ion channel determinants of reentry, the nature and roles of electric and structural remodeling, autonomic neural components, anatomic factors, interactions between atrial and ventricular functional consequences of AF, and the basic determinants of atrial thromboembolism. We then review the potential implications of the basic pathophysiology of the arrhythmia for its management. We first discuss consequences for improved rhythm control pharmacotherapy: targeting underlying conditions, new atrium-selective drug targets, new targets for focal ectopic source suppression, and upstream therapy aiming to prevent remodeling. We then review the implications of basic mechanistic considerations for rate control therapy, AF ablation, and the prevention of thromboembolic events. We conclude with some thoughts about the future of translational research related to AF mechanisms.

### Clinical review: clinical management of atrial fibrillation-rate control versus rhythm control [^76553cb4]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in the critically ill and is associated with adverse outcomes. Although there are plausible benefits from conversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm (the so-called 'rhythm-control' strategy), recent randomized trials have failed to demonstrate the superiority of this approach over the rate-control strategy. Regardless of approach, continuous therapeutic anticoagulation is crucial for stroke prevention. This review addresses the findings of these studies and their implications for clinical management of patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Weight-based versus non-weight-based diltiazem dosing in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^ae44bf66]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There is conflicting evidence to support the superiority of weight-based (WB) dosing of intravenous (IV) diltiazem over non-weight-based (NWB) dosing strategies in the management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

A retrospective review evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) in AFib with RVR and receiving IV diltiazem from 2015 to 2018. Those receiving a NWB dose were compared with those receiving a WB dose based on actual body weight (ABW). Secondary analyses evaluated safety profiles of the regimens and compared response in groups defined by ABW or ideal body weight (IBW).

Results

A total of 371 patients were included in the analysis. No significant difference was observed in achieving a therapeutic response (66.5% vs. 73.1%, p = 0.18) or adverse events between the groups. Patients receiving a WB dose were significantly more likely to have a HR < 100 bpm than those receiving a NWB dose (40.9% vs. 53.5%, p = 0.01). When groups were defined by IBW, WB dosing was associated with a significantly higher incidence of achieving a therapeutic response (62.7% vs. 74.3%, p = 0.02).

Conclusion

In patients presenting with AF with RVR, there was no significant difference in achieving a therapeutic response between the two strategies. A WB dosing approach did result in a greater proportion of patients with a HR < 100 bpm. The utilization of IBW for WB dosing may result in an increased achievement of a therapeutic response.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — persistent AF may worsen myocardial function, and early rhythm control may improve outcomes: it can be difficult to determine the extent of the contribution of AF to cardiomyopathy and even onset HFrEF; allowing AF to persist long term, regardless of reasonable rate control, may result in worsening HF and cardiomyopathy; an early and aggressive approach to rhythm control can reduce AF burden, resulting in favorable ventricular remodeling and halting of any occult arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy; in a prespecified analysis, early rhythm control significantly improved the composite outcome of death, stroke, or hospitalization for worsening of HF or ACS, and this was not altered by HF status; however, only 17% of the HF population had LVEF < 40%.

### Atrial fibrillation (chronic) [^e5fccc81]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, which is characterised by the presence of fast and uncoordinated atrial activation leading to reduced atrial mechanical function. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, coexisting cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and coexisting infection.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral medical treatments to control heart rate in people with chronic (defined as longer than 1 week for this review) non-valvular atrial fibrillation? What is the effect of different treatment strategies (rate vs. rhythm) for people with persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 18 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta-blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (rate limiting), digoxin, and rate versus rhythm control strategies.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure (HF) — rate control and rhythm strategy guidance emphasizes rate targets, agent selection, and anticoagulation. Digoxin 'slows atrioventricular conduction more effectively at rest than during exercise', while 'Beta-blockers are more effective than digoxin during exercise… and are preferred because of their favorable effects on the natural history of HF'; verapamil and diltiazem 'should be avoided', and if beta-blockers are 'ineffective or contraindicated… amiodarone may be a useful alternative'. If tachycardia persists, 'Atrioventricular nodal ablation may be needed'. For rate targets, 'every effort should be made to reduce the ventricular response to less than 80 to 90 beats per min at rest and less than 110 to 130 beats per min during moderate exercise'. For stroke prevention in this setting, 'Anticoagulation should be maintained in all patients with HF and a history of atrial fibrillation, regardless of whether sinus rhythm is achieved'. Evidence on rhythm control notes 'a total of 5032 patients in 4 separate trials' with 'no improvement in mortality or morbidity using a strategy of aggressive rhythm control'.

### Rate or rhythm control for atrial fibrillation: update and controversies [^3f15347d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased mortality and considerable morbidity, including stroke, heart failure, and diminished quality of life. Despite these adverse outcomes, rhythm control has not demonstrated benefit in clinical trials. Antiarrhythmic medications, including recently developed agents, have limited efficacy in achieving durable sinus rhythm and substantial toxicity. A rate-control strategy is therefore more attractive for minimally symptomatic patients, but younger and more symptomatic patients may benefit from restoration of sinus rhythm. Catheter ablation is more effective than medications in preventing arrhythmia recurrence, avoids adverse effects associated with antiarrhythmic drugs, and should be considered early in symptomatic patients when success is likely. However, more definitive data are needed from randomized trials assessing long-term outcomes after ablation, including stroke risk and mortality. Clinical decision tools help select the appropriate management for individual patients. Lenient rate management is easy to achieve and seems reasonably safe for certain patients, although the optimum rate varies with individual comorbidities. Because safer and more effective pharmacologic and interventional therapies are now available, an individualized approach to atrial fibrillation management is essential.
