39. Which of the following valves is affected in endocarditis?
A. Mitral stenosis
B. Mitral regurgitation
C. Mitral stenosis
D. Tricuspid regurgitation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which valve is affected in endocarditis among the given options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity of infective endocarditis and which valves it typically involves. Then, I should verify the specific options provided and whether they represent valves or lesions. Next, I will check guideline and review sources to confirm which valve is explicitly listed as a primary site of endocarditis. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent duplicates and select the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium, most often involving heart valves, and it can affect any valve, though the tricuspid valve is a classic and important site in certain populations such as people who inject drugs, patients with indwelling devices, or those with right-sided bacteremia, so I need to keep that in mind as I evaluate the choices [^4a36e33e].

> Wait, let me verify the options carefully because I initially thought there were two "mitral stenosis" entries. On closer inspection, the choices are labeled A. Mitral stenosis, B. Mitral regurgitation, C. Mitral stenosis, and D. Tricuspid regurgitation, so there is indeed a duplicate mitral stenosis and only one tricuspid option, which matters for selecting the unique correct answer.

> I will now examine which option is explicitly tied to endocarditis in the provided sources. The ACC/AHA etiologic classification of tricuspid regurgitation lists infective endocarditis as a primary cause of tricuspid regurgitation, and contemporary cohorts show endocarditis as a leading primary etiology of isolated significant tricuspid regurgitation, which directly links tricuspid valve disease to endocarditis in real-world data [^255ce9d3] [^7dd46022]. Let me also confirm clinical examples: a New England Journal of Medicine image in clinical medicine depicts severe tricuspid regurgitation from tricuspid valve endocarditis, reinforcing that the tricuspid valve is a recognized site of endocarditis involvement [^84fa6fc5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the mitral options. While infective endocarditis can certainly involve the mitral valve and cause mitral regurgitation, the question is asking which option among the listed choices is specifically identified as an endocarditis-affected valve in the provided materials, and the mitral choices here are framed as lesions (stenosis or regurgitation) rather than the valve itself, whereas the tricuspid option is the valve with regurgitation as the resulting lesion, which aligns with how the sources categorize endocarditis-related TR [^255ce9d3] [^7dd46022].

> Let me reconsider the duplicate mitral stenosis entries. Since both A and C are identical, neither offers a unique, valve-level answer distinct from the other, and neither is explicitly highlighted in the provided sources as the endocarditis-affected valve in the way tricuspid regurgitation is, so choosing between two identical mitral stenosis options would not resolve the question's intent to identify the valve implicated in endocarditis among the choices.

> I should double-check that I'm not overlooking a mitral-focused endocarditis reference in the packet. Scanning again, the clearest, repeated association with endocarditis in these materials is tricuspid regurgitation due to infective endocarditis, whereas mitral valve endocarditis is not emphasized as a unique answer choice here, so the best-supported selection remains the tricuspid option [^255ce9d3] [^7dd46022] [^84fa6fc5].

> Conclusion: Given the options and the evidence provided, the valve affected in endocarditis that is uniquely represented and explicitly linked to endocarditis in these sources is the tricuspid valve, with tricuspid regurgitation as the resulting lesion, so the correct choice is D. Tricuspid regurgitation [^255ce9d3] [^7dd46022] [^84fa6fc5].

---

The correct answer is **D. Tricuspid regurgitation**. Infective endocarditis most often affects the **left-sided valves** (mitral and aortic), but in people who inject drugs, those with pacemaker/defibrillator leads, or those with right-sided infections, the **tricuspid valve is commonly involved** [^5bace80d] [^4a36e33e]. Tricuspid regurgitation is a frequent consequence of tricuspid valve endocarditis, whereas mitral stenosis is not a typical manifestation of endocarditis [^7dd46022] [^84fa6fc5].

---

## Valves commonly affected by endocarditis

Infective endocarditis can involve any heart valve, but the **mitral and aortic valves** are most commonly affected because of their higher exposure to systemic blood flow and shear stress [^notfound]. Right-sided endocarditis is less common but occurs in specific clinical scenarios, such as intravenous drug use, pacemaker or defibrillator leads, or right-sided infections [^5bace80d].

---

## Tricuspid valve involvement in endocarditis

The tricuspid valve is the **most commonly affected right-sided valve** in infective endocarditis, particularly in the following scenarios:

- **Intravenous drug use**: Repeated injections can introduce bacteria into the venous system, leading to right-sided endocarditis [^notfound].
- **Pacemaker or defibrillator leads**: Indwelling leads can cause endothelial injury and serve as a nidus for infection [^4b31770d].
- **Right-sided infections**: Such as pneumonia or septic thrombophlebitis, can spread to the tricuspid valve [^notfound].

Tricuspid valve endocarditis often results in **tricuspid regurgitation** due to valve leaflet destruction, perforation, or chordal rupture [^notfound]. This is well-documented in clinical literature and guidelines, which consistently list infective endocarditis as a primary cause of tricuspid regurgitation [^255ce9d3] [^1f3cd54a].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting tricuspid regurgitation in endocarditis

Several studies and clinical guidelines highlight the association between infective endocarditis and tricuspid regurgitation:

- **Primary tricuspid regurgitation**: Infective endocarditis is a leading cause of primary tricuspid regurgitation, accounting for a significant proportion of cases [^7dd46022].
- **Clinical presentations**: Patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis often present with symptoms of right-sided heart failure, including peripheral edema, ascites, and hepatomegaly, due to severe tricuspid regurgitation [^5fa2edab].
- **Imaging findings**: Echocardiography commonly reveals large vegetations on the tricuspid valve, leaflet perforation, or flail leaflets, leading to severe tricuspid regurgitation [^notfound].

---

## Mitral valve involvement in endocarditis

While the mitral valve is frequently affected by endocarditis, the question specifically asks about the valve affected in endocarditis among the given options. Mitral stenosis is **not a typical manifestation** of infective endocarditis; instead, mitral regurgitation is more commonly observed due to valve leaflet destruction or chordal rupture. Therefore, options A, B, and C do not accurately represent the valve affected in endocarditis as described in the question.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **D. Tricuspid regurgitation**. Infective endocarditis commonly involves the tricuspid valve, particularly in intravenous drug users, patients with pacemaker or defibrillator leads, or those with right-sided infections. Tricuspid regurgitation is a frequent consequence of tricuspid valve endocarditis, whereas mitral stenosis is not a typical manifestation of endocarditis [^255ce9d3] [^7dd46022].

Tricuspid regurgitation — timing of intervention includes the following recommendations: In patients with severe TR (Stages C and D) undergoing left-sided valve surgery, tricuspid valve surgery is recommended. In patients with progressive TR (Stage B) undergoing left-sided valve surgery, tricuspid valve surgery can be beneficial in the context of either tricuspid annular dilation with tricuspid annulus end diastolic diameter > 4.0 cm or prior signs and symptoms of right-sided HF. In patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe primary TR (Stage D), isolated tricuspid valve surgery can be beneficial to reduce symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations. In patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe isolated secondary TR attributable to annular dilation (in the absence of pulmonary hypertension or left-sided disease) who are poorly responsive to medical therapy (Stage D), isolated tricuspid valve surgery can be beneficial to reduce symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations. In asymptomatic patients with severe primary TR (Stage C) and progressive RV dilation or systolic dysfunction, isolated tricuspid valve surgery may be considered. In patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe TR (Stage D) who have undergone previous left-sided valve surgery, reoperation with isolated tricuspid valve surgery may be considered in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension or severe RV systolic dysfunction.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous valvular disease, independently associated with excess mortality and high morbidity in all clinical contexts. TR is profoundly undertreated by surgery and is often discovered late in patients presenting with right-sided heart failure. To address the issue of undertreatment and poor clinical outcomes without intervention, numerous structural tricuspid interventional devices have been and are in development, a challenging process due to the unique anatomic and physiological characteristics of the tricuspid valve, and warranting well-designed clinical trials. The path from routine practice TR detection to appropriate TR evaluation, to conduction of clinical trials, to enriched therapeutic possibilities for improving TR access to treatment and outcomes in routine practice is complex. Therefore, this paper summarizes the key points and methods crucial to TR detection, quantitation, categorization, risk-scoring, intervention-monitoring, and outcomes evaluation, particularly of right-sided function, and to clinical trial development and conduct, for both interventional and surgical groups.

Tricuspid valve disease, and particularly tricuspid regurgitation, is a highly prevalent condition with a complex pathophysiology and long-term adverse consequences. Although historically neglected, tricuspid valve disease has gained increasing recognition, with important advances in the assessment and management of this disorder over the past 2 decades. Surgical treatment remains the standard of care, but it continues to have one of the the highest death rates among all cardiac valve-related procedures, and a broad range of patients still do not receive effective therapy for tricuspid valve disease in contemporary clinical practice. Therefore, several alternative, less-invasive technologies for treating patients with severe, native tricuspid valve disease at high surgical risk have been developed in the past decade, with promising early results. This Review summarizes key findings and highlights the latest developments in the diagnosis and management framework that are transforming clinical practice in the complex field of tricuspid valve disease.

### Mechanism and implications of the tricuspid regurgitation: from the pathophysiology to the current and future therapeutic options [^5cdcf735]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

The tricuspid valve was virtually ignored for a long time in the past. However, significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) often accompanies left-side heart valve pathology and does not always reverse with its correction. If left untreated, TR can progress and result in progressive right ventricular failure. Current guideline recommendations still hold minor differences. Nevertheless, there is a consensus to operate on patients with severe TR undergoing left-sided valve surgery (class I) or those with mild to moderate TR with a dilated annulus (≥ 40 or ≥ 21 mm², Class IIa). However, in case of the primary TR, surgical options is limited by a relatively high risk of mortality and morbidity. For these patients, new percutaneous approaches are becoming available but no long-term data are still available. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the epidemiological and pathophysiological aspects of TR, and the current and future directions of therapy.

Consequences of progressive tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular dysfunction — The development of right-sided heart failure (HF) and progressive TR is associated with increased mortality, more HF hospitalizations, and reduced quality of life, and most patients with severe TR have left-sided heart disease. Over time, with TV annular dilatation and worsening TR, the right ventricle dilates further and ultimately fails, leading to increased RV diastolic pressure. In advanced, severe TR with RV failure, the interventricular septum shifts toward the left ventricle, leading to decreased LV cavity size and restricted LV filling, further increasing the already elevated LV diastolic and pulmonary artery pressures, likely exacerbating RV-PA uncoupling. The resulting elevated left atrial and right atrial pressures can lead to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, irreversible RV failure, and death, and earlier medical and procedural management of TR is essential to avoid deleterious downstream effects, such as cardiorenal and cardiohepatic syndromes, which can exclude candidacy for advanced therapies.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) natural history and prevalence in heart failure (HF) show substantial burden across phenotypes, with the European Society of Cardiology registry reporting that the prevalence of moderate-to-severe TR is "equally distributed across HF phenotypes, ranging from 18% in HF with mildly reduced EF to 20% in HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) and 21% in HFpEF", while Viennese data suggest higher rates "33% in HFpEF and HF with mildly reduced EF, and 50% in HFrEF". In HFrEF specifically, secondary TR is "present in approximately 21% of patients with HFrEF", and progression is common as "in another series of 212 patients with HFrEF and moderate or less TR, a significant worsening of TR occurred in 22% for 5 years".

Tricuspid regurgitation supportive diagnostics — key thresholds and modalities: In patients with TR undergoing left-sided valve surgery, an annular diastolic diameter > 40 mm (or > 21 mm/m²) indicates increased risk of persistent or progressive TR after isolated mitral valve surgery. Normal RV systolic function may be defined using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion > 16 mm, tricuspid valve systolic annular velocity > 10.0 cm/s, and fractional area change > 35%; other imaging modalities such as 3D TEE, magnetic resonance imaging, and CT scan may provide more accurate information on the status of the RV.

Lack of consensus on the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has limited operative management for decades. However, emerging evidence indicates that intervening on moderate tricuspid regurgitation during concomitant cardiac surgery can be beneficial with appropriate patient selection. Furthermore, advances in transcatheter therapies have changed the landscape of managing tricuspid disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of tricuspid valve disease: current and future perspectives [^b4ebfa85]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The assessment and management of tricuspid valve disease have evolved substantially during the past several years. Whereas tricuspid stenosis is uncommon, tricuspid regurgitation is frequently encountered and is most often secondary in nature and caused by annular dilatation and leaflet tethering from adverse right ventricular remodelling in response to any of several disease processes. Non-invasive assessment of tricuspid regurgitation must define its cause and severity; advanced three-dimensional echocardiography, MRI, and CT are gaining in clinical application. The indications for tricuspid valve surgery to treat tricuspid regurgitation are related to the cause of the disorder, the context in which it is encountered, its severity, and its effects on right ventricular function. Most operations for tricuspid regurgitation are done at the time of left-sided heart valve surgery. The threshold for restrictive ring annuloplasty repair of secondary tricuspid regurgitation at the time of left-sided valve surgery has decreased over time with recognition of the risk of progressive tricuspid regurgitation and right heart failure in patients with moderate or lesser degrees of tricuspid regurgitation and tricuspid annular dilatation, as well as with appreciation of the high risks of reoperative surgery for severe tricuspid regurgitation late after left-sided valve surgery. However, many patients with unoperated severe tricuspid regurgitation are also deemed at very high or prohibitive surgical risk. Novel transcatheter therapies have begun to emerge for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation in such patients. Experience with such therapies is preliminary and further studies are needed to determine their role in the management of this disorder.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) diagnostic approach and referral — relative value of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and referral triggers are stated as follows: The physical examination is far less sensitive and specific than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for the detection and characterization of TR, and TR is often first appreciated on a TTE study done for another indication, with findings on TTE potentially discordant from those clinically detected and diuretic therapy reducing signs of congestion. Additionally, the severity of TR may wax and wane with time, necessitating longitudinal follow-up as a component of clinical decision-making. Referral to a MDT for optimization of medical and rhythm management, and assessment of candidacy for TV intervention should be considered for patients with severe TR in whom advanced treatments would not be considered futile, with emphasis on early recognition of progressive TR and prompt referral given the excess morbidity and mortality associated with late intervention in high-risk patients.

### Isolated tricuspid regurgitation: outcomes and therapeutic interventions [^fc97e4bb]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Isolated severe TR results in progressive right heart failure and adversely impacts survival. Surgery remains the only definitive treatment but is rarely performed. There are little data to guide management of isolated TR; however, surgery is reasonable in patients with right heart failure who are at low operative risk prior to the development of RV dysfunction and end-organ damage. Further research is needed to identify markers of disease progression and to aid in the optimal timing for surgical referral.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation — evaluation of right heart chambers states that the right ventricle is usually dilated in the presence of hemodynamically significant tricuspid regurgitation. The interventricular septum position produces a D-shaped left ventricle predominantly in diastole, consistent with a right ventricular volume overload pattern, whereas when tricuspid regurgitation is due to pulmonary hypertension, septal flattening is present throughout the cardiac cycle, reflecting diastolic and systolic overload of the right ventricle (a right ventricular pressure overload pattern).

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^8fba03c3]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

2020 ACC/AHA valvular heart disease — stage B medical therapy emphasizes that in early valvular heart disease (VHD) there are currently no therapies to prevent disease progression in the valve leaflets, so recommendations are directed toward patient monitoring with the intent to intervene once severe disease is present with symptoms or abnormal cardiovascular function. The document highlights inclusion gaps, noting that women and minorities often are underrepresented in clinical trials and calls for directed efforts to include all patient groups with numbers adequate to perform separate data analysis. It notes that, given the relatively low risk of intervention and improved options, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of intervention for severe asymptomatic VHD are important and in progress for some conditions, such as severe aortic stenosis (AS), and that clinical equipoise exists for asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation (AR) with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR) with normal LV function and a high likelihood of valve repair, and the role of intervention for tricuspid regurgitation (TR); long-term follow-up is needed to ensure the lifetime risks of a prosthetic valve or valve repair are balanced against any benefits attributable to earlier intervention.

### Functional tricuspid regurgitation in mitral valve disease: epidemiology and prognostic implications [^f1588dfe]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

In this review we summarize the data on epidemiology and natural history of functional tricuspid valve regurgitation as it applies to surgery for mitral valve disease. Tricuspid regurgitation in the context of mitral valve disease is frequent and is associated with substantial reduction in survival and quality of life. In many patients, the correction of left-sided cardiac lesions does not lead to resolution of tricuspid regurgitation. Significant tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve surgery portends a poor prognosis, a course that is often not altered by subsequent surgical therapy. Although a liberal approach to tricuspid annuloplasty is widely practiced, the evidence that this approach alters the natural history of functional tricuspid regurgitation is not yet available, so it is not certain how much of the negative impact of tricuspid regurgitation is causative, rather than confounding, and to what degree we will improve long-term outcomes of mitral valve surgery by liberal tricuspid annuloplasty.

### Guidelines for the standardization of adult echocardiography reporting: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^63869a4c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Echocardiography reporting — valvular regurgitation and stenosis severity qualifiers state that "These severity qualifiers are supported by well-established published parameters. Numerical grading (e.g., grade I–IV) may also be included when supported by guideline-established criteria… However, reporting numerical grades alone without the standard guideline recommended qualifiers is discouraged". The committee notes the historical use of multiple terms for less-than-mild regurgitation and explicitly states, "We recommend the use of 'trace' in place of all other 'less than mild' regurgitation descriptors". It further states, "'Trace' regurgitation of a structurally normal native valve or a prosthetic valve may be considered normal, whereas mild or greater aortic or mitral valve regurgitation should be classified as abnormal", and that for pulmonary valves "mild regurgitation may be regarded as a normal functional finding (physiologic)", with "A statement such as 'mild tricuspid regurgitation is present, which may be within normal limits', can be used in the report". For valve regurgitation, "reporting tools should include the options: no (none), trace, mild, moderate and severe", and for valve stenosis, "reporting tools should include the options: no (none), mild, moderate, severe", with "'Very severe' valve stenosis may be used when criteria are met according to established guidelines". The guideline clarifies that "'Critical' valve stenosis is not explicitly defined in major guidelines", though a lesion may be described as a "'critical result'" based on context, and that the classifications "'mild-to-moderate' and 'moderate-to-severe'… should be used sparingly when data is insufficient to assign a specific classification".

### Tricuspid regurgitation is a public health crisis [^9f1e534e]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has long been a forgotten valve disease of benign reputation. However, TR deserves higher attention and represents a growing public health crisis. Indeed, recent epidemiological data suggest that 1.6 million US residents are affected by moderate or severe TR. Furthermore, large recent cohorts demonstrate that higher degrees of TR are associated with considerable excess mortality, independent of all background clinical and hemodynamic contexts. Finally, analysis of recent cohorts also shows that > 90% of patients with moderate or severe TR are never offered surgical treatment and remain untreated. Therefore, TR is frequent, severely impacts outcomes, and is rarely treated, justifying the development of new strategies and methods for its treatment.

Table 4
Outcomes in the Total Cohort

Overall, patients with more severe TR at baseline sustained higher frequencies and cumulative incidences of the various outcomes, reaching statistical significance among those with above‐moderate TR (Table 4 and Figures 3 and 4). Likewise, patients affected by moderate TR at baseline suffered earlier, more frequent primary outcome events compared with those with below‐moderate TR. A notable exception to the aforementioned, all three TR severity groups exhibited comparable rates of moderate‐to‐severe or greater MR persistence.

Per multivariable analyses, which were based on the data of ≈95% of the original sample size (patients with complete baseline and procedural information), above‐moderate TR emerged as the sole TR threshold that was independently associated with increased risks for the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.36 [95% CI, 1.21–1.80]; P = 0.027), HF hospitalizations (HR, 1.42, [95% CI, 1.11–2.00]; P = 0.015), and the persistence of significant functional incapacitation and/or residual MR at 1 year postprocedure, translating to the primary outcome's cumulative hazard steeply rising in its presence (Table 5, Tables S1–S5, and Figure S1).

For functional tricuspid regurgitation during mitral valve repair: Put a ring on it!

Central Message

For patients with moderate or worse tricuspid regurgitation, tricuspid valve repair is safe, improves survival, and should be performed at the time of mitral valve surgery.

Functional, or secondary, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a condition that commonly accompanies mitral valve disease. Despite strong evidence for the benefit of tricuspid valve repair at the time of mitral valve surgery, adoption of concomitant tricuspid valve repair at the time of mitral valve surgery is low. Here, we provide an overview of functional TR, operative strategies to intervene on TR, and a summary of outcomes for concomitant tricuspid valve repair at the time of mitral valve surgery.

### Functional tricuspid regurgitation: a need to revise our understanding [^feef7a9f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The assessment of the etiology and severity of functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) has many limitations, especially when tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is more than severe. Instead of relying solely on TR severity, a new approach not only takes into account the severity of TR, but also pays strict attention to tricuspid annular dilation (size), the mode of tricuspid leaflet coaptation, and tricuspid leaflet tethering-factors often influenced by right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction. To simplify things, we propose a new staging system for functional tricuspid valve pathology using 3 parameters that may more accurately reflect the severity of the disease: TR severity, annular dilation, and mode of leaflet coaptation (extent of tethering). We believe that by utilizing these parameters, cardiologists and cardiac surgeons will be offered a better system for appraisal and decision-making in FTR.

### Tricuspid valve academic research consortium definitions for tricuspid regurgitation and trial endpoints [^04d0760b]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Section 2: endpoint definitions

Inherent in any discussion of endpoint definitions is the timing and duration of follow-up for each endpoint. Duration of follow-up should be long enough to allow reliable ascertainment of the effectiveness and safety of TR therapy. The timing of endpoint assessment must be considered when interpreting the periprocedural and the early and late risks and benefits of the TR therapy (Table 8). At a minimum, the occurrence of clinical outcomes should be reported in-hospital, at 30 days, and at 1 year. Common safety endpoints are frequent at the in-hospital and 30-day time points, while less common safety endpoints and device failures may be identified during longer follow-up. Premarket studies should continue follow-up through 5 years, as for other implantable devices. Imaging efficacy endpoints should be reported at postprocedure or predischarge, 30 days, and 1 year at minimum, and yearly up to 5 years in premarket studies. Powered clinical efficacy endpoints may be best assessed at a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Finally, the duration of follow-up must be sufficient to ascertain whether device durability is acceptable for the intended patient population and comparable to alternative therapies.

Timing of Events With Respect to Procedure

1 Efficacy endpoints: clinical, patient-centered, and surrogate outcomes

All-cause and cardiovascular mortality

Although cardiovascular mortality is an important contributor to total mortality in TR, differentiating between cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality may be challenging in TR patients, because right heart failure is often accompanied by cardiorenal and cardiohepatic syndromes. It is therefore recommended that all-cause mortality is used as the primary mortality endpoint in TR therapy trials.

Cardiovascular mortality can be adjudicated as a secondary endpoint given the previously mentioned considerations and subcategorized as indicated in Table 9. Noncardiovascular mortality is adjudicated only as a death clearly related to a noncardiovascular cause. Procedure or device relatedness should be ascertained in view of existing recommendations. In TR trials, relatedness to TR for both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular deaths (eg, hepatic failure, endocarditis) must also be ascertained.

Tricuspid regurgitation etiologic classification — primary versus secondary: Primary causes include rheumatic, infective endocarditis, iatrogenic (device leads, endomyocardial biopsy), congenital (e.g. Ebstein's, levotransposition of the great arteries), and other causes (e.g., trauma, carcinoid, drugs, irradiation). Secondary causes include pulmonary hypertension with RV remodeling (primary or secondary to left-sided heart disease), dilated cardiomyopathy, annular dilation (associated with AF), and RV volume overload (shunts/high output). Isolated TR is associated with AF and has LVEF > 60%, pulmonary artery systolic pressure < 50 mm Hg, and no left-sided valve disease, with normal-appearing tricuspid valve leaflets.

Valvular Heart Disease What is valvular heart disease. Valvular heart disease is when any valve in the heart has damage or is diseased. There are several causes of valve disease.
- The normal heart has four chambers and four valves.
- The mitral valve, also called the bicuspid valve, allows blood to flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle.
- The tricuspid valve allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle.
- The aortic valve allows blood to flow from the left ventricle to the aorta.
- The pulmonary valve allows blood to flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. The valves open and close to control or regulate the blood flowing into the heart and then away from the heart. Three of the heart valves are composed of three leaflets or flaps that work together to open and close to allow blood to flow across the opening. The mitral valve only has two leaflets.

regurgitation. If this happens, blood leaks back into the chamber that it came from and not enough blood can be pushed forward through the heart. The other common type of heart valve condition happens when the opening of the valve is narrowed and stiff and the valve is not able to open fully when blood is trying to pass through; this is called. 1 Rheumatic heart diseasemost commonly affects the mitral valve or the aortic valve, but any valve can be affected, and more than one can be involved. Bicuspid aortic valve happens in about 1% to 2% of the population and is more common among men.
- High blood pressure.
- A heart attack, which can damage the muscles that control the opening and closing of the valve.
- **Other**:
- Autoimmune disease, such as lupus.
- Marfan syndrome, a disease of connective tissue that can affect heart valves.
- Exposure to high-dose radiation, which may lead to calcium deposits on the valve.
- The aging process, which can cause calcium deposits to develop on the heart valves, making them stiff or thickened and less efficient with age.

### The tricuspid valve: current perspective and evolving management of tricuspid regurgitation [^ebd89403]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular specialists have entered an era of renewed interest and enthusiasm surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of valvular heart disease, driven in part by emerging percutaneous therapies for the treatment of aortic, pulmonic, and mitral valve disease. Despite this wave of investigation, little or no attention has been given to the treatment of tricuspid valve disease. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) occurs mainly from tricuspid annular dilation, which can result from left-sided heart failure from myocardial or valvular causes, right ventricular volume and pressure overload, or dilation of cardiac chambers. If untreated at the time of surgical mitral valve repair, significant residual TR negatively impacts perioperative outcomes, functional class, and survival. TR does not reliably resolve after successful mitral valve surgery. If present at the time of mitral valve surgery, TR can usually be effectively addressed with ring annuloplasty. Because reoperations for recurrent TR carry high mortality rates, few patients are offered reoperation for redo tricuspid repair or replacement. As transcatheter therapies for mitral regurgitation arise, parallel percutaneous approaches for TR may be necessary. In this article, we review the anatomy, pathophysiology, and value of mechanical correction of TR, including potential transcatheter therapies for TR.

### Survival outcomes in isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation according to therapeutic modalities: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3fbfedf9]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this study highlight the substantial long-term mortality risk associated with isolated severe TR. While selection bias (such as right ventricular dysfunction or heart failure) could not be accounted for, invasive management, through either percutaneous or surgical interventions, does not seem to be associated with lower mortality rates compared with medical management in this meta-analysis. Further research is warranted to refine patient selection criteria and optimise therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes in the management of isolated TR.

This study demonstrated that increasing EI at end‐diastole was independently associated with worse prognosis in patients with severe TR. Furthermore, this study identified worse outcomes of severe TR patients with D‐LV defined as EI ≥ 1.2 at end‐diastole compared with those without. Adding EI measurement to the clinical assessment may provide additional value for the management and treatment decisions of patients with severe TR.

### Long-term clinical outcomes in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation [^07c62118]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common echocardiographic finding, and it is encountered in 70% to 90% of the general population. TR has been believed to be a benign disease as it is often asymptomatic and can be managed conservatively with treatments such as diuretic therapy. However, it can sometimes cause right‐sided heart failure and require surgical or catheter intervention. Recent studies demonstrated that increased TR severity was associated with higher mortality. Although surgical mortality can be adversely affected by delayed surgical intervention, the optimal timing of intervention for TR remains controversial. A recent study also reported that the prognosis of surgically treated moderate or greater TR did not differ significantly from that treated using medical therapy. Thus, the natural history and risk factors associated with poor outcomes in isolated severe TR remain understudied. Therefore, we aimed to determine the long‐term clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with poor prognosis in patients with isolated severe TR to determine the optimal timing for intervention.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiographic examination in adults: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^0bd251cd]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Tricuspid valve (TV) inflow and tricuspid regurgitation — Forward flow velocities across the TV should be recorded through at least one respiratory cycle with PW Doppler, and the normal flow is diastolic with E and A waves. Using PW Doppler, a 1- to 3-mm sample volume should be positioned at the tips of the open valve leaflets in diastole. Measuring and reporting peak velocities across the TV is not considered a routine measurement, and current guidelines suggest a measurement either at expiration or averaged across an entire respiratory cycle. If TV regurgitation is present, CW Doppler should be used to obtain the peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity for assessment of RV systolic pressure; the maximum jet is variable and may be obtained from PLAX, PSAX, A4C, apical RV-focused, or SC four-chamber views. Weak signals may be enhanced using UEAs, but if after the use of contrast agents the signal is still weak and/or incomplete, the measurement should not be reported; the highest velocity and view from a good-quality signal should be reported in the final calculation and lower velocity data from other views should be edited out.

There is growing evidence that severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) impacts clinical outcomes in a variety of cardiovascular disease states. The late presentation of patients with advanced TR highlights the underappreciation of the disease, as well as the pitfalls of current guideline-directed medical management.

In this review, we explore the physiology of TR, discuss the etiologic classes of TR, and explore the transcatheter options for treatment and who might benefit from device therapy.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) etiology classification — adopted system, mechanisms, and key etiologies are summarized as follows: A detailed TR etiology classification system adopted by European societies and the Tricuspid Valve Academic Research Consortium lists 1) primary TR; 2) secondary TR with subclassifications of atrial secondary TR (A-STR) and ventricular secondary TR (V-STR); and 3) CIED-related causative and incidental TR. V-STR develops because of right ventricular (RV) dilation and/or dysfunction that leads to lateral or apical displacement of the papillary muscles, resulting in tricuspid valve (TV) leaflet tethering, with contributing processes including left-sided valvular or ventricular disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and primary RV cardiomyopathies, while the morphologic features of A-STR include marked right atrial (RA) and tricuspid annulus (TA) dilation. Table 1 lists etiologies for primary TR (degenerative [prolapse, flail], infective endocarditis, trauma to the chest wall or leaflets, Ebstein anomaly, carcinoid disease, mediastinal radiation, rheumatic disease), V-STR PH-related causes (LV systolic dysfunction or left-sided valve disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic lung disease, chronic pulmonary thromboembolic disease, intracardiac shunt), A-STR (atrial arrhythmia, HFpEF), and CIED-related TR (direct interaction of the lead with the TV leaflets or subvalvular apparatus; CIED present but not the direct cause of TR).

### Surgical strategies for functional tricuspid regurgitation [^08f7e0e2]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Functional or secondary tricuspid regurgitation commonly is found in the setting of left-sided heart disease and, when severe, is associated with substantially poorer functional outcomes and survival if untreated. The traditional view that functional tricuspid regurgitation generally resolves with surgical correction of the primary lesions is no longer held. Data showing late development of severe tricuspid regurgitation in patients with mild regurgitation at time of mitral valve surgery have heralded a new era of aggressive intervention on the tricuspid valve. Tricuspid ring annuloplasty can be performed with minimal incremental morbidity and negligible additional mortality. Therefore, in addition to patients with severe regurgitation, annuloplasty is now also recommended for patients with risk factors for developing late tricuspid insufficiency (typically patients with moderate tricuspid regurgitation or severe annular dilation at time of left-sided cardiac procedures). In this work we review the current indications for tricuspid valve repair in patients undergoing other cardiac surgery operations and also the various options available to the surgeon.

Hospitalization endpoints

TR and right heart failure are associated with a high hospitalization rate. As per the Heart Failure Collaboratory and Academic Research Consortium, trials should report both all-cause hospitalizations as well as cardiovascular and heart failure hospitalizations (Table 10). Hospitalizations should also be adjudicated as valve (both native or device) and/or procedure-related. Particularly in the COVID-19 era, it should be recognized that heart failure may be treated more aggressively in the outpatient setting (including ED visits) with either intravenous or more intense oral diuretics. In the PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial such "heart failure hospitalization equivalent" events had similar prognostic implications for both total and cardiovascular mortality as traditional inpatient hospitalizations. Including these events as heart failure events controls for variability between sites in threshold for hospitalization and increases the power of studies by increasing the number of events.

Tricuspid regurgitation and right-sided valvular disease in left heart disease — evaluation and caution. Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with volume overload, increased RV workload leading to RV dysfunction, and PH deterioration in valvular disease and in HFpEF/LHD. Transcatheter TR interventions aim to reduce TR and RV volume overload, but correcting TR in patients with PH or PH in (non-valvular) LHD with significantly elevated PVR and/or RV dysfunction must be undertaken with great caution as it may be hazardous. Right ventricle–pulmonary artery coupling independently predicts all-cause mortality in such patients, and careful patient selection plus comprehensive imaging and invasive haemodynamic assessment are necessary because echocardiography underestimates sPAP in severe TR.

### Concomitant tricuspid repair in patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation [^2dad57b3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tricuspid regurgitation is common in patients with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation. However, the evidence base is insufficient to inform a decision about whether to perform tricuspid-valve repair during mitral-valve surgery in patients who have moderate tricuspid regurgitation or less-than-moderate regurgitation with annular dilatation.

Methods

We randomly assigned 401 patients who were undergoing mitral-valve surgery for degenerative mitral regurgitation to receive a procedure with or without tricuspid annuloplasty (TA). The primary 2-year end point was a composite of reoperation for tricuspid regurgitation, progression of tricuspid regurgitation by two grades from baseline or the presence of severe tricuspid regurgitation, or death.

Results

Patients who underwent mitral-valve surgery plus TA had fewer primary-end-point events than those who underwent mitral-valve surgery alone (3.9% vs. 10.2%) (relative risk, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16 to 0.86; P = 0.02). Two-year mortality was 3.2% in the surgery-plus-TA group and 4.5% in the surgery-alone group (relative risk, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.25 to 1.88). The 2-year prevalence of progression of tricuspid regurgitation was lower in the surgery-plus-TA group than in the surgery-alone group (0.6% vs. 6.1%; relative risk, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.69). The frequencies of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, functional status, and quality of life were similar in the two groups at 2 years, although the incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation was higher in the surgery-plus-TA group than in the surgery-alone group (14.1% vs. 2.5%; rate ratio, 5.75; 95% CI, 2.27 to 14.60).

Conclusions

Among patients undergoing mitral-valve surgery, those who also received TA had a lower incidence of a primary-end-point event than those who underwent mitral-valve surgery alone at 2 years, a reduction that was driven by less frequent progression to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Tricuspid repair resulted in more frequent permanent pacemaker implantation. Whether reduced progression of tricuspid regurgitation results in long-term clinical benefit can be determined only with longer follow-up.

### Comparison of outcomes between transcatheter tricuspid valve repair and surgical tricuspid valve replacement or repair in patients with tricuspid insufficiency [^3433fc5e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is observed in 0.55% of the general population and its prevalence increases with age, affecting about 4% of the patients aged 75 years or more, approximately 1.6 million people in the United States and 3 million people in Europe with clinically relevant tricuspid regurgitation. There is increasing evidence demonstrates that tricuspid regurgitation is not only a marker of concurrent cardiac disease, but also a potential driver of major adverse cardiovascular events.

At present, few treatment options exist for tricuspid regurgitation, patients with mild or moderate TR are often treated conservatively with medical therapies. Surgeries such as surgical tricuspid valve replacement (STVR) or surgical tricuspid valve repair (STVr) are considered more definitive treatment in patients with severe TR. However, evidence shows that tricuspid valve surgery with a peri-operative mortality rate of 8–10%, and STVR is at risk for biological valvular degeneration, thrombosis, and long-term anticoagulation of mechanical valves, and the risk of reoperation increased in STVr.

Therefore, minimally invasive catheter therapy could effectively reduce tricuspid regurgitation and lower the risk of perioperative complications. In recent years, various minimally invasive catheter techniques have been applied to reduce tricuspid regurgitation. For example, annular reduction procedures had shown a promising in reducing tricuspid regurgitation and had clinical benefits for tricuspid regurgitation patients. Because leaflet malcoaptation is the main pathology of tricuspid regurgitation, the edge-edge clip technique, which is used to treat functional mitral regurgitation, has also been used to treat tricuspid regurgitation, and its results have been reported in retrospective studies.

Although initially promising, most transcatheter tricuspid valve repair (TTVr) approaches are still in development and the outcomes and safety evaluations of TTVr versus STVR or STVr remain limited and lack of support from randomized controlled trials or other high-quality clinical studies. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the burden, outcomes, financial cost and complications of TTVr versus STVR or STVr in a real-world population from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database.

### Surgical treatment of tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve surgery: a retrospective study in China [^3c414977]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Limitation of Study

This study was composed of the experience from a group of surgeons who have their own preference for tricuspid valve replacement or repair, and for the method of repair. Therefore, the uniform opinion as to the indication for tricuspid replacement or repair was not formed although all surgeons in this group agree that for the significant tricuspid regurgitation at mitral valve surgery and for the recurrent tricuspid regurgitation developed after the mitral surgery, the active surgical treatment is necessary. Further, due to the geographic limitations, the follow-up is limited. To reach the definite conclusion for the procedure to treat the tricuspid regurgitation, longer follow-up would be essential in the future.

### Contemporary etiologies, outcomes, and Novel risk score for isolated tricuspid regurgitation [^7dd46022]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The authors report etiologies and outcomes and devise a risk model in a large contemporary cohort of patients with isolated tricuspid regurgitation (TR).

Background

Isolated TR is a challenging clinical entity with heterogeneous etiology and often poor outcomes, with a paucity of recent research regarding the epidemiology of isolated TR.

Methods

Consecutive patients with isolated TR graded at least moderate to severe on echocardiography from January 2004 to December 2018 (n = 9,045, mean age 70.4 ± 15.4 years, 60.3% women) were studied. TR etiologies were individually adjudicated as secondary or primary, with subcategories. All-cause death during follow-up was the primary endpoint, with associations between etiology and outcomes analyzed and a risk model created.

Results

Primary and secondary TR etiologies were present in 470 (5.2%) and 8,575 (94.8%) patients, respectively. The main secondary etiologies were left heart disease in 4,664 (54.4%), atrial functional in 2,086 (24.3%), and pulmonary disease in 1,454 (17.0%), and the main primary etiologies were endocarditis in 222 (47.2%), degenerative or prolapse in 86 (18.3%), and prosthetic valve failure in 79 (16.8%). There were 3,987 deaths (44.0%) over a mean follow-up period of 2.6 ± 3.3 years. In unadjusted analyses, patients with secondary TR had worse survival than those with primary TR (HR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.32–1.85), but this result was not statistically significant in multivariable analysis. The authors devised and internally validated a risk score for predicting 1-year mortality in these patients.

Conclusions

Secondary TR constituted 95% of isolated significant TR and conferred worse survival than primary TR in unadjusted but not adjusted analyses. The present novel risk score stratifies the risk for 1-year death and may influence decision making for management in these high-risk patients.

Surgical decision-making in severe regurgitation — severity confirmation and tricuspid considerations: As management trends toward earlier intervention, "it is important that early preemptive surgery be performed only in those with truly severe regurgitation", and "surgery in symptomatic patients is recommended only when AR or MR is considered severe enough to be the cause of symptoms". In secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with mitral valve (MV) disease, "surgical repair of severe TR is indicated at the time of MV surgery whether or not there are clinical signs of severe TR", and "the decision for concomitant TV repair is driven principally by imaging evidence of severe TR or severe dilatation of the tricuspid annulus", whereas "in patients with primary TR, the clinical presentation is also of great importance".

IMAGING OF TRICUSPID REGURGITATION AND RIGHT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION

Evaluation of patients with TR requires the integration of the information from different cardiac imaging techniques (figure 2). Before left-side valve surgery, careful assessment of the severity of TR and careful measurement of the tricuspid annulus is mandatory.

Figure 2

(C) Dense/triangular flow with early systolic peak in a patient with massive TR. (D) Cine short-axis view showing right and left mass and volumes assessed by MRI. S, septal leaflet; P, posterior leaflet; A, anterior leaflet; TR, tricuspid regurgitation.

Transthoracic echocardiography

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the technique of choice to evaluate the aetiology of the TR, quantify its severity and determine the annular diameters. Simultaneous evaluation of the three leaflets is difficult by conventional TTE, requiring the use of different projections for the correct assessment (long-axis view of RV inflow, short-axis at the level of the aortic valve, apical four-chamber and subcostal views). The normal annulus diameter in adults is 28 ± 5 mm and significant dilatation is defined by a diastolic diameter > 40 mm or > 21 mm/mm². Of note, it has been demonstrated that the annular diameter, as measured from the apical four-chamber view, underestimates major and minor annular dimensions.

Quantification of the severity of the TR depends on the combination of different echocardiographic parameters. Box 1 summarises the main parameters characterising severe TR, according to the recommendations for the echocardiographic assessment of native valvular regurgitation from the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging.

### Transcatheter therapies for treating tricuspid regurgitation [^e5d965b9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Tricuspid valve (TV) disease has been relatively neglected, despite the known association between severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and mortality. Few patients undergo isolated tricuspid surgery, which remains associated with high in-hospital mortality rates, particularly in patients with prior left-sided valve surgery. Patients with severe TR are often managed medically for years before TV repair or replacement. Current guidelines recommend TV repair in the presence of a dilated tricuspid annulus at the time of a left-sided valve surgical intervention, even if regurgitation is mild. This proposed algorithm aims to prevent the inevitable progression to severe TR and the need for a second surgical intervention. Recently, novel transcatheter treatment options were developed for treating patients with severe TR and right heart failure with prohibitive surgical risk. Here we describe currently available transcatheter treatment options for severe TR implanted at different levels: the junction between vena cavae and right atrium; the tricuspid annulus; or between TV leaflets, improving coaptation.

### Implications of tricuspid regurgitation severity in patients undergoing mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair [^bf451ca4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Significant TR has long been associated with increased morbidity and mortality across a wide range of clinical scenarios. In patients undergoing mitral TEER, such a hazard may be mediated by a more advanced left‐heart disease, a greater burden of comorbidities, or a direct harmful effect(s) imposed by the right‐sided valvulopathy. Despite a substantial body of literature, no TR severity cutoff has been consistently demonstrated to date as an outcome predictor in the mitral TEER arena, presumably due to discrepancies in TR grading systems, analytical approaches, and MR mechanisms studied. Consequently, TR severity has not been acknowledged in all TEER‐specific risk models. As for TR evolution following TEER, current literature assigns a protective role for postprocedural TR improvement; however, supportive data either have stemmed from considerably small cohorts or have been based on limited or mixed pre/postprocedural variables regression models as well as highly variable TR assessment timings (eg, 40–152 days post‐TEER in 1 study). In either case, no attention has been paid to TR cause.

### Assessment of functional tricuspid regurgitation [^1a50c4f5]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) is characterized by structurally normal leaflets and is due to the deformation of the valvulo-ventricular complex. While mild FTR is frequent and usually benign, patients with severe FTR may develop progressive ventricular dysfunction and incur increased mortality. Therefore, FTR should not be ignored, should be appropriately diagnosed and quantified by Doppler echocardiography, and should be evaluated for corrective surgical procedures. At present, referral for surgical correction of FTR is often delayed until patients develop intractable heart failure. However, this strategy frequently translates in poor clinical outcome characterized by notable operative mortality and reduced long-term survival. Appropriate patient selection and proper timing for tricuspid valve (TV) repair or replacement are crucial for optimal outcome, but objective criteria for clinical decison-making remain poorly defined. In the present paper, we review the anatomy of the normal TV, the pathophysiology of FTR, the assessment of its severity and functional significance, and propose an algorithm for selecting patients for surgical treatment.

Statistical Analysis

Patients were first evaluated according to TR severity at baseline. Subsequent, limited‐scope survival analyses of the primary outcome were undertaken in those affected by prognostically meaningful baseline TR severity and among patients with assessable TR at 1 month following the intervention. At each stage, analyses were applied to the total study cohort and each of the 2 main MR causes (ie, secondary/functional MR [FMR] and primary MR [PMR]) subcohorts. For simplification purposes, 3 TR severity categories were mainly considered: below moderate (ie, 0–3), moderate (ie, 4), and above moderate (ie, 5–8). Further analyses of TR as a binary‐type variable (eg, below moderate versus moderate and above) and continuous‐type variable were used when applicable.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of valvular regurgitation: general considerations — valvular regurgitation or insufficiency results from varied etiologies that prevent complete apposition of leaflets or cusps and is grossly divided into organic valve regurgitation (primary) with structural alteration and functional regurgitation (secondary) whereby chamber remodeling affects a structurally normal valve, leading to insufficient coaptation; Doppler techniques are very sensitive so trivial or physiologic regurgitation can be detected and occurs frequently in right-sided valves. It is not sufficient to only note the presence of regurgitation, and one is obligated to describe the mechanism and possible etiologies; transthoracic echocardiography is usually the first-line imaging modality to investigate regurgitation, but if TTE is suboptimal, reliance on transesophageal echocardiography or CMR would be the next step, and three-dimensional echocardiography has significantly enhanced mechanistic understanding, particularly when imaging the mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves with TEE.

1 Background

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is classified as primary or secondary. Primary TR etiologies include congenital heart disease, leaflet prolapse, rheumatic disease, carcinoid disease, infective endocarditis, and valvular injury. Secondary TR, the most common form, results from annular dilatation and annular flattening due to right ventricular (RV) and/or right atrial dilatation; often due to left heart disease or longstanding atrial fibrillation (AF). TR occurs in 5%–20% of the general population and is associated with up to a 63.9% reduction in 1‐year survival. TR is also associated with high morbidity, including progressive RV dysfunction, volume overload, liver cirrhosis, and renal impairment.

Risk for 1‐Year Outcomes in the Total Cohort and Functional and Primary Mitral Regurgitation Subcohorts

Complementing these observations, an integrated risk model, composed of binary 1 or 0 variables for above‐moderate TR and each of the MitraScore parameters, outperformed the original MitraScore in regard to the primary outcome prediction, with a C statistic of 0.68 versus 0.65 and an area under the curve difference of 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01–0.04; P = 0.005) (Figure S2).

Interestingly, among patients with above‐moderate TR at baseline, no association was found between either TR cause or maximal medial‐lateral tricuspid annular diameter (both as continuous/dichotomous and nonindexed/indexed variable), or the performance of a subsequent tricuspid intervention and the primary outcome's incidence and risk.

One‐Month Tricuspid Regurgitation Severity

Among participants with analyzable echocardiograms at 1 month postprocedure (n = 890, 69.2%), TR severity, as a continuous variable, directly correlated with its baseline counterpart (Pearson r = 0.73, P < 0.001) and was not significantly altered following mitral TEER, as reflected by a 0 (IQR, −2 to 1) grade difference between the two (Table 3). Concomitantly, this difference inversely correlated with the baseline valvulopathy severity (Pearson r = −0.64, P < 0.001), translating to a net drop in TR extent in most patients with preprocedural moderate‐and‐above TR degrees (Figure S3).

Per an exploratory survival analysis, 1‐month moderate‐and‐above TR was associated with higher cumulative incidence and risk of the primary outcome (Table 6 and Figure S4). Conversely, no prognostic role was demonstrated for the change, and specifically the improvement, in TR class, from baseline to 1 month after TEER.

Table 6
One‐Month Observations‐Based Cox Proportional Hazard Model for All‐Cause Mortality or Heart Failure Hospitalizations at 1 Year in the Total Cohort

The odds of experiencing moderate‐and‐above TR at 1 month post‐TEER were higher in the presence, preprocedurally, of increasing TR grade, lower tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion/pulmonary arterial systolic pressure ratio, and cardiac implantable electronic device use (Table S6). Specifically within the above‐moderate baseline TR group, they were not affected, according to univariate analysis, by either TR cause or tricuspid annular diameter.

CONCLUSIONS

In our single, high‐volume center cohort of patients treated with mitral TEER, procedural safety and feasibility were unaffected by TR extent at baseline. However, advanced TR, and specifically that of moderate‐to‐severe and greater degree, present in 20% of cases, marked a more morbid patient profile and was associated with increased odds of prognostically hazardous moderate‐and‐above TR persistence at 1 month postprocedure, ultimately leading to excess mortality and HF hospitalizations at 1 year. These findings call for future randomized controlled trials to study the efficacy of treating significant TR in conjunction with mitral TEER.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) — right ventricular (RV) systolic function thresholds and secondary TR indicators are specified: A tricuspid annular excursion measurement < 1.6 cm and an RV fractional area change < 35% are suggestive of RV dysfunction, though tricuspid annular excursion in particular may yield both false-positive and -negative results; significant chronic TR also causes enlargement of the right atrium and inferior vena cava, and right atrial enlargement in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and concomitant TV annular dilatation (> 35 mm) may result in secondary TR.

### Prevalence and mechanism of tricuspid regurgitation following implantation of endocardial leads for pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator [^4b31770d]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2012). Low credibility.

Endocardial lead-induced tricuspid regurgitation has not been well recognized, either clinically or echocardiographically, and yet it is likely a preventable iatrogenic disease. In severe cases, it can lead to right ventricular failure and require tricuspid valve surgery. This complication will become increasingly important, because the numbers of permanent pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are expected to increase because of the aging population and the expanding capabilities of these devices. Published studies are largely retrospective, and serial studies to assess the time course of the development of tricuspid regurgitation are lacking. The mechanisms and severity of tricuspid regurgitation may not be well evaluated by two-dimensional echocardiography. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography appears to be a promising technique to evaluate the mechanism of tricuspid regurgitation and may allow the early detection of patients who will develop severe lead-induced tricuspid regurgitation. A better understanding of the mechanism of lead-induced tricuspid regurgitation will be essential to the development of preventive strategies, which can then be tested in future clinical trials.

Ebstein's anomaly — diagnostic differentiation by echocardiography is characterized by apical displacement of the septal tricuspid leaflet and a redundant anterior leaflet, and several conditions may mimic it. Cardiac disorders that cause tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right-sided chamber enlargement may be misdiagnosed as Ebstein's anomaly, and experienced echocardiographic assessment allows differentiation. A defining feature is apical displacement of the septal tricuspid leaflet of more than 8 mm per m², with misdiagnoses including tricuspid valve dysplasia or prolapse, traumatic changes of the tricuspid valve, arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) cardiomyopathy, tricuspid valve endocarditis, and carcinoid heart disease. The severity of TR may be underestimated on echocardiography due to subtle physical findings and laminar regurgitant flow.

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults and special considerations in pulmonary hypertension: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^b05a99ab]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Tricuspid valve disease — Comprehensive echocardiographic assessment is crucial to accurately determine tricuspid regurgitation (TR) severity and identify the mechanism and underlying valvular pathology; TR is categorized into primary (arising from a primary abnormality of the tricuspid valve apparatus [TVA]), functional TR (FTR) secondary to adverse right heart remodeling, and isolated atriofunctional TR (AFTR) due to adverse right atrial remodeling and long‑standing atrial arrhythmia. In healthy individuals, the tricuspid valve typically has three leaflets with a relative circumferential anterior/septal/posterior length ratio of 1:1:0.75, but variation exists with three, four, two, and five leaflets described in 54%, 39%, 5%, and 2% of patients, respectively. Primary TR causes include myxomatous leaflet degeneration, leaflet prolapse, infective endocarditis, procedural iatrogenic perforation, and leaflet impingement from indwelling intracardiac leads; FTR and AFTR are the predominant forms of TR, accounting for > 80% of cases, and adjunctive signs frequently seen in severe TR include right heart dilatation and dysfunction, IVC enlargement with impaired respirophasic variation, abnormal HVs/HAdV ratio < 1, and holosystolic flow reversal.

### Tricuspid regurgitation in mitral valve disease incidence, prognostic implications, mechanism, and management [^02861fca]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients with mitral valve (MV) disease is associated with poor outcome and predicts poor survival, heart failure, and reduced functional capacity. It is common if left untreated after MV replacement mainly in rheumatic patients, but it is also common in patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation. It is less common, however, in those with degenerative mitral regurgitation. It might appear many years after surgery and might not resolve after correcting the MV lesion. Late TR might be caused by prosthetic valve dysfunction, left heart disease, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and dilation, persistent pulmonary hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, or by organic (mainly rheumatic) tricuspid valve disease. Most commonly, late TR is functional and isolated, secondary to tricuspid annular dilation. Outcome of isolated tricuspid valve surgery is poor, because RV dysfunction has already occurred at that point in many patients. MV surgery or balloon valvotomy should be performed before RV dysfunction, severe TR, or advanced heart failure has occurred. Tricuspid annuloplasty with a ring should be performed at the initial MV surgery, and the tricuspid annulus diameter (≥ 3.5 cm) is the best criterion for performing the annuloplasty. In this article we will review the current data available for understanding the prognostic implications, mechanism, and management of TR in patients with MV disease.

### Commentary: the tricuspid valve: No longer forgotten but still unknown [^e6696775]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Matthew A. Romano, MD

Central Message

Severe functional TR is complex, annuloplasty may be inadequate, and adjunctive techniques may improve results. Sufficient evidence is needed to determine which maneuvers are effective and durable.

See Article page 162.

The association between the degree of functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and poor outcome is well established, and the severity of the regurgitation may be a marker of worsening right ventricular dysfunction that is not fully appreciated by imaging. Traditionally, the approach to surgical repair for functional TR has primarily consisted of a downsized annuloplasty ring. However, annuloplasty alone has been associated with an important incidence of recurrence. The mechanism of functional TR is complex and is a combination of many factors, including annular dilatation and geometric ventricular distortion with tethering of the papillary muscles and leaflet restriction. Given these complexities, an effective and durable repair solution has yet to emerge.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^5bace80d]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery, right-sided endocarditis, AHA 2015 guidelines recommend to consider performing surgical intervention in patients with certain complications, including:

- right HF secondary to severe tricuspid regurgitation with poor response to medical therapy

- sustained infection caused by difficult-to-treat organisms, such as fungi or multidrug-resistant bacteria or lack of response to appropriate antimicrobial therapy

- tricuspid valve vegetations ≥ 20 mm in diameter and recurrent PE despite antimicrobial therapy.

Conclusions

Improvement in TR occurs in more than one‐third of patients undergoing successful M‐TEER for SMR. Residual MR 2+ (vs. 1+) and increased LAD are associated with a reduced likelihood to have TR ≤ 2+ after M‐TEER. A TR ≤ 2+ at short‐term follow‐up after M‐TEER was associated with a lower risk of mortality regardless of baseline TR.

Central Message

Patients who undergo tricuspid valvectomy may develop symptoms of right-sided heart failure and require operative reintervention with valve replacement.

See Commentary on page 68.

The incidence of tricuspid valve infective endocarditis secondary to intravenous (IV) drug abuse has risen sharply during the opioid epidemic in the United States. Although medical management with long-term IV antibiotics is the primary treatment strategy, several patients may not respond to treatment or have residual tricuspid insufficiency requiring operative intervention. The optimal surgical management of tricuspid valve endocarditis has evolved over the last several decades and has included valvectomy, valve repair, and valve replacement. We report the follow-up and management of a long-term survivor who had previously undergone tricuspid valvectomy for infective endocarditis 30 years previously.
