## Question

Do you bridge DOACs?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bridging anticoagulation is needed for patients taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and how to manage interruption and resumption safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic rationale for bridging with DOACs versus warfarin. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and trials say about bridging during DOAC interruption. Next, I will review the evidence quantifying bleeding and thromboembolic risks with and without bridging. After that, I need to check for any exceptions where bridging might still be considered. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach to interruption and resumption, and confirm the bottom-line recommendation with supporting references [^116nqRDb] [^112jnRz3] [^114yW3p7].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic foundation. DOACs have short half-lives and rapid onset/offset, which means the time off anticoagulation is brief when held appropriately, and the rapid return of therapeutic effect after restarting further reduces the need for parenteral bridging; by contrast, warfarin's long half-life and slow reversal often necessitate multi-day interruption, creating a longer "gap" that historically prompted bridging in higher-risk patients [^116nqRDb] [^116Ywy1q].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before drawing conclusions. The 2022 CHEST perioperative guideline explicitly recommends against perioperative heparin bridging when DOACs are interrupted for elective procedures, citing increased bleeding without thromboembolic benefit; the 2024 ACC/AHA/ACCP AF guideline likewise recommends temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging for most AF patients undergoing procedures, with explicit exceptions for mechanical valves or recent stroke/TIA; the 2024 AHA/ACC perioperative guideline echoes that a simple DOAC interruption strategy without bridging yields low thromboembolic and bleeding rates, and the European anesthesia guidance similarly advises no bridging for DOACs around intermediate/high bleeding risk procedures [^112jnRz3] [^116uzr5n] [^117RfkEm] [^115keWki].

> I should double-check the quantitative evidence. The BRIDGE randomized trial in AF patients interrupting warfarin showed that forgoing bridging was noninferior for thromboembolism and reduced major bleeding, establishing the principle that routine bridging can harm without preventing events; meta-analyses and observational syntheses report substantially higher major bleeding with bridging in DOAC cohorts (approximately 4.8–6.5% with bridging vs 1.6–1.8% without), without a compensatory reduction in thromboembolism; PAUSE and related standardized DOAC protocols demonstrate very low 30-day thromboembolic rates (~0.2–0.4%) and low major bleeding (~1–2%) when DOACs are simply interrupted and resumed per protocol without bridging [^1146jfak] [^117NFVUu] [^116nqRDb] [^112tFWRw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — are there exceptions where bridging might still be reasonable with DOACs? I need to ensure I capture the narrow indications. Contemporary guidance reserves bridging for exceptional scenarios such as mechanical heart valves or very recent stroke/TIA, where the thrombotic risk is uniquely high and the balance of risk may differ; even then, evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized, and importantly, DOACs are contraindicated in mechanical valves, so this exception pertains to warfarin-based strategies rather than DOACs per se; outside these, bridging during DOAC interruption is not recommended [^114yW3p7] [^1158iCqD] [^1144uyDx].

> Next, I should review a practical, risk-stratified approach to interruption and resumption so I don't overgeneralize. For low bleeding risk procedures, holding the DOAC the day of or 1 day prior and resuming 24 hours post-procedure is reasonable; for moderate risk, typically hold 1 day pre and resume 24 hours post; for high bleeding risk, hold 2 days pre and resume 48–72 hours post, ensuring hemostasis before reinitiation; these intervals may need adjustment for renal impairment, especially for dabigatran, and agent-specific pharmacokinetics should guide timing; importantly, none of these scenarios require heparin bridging when following standardized protocols [^116nqRDb] [^112tFWRw] [^115PRh2i].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about real-world bleeding signals with DOAC interruption compared with warfarin without bridging? Some observational analyses suggest higher bleeding with DOAC interruption versus non-bridged warfarin, but these comparisons are confounded by differences in interruption timing, procedural mix, and patient risk; guideline panels still conclude that, given the rapid offset/onset of DOACs, adding bridging increases bleeding without improving thrombotic outcomes, so the balance remains against bridging in routine DOAC management [^114rP68G] [^112jnRz3] [^116nqRDb].

> I should confirm the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. For patients on DOACs who require elective procedures, do not bridge with heparin; instead, use a standardized interruption and resumption strategy tailored to procedural bleeding risk and renal function, which achieves low thromboembolism and low bleeding without the added hemorrhagic risk of bridging; reserve bridging only for the rare, guideline-specified exceptions such as mechanical valves or recent stroke/TIA, recognizing that DOACs themselves are not used in mechanical valves and that evidence for bridging even in warfarin patients is largely negative outside these niches [^112jnRz3] [^114yW3p7] [^117RfkEm] [^1146jfak].

---

In general, **DOACs are not bridged** for elective procedures because their rapid onset/offset and predictable pharmacokinetics make bridging unnecessary and risky [^116nqRDb] [^117NFVUu]. Bridging is only considered for **very high thrombotic risk** (e.g. mechanical heart valves, recent VTE/TE, or active cancer) and is otherwise avoided due to increased bleeding without thrombotic benefit [^114yW3p7] [^117NFVUu]. Use standardized interruption/resumption protocols based on procedure bleeding risk and renal function, and avoid routine bridging [^112tFWRw] [^115ErXWS].

---

## Pharmacological rationale against bridging DOACs

DOACs have **rapid onset/offset** — achieving peak effect within 2–4 hours and losing meaningful activity within 24–48 hours after the last dose — which makes bridging unnecessary in most cases [^1155dUxX]. Their predictable pharmacokinetics enable standardized interruption/resumption without routine lab monitoring or bridging [^116nqRDb].

---

## Clinical evidence on bridging DOACs

Evidence shows **no benefit** from bridging DOACs; instead, it increases bleeding:

- **PAUSE study**: Standardized interruption/resumption without bridging resulted in low thromboembolism (0.2–0.4%) and low major bleeding (1–2%) [^116nqRDb] [^112tFWRw].
- **BRIDGE trial**: In AF patients interrupting warfarin, no bridging was noninferior for thromboembolism and reduced major bleeding vs bridging [^1146jfak] [^1155xR7b].
- **Meta-analyses**: Bridging increases major bleeding without reducing thromboembolism in DOAC patients [^117NFVUu] [^115xsBwQ].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Major guidelines **advise against routine bridging** for DOACs:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| CHEST 2022 | - Suggests against perioperative heparin bridging when interrupting DOACs for elective procedures [^112jnRz3] [^1143i4N9] |
| ACC/AHA/HRS 2024 | - Recommends temporary cessation without bridging for AF patients undergoing procedures, except mechanical valves or recent stroke/TIA [^115ErXWS] [^114yW3p7] |
| ESC 2021 | - No bridging recommended for DOACs; use standardized interruption/resumption based on bleeding risk and renal function [^notfound] |

---

## Situations where bridging may be considered

Bridging is **rarely considered** only for **very high thrombotic risk**, such as:

- **Mechanical heart valves**: Especially mitral position [^115ErXWS] [^1144uyDx].
- **Recent thromboembolism**: VTE within 3 months or stroke/TIA within 30 days [^116PPDoa].
- **Active cancer**: Ongoing malignancy with high thrombotic burden.

Even in these scenarios, decisions should be individualized and multidisciplinary.

---

## Risks associated with bridging DOACs

Bridging **increases bleeding** without reducing thromboembolism:

- **Increased major bleeding**: 6.5% vs 1.8% without bridging in DOAC patients [^117NFVUu].
- **Increased minor bleeding**: 20.9% vs 12.0% in BRIDGE [^1146jfak].
- **Postoperative complications**: Higher wound hematoma, transfusion, and reoperation rates [^116STUmW].

---

## Standardized perioperative management of DOACs

A **practical, evidence-based approach**:

| **Procedure bleeding risk** | **Preoperative interruption** | **Postoperative resumption** |
|-|-|-|
| Minimal/low | Day of procedure or 1 day before | 24 hours post-procedure |
| Moderate | 1 day before | 24–48 hours post-procedure |
| High | 2 days before | 48–72 hours post-procedure |

---

Adjust for **renal function** (especially dabigatran) and **agent half-life** [^112tFWRw] [^115PRh2i].

---

## Clinical outcomes with standardized interruption

Standardized interruption without bridging yields **low thromboembolism** (0.2–0.4%) and **low major bleeding** (1–2%) in PAUSE and related cohorts [^116nqRDb]. Procedure delays and cancellations are infrequent with this approach [^116nqRDb].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Extend interruption for dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors as needed [^115keWki] [^115PRh2i].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, diltiazem) can raise DOAC levels; consider longer interruption or closer monitoring [^113ykPaG].
- **Emergency procedures**: Use specific reversal agents (idarucizumab, andexanet alfa) when indicated [^1178YTJJ] [^116nqRDb].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine bridging**: Not recommended for DOACs due to increased bleeding without thrombotic benefit [^112jnRz3] [^117NFVUu].
- **Standardized interruption**: Use risk-based interruption/resumption protocols tailored to procedure bleeding risk and renal function [^116nqRDb] [^114yW3p7].
- **Exceptions**: Consider bridging only for very high thrombotic risk (mechanical valves, recent VTE/TE, active cancer) and individualize decisions [^115ErXWS] [^114JUNGv].

---

Bridging is **generally not indicated** for DOACs; use standardized interruption/resumption to balance thrombotic and bleeding risks, reserving bridging for exceptional high-risk scenarios.

Most patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are currently treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Before an invasive procedure or surgery, clinicians face the challenging decision of how to best manage DOACs. Should the DOAC be held, for how long, and are there instances where bridging with other anticoagulants should be considered? Although clinical trials indicate that most patients taking DOACs for atrial fibrillation do not require bridging anticoagulation, the optimal strategy for patients with a history of VTE is undefined. In this review, we present a case-based discussion for DOAC interruption perioperatively in patients receiving anticoagulation for management of VTE.

American College of Chest Physicians guideline — perioperative direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) interruption: In patients who require DOAC interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest against perioperative heparin bridging (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence), supported by evidence that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging increased major bleeding without thromboembolic benefit in DOAC-treated patients (6.5% vs 1.8%; P < .001; stroke/systemic embolism 0.5% vs 0.3%; p = 0.46), a registry showing higher major bleeding with bridging (OR = 4.6; 95% CI: 1.1–9.9) without significant thromboembolic effect (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 0.7–5.4), and a meta-analysis reporting 4.8% [95% CI: 3.4–6.2] vs 1.6% [95% CI: 1.2–2.0%]; the guideline notes that the rapid offset and onset of DOACs obviate the need for bridging with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or LMWH in a perioperative setting.

### Bridging anticoagulation: primum non nocere [^111A3CwZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic oral anticoagulation frequently requires interruption for various reasons and durations. Whether or not to bridge with heparin or other anticoagulants is a common clinical dilemma. The evidence to inform decision making is limited, making current guidelines equivocal and imprecise. Moreover, indications for anticoagulation interruption may be unclear. New observational studies and a recent large randomized trial have noted significant perioperative or periprocedural bleeding rates without reduction in thromboembolism when bridging is employed. Such bleeding may also increase morbidity and mortality. In light of these findings, physician preferences for routine bridging anticoagulation during chronic anticoagulation interruptions may be too aggressive. More randomized trials, such as PERIOP2 (A Double Blind Randomized Control Trial of Post-Operative Low Molecular Weight Heparin Bridging Therapy Versus Placebo Bridging Therapy for Patients Who Are at High Risk for Arterial Thromboembolism), will help guide periprocedural management of anticoagulation for indications such as venous thromboembolism and mechanical heart valves. In the meantime, physicians should carefully consider both the need for oral anticoagulation interruption and the practice of routine bridging when anticoagulation interruption is indicated.

### Perioperative management of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xsBwQ]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of patients who are receiving chronic oral anticoagulation therapy and require an elective surgery or an invasive procedure is a common clinical scenario.

Research Question

What is the best available evidence to support the development of American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term vitamin K agonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and require elective surgery or procedures?

Study Design and Methods

A literature search including multiple databases from database inception through July 16, 2020, was performed. Meta-analyses were conducted when appropriate.

Results

In patients receiving VKA (warfarin) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, shorter (< 3 days) VKA interruption is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. In patients who required VKA interruption, heparin bridging (mostly with low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]) was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of major bleed, representing a very low certainty of evidence (COE). Compared with DOAC interruption 1 to 4 days before surgery, continuing DOACs may be associated with higher risk of bleeding demonstrated in some, but not all studies. In patients who needed DOAC interruption, bridging with LMWH may be associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bleeding, representing a low COE.

Interpretation

The certainty in the evidence supporting the perioperative management of anticoagulants remains limited. No high-quality evidence exists to support the practice of heparin bridging during the interruption of VKA or DOAC therapy for an elective surgery or procedure, or for the practice of interrupting VKA therapy for minor procedures, including cardiac device implantation, or continuation of a DOAC vs short-term interruption of a DOAC in the perioperative period.

### A call to reduce the use of bridging anticoagulation [^115eDW5R]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Low credibility.

Because of the recent publication of several important studies, there has been a major change in how we think about perioperative management of anticoagulation. Because of these changes, existing consensus guidelines are suddenly out of date and can no longer be used as is, particularly the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Guidelines, version 9. We estimate that well over 90% of patients receiving warfarin therapy should not receive bridging anticoagulation during periprocedural interruptions of therapy, except under unusual circumstances and with appropriate justification. Accumulating evidence also suggests that bridging is not indicated among patients receiving direct-acting oral anticoagulant therapy. The large number of patients potentially affected represents an important safety concern and requires an immediate change in practice.

### Perioperative consultative hematology: can you clear my patient for a procedure? [^113GaNAi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Periprocedural management of antithrombotics is a common but challenging clinical scenario that renders patients vulnerable to potential adverse events such as bleeding and thrombosis. Over the past decade, periprocedural antithrombotic approaches have changed considerably with the advent of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), as well as a paradigm shift away from bridging in many warfarin patients. Successfully navigating this high-risk period relies on a number of individualized patient assessments conducted within a framework of standardized, systematic approaches. It also requires a thorough understanding of antithrombotic pharmacokinetics, multidisciplinary coordination of care, and comprehensive patient education and empowerment. In this article, we provide clinicians with a practical, stepwise approach to periprocedural management of antithrombotic agents through case-based examples of relevant clinical scenarios.

### The current status of bridging anticoagulation [^1138dfau]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

For patients prescribed chronic vitamin K antagonist therapy requiring a surgical or invasive procedure, the question of whether or not to bridge and how to bridge is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Bridging anticoagulation has evolved over the years and the evidence base for current practice is deficient in many areas. Clinical trials currently being completed with conventional anticoagulants should help strengthen the evidence base for future practice. The availability of novel oral anticoagulants is a welcome addition, though their optimal management peri-procedure is yet to be determined. Prospective multi-centre controlled studies that can provide the evidence base for novel oral anticoagulant peri-procedural management are required.

Procedural Management

Past guidelines on perioperative and postoperative management for patients on DOACs have been primarily based on surgical risk (both thrombotic and bleeding), the DOAC's pharmacokinetic profile, concurrent medications, and patient characteristics (ie, comorbid diseases, history of bleeding complications, renal function, and age). 92, 93 Because of DOACs' fast onset and offset, periprocedural bridging is generally not required; however, it is important to note the length of time to hold regimens before and after procedures. Providers may find it useful to obtain specific coagulation measurements before procedures, especially in high‐risk interventions, to determine the level of hemostasis. However, for the majority of patients undergoing elective procedures, the interruption of DOAC therapy can be substantiated on a time‐based approach that takes into consideration bleeding risk of the procedure and renal function (see Table 8). 38, 93 Furthermore, the results of the ongoing PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation; NCT02228798) will help to further define a more conclusive standard‐of‐care approach for perioperative management. 94

### Periprocedural management of patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant requiring an elective procedure or surgery [^116WN6EW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic therapy with oral anticoagulants (OACs), including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin and direct OACs (DOACs), is a common clinical problem. The optimal perioperative management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy is anchored on four key principles: (i) risk stratification of patient-related and procedure-related risks of thrombosis and bleeding; (ii) the clinical consequences of a thrombotic or bleeding event; (iii) discontinuation and reinitiation of OAC therapy on the basis of the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent; and (iv) whether aggressive management such as the use of periprocedural heparin bridging has advantages for the prevention of postoperative thromboembolism at the cost of a possible increase in bleeding risk. Recent data from randomized trials in patients receiving VKAs undergoing pacemaker/defibrillator implantation or using heparin bridging therapy for elective procedures or surgeries can now inform best practice. There are also emerging data on periprocedural outcomes in the DOAC trials for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This review summarizes the evidence for the periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy, focusing on recent randomized trials and large outcome studies, to address three key clinical scenarios: (i) can OAC therapy be safely continued for minor procedures or surgeries; (ii) if therapy with VKAs (especially warfarin) needs to be temporarily interrupted for an elective procedure/surgery, is heparin bridging necessary; and (iii) what is the optimal periprocedural management of the DOACs? In answering these questions, we aim to provide updated clinical guidance for the periprocedural management of patients receiving VKA or DOAC therapy, including the use of heparin bridging.

### New trends in anticoagulation therapy [^1151wobY]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation pharmacy has been dramatically altered with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of 5 direct oral anticoagulants, 1 novel reversal agent and, a second designated for fast-track approval. Trial data surrounding current trends in anticoagulant choice for VTE, reversal, and bridging are constantly redefining practice. Extended therapy for unprovoked VTE has expanded to include low-dose direct oral anticoagulants, aspirin, and the use of the HERDOO2 system to identify women who can stop anticoagulant therapy without increased risk of recurrent VTE. Trends in thromboprophylaxis include extended duration low-dose direct oral anticoagulants to prevent VTE in high-risk patients.

### A systematic update on the state of novel anticoagulants and a primer on reversal and bridging [^11618K95]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes familiar agents that have been in use for many years, including unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). A number of novel oral anticoagulants are currently developed or are in stages of development to either replace VKAs in concert with initial heparin or LMWH, or to replace both heparin/LMWH and VKAs totally as monotherapy. These agents hold the promise of not requiring monitoring, being safer in terms of bleeding risk than current agents, and being of equal or improved efficacy compared with established anticoagulants.

Methods

In the following report, we systematically review the oral agents currently approved or closest to approval for both VTE and atrial fibrillation treatment, focusing on the treatment of VTE: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban.

Results

Findings of clinical use and comparisons to standard care of these agents are summarized in depth, by succinctly reviewing all major randomized controlled trials. Mechanistic and functional differences are reviewed, as Dabigatran targets activated factor II (factor IIa), while rivaroxaban and apixaban target activated factor X (factor Xa). We also discuss the inability at the present time to reliably reverse the anticoagulant effects of these agents, provide a suggested strategy for reversal, and finally discuss an approach to bridging these agents when other procedures are required while currently taking one of these three agents.

Conclusions

These agents, while still with many unanswered questions, demonstrate great promise in the prevention and treatment of VTE.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nZcRy]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

An estimated 2.5 million patients use oral anticoagulants for the prevention of arterial thromboembolic events in North America, and one‐tenth of them require temporary interruption in preparation for an elective procedure or surgery. 1, 2 However, the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation is not completely clarified for patients who need an anticoagulation interruption before invasive procedures. Two main concerns remain unsolved, the risk of thromboembolism, and the risk of bleeding. 1, 2

To reduce the bleeding risk for patients undergoing invasive procedures, oral anticoagulant is typically interrupted prior to the procedure, and then continued when hemostasis is achieved postprocedurally. 1, 2 Because the interruption of anticoagulation may expose patients to the risk of thromboembolism, heparin bridging (unfractionated heparin [UFH] or low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH]) is administered to minimize the period of inadequate level of anticoagulation. 1, 2 It is of great importance to confirm whether bridging therapy reduces thromboembolic risk and to ascertain the safety of bridging therapy in relation to bleeding risk. 3

There have been many published articles related to bridging anticoagulation, 4, 5 but the quality of evidence with best practices is uneven across studies. Current guidelines from the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association suggest bridging anticoagulation used in patients with a high thrombosis risk, such as certain mechanical valve prostheses or recent pulmonary embolism during interruption of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy. 3 However, these recommendations are primarily based on observational studies and experts' opinions. 3

Although Siegal and colleagues concluded that bridging anticoagulation increases bleeding risk and produces similar thromboembolic risk, their review included only one underpowered randomized trial together with some observational studies with no control arm to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging therapy. 6 To better clarify the risk and benefit of bridging therapy, we updated the current published data and conducted a meta‐analysis to compare the periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks between patients receiving interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging therapy and continuous oral anticoagulation.

### Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants in the DOAC era [^1145H6eJ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants can be complex and confusing for many providers. It involves a careful balance of a patient's thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk. For every patient chronically taking an oral anticoagulant who will be undergoing an elective procedure, a four step approach may be considered when creating a plan for the oral anticoagulant. (1) Does the oral anticoagulant need to stop for the procedure? (2) If yes, when should the oral anticoagulant be stopped pre-procedure? (3) Does the patient require a "bridging" parenteral anticoagulant? (4) When should anticoagulation be re-started post procedure? Based on the unique features of warfarin versus the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), a unique, personalized plan should be developed and tailored to the individual patient. Anticoagulant specialists, such as anticoagulation clinic pharmacists, may help facilitate this process.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1161x5Qh]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy — CHEST clinical practice guideline scope and strong recommendations — addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions for patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy who require an elective surgery/procedure; it is separated into four broad categories (vitamin K antagonist [VKA]; perioperative heparin bridging while receiving a VKA; direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]; antiplatelet drug) and generates strong or conditional practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations, of which two are strong recommendations: against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation and continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation; separate recommendations address minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data sources and searches

We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses (PRISMA) guidelines 7 and performed a search of PubMed, Ovid and Elsevier, and Cochrane Library for published randomized and observational studies in English from January 1, 2000 to August 30, 2016. We searched with keywords "long‐term oral anticoagulant", "chronic oral anticoagulant", "periprocedural anticoagulant", "perioperative anticoagulant", "uninterrupted anticoagulant", "continued oral anticoagulant", "interrupted anticoagulant", "unfractionated heparin bridging", and "low‐molecular‐weight heparin bridging". References of articles and previous meta‐analyses were also reviewed to confirm that no studies were missed.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^111iewh1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have quickly become attractive alternatives to the long-standing standard of care in anticoagulation, vitamin K antagonist. DOACs are indicated for prevention and treatment of several cardiovascular conditions. Since the first approval in 2010, DOACs have emerged as leading therapeutic alternatives that provide both clinicians and patients with more effective, safe, and convenient treatment options in thromboembolic settings. With the expanding role of DOACs, clinicians are faced with increasingly complex decisions relating to appropriate agent, duration of treatment, and use in special populations. This review will provide an overview of DOACs and act as a practical reference for clinicians to optimize DOAC use among common challenging scenarios. Topics addressed include (1) appropriate indications; (2) use in patients with specific comorbidities; (3) monitoring parameters; (4) transitioning between anticoagulant regimens; (5) major drug interactions; and (6) cost considerations.

Bridge therapy — evidence on perioperative heparin bridging for vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — indicates limited benefit: A meta-analysis of 34 studies (total of 12,278 patients included) of vitamin K antagonist users undergoing elective procedures found no difference in thrombotic events between bridged and unbridged groups; two randomized trials (PERIOP2 and BRIDGE) assessing bridging patients on warfarin found no reduction in thromboembolic events versus placebo; and in DOAC-treated atrial fibrillation patients (PAUSE), discontinuing DOACs without heparin bridging yielded low thromboembolic event rates. The text also notes that, for certain patients, the risks of bridging may outweigh the benefits.

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116aSsRZ]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline on the Perioperative Management of Antithrombotic Therapy addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions related to the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and require an elective surgery/procedure. This guideline is separated into four broad categories, encompassing the management of patients who are receiving: (1) a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), mainly warfarin; (2) if receiving a VKA, the use of perioperative heparin bridging, typically with a low-molecular-weight heparin; (3) a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC); and (4) an antiplatelet drug.

Methods

Strong or conditional practice recommendations are generated based on high, moderate, low, and very low certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for clinical practice guidelines.

Results

A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations for the perioperative management of VKAs, heparin bridging, DOACs, and antiplatelet drugs, of which two are strong recommendations: (1) against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation; and (2) continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation. There are separate recommendations on the perioperative management of patients who are undergoing minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

Conclusions

Substantial new evidence has emerged since the 2012 iteration of these guidelines, especially to inform best practices for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a VKA and may require heparin bridging, for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a DOAC, and for patients who are receiving one or more antiplatelet drugs. Despite this new knowledge, uncertainty remains as to best practices for the majority of perioperative management questions.

### Perioperative care of patients at high risk for stroke during or after non-cardiac, non-neurological surgery: 2020 guidelines from the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care [^115PRh2i]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2020). High credibility.

Perioperative bridging of anticoagulation management (Table 4) specifies timing for medication holds, resumption, and bridging with low–molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH). For high thromboembolic risk on warfarin, "Give last dose 6 d before operation, bridge with LMWH or UFH, resume 24 h postoperatively"; for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), use "Give last dose 3 d before operation, resume 2–3 d postoperatively" for high bleeding risk procedures and "Give last dose 2 d before operation, resume 24 h postoperatively" for low bleeding risk procedures. For intermediate thromboembolic risk on warfarin, "determine need for bridging by clinician judgment and current evidence" with "Give last dose 6 d before operation" and "resume 24 h postoperatively"; DOAC timing mirrors these high- and low-bleeding risk schedules. For low thromboembolic risk on warfarin, "bridging not recommended" with "Give last dose 6 d before operation" and "resume 24 h postoperatively"; DOAC timing is the same as above. For dabigatran with creatinine clearance (CrCl) " ≤ 50 mL/min", the footnote directs that "the last dose should be given 3 days before the procedure for low bleeding risk surgery, and 4 to 5 days before the procedure for high bleeding risk operation".

Importance

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are commonly used medications to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Decisions about how to manage DOACs in patients undergoing a surgical or nonsurgical procedure are important to decrease the risks of bleeding and thromboembolism.

Observations

For elective surgical or nonsurgical procedures, a standardized approach to perioperative DOAC management involves classifying the risk of procedure-related bleeding as minimal (eg, minor dental or skin procedures), low to moderate (eg, cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair), or high risk (eg, major cancer or joint replacement procedures). For patients undergoing minimal bleeding risk procedures, DOACs may be continued, or if there is concern about excessive bleeding, DOACs may be discontinued on the day of the procedure. Patients undergoing a low to moderate bleeding risk procedure should typically discontinue DOACs 1 day before the operation and restart DOACs 1 day after. Patients undergoing a high bleeding risk procedure should stop DOACs 2 days prior to the operation and restart DOACs 2 days after. With this perioperative DOAC management strategy, rates of thromboembolism (0.2%-0.4%) and major bleeding (1%-2%) are low and delays or cancellations of surgical and nonsurgical procedures are infrequent. Patients taking DOACs who need emergent (< 6 hours after presentation) or urgent surgical procedures (6–24 hours after presentation) experience bleeding rates up to 23% and thromboembolism as high as 11%. Laboratory testing to measure preoperative DOAC levels may be useful to determine whether patients should receive a DOAC reversal agent (eg, prothrombin complex concentrates, idarucizumab, or andexanet-α) prior to an emergent or urgent procedure.

Conclusions and Relevance

When patients who are taking a DOAC require an elective surgical or nonsurgical procedure, standardized management protocols can be applied that do not require testing DOAC levels or heparin bridging. When patients taking a DOAC require an emergent, urgent, or semiurgent surgical procedure, anticoagulant reversal agents may be appropriate when DOAC levels are elevated or not available.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1139gwNk]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative antithrombotic management — scope and PICO framework include the following: Approximately 15% to 20% of patients who are receiving anticoagulant therapy will require a surgery/procedure annually, and 10% to 15% of patients with coronary stents will require surgery within 2 years of implantation, highlighting the clinical burden. The current American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines have expanded to address 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions, and the aims are (1) to provide evidence-based recommendations for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving antithrombotic therapy; and (2) to provide practical guidance to clinicians for managing such patients in the perioperative period. The PICO questions and guideline statements are separated into four broad categories: patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) focused on warfarin, among patients receiving a VKA the use of perioperative heparin bridging, patients receiving a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), and patients receiving an antiplatelet drug.

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^116GFjDS]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which include apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, are now first‐line therapy for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). Many patients taking chronic anticoagulant therapy will require temporary interruption for a surgical procedure. Management of the anticoagulant in the perioperative period can be complicated because the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent differ, most significantly as compared with warfarin.

Because of its long half‐life, warfarin is often interrupted several days before the procedure. For patients with a high risk of thrombotic complications, "bridging" therapy with low molecular weight heparin or other short‐acting parenteral anticoagulants are frequently used while the anticoagulant activity of warfarin wanes or returns to therapeutic range. This practice, however, is associated with higher risk of bleeding compared with those in whom bridging therapy was not initiated. In contrast to warfarin, DOACs have both a short half‐life and rapid onset of action, which make them ideal for perioperative use and removes the necessity of bridging anticoagulation. Prior studies have compared postoperative outcomes of patients following the perioperative interruption of DOACs vs. warfarin and found no major differences in postoperative rates of major bleeding or thromboembolic events. However, because these were post hoc analyses of clinical trials, the patient samples include a more selective population that is commonly seen in routine clinical practice. Therefore, we aimed to compare 30‐day postoperative bleeding and thromboembolic events associated with DOAC versus warfarin management in the perioperative period in a practice‐based cohort of patients.

### Anticoagulation therapy: perioperative anticoagulation-are we at' a bridge too far'? [^116HWte5]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

The perioperative management of patients with atrial fibrillation who require an elective surgical or other invasive procedure is an area of ongoing uncertainty. Accumulating evidence from observational studies suggests that the use of bridging anticoagulation with heparin, although well-intentioned, might not reduce perioperative thromboembolism and can increase bleeding.

Clinical Considerations in Incorporating DOACs in the Management of VTE

Recently published antithrombotic guidelines support the use of DOAC agents over VKA therapy (Grade 2B recommendation) in patients with DVT or PE without cancer. Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk, and thus, clinicians need to consider a number of clinical issues to optimize treatment. Assessment of the following factors may be helpful in selecting one DOAC over another or, alternatively, oral anticoagulation with a VKA.

Pharmacokinetic and Dosing Considerations

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of DOACs have been well described. Because the DOACs have predictable and stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, unlike VKAs, routine monitoring of anticoagulant activity is not required. However, it is important to note that in clinical scenarios where the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response may be altered significantly (eg, organ dysfunction or drug-drug interactions), there currently is no readily available coagulation assay approved in the United States that can precisely assess the level of anticoagulation for any of the DOACs. For information on currently available coagulation assays to measure the level of anticoagulation with DOACs, the reader is referred to several recent reviews. Despite this gap, the great majority of patients can be appropriately managed with standard fixed doses for each DOAC, which greatly simplifies many aspects of patient management compared with VKAs. The potential for dosing errors with DOACs is still present, however. The 4 agents have achieved regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of acute or chronic VTE, each with a different dosing scheme that may differ by indication, adding some complexity for the clinician when selecting the appropriate dose. Table 1 highlights the approved dosing regimens per indication for the DOACs available in the United States.

Depending on the health care setting, clinicians may routinely interact with patients on different DOACs, and care must be taken to ensure appropriateness of the chosen therapy and initial dose. In addition, transition from injectable agent to oral DOAC (dabigatran, edoxaban) or from oral high dose to oral maintenance dose (rivaroxaban at 21 days, apixaban at 7 days) should be implemented at the appropriate juncture. Particularly at times of transitions of care (ie, bridging), the practitioner may be faced with multiple decisions regarding switching agents or alternative anticoagulation. Data to support best practice in switching from VKA to a DOAC or vice versa are, however, limited, although the phase 3 DOAC trials in VTE and atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as best practice reports provide some information.-

### Management of periprocedural anticoagulation: a survey of contemporary practice [^115QknN2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Interruption of oral anticoagulation (AC) for surgery or an invasive procedure is a complicated process. Practice guidelines provide only general recommendations, and care of such patients occurs across multiple specialties. The availability of direct oral anticoagulants further complicates decision making and guidance here is limited. To evaluate current practice patterns in the United States for bridging AC, a survey was developed by the American College of Cardiology Anticoagulation Work Group. The goal of the survey was to assess how general and subspecialty cardiologists, internists, gastroenterologists, and orthopedic surgeons currently manage patients who receive AC and undergo surgery or an invasive procedure. The survey was completed by 945 physicians involved in the periprocedural management of AC. The results provide a template for educational and research projects geared toward the development of clinical pathways and point-of-care tools to improve this area of health care.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1122fZyw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Postprocedural anticoagulation management in patients on oral anticoagulants specifies that once adequate postprocedural hemostasis is achieved, anticoagulation should likely be restarted expeditiously. For procedures with low postprocedural bleeding risk, anticoagulation can likely be restarted 24 hours after the procedure, whereas if postprocedural bleeding risk is higher, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation should be delayed for 48 to 72 hours. For patients at high thrombotic risk who will be restarting VKA therapy, bridging anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulants may be considered once hemostasis is achieved, but such bridging is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and no decrease in thrombotic events in nonvalvular AF; if a DOAC is used postprocedurally, bridging anticoagulation should not be used. When surgeries or procedures are performed to control bleeding, restarting anticoagulation after the procedure may carry a higher bleeding risk; if the source of bleeding is identified and completely corrected with adequate hemostasis, restarting anticoagulation may be reasonable, and individualized strategies with close clinical monitoring apply when bleeding was not successfully controlled by surgical/procedural management.

Recognize that decisions on bridging therapy should balance the risks of stroke and bleeding.

### Peri-procedural management of patients taking oral anticoagulants [^116Ywy1q]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The use of oral anticoagulants is becoming increasingly common. For many years warfarin was the main oral anticoagulant available, but therapeutic options have expanded with the introduction of oral direct thrombin (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). Management of patients taking any oral anticoagulant in the peri-procedural period poses a challenge to medical and surgical providers because of the competing risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage. Bridging therapy has been used to minimize time without anticoagulation when warfarin is interrupted for invasive procedures, but validated strategies based on high quality data are lacking. Existing data suggest that the use of bridging therapy may increase the risk of bleeding for some patients without reducing the risk of thrombosis. Clinical trials are currently under way to answer these questions. Because the half lives and time to anticoagulant activity of newer oral anticoagulants are shorter than for warfarin, bridging therapy is not thought to be necessary with these agents. Peri-procedural management of patients taking these agents is complicated by the lack of demonstrated reversal agents in emergency situations, although specific antidotes are being developed and tested. Existing guidelines for peri-procedural management of patients on oral anticoagulants highlight the importance of individualized patient decision making and suggest strategies to minimize complications. From a patient's perspective, given the uncertainties surrounding optimal management, explicit discussions regarding risks and benefits of treatment options and demonstration of effective communication among medical and surgical providers are essential.

Periprocedural anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation when uninterrupted therapy is not feasible — interruption and resumption: If a procedure cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging is recommended (1) excluding those with recent stroke or TIA or a mechanical valve; the timing of interruption of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk (1); bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered except in patients with a mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA (3: Harm); and resumption of anticoagulation is the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery (2a).

### Discontinuation and management of direct-acting anticoagulants for emergency procedures [^115AdpZY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patients taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) who then need an emergency invasive procedure require specialized management strategies. Appropriate patient evaluation includes assessment of the current anticoagulation state, including timing of the last dose. DOACs require particular coagulation assays to measure anticoagulation levels accurately, although standard coagulation screening tests may provide qualitative guidance. Specialty societies have endorsed general recommendations for patient management to promote hemostasis in anticoagulated patients requiring surgery or other invasive procedures. These include general stopping rules (such as ≥ 24 hours for low-risk procedures and ≥ 48 hours for high-risk surgery with normal renal function) for elective procedures. Bridging therapy when oral anticoagulant treatment is interrupted has recently been questioned, depending on the clinical scenario. Novel agents for the reversal of DOAC-induced anticoagulation have recently been developed. Idarucizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that selectively binds dabigatran, was recently approved for clinical use in patients with life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, and for patients requiring emergency interventions. Idarucizumab can streamline the pre- and periprocedural anticoagulation management of dabigatran-treated patients, as it provides fast, complete, and sustainable reversibility. Andexanet alfa is an inactive, decoy factor Xa (FXa) molecule that binds FXa inhibitors, and ciraparantag is a synthetic molecule designed to bind fractionated and unfractionated heparins, and each of the currently approved DOACs. As clinical development of the additional anti-FXa-specific anticoagulant reversal agents proceeds, the respective role of each in the management of emergency bleeding events and invasive procedures will be better defined, and it is hoped they will make important contributions to patient care.

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^112phF81]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Our study suggests that the periprocedural interruption of DOACs may be associated with a higher incidence of 30‐day minor bleeds, major bleeds, and bleeds requiring medical therapy when compared with the interruption of nonbridged warfarin. However, no difference in bleeding or thromboembolic events was noted between patients with warfarin who received bridging therapy and DOAC‐treated patients. Further studies that investigate the effects of perioperative interruption of DOACs and warfarin on postoperative outcomes while addressing potential issues of confounding variables are warranted.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Periprocedural management of anticoagulation (AC) for patients who need percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — If PCI is elective and can be delayed until treatment with AC therapy is complete, it is preferable to postpone the procedure; in emergencies AC therapy should be stopped and PCI should be performed without delay, and activated clotting time may not be a reliable indicator of anticoagulation for patients taking a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). For patients awaiting elective or urgent PCI when safe to defer briefly, we recommend the following: for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy, defer until the INR is ≤ 2.0 (some catheterization laboratories may use ≤ 1.5) and thresholds may differ by radial versus femoral access; for DOAC therapy, defer per Table 5, which also discusses bridging and notes there is likely no value in bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) because of similar pharmacokinetic properties to DOAC.

### Clinicians' adherence to guidelines for the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants in a tertiary hospital: a retrospective study [^112gLttB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite clear, relatively easy-to-use guidance, many clinicians find the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) challenging. Inappropriate management can delay procedures and lead to haemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications. We aimed to describe preoperative management practices regarding DOACs in a tertiary hospital and clinicians' adherence to in-house recommendations.

Method

We included all patients being treated with DOACs who underwent elective surgery in 2019 and 2020 (n = 337). In-house recommendations for perioperative management were largely comparable to the 2022 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines.

Results

Typical patients were older adults with multiple comorbidities and high thrombotic risk stratification scores, and 65.6% (n = 221) had not undergone recommended preoperative anticoagulation management protocols. Patients operated on using local anaesthesia (adjusted OR = 0.30, 95%CI 0.14–0.66; p < 0.01) were less likely to have been treated following institutional recommendations, but no association between their procedure's bleeding risk and adherence was found. Clinicians' failures to adhere to recommendations mostly involved late or non-indicated interruptions of anticoagulation treatment (n = 89, 26.4%) or inappropriate heparin bridging (n = 54, 16.0%). Forty-five (13.3%) procedures had to be postponed. Incorrect preoperative anticoagulation management was directly responsible for 12/45 postponements (26.7% of postponements).

Conclusion

This study highlights clinicians' low adherence rates to institutional recommendations for patients treated with DOACs scheduled for elective surgery in a tertiary hospital centre. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical study addressing the issue of clinicians' adherence to guidelines for the preoperative management of DOACs. Going beyond the issue of whether clinicians are knowledgeable about guidelines or have them available, this study questions how generalisable guidelines are in a tertiary hospital managing many highly polymorbid patients.

Further studies should identify the causes of poor adherence.

2.2 Data retrieval and quality evaluation

Included studies met all of the following criteria: patients ≥ 18 years of age, long‐term use of oral anticoagulant before a procedure, elective invasive procedure or surgery, comparison of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation and non‐bridging management (continuous oral anticoagulation or interrupted oral anticoagulation without bridging therapy), reporting of both thromboembolic and bleeding events, and articles published in peer‐reviewed journals. Studies with unclear reporting of thromboembolic or bleeding events, case reports, or letters to the editor were excluded. Studies with no control arm or designed specific to patients using novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were also excluded. Two authors (H.C.K. and F.L.L.) independently reviewed and collected data, including study design, patient characteristics of interest and relevant outcomes. The third blinded reviewer (Y.H.T.) resolved any disagreements between reviewers.

Patients were classified as bridged if they received any bridging therapy with UFH or LMWH in the periprocedural period. Patients were classified as non‐bridged if they interrupted oral anticoagulation without heparin bridging or continued use of oral anticoagulants during periprocedural period. Classification of high and low thromboembolic risk was based on the definitions described in the primary studies.

Primary outcomes were thromboembolic events and overall bleeding events. Secondary outcome was major bleeding events. Thromboembolic events were defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism occurring during the follow‐up period. Major bleeding was defined as a need for transfusion, drop in hemoglobin > 2 g/L, requirement for surgical hemostasis, need for rehospitalization, intracranial hemorrhage, or fatal bleeding.

Study quality was assessed with criteria adapted from the Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, ninth ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence‐Based Clinical Practice Guidelines. 8 Disagreements on data acquisition were resolved by consensus with the third reviewer.

Anticoagulant therapy — Perioperative management should account for pharmacokinetics and organ function, bridging should be based upon risk of thromboembolism in patients with an indication for anticoagulation, and administration of a direct oral anticoagulant reversal agent for FXa inhibitors is not recommended if intraoperative unfractionated heparin (UFH) is needed because the reversal agent also reverses UFH, requiring significantly higher doses to achieve the target activated clotting time (ACT).

4 DISCUSSION

Among the 1323 warfarin patients and 525 DOAC patients who underwent surgical procedure requiring perioperative interruption, rates of minor bleeding, major bleeding, and bleeding requiring an emergency department visit were lower for patients treated with warfarin and no bridging therapy than for DOAC‐treated patients following IPTW weighting. There were no differences in thromboembolic events between warfarin‐treated patients without bridging and DOAC‐treated patients, and no differences between warfarin‐treated patients with bridging and DOAC‐treated patients. IPTW analysis indicates that DOAC use contributed most greatly to the differences in bleeding rates between the two cohorts.

Given the large body of evidence associating bridging therapy with increased bleeding risk, it was unsurprising that the bridged warfarin cohort had a numerically higher bleeding rate than to our unbridged warfarin cohort. Our bridged warfarin cohort saw similar outcomes with our DOAC cohort with regard to bleeding and thromboembolic events. In contrast to warfarin, DOACs have both a short half‐life and fast onset of action and thus do not require bridging. This leads to a shortened time between the surgical procedure and when a DOAC medication is stopped or restarted as compared to warfarin. It is thus not unexpected that the addition of a fast‐acting bridging agent in our bridged warfarin cohort to result in similar rates of bleeding compared to our DOAC cohort.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients with AF, preprocedural bridging, ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that decisions about bridging therapy (UFH or LMWH) in patients with AF without mechanical heart valves requiring interruption of warfarin for procedures should balance the risks of stroke and bleeding and the duration of time the patient will not be anticoagulated.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1158iCqD]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease — planned interruption of VKA and bridging — When interruption of oral VKA therapy is deemed necessary, the agent is usually stopped 3 to 4 days before the procedure and restarted postoperatively as soon as bleeding risk allows; bridging with intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is started when the INR falls below the therapeutic threshold (ie, 2.0 or 2.5), usually 36 to 48 hours before surgery, and is stopped 4 to 6 hours (intravenous UFH) or 12 hours (subcutaneous LMWH) before the procedure. There are no randomized comparative-effectiveness trials in adequate numbers of prosthetic heart valve patients, evidence derives mostly from cohort studies with poor or no comparator groups, and in other patient groups bridging therapy exposes patients to higher bleeding risks without reducing thromboembolism; accordingly, decisions about bridging should be individualized and account for the tradeoffs between thrombosis and bleeding.

Heparin bridging — management points should be considered when administering heparin bridging, including that bridging is most often done with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) using a therapeutic-dose regimen (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid); bridging with therapeutic-dose IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) is another treatment option, for example, in patients with severe renal insufficiency or who are dialysis-dependent; and other types of heparin bridging may include intermediate-dose regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid). Heparin bridging should be administered in a manner to minimize the risk for bleeding that would require re-operation or another intervention, and avoidance of major bleeding is important because it typically requires a longer period of anticoagulant interruption that, in turn, exposes patients to an increased risk for thromboembolism.

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^1118PP1p]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

### International consensus statement on the peri-operative management of direct oral anticoagulants in cardiac surgery [^112dHq1a]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Despite current recommendations on the management of severe peri-operative bleeding, there is no pragmatic guidance for the peri-operative monitoring and management of cardiac surgical patients taking direct oral anticoagulants. Members of the Transfusion and Haemostasis Subcommittee of the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology, of their own volition, performed an independent systematic review of peer-reviewed original research, review articles and case reports and developed the following consensus statement. This has been endorsed by the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology. In our opinion, most patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy presenting for elective cardiac surgery can be safely managed in the peri-operative period if the following conditions are fulfilled: direct oral anticoagulants have been discontinued two days before cardiac surgery, corresponding to five elimination half-live periods; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or a high risk of bleeding, a pre-operative plasma level of direct oral anticoagulants has been determined and found to be below 30 ng.ml -1 (currently only valid for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban). In cases where plasma level monitoring is not possible (e.g. assay was not available), discontinuation for 10 elimination half-live periods (four days) is required. For FXa inhibitors, a standard heparin-calibrated anti-Xa level of < 0.1 IU.ml -1 should be measured, indicating sufficient reduction in the anticoagulant effect. Finally, short-term bridging with heparin is not required in the pre-operative period.

Device surgery evidence — bridging and DOAC management: Periprocedural unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin bridging has been associated with an increased risk of pocket hematoma after pacemaker or ICD procedures; BRUISE-CONTROL randomized elective device surgery patients with atrial fibrillation or a mechanical valve (estimated annual stroke risk ≥ 5%) to continued warfarin versus interruption with bridging; two RCTs and several observational studies have shown little or no difference in pocket hematoma and thromboembolic events with DOACs in device surgery; and lead extraction procedures are generally considered high bleeding risk and should be treated as such with warfarin interrupted, with occasional exceptions.

It also notes that "antithrombotics may be continued in low-risk category" based on clinical conditions and shared decision making.

### Short-term risk of bleeding during heparin bridging at initiation of vitamin K antagonist therapy in more than 90 000 patients with Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation managed in outpatient care [^112FM2o4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), a treatable risk factor for ischemic stroke, is considered a worldwide epidemic predicted to increase in the coming decades. Indeed, in 2010, the estimated global prevalence of AF was 33.5 million. 1 Oral anticoagulation is the cornerstone treatment for NVAF patients with a moderate or high risk of thromboembolic complication. 2

Although direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have been on the market since 2010, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs: warfarin, acenocoumarol, fluindione) remain a standard treatment in the management of NVAF.

Recently, several studies have examined the risks of bleeding and of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (IS/SE) associated with perioperative heparin bridging anticoagulation in patients with NVAF. 3, 4, 5, 6 However, no studies have investigated bridging risks during VKA initiation in outpatient settings.

It has been shown that the bleeding risk is highest during the first month of VKA initiation. 7 This risk may be greatest when a VKA is combined with another antithrombotic agent, particularly in patients for whom a bridging therapy is indicated. Bridging therapy at the initiation of VKA therapy consists of transitioning a bridging agent (low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH] or other pentasaccharide, eg, fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin) to a VKA.

There is an overall consensus in favor of a bridging therapy prior to urgent cardioversion in patients with life‐threatening hemodynamic instability caused by new‐onset NVAF. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 The recommendation in guidelines 9, 10, 12 and summaries of product characteristics 14, 15 is less clear for those with stable NVAF who do not require rapid anticoagulation. In real‐life conditions, a bridging regimen is commonly used in those with a low stroke risk. 16, 17, 18, 19 This practice is not supported by evidence.

VKA use has declined recently in favor of direct oral anticoagulants; however, the latest available results have shown that they are still more widely used than direct oral anticoagulants. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 Since millions of patients worldwide may be at risk of being unnecessarily exposed to bridging therapy, adverse health outcomes associated with management of VKA still warrant investigation.

Therefore, the purpose of this cohort study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a bridging regimen during the initiation of VKA therapy in NVAF patients in outpatient care.

### Is percutaneous coronary intervention safe during uninterrupted direct oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndromes? [^115foSSZ]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Consensus documents also state that parenteral bridging after DOACs interruption in patients without high thrombosis risk is not indicated due to their short half-lives. This statement has been recently confirmed by the large Perioperative Anticoagulation Use for Surgery Evaluation (PAUSE) trial that recently included about 3000 AF patients on long-term DOACs scheduled for an elective surgery or procedure. The PAUSE demonstrated that a perioperative management strategy without heparin bridging was associated with low rates of major bleeding and arterial thromboembolism. Nevertheless, bridging therapies has been largely used even in our series, since one-third of patients in the IDOAC group received an LMWH before PCI. This aspect, together with the need to improve the periprocedural antithrombotic management and outcome, especially in patients on long-term anticoagulation therapy, should deserve specific education campaigns.

Study limitations

Our study must be evaluated in the light of the known limitations of observational, cross-sectional studies. In addition, even though the participating centres were asked to include in the registry all consecutive ACS patients with AF requiring coronary stents, we were not able to verify the enrolment process due to the absence of administrative auditing. However, based on the number of AF patients enrolled in previous nationwide registries on ACS, we believe that the rate of patients enrolled is reliable, and it is unlikely that a selective enrolment in a few sites may have substantially changed the study results. Furthermore, besides the differences in the perioperative use of DOACs, other variables not considered or included in the multivariable analysis on NACE at 6 months may have influenced our results. Finally, our sample size may not be sufficient to cover small but clinically significant differences in bleeding and thrombotic complications between UDOAC and IDOAC strategies, and the sample size is limited for subgroup analyses. In spite of these limitations, we feel that our data may be used to guide the treatment of patients with ACS and concomitant AF on long-term DOAC undergoing PCI.

### Perioperative bridging anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1146jfak]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) was published by Douketis JD and colleagues in 2015 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism, Deep vein thrombosis, Atrial fibrillation, Periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy and Perioperative bleeding. In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the trial question was: is forgoing bridging anticoagulation noninferior to perioperative bridging in patients with AF? In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the population was: 1884 patients (502 female, 1382 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AF who need an interruption in warfarin treatment (5 days before the procedure) for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure. The key exclusion criteria were a mechanical heart valve; stroke, systemic embolism, or TIA within the previous 12 weeks; major bleeding within the previous 6 weeks; CrCl of < 30 mL/min; platelet count of < 100×10⁹/L, or planned cardiac, intracranial, or intraspinal surgery. In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the interventions were: n = 950 avoiding routine bridging (matching subcutaneous placebo BID) n = 934 routine bridging therapy (100 IU dalteparin per kg of body weight administered SC BID from 3 days before the procedure until 24h before the procedure and then 5–10 days after the procedure). In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in arterial thromboembolism at 30 days after the procedure (0.4% vs. 0.3%; AD 0.1%, 95% CI -0.6 to 0.8). In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death (0.5% vs. 0.4%; AD 0.1%, 95% CI -1.1 to 1.3) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (0.8% vs. 1.6%; ARD -0.8, 95% CI -1.75 to 0.15) No significant difference in DVT (0% vs. 0.1%; ARD -0.1, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.07). In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in major bleeding (1.3% vs. 3.2%), minor bleeding (12.0% vs. 20.9%). In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the conclusion was: in patients with AF who need an interruption in warfarin treatment (5 days before the procedure) for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure, avoiding routine bridging was noninferior to routine bridging therapy with respect to arterial thromboembolism at 30 days after the procedure.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anticoagulation management — vitamin K antagonist (VKA) interruption, bridging, and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) resumption — is summarized as follows: In atrial fibrillation (AF) patients on VKA, the BRIDGE trial randomized 1844 patients to low-molecular-weight heparin bridging or placebo starting 3 days preoperatively and continued 5 days postoperatively, with warfarin held from preoperative day 5 through postoperative day 1, and bridging anticoagulation was noninferior for prevention of thromboembolism but increased the risk of major bleeding; a simple DOAC interruption strategy without heparin bridging resulted in minimal time off DOAC with low bleeding and low thromboembolic risk, and among approximately 11% of DOAC-treated patients who received heparin bridging bleeding risk increased without reduction in thromboembolic risk, so most patients with AF will not benefit from bridging anticoagulation. For resumption after interruption, once hemostasis is achieved after a low or moderate bleeding risk procedure it is reasonable to restart VKA as early as 12 to 24 hours and it is suggested to resume VKA at the previous therapeutic dose, whereas DOACs should be resumed when full anticoagulation is clinically appropriate, which may be as early as 6 hours postoperatively if hemostasis has occurred; in the PAUSE trial, DOACs were resumed 48 to 72 hours after high bleeding risk procedures.

Regarding medical management for colonoscopy, more specifically with respect to management of anticoagulant therapy, postprocedural, ASGE 2016 guidelines recommend to consider delaying reinitiation of direct acting anticoagulants after high-risk endoscopic procedures until adequate hemostasis is ensured, given their rapid onset of action and lack of reversal agents. Consider administering thromboprophylaxis (UFH, bridge) if therapeutic doses of direct acting anticoagulants cannot be restarted within 12–24 hours after a high-risk endoscopic procedure, to decrease the risk of thromboembolism, given the short half-life of the direct acting anticoagulant agent, in patients with a high risk for thromboembolism.

### Clinicians' adherence to guidelines for the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants in a tertiary hospital: a retrospective study [^113f7HFF]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study's main objective was to evaluate clinicians' adherence to our institution's recommendations for the preoperative management of DOACs, which are largely based on the 2022 ACCP guidelines. This evaluation took place over a two-year period in our tertiary hospital centre. Surprisingly, only one-third of the patients were treated in adherence with the DOAC management protocol suggested to clinicians in our institutional recommendations. Although patient recruitment occurred in 2019 and 2020, our recommendations were very similar to the 2022 ACCP guidelines, allowing a valid evaluation with them. It is of note that our institutional recommendations suggest heparin bridging for patients who have recently undergone a thromboembolic event (< 3 months previously), whereas the ACCP guidelines do not recommend this. However, non-adherence to heparin bridging recommendations involved less than 1% of the 65.1% of non-adherent cases. Other exceptions were the recommendations for minimal-bleeding-risk procedures, which were included in the low-risk procedures category, as in the PAUSE study. Patients were therefore considered to be non-adherent when clinicians did not stop their DOAC treatment for minimal-bleeding-risk procedures (except flutter ablations and cardioversions, which were excluded from the study).

### Who are we bridging? Description of warfarin patients receiving injectable bridging therapy [^115cZLCW]. Thrombosis Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The evidence guiding the decision to provide injectable anticoagulant bridging therapy during periods of subtherapeutic warfarin anticoagulation is sparse. This study aims to identify the types of patients currently bridged within an academic medical center's Thrombosis Service, to highlight patient populations for future study of bridging outcomes.

Methods

This descriptive cohort study included patients taking warfarin managed by University of Utah Health Thrombosis Service who received outpatient enoxaparin bridging between January 1 and December 31, 2022. Anticoagulation indication, reason for bridging, and type of procedure were validated via manual chart review.

Results

During the one-year study period, 181 unique patients (9.4% of the service's total warfarin population) experienced 244 bridging episodes, mostlyin the periprocedural setting (67.6%) for gastrointestinal-type procedures (39.4%). The most common anticoagulation indications in all bridged patients were antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (23.2%), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (21.5%), or a mechanical mitral valve plus another indication (13.3%). Most bridging episodes for VTE occurred > 3 months from the acute event, with the rationale for bridging including breakthrough VTE (31%) or APS (23%). Just over one-half of bridged patients fit the guideline-recommended criteria for high thrombotic risk, and just over one-third were low-moderate thrombotic risk.

Conclusions

In this one-year outpatient study, warfarin patients received enoxaparin bridging most commonly due to a gastrointestinal procedural interruption in the setting of APS, VTE with a prior breakthrough thrombotic event, or mechanical mitral valve. Just over one-third of bridged patients were guideline-classified as low-moderate thrombotic risk, indicating these populations may warrant further investigation or bridging de-escalation.

### Surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part two: antiplatelet agents and perioperative management of long-term anticoagulation [^114QvcTb]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

With the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, no strong evidence to support bridging exists currently. These anticoagulants have a shorter half-life and faster onset making the benefits of bridging less obvious. A study from the European Dresden registry from 2014 demonstrated that in patients taking nonvitamin K antagonists, heparin bridging did not reduce cardiovascular events, and major bleeding again was more frequent with bridging than without. Additionally, the HASBLED scoring system used to gauge the risk of hemorrhage can also be used to estimate risk of hemorrhage heparin bridging during warfarin cessation. Recommendations are unclear regarding the efficacy and need for bridging with DOACs.

Re-initiation of oral anticoagulation: The decision to restart anticoagulation after a procedure is again determined by weighing the risks for thromboembolism against that of hemorrhage. If hemostasis is assured after the procedure, vitamin K antagonists can be restarted 6–24 hours after surgery as therapeutic levels will take several days to reach. If periprocedural bridging is being used, patients at low risk of bleeding can resume bridging at 24 hours and those at higher bleed risk at 48–72 hours for all high-risk patients. Non-vitamin K antagonists could potentially be resumed after 6–24 hours in patients with low bleeding risk if hemostasis is assured, bearing in mind that these agents have a much faster time of onset. Those with higher bleeding risk should wait 48–72 hours prior to restarting and could be considered for bridging with heparin if the risk of thromboembolism is also high.

Valvular heart disease — NOAC use and bridging considerations with bioprosthetic valves — Although phase III trials comparing non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with warfarin excluded patients with moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves, some included other valvular heart disease and bioprosthetic valve replacement or repair; many patients late after bioprosthetic valve replacement or native valve repair are treated safely with direct oral anticoagulants, and bridging decisions in these individuals can follow the same strategy as for atrial fibrillation without moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthesis.

In-house recommendations adherence

Only 116 patients (34.4%) had followed our institution's anticoagulation management recommendations, which are mainly based on the ACCP guidelines. Of the 221 (65.6%) who had not followed this protocol (Fig. 2), the majority (n = 89, 26.4%) had had their treatment prematurely interrupted (DOAC stopped before the recommended D -1 or D -2 before surgery), 54 (16.0%) underwent heparin bridging despite it not being recommended, 28 (8.3%) cases had no data (n = 28, 8.3%) and 27 (8.0%) patients had their treatment interrupted too late (on D -1 instead of D -2). Overall, 19/54 (35.2%) patients who underwent heparin bridging had had a thromboembolic event < 3 months previously, and 35/54 (64.8%) had had a thromboembolic event > 3 months previously. Twenty patients (5.9%) did not have their anticoagulant treatment interrupted, and only three (0.9%) patients had not undergone heparin bridging according to our institutional recommendations (thromboembolic event < 3 months previously).

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^111ziJQZ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

The key strength of our study is the use of our IPTW statistical analysis, which is able to account for various potential confounding variables in the warfarin and DOAC cohorts while maintaining statistical power and generalizability. This approach was not taken with most other studies comparing DOAC and warfarin outcomes in the perioperative period. Although each of those analyses were conducted on randomized, controlled trial populations and thus reduce the effect of confounding variables on outcomes, the samples for these studies are limited to patients who are eligible for randomization. In contrast, our data were not limited to patients eligible for randomization, therefore representing a potentially more generalizable estimate of adverse event rates. Last, our analysis distinguishes between warfarin‐treated patients into both a bridged and a nonbridged cohort, which is critical given the strong evidence associating use of bridging therapy with increased bleeding risk.

Despite these strengths, certain limitations must be acknowledged. First, the modest sample sizes and inclusion of patients from one geographic region may limit generalizability. Second, data on exact perioperative management of DOACs was not available for this analysis. Therefore, it is unclear whether our DOAC perioperative interruption practices are fully consistent with the PAUSE protocol. Third, as with any retrospective cohort study, our analysis is only as accurate as what is depicted in our electronic health records and cannot account for things such as misinformation or lapses in data. Fourth, although the use of IPTW methodology significantly reduces the impact of confounding in the analysis, covariate balance between the two groups are notably different before and after the probability weighting is applied. Fifth, data on the rationale for why bridging was or was not given were not available in the MAQI 2 dataset. Sixth, we do not have data on the use of prophylactic‐dose heparin in the periprocedural period. Seventh, we are only able to comment on association, not causation. Last, although we used a fairly comprehensive list of confounding variables for our matching procedure, it is possible that there are other confounding factors that were not included and influenced our results.

### Interrupted versus uninterrupted anticoagulation for cardiac rhythm management device insertion [^114sFpkX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Guideline-recommended strategies to interrupt chronic anticoagulation with warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) during the perioperative period of cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) surgery differ worldwide. There is uncertainty concerning the benefits and harms of interrupted and uninterrupted anticoagulation in patients undergoing CIED surgery.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of interrupted anticoagulation (IAC) with either warfarin or DOAC in the perioperative period of CIED surgery versus uninterrupted anticoagulation (UAC), with or without heparin bridging, during an equivalent time frame, for CIED surgery.

Search Methods

CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and two trials registers were searched on 26 November 2021 together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We plan to update this review imminently.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IAC vs. UAC in adults with a diagnosed cardiac rhythm disorder, who underwent elective CIED surgery and received at least one month of warfarin or DOAC anticoagulation. Comparisons of interest were: (1) continued warfarin vs. interrupted warfarin anticoagulation, with or without heparin bridging; and (2) continued DOAC (apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) vs. interrupted DOAC, with or without heparin bridging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Primary outcomes were composite thromboembolic events (transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, peripheral embolism, or valve thrombosis) and device-pocket hematoma. Secondary outcomes included individual components of composite thromboembolic events, composite bleeding events, all-cause mortality, adverse events, quality of life and days of hospitalization. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. The inverse variance random-effects model was used for meta-analyses, and the DerSimonian and Laird method was used for calculating the between-study variance Tau 2. Dichotomous outcomes were calculated as risk ratios (RRs) and we used mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, with respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).

Main Results

We identified 10 eligible studies (2221 participants), of which one is ongoing. Of these 10 studies, six compared IAC vs. UAC with warfarin (1267 participants) and four compared IAC vs. UAC with DOAC (954 participants). Follow-up duration ranged between 0.5 to three months. The mean age of participants ranged from 68 to 76 years. Definitions of thromboembolic events, device-pocket hematoma, and bleeding events varied across studies. IAC vs. UAC with warfarin IAC with warfarin may result in little to no difference in composite thromboembolic events (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.18 to 4.11; 5 RCTs, n = 1266; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of IAC on device-pocket hematoma (RR 1.87, 95% CI 0.83 to 4.22; 5 RCTs, n = 1266; very low-certainty evidence), ischemic stroke (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.11 to 4.40; 5 RCTs, n = 1266; very low-certainty evidence) and composite bleeding events (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 4.43; 5 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). IAC with warfarin likely results in little to no difference in deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (0 events in both groups; 2 RCTs, n = 782; moderate-certainty evidence). IAC may result in a slight reduction of all-cause mortality (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.93; 3 RCTs, n = 953; low-certainty evidence). IAC vs. UAC with DOAC IAC with DOAC may result in little to no difference in composite thromboembolic events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.63; 3 RCTs, n = 843; low-certainty evidence) and ischemic stroke (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.63, 2 RCTs, n = 763; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of IAC with DOAC on device-pocket hematoma (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.11; 4 RCTs, n = 954; very low-certainty evidence) and composite bleeding events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.06; 4 RCTs, n = 954; very low-certainty evidence). IAC may result in little to no difference in ischemic stroke (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.63, 2 RCTs, low-certainty evidence). IAC likely results in little to no difference in deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (0 events in both groups; 2 RCTs, n = 763; moderate-certainty evidence). IAC may result in a slight reduction of all-cause mortality (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.39; 2 RCTs, n = 763; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Interrupted anticoagulation in people undergoing elective CIED surgery had similar outcomes to uninterrupted anticoagulation with either warfarin or DOAC medications. Certainty of evidence was judged to be low to very low for most of the assessed outcomes. Further RCTs are particularly needed to help identify whether IAC significantly impacts the risks of thromboembolic events and device-pocket hematoma.

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^114rP68G]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Differences in clinical outcomes following a temporary interruption of warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for a surgical procedure are not well described. Differences in patient characteristics from practice‐based cohorts have not typically been accounted for in prior analyses.

Aim

To describe risk‐adjusted differences in postoperative outcomes following an interruption of warfarin vs DOACs.

Methods

Patients receiving care at six anticoagulation clinics participating in the Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative were included if they had at least one oral anticoagulant interruption for a procedure. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance baseline differences between the warfarin cohort and DOAC cohort. Bleeding and thromboembolic events within 30 days following the procedure were compared between the IPTW cohorts using the Poisson distribution test.

Results

A total of 525 DOAC patients were matched with 1323 warfarin patients, of which 923 were nonbridged warfarin patients and 400 were bridged warfarin patients. The occurrence of postoperative minor bleeding (10.8% vs. 4.7%, p < .001), major bleeding (2.9% vs. 1.1%, p = .01) and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (CRNMB) (6.5% vs. 3.0%, p = .002) was greater in the DOAC cohort compared with the nonbridged warfarin cohort. The rates of postoperative bleeding outcomes were similar between the DOAC and the bridged warfarin cohorts.

Conclusion

Perioperative interruption of DOACs, compared with warfarin without bridging, is associated with a higher incidence of 30‐day minor bleeds, major bleeds, and CRNMBs. Further research investigating the perioperative outcomes of these two classes of anticoagulants is warranted.

Perioperative antithrombotic management — guideline themes and recent evidence — indicates that for direct oral anticoagulants, no bridging therapy is required; for vitamin K antagonist therapy (eg, warfarin), bridging anticoagulation is reserved for patients with moderate-to-high thromboembolic risk, and direct oral anticoagulants are generally held for 2 to 3 days preoperatively with bridging deferred. In the Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation (PAUSE) study using a standardized interruption protocol, anticoagulants were stopped 1 to 2 days before surgery and resumed 1 to 3 days postoperatively, with rates of stroke (< 1%) and major bleeding (0.9% to 2.6%). The authors state this approach can minimize the risk of stroke and major bleeding with a minimum interruption window and no requirement for heparin bridging. Regarding aspirin, evidence is limited: in a POISE-2 Trial substudy of patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention, the overall incidence of stroke was low (2/470, 0.4%), and among patients undergoing vascular surgery it was rare (1/537, 0.1%); across randomized trials dominated by Pulmonary Embolism Prevention 1 and POISE-2 (> 13,000 patients), there was no difference in stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) risk between groups.

Atrial fibrillation — bridging during interruption of warfarin: To mitigate thromboembolic risk during interruption of warfarin therapy for a procedure or surgery, bridging anticoagulation can be administered, but observational studies consistently showed an increased risk of bleeding without a difference in thromboembolic risk with this strategy. In the BRIDGE trial, the mean CHADS2 score was 2.3 (range, 1–6) and 61.7% had a CHADS2 score < 3, and in this study, interruption of warfarin without bridging anticoagulation was superior to bridging.

Designed to be given in fixed doses without routine monitoring, direct oral anticoagulants have a lower propensity for food and drug interactions than do vitamin K antagonists, and in randomised controlled trials involving around 250000 patients, they were at least as effective for prevention and treatment of thrombosis and were associated with a lower risk of life-threatening bleeding. The absolute benefits of direct oral anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists are modest; however, guidelines recommend them in preference to vitamin K antagonists for most indications because of their ease of use and superior safety. The greatest benefits of direct oral anticoagulants are likely to be in patients who were previously deemed unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. The emergence of generic preparations is expected to further increase the uptake of direct oral anticoagulants, particularly in countries where they are currently not widely used because of cost. Direct oral anticoagulants are contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart valves and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with advanced kidney or liver disease. In this Therapeutics paper, we review the pharmacology of direct oral anticoagulants, summarise the evidence that led to their approval and incorporation into treatment guidelines, and explore key unresolved issues. We also briefly discuss future perspectives for the development of oral anticoagulants.

Aspirin and perioperative antithrombotic management — Major bleeding was "significantly higher in patients randomized to receive aspirin (odds ratio [OR] = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05–1.33, P = 0.007)", and "recent studies suggest that aspirin probably does not reduce stroke risk for the majority of noncardiac patients". Recommendations are: "(1) For patients on vitamin K anticoagulants (eg, warfarin), stop medication 5 days preoperatively, and consider bridging anticoagulation only for those with moderate-to-high thromboembolic risk (Level A, Class I)". "(2) For patients on direct oral anticoagulants, administer last dose 2 to 3 days preoperatively and resume 1 to 3 days postoperatively based on clinical risk factors. Avoid heparin bridging (Level A, Class I)". "(3) For patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention, a continuation of aspirin may reduce perioperative mortality and myocardial infarction risk (Level B-R, Class IIa). However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether aspirin mitigates stroke risk in such patients (Level C-LD, Class IIb)".

Anticoagulant therapy — perioperative management emphasizes that similar to antiplatelet therapy, preoperative management is based on risk of thrombosis vs bleeding; in patients with an indication for anticoagulation, bridging should be based upon risk of thromboembolism; and administration of a direct oral anticoagulant reversal agent for FXa inhibitors is not recommended if there is a need for intraoperative anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin, because the reversal agent also reverses UFH such that significantly higher doses are required to achieve the target activated clotting time.

Perioperative anticoagulation management in atrial fibrillation on vitamin K antagonists — The BRIDGE Trial found that forgoing bridging was noninferior to bridging for thromboembolism risk (0.4% vs. 0.3%, respectively, risk difference = 0.1%, 95% CI: −0.6 to 0.8; P = 0.01) and superior for major bleeding risk (1.3% vs. 3.2%, respectively, relative risk [RR] = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.20–0.78; P = 0.005); only patients with vitamin K antagonist therapy were included and patients with mechanical heart valves or recent thromboembolic events were excluded. For direct oral anticoagulants, interruption can be shorter than with warfarin, and bridging is not required with these agents because this practice appears to increase bleeding risk without reducing thromboembolic events.

### Personalizing bridging anticoagulation in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation-a microsimulation analysis [^113AExWN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bridging anticoagulation is commonly prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation who are initiating warfarin or require interruption of anticoagulation. Current guidelines recommend bridging for patients at high risk of stroke. Among patients with atrial fibrillation and one or more risk factors for ischemic stroke, the recently published BRIDGE trial found forgoing bridging during interruption to be, on average, noninferior to bridging with respect to ischemic complications, with significantly fewer hemorrhagic complications.

Objective

We sought to examine the benefits and harms of bridging anticoagulation across the spectrum of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke risk and thereby enable more nuanced, risk-stratified decision-making when bridging is considered during initiation or interruption of vitamin K antagonists.

Design

A Monte Carlo simulation, using a combination of literature-derived estimates, registry data, and trial data.

Main Measures

Net clinical benefit, weighting for ischemic strokes, intracranial hemorrhages, and extracranial major hemorrhages.

Key Results

The benefits and harms of bridging anticoagulation vary according to underlying patient risk profiles for both thromboembolic stroke and major intracranial bleeding. Patients at high risk of ischemic stroke and low risk of hemorrhage derive benefit from bridging during initiation or interruption of warfarin therapy. Patients at similarly high or low risk of both outcomes may receive benefit from bridging during initiation and bridging during interruption, but this was sensitive to underlying assumptions. The need for stratification along both axes of risk was robust to a wide range of parameters.

Conclusions

Bridging anticoagulation may provide benefit to patients at high risk of ischemic stroke and low risk of intracranial hemorrhage who are initiating or interrupting warfarin therapy, while patients at high or low risk of both complications may be harmed. The use of bridging anticoagulation in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation should be considered only after stratification by risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic complications.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115ErXWS]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) periprocedural anticoagulation management — In patients with AF (excluding those with recent stroke or TIA, or a mechanical valve) on warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) undergoing an invasive procedure or surgery, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging anticoagulation is recommended. In patients with AF on warfarin anticoagulation and an annual predicted risk of thromboembolism of ≥ 5% undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change, continued anticoagulation is recommended in preference to interruption of warfarin and bridging anticoagulation with heparin to reduce the risk of pocket hematoma. In patients with AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 or equivalent risk of stroke on DOAC anticoagulation and undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change, either uninterrupted or interrupted DOAC is reasonable. If an invasive procedure or surgery cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted DOAC, the timing of DOAC interruption should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk of the procedure. After DOAC interruption for a procedure or surgery, resumption of anticoagulation the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery is reasonable, as long as hemostasis has been achieved and further bleeding is not anticipated. For patients with AF on warfarin who are holding warfarin for a surgery or procedure, except in patients with mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA, bridging anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered.

5.5. Patient Preparation

Heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, and myocardial ischemia should be adequately treated and controlled, if possible, before the patient is subjected to an invasive electrophysiology study. Similarly, associated SHDs should be clearly defined, given that patients with conditions such as severe LV systolic dysfunction, severe coronary artery disease, critical aortic stenosis, and advanced renal impairment might not tolerate induction of arrhythmia, prolonged procedures, or fluid overload resulting from the use of saline-irrigated catheters. Although some of these conditions can be optimized prior to an elective procedure, this is often not possible for more emergent procedures. In these cases, a substrate-based ablation approach without repeated VT inductions might be preferable.

AADs, with the exception of amiodarone, should, if at all possible, be discontinued for at least 5 half-lives prior to the ablation procedure. This is almost mandatory for cases in which the primary strategy of mapping is not substratebased, but it might not be possible for emergency cases. Oral anticoagulants are generally discontinued prior to the ablation to achieve an international normalized ratio < 1.5 at the time of the study. Direct oral anticoagulants should be withheld for 24–48 hours before the procedure, depending on anticipated access, and bridging with heparin can be used for patients with mechanical heart valves or other features that place them at high risk of thrombosis. The majority of the writing committee (60%) usually use bridging in patients with mechanical valves, where possible, but many distinguish between mechanical aortic valves, in which transseptal access with continued anticoagulation can be used, and mechanical mitral valves, in which retrograde access is used. For elective procedures, imaging with ultrasound can help to define the feasibility of an arterial closure device, and therefore continued anticoagulation. Routine perioperative bridging in patients with AF who interrupted warfarin for procedures, including percutaneous transvascular procedures, was noninferior to no bridging in a large RCT with respect to the occurrence of thromboembolic events. Approximately half of the writing committee do not use bridging in similar patients, and a further 20% do not use bridging in patients taking direct oral anticoagulants.

Informed consent needs to be obtained from the patient or his or her surrogate after discussing the risks and benefits involved in the procedure, as well as alternatives. The patient should fast overnight or for at least for 6 hours prior to the procedure.

Bridging anticoagulation during VKA interruption — atrial fibrillation (PICO 6): The BRIDGE trial assessed a heparin bridging vs no bridging strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation who required warfarin interruption for an elective surgery/procedure; in a double-blind manner, patients received bridging with therapeutic-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid) for 3 days pre-operatively, with only the morning dose given on the day before surgery/procedure, and for at least 5 days post-operatively until the INR was ≥ 2.0, with follow-up for 4 weeks post-operatively; this trial showed that no bridging was noninferior to LMWH.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116STUmW]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although thromboembolism may cause severe morbidity and mortality, it should be weighed against the bleeding risk of bridging anticoagulation. 31 Considering the higher risk of bleeding related to bridging anticoagulation, our results suggested non‐bridging management seems to have a favorable risk‐benefit profile in terms of thromboembolic and bleeding complications. There are some explanations for the bleeding risk of bridging anticoagulation. First, residual anti‐Xa effect or heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia may contribute to postoperative bleeding. 32 Second, due to the interindividual variability in the sensitivity of aPTT test (the most common laboratory measurement to monitor UFH), control of aPTT range may not correlate well with the activity of bridging anticoagulation. 33

NOACs have been increasingly used for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with moderate‐to‐high risk. 32 NOACs are non‐inferior for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and associated with less bleeding compared to warfarin. 34 NOACs have advantages of short half‐lives, fast onset of action, predictable pharmacokinetic properties (concentration‐dependent), and few drug‐drug interactions. 35 Although the experience of periprocedural use of NOACs is accumulating, there are limited data available pertaining to the bridging anticoagulation for patients on NOAC therapy in terms of perioperative bleeding risk. 36 The Dresden NOAC registry revealed major bleeding rate of 1.2% and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding rate of 3.4% in patients using NOACs during invasive procedures. 37 A subgroup analysis of the RE‐LY trial showed no significant difference in the risk of periprocedural major bleeding between patients using dabigatran 110 mg (3.8%), dabigatran 150 mg (5.1%), or warfarin (4.6%). 38 However, these studies did not compare the bleeding risk between bridging and non‐bridging therapy. 37, 38 Whether it is better for patients using NOACs to receive bridging anticoagulation is currently unclear. Two specific reversal agents for NOACs have been approved in the United States: idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal and andexanet alfa for apixaban and rivaroxaban reversal. 39, 40 Tailoring periprocedural management of NOACs to the type of invasive procedure may reduce the risk of bleeding.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

VTE maintenance and bridging guidance emphasizes VTE-specific dosing and selective use of parenteral bridging. The VTE maintenance dose of rivaroxaban should be 20 mg daily, not 15 mg daily, as studied in the PIONEER-AF-PCI trial. An unusual scenario described is a patient on a treatment dose of a DOAC for VTE prior to PCI who develops significant renal dysfunction, warranting transition to a VKA. In patients requiring a VKA, bridging with low–molecular-weight heparin is associated with increased bleeding risk and should therefore be reserved for patients judged to be at a very high risk of recurrent VTE, such as those within 3 months of a VTE.

Postponements of surgical procedures

Overall, 45 procedures were postponed (13.3% of total procedures) (Table 4). We identified three different causes of deferrals: i) related to anticoagulation mismanagement according to the institutional recommendations (n = 11); ii) related to another known cause (Supplementary Table 5, Additional file 1 n = 15); and iii) related to an unknown cause (n = 19). Among postponements directly related to clinicians' non-adherence to recommendations, three postponements were related to patients' behaviours (misunderstanding of instructions).

Table 4
Causes of procedure postponement

Non-recommended heparin bridging was the major cause of postponements to surgery related to anticoagulation mismanagement (with anti-Xa measured and values deemed unsuitable for surgical procedures; Supplementary Table 6, Additional file 1), followed by the failure to interrupt DOACs before the procedure and a failure to interrupt DOACs early enough (Table 4).

Patients with atrial fibrillation and AIS-timing of anticoagulation

When is the best time for initiating anticoagulation treatment after AIS based on RAF study?

In patients with AIS and atrial fibrillation, we recommend that oral anticoagulation treatment may be started at day 4 in mild stroke and small infarct, at day 7 in moderate stroke with medium infarcts, and at day 14 in severe stroke with large infarcts from index stroke. More data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective registries are needed to verify these time-points, in particular for direct oral anticoagulants (Grade C).
Should low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) not be used alone or prior to start of oral anticoagulation treatment in patients with AF and ischaemic stroke?

Based on observational study results, bridging therapy with LMWH, prior to oral anticoagulation therapy may not be used in patients with atrial fibrillation and ischaemic stroke (Grade C).

### Select drug-drug interactions with direct Oral anticoagulants: JACC review topic of the week [^111UcWtA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Millions of individuals in the United States require long-term treatment with an oral anticoagulant. For decades, vitamin K antagonists were the only oral option available; however, they have a number of well-known limitations. Introduction of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has long been considered a major therapeutic advance, largely because they lack the need for therapeutic monitoring. Despite this, DOACs, like vitamin K antagonists, can still cause major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, even when used appropriately. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving the DOACs represent an important contributor to increased bleeding risk. Awareness of these DDIs and how best to address them is of critical importance in optimizing management while mitigating bleeding risk. This review provides an overview of DOAC metabolism, the most common drugs likely to contribute to DOAC DDIs, their underlying mechanisms, and how best to address them.

Bridging therapy was widely used at the initiation of oral anticoagulation in a stable NVAF population. This practice did not decrease the IS/SE risk but increased the bleeding risk. These findings do not support the use of routine bridging in this population.

### Risk-adjusted perioperative bridging anticoagulation reduces bleeding complications without increasing thromboembolic events in general and visceral surgery [^1144DxGW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An aging population leads to a strongly increasing incidence of diseases as atrial fibrillation, mechanic heart valves and thrombosis. This also affects the need for oral anticoagulation (OAC) using warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Notably, these elderly people increasingly require surgery for age-related comorbidities, such as hernia, diverticulitis or gastrointestinal carcinoma. Recent studies highlighted the effects of perioperative bridging versus non-bridging on thromboembolic events and bleeding complications. Most of these trials showed that placebo was non-inferior to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) bridging concerning thromboembolic events, but they revealed an increased risk of bleeding in bridged patients. A reduced use of LMWH bridging has been reported since publication of the BRIDGE-trial. However, general and visceral surgery made up only a small proportion within the recent study populations.

There is a need for further evidence on perioperative OAC bridging and postoperative bleeding complications in general and visceral surgery, in particular since postoperative hemorrhage is one of the major complications in this field. Our initial study reported that especially full-therapeutic-dose LMWH strongly increases the risk of postoperative bleeding complications. Based on this experience, we developed a less aggressive and individually risk-adjusted bridging regime.

The aim of this quality improvement study was to evaluate the local implementation of the new bridging regimen concerning its efficacy to reduce bleeding complications and its safety aspects concerning thromboembolic events.

Patients and methods

This quality improvement study was conducted in a German 1,500-bed university hospital (University hospital Würzburg) comparing perioperative bridging anticoagulation before (period 1) and after implementation (period 2) of a new local bridging regimen. The manuscript was prepared according to the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) guidelines. The retrospective analysis was approved by the local institutional ethical review board (Ethik-Kommission der Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg; Ref. 20,210,505 03) without need for informed consent because only medical records were analyzed anonymously.

Medication reconciliation — Before discharge, medication reconciliation must update and document all medications, including duration of DAPT; particular attention should be given to patients on "triple therapy", which due to bleeding risk should be maintained for the least amount of time possible (e.g., 1 week to 1 month). Consider a single antiplatelet agent with oral anticoagulation to minimize bleeding risk. Patients on a direct oral anticoagulant can restart the same or next day, while those on warfarin should restart within 1 week of discharge; LMWH bridging is not routinely recommended except in high thrombosis risk, metformin should be held for 48 h in those at risk of CKD or with CIN, and proton‐pump inhibitors should be considered for bleeding risk on DAPT and routinely prescribed for all on triple therapy.

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^114G3xxZ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Differences in clinical outcomes following a temporary interruption of warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for a surgical procedure are not well described. Differences in patient characteristics from practice-based cohorts have not typically been accounted for in prior analyses.

Aim

To describe risk-adjusted differences in postoperative outcomes following an interruption of warfarin vs DOACs.

Methods

Patients receiving care at six anticoagulation clinics participating in the Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative were included if they had at least one oral anticoagulant interruption for a procedure. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance baseline differences between the warfarin cohort and DOAC cohort. Bleeding and thromboembolic events within 30days following the procedure were compared between the IPTW cohorts using the Poisson distribution test.

Results

A total of 525 DOAC patients were matched with 1323 warfarin patients, of which 923 were nonbridged warfarin patients and 400 were bridged warfarin patients. The occurrence of postoperative minor bleeding (10.8% vs. 4.7%, p < .001), major bleeding (2.9% vs. 1.1%, p = .01) and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (CRNMB) (6.5% vs. 3.0%, p = .002) was greater in the DOAC cohort compared with the nonbridged warfarin cohort. The rates of postoperative bleeding outcomes were similar between the DOAC and the bridged warfarin cohorts.

Conclusion

Perioperative interruption of DOACs, compared with warfarin without bridging, is associated with a higher incidence of 30-day minor bleeds, major bleeds, and CRNMBs. Further research investigating the perioperative outcomes of these two classes of anticoagulants is warranted.

Changes in perioperative bridging

The percentage of patients receiving too aggressive bridging, meaning full-therapeutic dose LMWH in low or medium risk patients strongly decreased from 60.8% to 32.8% (p < 0.001) during period 2. Thus, the distribution of perioperative LMWH dosing significantly changed in period 2 (Table 2). Despite the medicinal recommendation the majority of patients on DOACs received postoperative bridging in both. However, 86 patients on DOACs (60%) were continued orally prior discharge during period 2. While preoperative interruption of anticoagulation for ≥ 24 h was observed in 41% of all cases during the period 1, this proportion almost doubled during period 2. However, the full adherence to the new regime was only 54% during period 2, and 32.8% of patients still received a too aggressive perioperative bridging in reflection of their individual thromboembolic risk.

### International collaboration in real-world evidence generation for direct acting oral anti-coagulants [^113YZDXA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

At the time of authorization, the different DOACs had high‐quality clinical trial evidence supporting their positive benefit risk balance. However, additional studies were imposed on these products by some jurisdictions because of the limitations related to the duration and nature of the clinical trial exposure, and some uncertainties related to their safe and effective use, including the optimal dose, use in patients with renal impairment, and use in at‐risk populations. To take stock of the knowledge on the products and to catalyze the generation of information to fill knowledge gaps, the EMA organized an expert workshop on November 25, 2015. Among the conclusions of the workshop was the request for further research in real life patients to support the safe use of anticoagulants in clinical practice outside the setting of a clinical trial. On this basis, the EMA commissioned independent research from academia in the European Union and embarked on collaboration with Health Canada through the Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network and with the FDA on real‐world studies of DOACs.

Periprocedural bridging anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) — The BRIDGE trial randomized 1884 patients with AF or AFL to bridging anticoagulation before and after the procedure with dalteparin versus placebo, and no bridging was superior to bridging with respect to major bleeding and was noninferior with respect to thromboembolism, with the observed rate (0.4%) lower than anticipated (1.0%). Almost 90% of patients were undergoing low bleeding risk procedures. In PERIOP2, 79% had AF and patients were randomized to postoperative bridging with dalteparin or placebo until the INR was > 1.9; all patients received preoperative bridging, and bleeding and thromboembolism outcomes were similar. Additional studies reported dental extractions performed on uninterrupted warfarin without bridging and a large multicenter registry found no difference in thromboembolism but an increase in bleeding in bridged patients.

Perioperative interruption and resumption of DOACs — evidence from randomized trials and observational analyses indicates that perioperative management in major DOAC vs warfarin trials was generally non-standardized with 15% to 20% receiving heparin bridging, and a meta-analysis of > 19,000 such patients reported perioperative ATE rates of 0.5% to 1.0% and major bleeding rates of 2% to 5%. Additional studies around catheter ablation showed mixed findings: an observational study reported an increase in bleeding with periprocedural DOAC continuation while another reported no difference, and a 306-patient randomized trial comparing 1-day interruption vs no interruption found no significant difference in bleeding outcomes (11.3% vs 9.7%; risk difference = 1.7%; 95% CI −5.5 to 8.8).

Conclusion

Balancing thromboembolic and bleeding risks during perioperative management of elderly patients receiving OAC is of high clinical relevance to avoid major sequela. Individual risk-adjusted bridging effectively reduces bleeding complications in general and visceral surgery while the risk of thromboembolism remains comparable. Further research concerning the general necessity of warfarin bridging and the perioperative handling of DOACs is required to provide optimal perioperative management for all OAC indications.

### New avenues for optimal treatment of atrial fibrillation and stroke prevention [^115ajNHc]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

One in 3 individuals free of atrial fibrillation (AF) at index age 55 years is estimated to develop AF later in life. AF increases not only the risk of ischemic stroke but also of dementia, even in stroke-free patients. In this review, we address recent advances in the heart-brain interaction with focus on AF. Issues discussed are (1) the timing of direct oral anticoagulants start following an ischemic stroke; (2) the comparison of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in early secondary stroke prevention; (3) harms of bridging with heparin before direct oral anticoagulants; (4) importance of appropriate direct oral anticoagulants dosing; (5) screening for AF in high-risk populations, including the role of wearables; (6) left atrial appendage occlusion as an alternative to oral anticoagulation; (7) the role of early rhythm-control therapy; (8) effect of lifestyle interventions on AF; (9) AF as a risk factor for dementia. An interdisciplinary approach seems appropriate to address the complex challenges posed by AF.

Early paradigms suggested routine assessment of preprocedural DOAC levels and consideration of heparin bridging during periprocedural DOAC interruption in high thrombotic risk populations. 1 This laboratory-based approach, analogous to that for managing vitamin K antagonists, was countered by arguments for more pragmatic and simplified pharmacokinetics. -based periprocedural DOAC management using key parameters, such as a DOAC half-life and DOAC time to maximum concentration, without the need for heparin bridging given the short DOAC half-life and without DOAC-level testing.

2 The need to harmonize definitions of surgical or procedural bleeding risk also became important due to the rapid offset and onset of DOAC action and need to tailor interruption and resumption of DOACs according to procedural bleeding risk. heparin bridging or perioperative DOAC level testing would be associated with low rates of bleeding and thromboembolism. 6 For procedures with low to moderate bleeding risk in which residual anticoagulant activity was permitted, approximately 3 half-lives was the recommended interruption interval, which translated to DOACs being held 1 day before the procedure. 6 For procedures with high bleeding risk aiming for no residual anticoagulant activity, a full 5 half-lives was the recommended interruption interval, which translated to DOACs being held 2 days before the procedure. risk) and very low rates of arterial thromboembolism at 30 days among the 3 DOACs studied.

5 The trial also found that approximately 99% of patients undergoing procedures with high bleeding risk had negligible residual DOAC anti-Xa levels, based on blood samples obtained during the trial but not used for clinical practice. 5 Given these results, a simple pharmacokinetics-based DOAC management strategy has been incorporated into recent perioperative antithrombotic guidelines. 8, 9. The PERIXa study10 confirmed and expanded the key conceptual framework that a simple, standardized periprocedural protocol based on DOAC pharmacokinetic parameters and procedural bleeding risk with no routine DOAC monitoring and no heparin bridging would result in very low rates of postprocedural adverse outcomes.

10. 1001/archneur.
65. 9. noc70105. The decisions of whether to bridge and whether to use heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin were made based on clinical judgment and personal preference of the treating physician. Outcome measures and adverse events were captured prospectively. Severe systemic bleeding was defined as any gastrointestinal tract, intra-abdominal, or external bleeding necessitating transfusion. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was given to all of the patients in the NT, ASA, and WAR groups. Additionally, to study the global effect of AC, all of the patients treated with some form of AC were grouped into the AC group.

Our study attempted to address a common clinical dilemma in patients with CES: when and how to institute long-term AC for secondary stroke prevention. Currently, short-term AC of patients with CES for preventing early stroke recurrence is not endorsed by published guidelines. 3 However, the common practice of bridging patients with heparin or enoxaparin often leads to very early full AC. This may suggest a role of AC in preventing stroke progression, which is supported by 2 studies14, 15 that recently demonstrated a better outcome with early AC treatment of patients with CES. Stroke progression may be difficult to distinguish from recurrent embolization to the same arterial territory. This may also account for some of the observed reduction in stroke progression in our study. Finally, our ASA group had more severe strokes at baseline, so the excess of progression in this group may simply reflect the extent of their infarct and not treatment effect.

We did not routinely obtain a head computed tomographic scan on AC-treated patients; thus, it is possible that some asymptomatic HTs were missed. Our study was not designed to specifically address patients who may be at high risk for early thrombotic complications or patients who have protein C deficiency or another hypercoagulable state that may be aggravated by warfarin initiation. In these patients, the benefit of bridging may outweigh the additional risk of bleeding.

### Bleeding risk with oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem… [^113ykPaG]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that prescribers may need to avoid P-glycoprotein–related drug-drug interactions with dabigatran regardless of kidney function. Importance Direct oral anticoagulants are purported to have fewer drug-drug interactions than warfarin. However, potential interactions with coprescribed medications are still a safety concern. Verapamil hydrochloride and diltiazem hydrochloride are combined P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inhibitors and may be associated with increases in the risk of bleeding with DOACs. Direct oral anticoagulants, first introduced into the market in 2010, have become more popular as a stroke prevention therapy for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation owing to less complexity in therapeutic dosing in addition to equivalent efficacy and superior safety compared with warfarin.

1 Even though adverse bleeding events are of less concern among patients receiving DOACs compared with those receiving traditional warfarin therapy, the risk of major bleeding events is still present. All patients receiving DOACs were identified from October 19, 2010, through June 30, 2015. The date of the first prescription filled of each medication was defined as the index date. Patients were required to have at least 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient diagnoses of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation within 60 days before the index date based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 427.
31. Patients were considered exposed to one of these drugs if they had an overlap use with DOACs on the index date and at least 90 days of cumulative use of these drugs within the 6-month preindex period. Prescription fills of all studied medications were identified based on the National Drug Codes.

Medication use each day during follow-up was assessed using the prescription fill dates and days-supplied values on prescription claims with correction for overlapping refills. However, there are still several limitations in our study. First, we only looked at the use of verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, and metoprolol before DOAC initiation, and required 90 days of cumulative use of these medications during the previous 6-month period with strict criteria for censoring at discontinuation or switching of any study medication.

### Bridging anticoagulation offers No benefit… [^1155xR7b]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

A recent trial found that among patients with atrial fibrillation who stopped taking warfarin before undergoing an elective surgery or invasive procedure, forgoing bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to perioperative bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent arterial thromboembolism. Bridging also nearly tripled the risk of major bleeding without providing benefit in preventing myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, or death when compared with no bridging. Slomski A.

### Bridging anticoagulation therapy… [^115TNx4b]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

A 76-year-old man who had nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being managed with 3-liter flow home oxygen, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation being managed with warfarin therapy presented to the emergency department after developing lightheadedness, fatigue, and a large bruise on his right buttocks after a mechanical fall at home. The previous week, the patient had been hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation, reporting coughing up some scant blood-tinged sputum at home. Warfarin treatment was discontinued at admission as a precaution. He had no further blood-tinged sputum throughout the hospitalization, and his hemoglobin level remained stable. At discharge, his international normalized ratio was 1. 24; hemoglobin level was
12. 1 g/dL; and he was ambulatory without assistance.

His CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4, and he had no history of ischemic stroke or major bleeding episodes. The patient was offered treatment with a direct oral anticoagulant but elected to resume warfarin owing to familiarity and comfort with it. He was discharged home with the existing dose of warfarin. In the setting of a subtherapeutic INR, a 5-day regimen of enoxaparin therapy was also prescribed as a bridging anticoagulant. Follow-up in the anticoagulation clinic was scheduled for 1 week after discharge. Kulkarni SA, Fang MC. Bridging Anticoagulation Therapy: A Teachable Moment. JAMA Intern Med. 2020; 180: 311–312.
