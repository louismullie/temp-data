## Question

What do the ACC/AHA Guidelines say about Beta Blockers for treatment of Hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ACC/AHA guidance on beta-blockers for hypertension, including their role as first-line therapy, the rationale for restriction, compelling indications, special populations, and practical implementation details. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most current ACC/AHA guideline position on first-line therapy. Then, I should verify the historical evolution and why beta-blockers were downgraded. Next, I will examine the evidence base comparing beta-blockers to other classes. After that, I need to identify the compelling indications where beta-blockers are recommended. Then, I should review special populations and scenarios where beta-blockers are preferred or avoided. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and monitoring considerations, and I will double-check for any nuances or exceptions I might miss along the way.

> Let me first confirm the current ACC/AHA stance so I don't overstate anything. The 2025 ACC/AHA High Blood Pressure Guideline explicitly recommends thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line agents for adults initiating pharmacologic therapy, and it states that beta-blockers are not first-line because they are less effective in preventing stroke and have a less favorable side-effect profile, reserving them for compelling indications [^113wcFJf] [^113Zr8D6].

> Wait, let me verify the historical trajectory to ensure I'm not missing a recent shift. Initially, beta-blockers were first-line in earlier eras, but JNC 8 in 2014 moved them to second-line except for compelling indications, and the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline aligned with that restriction, reinforcing that beta-blockers should not be used as initial therapy in the absence of a compelling indication. The 2025 update reaffirms this position rather than reversing it [^114HskhJ] [^113wcFJf].

> I need to check the evidentiary rationale carefully. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews show beta-blockers lower blood pressure comparably to other classes but are inferior for preventing stroke and may have higher discontinuation rates due to adverse effects. Notably, many trials used atenolol, and there is insufficient outcome evidence for newer vasodilating beta-blockers like nebivolol or carvedilol in uncomplicated hypertension, which supports the ACC/AHA's caution [^1138YWP5] [^113DPngt] [^113wcFJf].

> Hold on, I should verify the "compelling indications" where beta-blockers are still recommended. In chronic coronary disease, especially with prior myocardial infarction or angina, beta-blockers are first-line for their anti-ischemic and prognostic benefits. In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, guideline-directed beta-blocker therapy is foundational. In acute coronary syndromes, early beta-blocker use is indicated when hemodynamically stable. In thoracic aortic disease, including Marfan-related aneurysm and acute aortic syndromes, beta-blockers are preferred to reduce aortic wall stress. And for rate control in atrial fibrillation, beta-blockers are appropriate when indicated [^111yyMDk] [^1156g94y] [^115ZqZT8] [^111WJdj7] [^114gf19D].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios so I don't overgeneralize. In pregnancy or women planning pregnancy, beta-blockers can be considered as alternatives to ACE inhibitors or ARBs. In resistant hypertension, adding a beta-blocker is reasonable if other classes are not tolerated or contraindicated. In peripheral artery disease, beta-blockers do not worsen claudication and can be used when otherwise indicated. In perioperative care, chronic beta-blockers should be continued and not started de novo on the day of surgery due to harm, with careful attention to rebound risk if withdrawn abruptly [^113xvfLh] [^116Nvzqw] [^112sDuH8] [^112n77xa] [^117RbZ35].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied beta-blockers are broadly beneficial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; I should correct that. In HFpEF, contemporary ACC/AHA guidance emphasizes RAAS inhibition, SGLT2 inhibitors, and diuretics for volume management, and it restricts beta-blockers to specific comorbid indications like angina, prior MI, or arrhythmias, given potential negative chronotropic effects that may worsen exercise intolerance in some patients [^114TQyGR] [^116y2dGT].

> I will now examine practical implementation so this is actionable. For uncomplicated hypertension, start with a thiazide-like diuretic, a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB, or an ACE inhibitor or ARB, and escalate to combination therapy as needed; for stage 2 hypertension, initial two-drug therapy is preferred, ideally as a single-pill combination to improve adherence; reserve beta-blockers for patients with compelling indications or intolerance to the four first-line classes, and avoid abrupt withdrawal given rebound risk [^113wcFJf] [^115shpQ8] [^111JrcxT].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a beta-blocker without a clear indication? Should I switch immediately? I should double-check the risk of abrupt cessation. The safer approach is to continue the beta-blocker if it is tolerated while addressing the indication and then taper slowly if a change is warranted, because abrupt withdrawal can precipitate rebound hypertension and ischemia; this is especially critical in the perioperative setting [^112n77xa] [^117RbZ35].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. The ACC/AHA position is consistent across iterations: beta-blockers are not first-line for uncomplicated hypertension due to inferior stroke prevention and tolerability concerns, but they remain essential for compelling cardiac indications such as HFrEF, post-MI care, chronic coronary disease with angina, thoracic aortic disease, and selected arrhythmia scenarios; implementation should prioritize first-line classes and reserve beta-blockers for those indications or for intolerance, with careful attention to continuation and withdrawal practices [^113wcFJf] [^113Zr8D6] [^112n77xa].

The ACC/AHA guidelines do not recommend beta-blockers as **first-line therapy** for hypertension in adults without compelling indications [^113wcFJf]. They are reserved for patients with **compelling indications** such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, coronary artery disease (especially post–myocardial infarction or angina), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, or thoracic aortic disease [^1156g94y] [^115ZqZT8]. For uncomplicated hypertension, beta-blockers are less effective than other first-line agents in preventing stroke and cardiovascular events and are more often discontinued due to side effects [^1138YWP5] [^113wcFJf]. If used, cardioselective or vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g. metoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol) are preferred, and abrupt cessation should be avoided [^115C4smF] [^111tGBo1].

## Current ACC/AHA recommendations on beta-blockers for hypertension

### First-line therapy recommendations

First-line agents are **thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** [^113wcFJf]. Beta-blockers are **not recommended as first-line therapy** for uncomplicated hypertension due to inferior stroke prevention and a less favorable side-effect profile [^113wcFJf].

---

### Compelling indications for beta-blocker use

Beta-blockers are **recommended for hypertension** when specific comorbidities or clinical scenarios are present:

| **Clinical indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) | - Proven mortality benefit <br/> - Reduced hospitalizations [^notfound] |
| Coronary artery disease (CAD), especially post–myocardial infarction (MI) or angina | - Anti-ischemic benefits <br/> - Reduced recurrent MI and mortality [^113UgTwj] |
| Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response | Rate control and symptom improvement [^117E9Ho2] |
| Thoracic aortic disease (e.g. Marfan syndrome, aortic aneurysm) | Reduce aortic wall stress and progression [^111WJdj7] |

---

### Limitations and concerns with beta-blockers

The ACC/AHA guidelines highlight several limitations of beta-blockers in hypertension management:

- **Stroke prevention**: Beta-blockers are less effective than other first-line agents in preventing stroke [^113wcFJf].

- **Side effects**: Higher discontinuation rates due to fatigue, bradycardia, erectile dysfunction, and metabolic effects [^notfound].

- **Central aortic pressure**: Less effective in lowering central aortic pressure, which may explain inferior stroke prevention [^113DPngt].

---

## Comparison with other antihypertensive classes

The ACC/AHA guidelines emphasize that **other antihypertensive classes are preferred** over beta-blockers for initial therapy:

- **Thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEis, and ARBs**: Proven superior in preventing cardiovascular events, particularly stroke [^113wcFJf].

- **Combination therapy**: Recommended for stage 2 hypertension or when BP is > 20/10 mmHg above target, typically involving thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEis, or ARBs [^1165rPnZ].

---

## Specific beta-blocker agents recommended

When beta-blockers are indicated, the ACC/AHA guidelines **prefer certain agents**:

- **Cardioselective beta-blockers**: Metoprolol, bisoprolol, and nebivolol are preferred due to fewer side effects and better tolerability [^notfound].

- **Vasodilating beta-blockers**: Carvedilol and nebivolol are preferred in patients with heart failure or metabolic concerns due to their vasodilatory properties [^111Gu2ym].

- **Avoidance**: Beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (e.g. acebutolol, pindolol) are generally avoided, especially in patients with coronary heart disease or heart failure [^111tGBo1].

---

## Clinical scenarios where beta-blockers are not recommended

Beta-blockers are **not recommended or should be used with caution** in the following scenarios:

- **Uncomplicated hypertension**: Without compelling indications, beta-blockers are not recommended as initial therapy [^113wcFJf].

- **Peripheral artery disease (PAD)**: Beta-blockers do not worsen claudication but are not superior to other antihypertensive classes in PAD management [^112sDuH8].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Caution is advised due to potential masking of hypoglycemia and metabolic side effects [^114M6mK3].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

When prescribing beta-blockers, clinicians should **monitor for**:

- **Bradycardia and heart block**: Regularly monitor heart rate and rhythm [^112eXi7Q].

- **Metabolic effects**: Monitor for hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain [^114M6mK3].

- **Withdrawal**: Avoid abrupt cessation to prevent rebound hypertension and tachycardia [^112n77xa].

## Summary of ACC/AHA guidelines on beta-blockers for hypertension

Beta-blockers are **not recommended as first-line therapy** for uncomplicated hypertension due to inferior stroke prevention and a less favorable side-effect profile [^113wcFJf]. They are reserved for patients with compelling indications such as HFrEF, CAD (especially post-MI or angina), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, or thoracic aortic disease [^111Gu2ym] [^111yyMDk] [^114gf19D] [^112mdxaK]. When used, cardioselective or vasodilating beta-blockers are preferred, and abrupt cessation should be avoided [^115C4smF].

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to combine β-blockers with any of the other major BP-lowering drug classes when there are compelling indications for their use, such as angina, post-myocardial infarction, HFrEF, or for HR control.

### Β-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension [^1138YWP5]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are β-blockers associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events when used as initial treatment in individuals with hypertension compared with placebo, no treatment, or other drugs?

Bottom Line

Initial therapy of hypertension with β-blockers is not associated with reduced all-cause mortality but is associated with modest reductions in cardiovascular events compared with placebo or no treatment. Calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are associated with greater reductions in cardiovascular event rates than β-blockers. This evidence derives from trials of traditional β-blockers (eg, atenolol and propranolol), because there are currently no mortality and cardiovascular event data on the new vasodilating β-blockers (eg, carvedilol and nebivolol).

Sexual dysfunction in hypertension — synopsis states that sexual dysfunction frequently occurs in individuals with hypertension and has been more commonly reported by women than men, and it is defined as a person's inability to participate in sexual relationships as they would wish with assessment using sex-specific validated tools covering domains including thoughts and desires, arousal, frequency of sexual activity, pleasure and orgasm, and problems affecting sexual function. The association between hypertension and sexual dysfunction may be due to shared mechanistic pathways of impaired vascular function and atherosclerosis in addition to common risk factors such as increasing age, hormonal shifts, diabetes, and depression, and antihypertensive medications may also contribute because treated patients with hypertension are more likely to report sexual dysfunction than untreated ones. Discussing sexual function with patients is essential as concerns about antihypertensive medications' negative impact on sexual function can lead to decreased adherence, and drug-class observations include that diuretics and beta-blockers (BBs), except nebivolol, are most commonly associated with erectile dysfunction in men, BBs are associated with a worsening of sexual function in women, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have the most favorable profile in men and women.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — hypertension management emphasizes diuretics, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), with limited beta-blocker (BB) use. Hypertension "is a major risk factor for developing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and an important target for HF management to reduce hospitalization, CVD events, and mortality". Diuretics are pivotal and "should be used for signs and/or symptoms of volume overload". "RAASi are indicated for management of HFpEF to attain an SBP of < 130 mm Hg, especially with an MRA or ARNI, or ARB when ARNI is not feasible". Conversely, "BB are not recommended for hypertension management with HFpEF… and should be restricted to specific comorbid conditions". "SGLT2i are used frequently… to reduce the risk of hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality", and because "SGLT2i may lower BP", dose "adjustment in other antihypertensive medications may be indicated if signs or symptoms of hypotension are present".

### First-line β-blocker use for hypertension in the veterans health administration [^114HskhJ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Guideline recommendations regarding β-blocker use for first-line treatment of high blood pressure (BP) have changed significantly over the past 3 decades. In the 1980s and 1990s, several placebo-controlled trials demonstrated their efficacy to prevent adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, leading to first-line endorsement alongside thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (hereafter, thiazides) in the Sixth and Seventh Reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC6 and JNC7, respectively). This changed in 2014 with the Eighth JNC Report (JNC8) recommending β-blockers as first-line only for patients with "compelling indications" supported by strong evidence of benefit. In the absence of such compelling indications, β-blockers were relegated to second-line therapy after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARB), thiazides, and calcium channel blockers (CCB). This shift was based on trials and meta-analyses suggesting inferior stroke and mortality as well as higher discontinuation rates from adverse effects. Similar recommendations appeared in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) BP guidelines and were reinforced in the 2024 AHA/American Stroke Association Guideline for the Primary Prevention of Stroke. In contrast, the 2018 and 2023 updates of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines supported first-line β-blocker use for uncomplicated hypertension, citing their efficacy compared with placebo in lowering BP and preventing CVD.

The quality of hypertension care for US veterans has been a major focus of the Veterans Health Administration (VA), the largest integrated health care system in the US. The Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in 2004, 2014, and 2020 conformed with the recommendations outlined in the JNC7, JNC8, and 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. However, in our recent analyses, we identified that β-blockers are prescribed as first-line hypertension treatment in approximately 20% of veterans who do not have a compelling indication, although this trend decreased over the 20-year study. To improve evidence-based prescribing of β-blockers for treatment of high BP, we sought to investigate the clinical factors associated with β-blocker use in a cohort of veterans initiating treatment for high BP over 23 years.

### Treatment of hypertension in patients with coronary artery disease. A case-based summary of the 2015 AHA / ACC / ASH scientific statement [^114dVzMX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The 2015 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/American Society of Hypertension Scientific Statement "Treatment of Hypertension in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease" is summarized in the context of a clinical case. The Statement deals with target blood pressures, and the optimal agents for the treatment of hypertension in patients with stable angina, in acute coronary syndromes, and in patients with ischemic heart failure. In all cases, the recommended blood pressure target is < 140/90 mm Hg, but < 130/80 mm Hg may be appropriate, especially in those with a history of a previous myocardial infarction or stroke, or at high risk for developing either. These numbers may need to be revised after the publication of the SPRINT data. Appropriate management should include beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and in the case of heart failure, aldosterone antagonists. Thiazide or thiazide-like (chlorthalidone) diuretics and calcium channel blockers can be used for the management of hypertension, but the evidence for improved outcomes compared with other agents in hypertension with coronary artery disease is meager. Loop diuretics should be reserved for patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure or with a glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min.

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^115mfr53]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

PERSPECTIVES

The multiple important data in favor of BBs that have been discussed in this article justify their inclusion among the major drugs to be used for the treatment of hypertension, at the same level as diuretics, ACEIs, CCBs, and ARBs. This also carries the advantage of increasing the number of options available to the physician to effectively lower an elevated BP by mono or combination therapy, achieving cardiovascular protection in a greater number of patients. Although they should be appropriately taken into account, the inconveniences of BBs (treatment discontinuation, lesser protection against subclinical organ damage, dysmetabolic effects) should not be used as an exclusion criterion to avoid the double standard of judgment that has never regarded the same inconveniences a problem for the use of diuretics. The same is true for the lesser protective effect of BBs against stroke that cannot ignore that different protective effects against cause-specific events characterize all major drugs and, in the case of BBs, do not prevent an effective overall cardiovascular protection.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^1165rPnZ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA and ESH guidelines recommend initial treatment with antihypertensive agents from at least 1 of 4 major classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. The ESH guideline continues to recommend beta-blockers as an optional first-line therapy for several CV and many non-CV conditions, including atrial fibrillation, aortic dissection, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, while the American guideline only recommends them for patients with ischemic heart disease or heart failure. The ESH guideline points to several randomized control trials and meta-analyses that show beta-blockers significantly reduce major CVD events when compared to placebo.

Initiation of combination therapy with medications from different classes is also prominent in both guidelines. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends an initial two-drug regimen for patients with "stage 2 hypertension" and BP > 20/10 mm Hg above target, and for Black patients (COR I, LOE: C-EO), while ESH recommends initial therapy with a two-drug combination regimen for most patients with hypertension (COR I, LOE: A). ESH strongly advocates for single-pill combination therapy to improve medication adherence and achieve BP control, while the U.S. guideline recommends either single-pill combination or multi-pill combinations.

### ACCF and AHA release guidelines on the management of heart failure [^114NksvT]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of stage A heart failure should focus on reducing modifiable risk factors, including management of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. To prevent symptomatic heart failure, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers should be used in all patients with stage B or C heart failure who have a reduced ejection fraction. Patients with stage C heart failure and fluid retention should be treated with diuretics in addition to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^114sCaud]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Surgical procedures in adults with hypertension — Preoperative medication guidance includes continuation and specific cautions. In patients with hypertension undergoing major surgery who have been on beta blockers chronically, beta blockers should be continued (COR I, LOE B-NR). In patients with hypertension undergoing planned elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue medical therapy for hypertension until surgery (COR IIa, LOE C-EO). In patients with hypertension undergoing major surgery, discontinuation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs perioperatively can be considered (COR IIb, LOE B-NR). In patients with planned elective major surgery and SBP of 180 mm Hg or higher or DBP of 110 mm Hg or higher, deferring surgery may be considered (COR IIb, LOE C-LD). For patients undergoing surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of beta blockers or clonidine is potentially harmful (COR III: Harm, LOE B-NR). Beta blockers should not be started on the day of surgery in beta blocker–naive patients (COR III: Harm, LOE B-NR).

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — risk-based antihypertensive drug therapy: Antihypertensive drug treatment that is based on overall ASCVD risk assessment combined with BP levels may prevent more CVD events than treatment that is based on BP levels alone; these meta-analyses conclude that lowering of BP results in larger absolute risk reduction in higher-risk individuals regardless of baseline treated or untreated BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg; these analyses indicate that the benefit of treatment outweighs the potential harm at threshold BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2005 heart failure (HF) — concomitant disorders: Physicians should control systolic and diastolic hypertension and diabetes mellitus in patients with HF in accordance with recommended guidelines (Level of Evidence: C). Physicians should use nitrates and beta-blockers for the treatment of angina in patients with HF (Level of Evidence: B). Physicians should recommend coronary revascularization according to recommended guidelines in patients who have both HF and angina (Level of Evidence: A). Physicians should prescribe anticoagulants in patients with HF who have paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or a previous thromboembolic event (Level of Evidence: A). Physicians should control the ventricular response rate in patients with HF and atrial fibrillation with a beta-blocker (or amiodarone, if the beta-blocker is contraindicated or not tolerated) (Level of Evidence: A). Patients with coronary artery disease and HF should be treated in accordance with recommended guidelines for chronic stable angina (Level of Evidence: C). Physicians should prescribe antiplatelet agents for prevention of MI and death in patients with HF who have underlying coronary artery disease (Level of Evidence: B).

### Individualized beta-blocker treatment for high blood pressure dictated by medical comorbidities: indications beyond the 2018 European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^116aczgM]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Several hypertension guidelines have removed beta-blockers from their previous position as first-choice drugs for the treatment of hypertension. However, this downgrading may not be justified by available evidence because beta-blockers lower blood pressure as effectively as other major antihypertensive drugs and have solid documentation in preventing cardiovascular complications. Suspected inconveniences of beta-blockers such as increased risk of depression or erectile dysfunction may have been overemphasized, while patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or peripheral artery disease, that is, conditions in which their use was previously restricted, will benefit from beta-blocker therapy. Besides, evidence that from early to late phases, hypertension is accompanied by activation of the sympathetic nervous system makes beta-blockers pathophysiologically an appropriate treatment in hypertension. Beta-blockers have favorable effects on a variety of clinical conditions that may coexist with hypertension, making their use either as specific treatment or as co-treatment potentially common in clinical practice. Guidelines typically limit recommendations on specific beta-blocker use to cardiac conditions including angina pectoris, postmyocardial infarction, or heart failure, with little or no mention of the additional cardiovascular or noncardiovascular conditions in which these drugs may be needed or preferred. In the present narrative review, we focus on multiple additional diseases and conditions that may occur and affect patients with hypertension, often more frequently than people without hypertension, and that may favor the choice of beta-blocker. Notwithstanding, beta-blockers represent an in-homogenous group of drugs and choosing beta-blockers with documented effect in prevention and treatment of disease is important for first choice in guidelines.

BP treatment threshold and CVD risk estimation — higher risk groups: In adults with hypertension without clinical CVD but with diabetes or CKD or at increased 10-year CVD risk (ie, ≥ 7.5% based on PREVENT), initiation of medications to lower BP is recommended when average SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg and average DBP is ≥ 80 mm Hg to reduce the risk of CVD events and total mortality.

Resistant hypertension — core management recommendations state that, in adults with resistant hypertension, a more detailed evaluation for secondary causes, including careful review of all medications and removal of those with interfering effects on BP, is beneficial for lowering BP and simplifying treatment (class 1, level B-NR). In adults with uncontrolled resistant hypertension who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to MRA, adding one of the following agents or classes — amiloride, BBs, alpha-blockers, central sympathetic drugs, dual endothelin receptor antagonists, or direct vasodilators — is reasonable to control BP (class 2a, level B-R).

Perioperative hypertension in noncardiac surgery — beta-blocker (BB) and clonidine management: If well tolerated, BBs should be continued in patients who are currently receiving them for GDMT indications, with clinical judgment used in titrating BB during the perioperative period and focusing on continuing the medication through the hospital stay and at discharge unless clear contraindications arise. Longstanding evidence suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can result in rebound hypertension associated with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and when there are no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^1161cHZJ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

A major difference between guidelines is the recommendation of renal denervation therapy for hypertension treatment by the 2023 ESH guideline (COR II, LOE: B), which is absent from the ACC/AHA guideline. Renal denervation therapy is a device-based treatment intended for patients with uncontrolled resistant hypertension (after excluding secondary hypertension) as either an additional or alternative therapy to increasing medication burden.

The updated 2023 ESH BP guideline is a comprehensive resource for hypertension management. The changes highlighted in this review demonstrate that the recommendations of the U.S. and European guidelines continue to harmonize. Both emphasize proper BP measurement technique, advise use of ASCVD risk assessment tools for treatment decisions, and recommend similar classes of antihypertensive therapies. The guidelines continue to differ in BP classification, hypertension definition, BP targets for older adults, and beta-blocker and device-based treatment strategies. Overall, there is strong agreement that for most people, especially those at highest ASCVD risk, BP < 130/80 mm Hg should be encouraged.

### Beta-blockers for primary prevention in hypertension: era bygone? [^114ppJYX]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are used commonly worldwide in clinical practice for lowering blood pressure. Most of the agents in this class are efficacious in reducing blood pressure, although they vary widely in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. This variability may confer significant differences in clinical benefits associated with use of specific agents. Although commonly used in managing hypertension, the role of beta-blockers for primary prevention in uncomplicated hypertension has been controversial. Evidence from recent trials suggest relatively poor efficacy toward primary prevention and worse outcomes for certain end points, when compared with other blood pressure-lowering agents, Recently updated National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for England and Wales reflect this concern and have changed the indication for beta-blockers for blood pressure control from primary agents to use as an add-on agent in patients requiring multiple therapy. In this review, considering the extended debate on this topic, we discuss the general properties of beta-blockers and evidence from clinical trials supporting or refuting their use in various clinical scenarios. Newer beta-blockers have additional properties which may be beneficial. Although, whether these additional benefits will help in primary prevention is not clear.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Hypertension — prevention of heart failure (HF) is emphasized: optimal blood pressure control decreases the risk of new HF by approximately 50%, and the lifetime risk of developing hypertension in the United States exceeds 75%. In the Framingham Heart Study, hypertension accounted for 39% of HF cases in men and 59% in women, and among patients who have had a prior MI, benefits include an 81% reduction in the incidence of HF. Healthcare providers should lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in accordance with published guidelines, and target levels of blood pressure are lower in patients with associated major cardiovascular risk factors, especially those with diabetes mellitus. Diuretic-based antihypertensive therapy has repeatedly been shown to prevent HF; ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta-blockers are also effective in the prevention of HF, whereas calcium antagonists and alpha-blockers are less effective in preventing HF syndrome. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy, the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) losartan and irbesartan significantly reduced the incidence of HF.

### Are beta blockers effective first-line treatments for… [^115U4kjQ]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 55-year-old woman presents with new-onset hypertension. Clinical Question Should beta blockers be used as first-line treatments for lowering blood pressure. Evidence-Based Answer Current evidence does not support the use of beta blockers as initial therapy for hypertension. In addition, these systematic reviews did not assess the tolerability of beta blockers relative to other antihypertensive medications. Thus, we undertook this review to reassess the place of beta blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension compared with other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. Objectives: To quantify the effectiveness and safety of beta blockers on morbidity and mortality end points in adults with hypertension. The risk of total cardiovascular disease was lower for first-line beta blockers compared with placebo inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for heart failure, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs for diabetes.

1.

Lifetime risk of coronary heart disease and stroke is directly related to higher blood pressure 5; therefore, the primary reason for treating hypertension is to reduce morbidity and mortality from these conditions. Generic beta blockers are inexpensive and may seem appealing as initial antihypertensive therapy; however, this Cochrane review supports the JNC 7 recommendation to begin medical treatment of high blood pressure with thiazide diuretics. ALLHAT demonstrated that thiazide diuretics are as effective as calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors for reducing cardiovascular risk. 6.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^113xvfLh]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — preferred combination therapy and role of beta‑blockers: Three outcome trials compared combinations including a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) with other regimens; in ACCOMPLISH the ACE inhibitor–CCB combination was superior to the same ACE inhibitor with a thiazide diuretic despite no blood pressure (BP) difference, whereas COLM and COPE reported no significant differences and had insufficient statistical power. Based on outcome randomized controlled trials and meta‑analyses, all five major drug classes can, in principle, be combined with one another, except for ACE inhibitors and ARBs, whose concomitant use may lead to no additional benefit but increased adverse effects and is thus discouraged. We recommend that the treatment of hypertension should be preferentially based on combinations of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide‑like diuretic, and these combinations are now widely available in a single pill. Other combinations, such as CCB + diuretic, also have evidence from RCTs supporting their use, but these are much less widely available as SPCs and do not include blockade of the RAS. Beta‑blockers in combination should be preferentially used when there is a specific clinical indication for their use, including symptomatic angina, heart rate control, post‑myocardial infarction, chronic HFrEF, and as an alternative to ACE inhibitors or ARBs in younger hypertensive women planning pregnancy or of child‑bearing potential; SPCs of beta‑blockers with an ACE inhibitor, CCB, or diuretic are available.

### For debate: the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines-cause for concern [^111W8yEP]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Sadly, all the guideline committees (from the USA, the UK and Europe) largely comprise hospital-based specialists. In contrast, most patients with hypertension are managed exclusively in primary care settings because they are less likely to have cardiovascular complications of hypertension. Hospital-based hypertension specialists are more likely to encounter more complex cases many of whom may have suffered the vascular complications of hypertension. The re-endorsement of the beta-blockers for uncomplicated hypertension might not have happened if more primary care physicians had had greater input into the preparation of the guidelines.

To some extent, arguments about first-line drugs are of only limited use as, in most patients, double or triple therapy is necessary to bring the BP under control. But even then, the beta-blockers are only required if there is concomitant heart disease. In primary healthcare, such patients are in the minority. Hence, the return of beta-blockers as a first-line option for the management of uncomplicated hypertension by the ESH is a cause for concern and should be reconsidered.

The synopsis notes that "Controlling hypertension has consistently been shown to decrease aorta-related adverse events", and supporting text reports that long-term oral antihypertensive regimens including beta blockers, ACEIs, and ARBs "have shown to improve long-term outcomes in patients with AAS", while registry data "showed deleterious effects of long-term calcium channel blocker use and, consequently, it may be best to avoid these agents in patients with Marfan syndrome unless necessary to achieve BP control".

Prevention of cardiovascular events — acute MI and history of MI with normal LVEF: In patients with an acute MI, the infusion of a fibrinolytic agent or the use of percutaneous coronary intervention can decrease the risk of developing HF, and patients also benefit from both a beta-blocker and either an ACEI or ARB, which can decrease the risk of reinfarction or death when initiated within days after the ischemic event; combined neurohormonal blockade produces additive benefits. In patients with a history of MI but normal LVEF, both hypertension and hyperlipidemia should be treated vigorously, patients with a recent MI should also receive ACEIs and beta-blockers to reduce death risk, and evidence from 2 large-scale studies indicates that prolonged ACEI therapy can reduce major cardiovascular events even when started months or years after MI.

### Cardiovascular protection using β-blockers: a critical review of the evidence [^1112Eq5E]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

For more than 3 decades, beta-blockers have been widely used in the treatment of hypertension and are still recommended as first-line agents by national and international guidelines. Recent meta-analyses indicate that, in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, compared with other antihypertensive agents, first-line therapy with beta-blockers was associated with an increased risk of stroke, especially in the elderly cohort with no benefit for the end points of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality. In this review, we critically analyze the evidence supporting the use of beta-blockers in patients with hypertension and evaluate evidence for its role in other indications. The review of the currently available literature shows that in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, there is a paucity of data or absence of evidence to support use of beta-blockers as monotherapy or as first-line agents. Given the increased risk of stroke, their "pseudo-antihypertensive" efficacy (failure to lower central aortic pressure), lack of effect on regression of target end organ effects like left ventricular hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction, and numerous adverse effects, the risk benefit ratio for beta-blockers is not acceptable for this indication. However, beta-blockers remain very efficacious agents for the treatment of heart failure, certain types of arrhythmia, hypertropic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and in patients with prior myocardial infarction.

Hypertension in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — Treat as per the current ACC/AHA guidelines for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults and target systolic BP < 130 mm Hg. In participants with hypertension without HF, a more intensive intervention targeting systolic blood pressure < 120 mm Hg significantly reduced the incidence of HF by 38%. Most individuals with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive agents, and an investigation of secondary causes of hypertension may be indicated in some individuals with refractory hypertension despite 4 agents, including a diuretic agent; beta-blockers should generally be avoided given the negative chronotropic effects that may reduce tolerability in HFpEF.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117RsYLN]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Drug treatment algorithm for hypertension — the guideline recommends the following simple treatment algorithm based on six key recommendations: (1) The initiation of treatment in most patients with an SPC comprising two drugs, to improve the speed, efficiency, and predictability of BP control. (2) Preferred two-drug combinations are a RAS blocker with a CCB or a diuretic, with a beta-blocker alternative when there is a specific indication (e.g. angina, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure, or heart rate control). (3) Use monotherapy for low-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension where systolic blood pressure (SBP) is < 150 mmHg, very high-risk patients with high–normal BP, or frail older patients. (4) The use of a three-drug single-pill combination (SPC) comprising a RAS blocker, a CCB, and a diuretic if BP is not controlled by a two-drug SPC. (5) The addition of spironolactone for the treatment of resistant hypertension, unless contraindicated (see section 8.1.4). (6) The use of other classes of antihypertensive drugs in the rare circumstances in which BP is not controlled by the above treatments. The document further notes this treatment algorithm focuses on ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), CCBs, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, and beta-blockers, and that initial therapy for most patients is a two drug-combination, ideally as an SPC.

HFpEF blood pressure management — blood pressure control is well established for prevention of HF and reduction of cardiovascular events and mortality; in HFpEF, targets are extrapolated from hypertension guidelines. RAAS antagonists including ACEi, ARB, MRA, and possibly ARNi, could be first-line agents in HFpEF trials. Beta blockers may be used to treat hypertension in patients with a history of MI, symptomatic CAD, or AF with rapid ventricular response, and this needs to be balanced with the potential contribution of chronotropic incompetence to exercise intolerance in some patients.

Pharmacological treatment for hypertension — other outcomes and beta blocker considerations: The Work Group did not make a formal recommendation for other outcomes such as stroke or heart failure reduction alone, but notable findings were that thiazide-type diuretics were superior to other drug classes for preventing CHF outcomes, CCBs were superior for reducing all-cause mortality, and CCBs were inferior for preventing CHF outcomes; ACEIs and ARBs are not used concomitantly due to recognized safety risks. Although the evidence was not supportive of a recommendation, providers can consider beta blockers as an alternative for patients with compelling indications (e.g., underlying coronary artery disease, following myocardial infarction, or in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction), and patients intolerant to the four main classes may also consider a beta blocker; the systematic review found beta blockers were equivalent to ARBs for composite cardiovascular outcomes with no significant difference versus CCBs or thiazide-type diuretics and no critical outcomes versus ACEIs, but some important outcomes showed beta blockers were inferior, particularly for stroke reduction; beta blockers are not recommended as initial antihypertensive therapy.

OVERALL PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF BB IN PLACEBO-CONTROLLED BP-LOWERING TRIALS

BBs have been the drugs of interest in several antihypertensive treatment trials, in which patients were randomized to a BB (mainly but not exclusively atenolol) versus placebo or an untreated group. In most trials, the use of BB was associated with a statistically and clinically significant reduction of major cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, an observation that has been confirmed by randomized trial-based meta-analyses. –

An example refers to a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials published in 2015 (Figure 1), in which patients randomized to BB showed a 25% and 23% significant reduction in the risk, respectively, of cardiovascular outcomes and cardiovascular mortality, for a ≈10 to 11 mm Hg SBP reduction, with a corresponding 13% nonsignificant reduction of all-cause mortality. In the same meta-analysis, significant outcome reductions were seen also when BP was reduced by other major antihypertensive drugs, except for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients treated with ARBs, whose risk was numerically reduced without attaining statistical significance.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112zkx4m]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — drug treatment strategy states that among all antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, CCBs, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics are indicated as the basis of therapy because they have demonstrated effective reduction of BP and cardiovascular events in randomized controlled trials. Combination treatment is recommended for most hypertensive patients as initial therapy, and preferred combinations should comprise a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic, though other combinations of the five major classes can be used. It is recommended that beta-blockers are combined with any of the other major drug classes when there are specific clinical situations such as angina, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure, or heart rate control. It is recommended to initiate antihypertensive treatment with a two-drug combination, preferably in a single-pill combination (SPC), with exceptions for frail older patients and those at low risk and with grade 1 hypertension (particularly if SBP < 150 mmHg). It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a two-drug combination, treatment should be increased to a three-drug combination, usually a RAS blocker with a CCB and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, preferably as an SPC. It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a three-drug combination, treatment should be increased by the addition of spironolactone or, if not tolerated, other diuretics such as amiloride or higher doses of other diuretics, a beta-blocker, or an alpha-blocker. The combination of two RAS blockers is not recommended.

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^114Zvivw]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

We address the reasons why, unlike other guidelines, in the 2023 guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension β-blockers (BBs) have been regarded as major drugs for the treatment of hypertension, at the same level as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. We argue that BBs, (1) reduce blood pressure (the main factor responsible for treatment-related protection) not less than other drugs, (2) reduce pooled cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in placebo-controlled trials, in which there has also been a sizeable reduction of all major cause-specific cardiovascular outcomes, (3) have been associated with a lower global cardiovascular protection in 2 but not in several other comparison trials, in which the protective effect of BBs versus the other major drugs has been similar or even greater, with a slightly smaller or no difference of global benefit in large trial meta-analyses and a similar protective effect when comparisons extend to BBs in combination versus other drug combinations. We mention the large number of cardiac and other comorbidities for which BBs are elective drugs, and we express criticism against the exclusion of BBs because of their lower protective effect against stroke in comparison trials, because, for still uncertain reasons, differences in protection against cause-specific events (stroke, heart failure, and coronary disease) have been reported for other major drugs. These partial data cannot replace global benefits as the main deciding factor for drug choice, also because in the general hypertensive population whether and which type of event might occur is unknown.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^111bTQCB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

One of the key factors that drives BP control is the prescribing patterns of clinicians, which is highly variable. There are numerous factors that contribute to the choice of antihypertensive medication for individual patients, including patient and clinician preferences. To encourage evidence‐based treatment and standardization of prescribing patterns for antihypertensive regimens, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) published a report on the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure in 2014, and the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published a joint recommendation for the management of hypertension in 2017 (2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines). Briefly, the JNC 8 recommended thiazide diuretics, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as acceptable first‐line treatment options for non‐Black patients and recommended only thiazide diuretics or CCBs as first‐line options for Black patients. Beta blockers were no longer recommended as a first‐line option, in contrast to its previous report. The adoption of the JNC 8 recommendations varied across health care providers, with some controversies mostly centering around an established higher treatment threshold for older adults (150 mm Hg/90 mm Hg for adults 60 years and older); this recommendation deviated from more aggressive targets recommended by other organizations. This controversy later contributed to the development of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines, which differed primarily in the choice of initial medications and the target blood pressure goals. The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a broader use of thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs for all patients, regardless of race, and emphasized selecting medications based on individual patient characteristics and comorbidities. Compared with the JNC 8 report, the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a lower target BP broadly, particularly in high‐risk patients. Following the publication of those guidelines, several international studies have characterized prescribing patterns for antihypertensive medications in select subpopulations (ie, patients with chronic kidney disease [CKD])or in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Prescribing patterns have also been studied in a population‐based cohort in the United Kingdom. To date, there has been limited exploration of how prescribing patterns overall may have changed since publication of the JNC 8 report or 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in the United States. In addition, previous studies have suggested that it can take more than a decade for clinical guidelines to be adopted into routine clinical practice and that those guidelines can be adopted differentially for patients from minority populations. Thus, understanding how the adoption of clinical practice guidelines for antihypertension management may vary by sociodemographic variables may help identify opportunities for more equitable prescribing practices nationally.

Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) — initial medical management is achieved with anti-impulse therapy using a combination of intravenous beta blockers and vasodilators to reduce both heart rate and blood pressure (BP) to decrease aortic wall stress, with small studies emphasizing reduction of heart rate to 60 to 80 bpm and systolic BP (SBP) to < 120 mm Hg. Intravenous beta blockers have been the mainstay of acute medical treatment, with reports emphasizing the importance of continuing this therapy at the time of hospital discharge to improve clinical outcomes; caution should be used in patients with contraindications to beta blockers (eg, acute AR, heart block, or bradycardia), and for intolerance to beta blockers, intravenous non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ie, verapamil or diltiazem) are typically used for initial treatment. Intravenous vasodilators are useful adjunctive therapy for intravenous beta blockers but should be avoided as initial treatment (before starting beta blockers or calcium channel blockers), given the potential for compensatory tachycardia. Pain related to AAS can trigger a rise in heart rate and BP, so treating pain can help control the patient's BP and heart rate; intravenous opiates are particularly efficacious, whereas intravenous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ketorolac may not be suitable because of the risk of inducing hypertension as well as adverse renal effects.

In a small randomized trial, prophylactic propranolol (mean dose, 212 ± 68 mg/d) slowed aortic root growth and reduced aortic complications, and in 155 children < 12 years of age, beta blockers decreased aortic root growth by 0.16 mm/y; additionally, the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guideline states beta-blocker therapy is recommended first-line antihypertensive drug therapy for patients with hypertension and TAD. A meta-analysis of 1510 randomized patients with Marfan syndrome–associated TAA showed slower aortic root growth with ARBs versus placebo, no difference versus beta-blocker therapy, and slower growth with beta blocker plus ARB than beta blocker alone, but the Jikei Heart Study supporting ARBs was retracted and the LOE for use of ARBs has been downgraded to C from B.

Resistant hypertension — medication contributors and foundational regimen — Approximately 20% of adults with hypertension reported regular use of over-the-counter or nonprescription medications that may directly raise BP, and these medications are associated with uncontrolled BP and should be reviewed during evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension; some prescription drugs known to elevate BP should be replaced with alternative agents that avoid hypertensive side effects, if possible. Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol and greater than clonidine, yet 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects.

### 2017 ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline for high blood pressure in adults… [^117Khyh3]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

This guideline provides a new system for classification of blood pressure that identifies stage 1 hypertension as an average systolic BP of 130 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg and stage 2 hypertension as an average SBP of 140 mm Hg or greater or a DBP of 90 mm Hg or greater. It emphasizes accurately measuring BP, averaging readings, and using out-of-office BPs to confirm an office diagnosis and recognize white-coat or masked hypertension. Choosing antihypertensive drug therapy should be influenced by comorbidities with an indication to use an agent that concurrently lowers BP. Without an indication, initial therapy with a diuretic, calcium-channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker is acceptable. The focus should be on BP control rather than therapy choice.

Most adults requiring antihypertensive drug therapy should be treated initially with 2 agents, especially those who are African American or have stage 2 hypertension. The goal during hypertension treatment should be an SBP of less than 130 mm Hg and a DBP of less than 80 mm Hg. Whelton PK, Carey RM.

Changes in Trends After Guidelines

After publication of the JNC 8 report in 2014, which removed beta blockers as a first‐line therapy for most patients (except those with CAD and congestive heart failure) and recommended the use of thiazide diuretics and CCBs alone as first‐line therapies for Black patients, the probability of receiving a beta blocker prescription did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017 but was 3% (95% CI, 2%–4%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with the pre‐JNC 8 time period of 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4A). Among Black patients, the probability of receiving CCB was 20% (95% CI, 18%–22%) higher in 2015 to 2017, and 41% (95% CI, 38%–41%) higher in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4B). Among Black patients, the probability of receiving thiazide diuretics did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017 and was 6% (95% CI, 8%−5%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4B).

Initial combination therapy versus monotherapy — In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dose titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control.

### ACC / AHA versus ESC / ESH on hypertension Guidelines: JACC guideline comparison [^1158QssX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This study compares the recommendations of the most recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) blood pressure guidelines. Both guidelines represent updates of previous guidelines and reinforce previous concepts of prevention regarding elevated blood pressure. Specifically, a low-sodium diet, exercise, body weight reduction, low to moderate alcohol intake, and adequate potassium intake are emphasized. Overall, both guidelines agree on the proper method of blood pressure measurement, the use of home blood pressure and ambulatory monitoring, and restricted use of beta-blockers as first-line therapy. The major disagreements are with the level of blood pressure defining hypertension, flexibility in identifying blood pressure targets for treatment, and the use of initial combination therapy. Although initial single-pill combination therapy is strongly recommended in both guidelines, the ESC/ESH guideline recommends it as initial therapy in patients at ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends its use in patients > 20/10 mm Hg above blood pressure goal. Thus, the only real disagreement is that the ACC/AHA guidelines maintain that all people with blood pressure > 130/80 mm Hg have hypertension, and blood pressure should be lowered to < 130/80 mm Hg in all. In contrast, the ESC/ESH guidelines state that hypertension is defined as > 140/90 mm Hg, with the goal being a level < 140/90 mm Hg for all targeting to < 130/80 mm Hg only in those at high cardiovascular risk, but always considering individual tolerability of the proposed goal.

### Beta blockers compared with other drug options for the… [^111FU2uY]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: Nonpregnant adults with hypertension who have been treated for at least one year with a beta blocker Efficacy End Points: Reduction in incidence of mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease, or total cardiovascular disease Harm End Points: Mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular events, or nonadherence due to adverse effects. Narrative: Hypertension is one of the leading causes of disability and contributors to early death worldwide. 1 Beta blockers have been shown to have a mortality benefit in persons with heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. 2–5 However, their benefit as a first-line treatment for hypertension is controversial. 6–8 In this 2017 Cochrane review of 13 randomized controlled trials with 91, 561 participants, the effectiveness of beta blockers was compared with placebo, diuretics, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers.

Beta blockers showed a reduction in total cardiovascular events compared with placebo; however, the effect was driven by the above-mentioned stroke reduction because there was no significant difference in the outcome for coronary heart disease. In individuals older than 65 years, one randomized controlled trial found atenolol to be inferior to diuretics in reducing coronary heart disease (RR = 1. 63; 95% CI,

1. 15 to 2. 32; NNH = 196]; however, the study is at risk of bias because of a high attrition rate of 25%.
10. **Caveats**: Although beta blockers seem to have a positive impact on patient-oriented evidence that matters, they appear to be inferior when compared with other medications.

Additionally, beta blockers are likely to have a higher rate of adverse effects leading to patient nonadherence. Most studies were judged to have a high risk of bias because of a variety of issues, including inadequate blinding, incomplete data caused by high attrition rates, and heterogeneity in the subsequent antihypertensive medications added to treatment regimens after the beta blocker.

### Misconceptions and facts about beta-blockers [^113tw7oQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers are commonly used medications, and they have been traditionally considered "cardioprotective". Their clinical use appears to be more widespread than the available evidence base supporting their role in cardioprotection. Beta-blockers counteract neurohumoral activation in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and offer both symptomatic improvement and reduction in adverse events. On the other hand, the use of beta-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension results in suboptimal outcomes compared to the established first-line antihypertensive agents. Providers at all levels should be familiar with common misconceptions regarding beta-blocker use in routine clinical practice.

Perioperative hypertension management — beta blockers (BB) and clonidine: If well tolerated, BBs should be continued in patients receiving them for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) indications, with continuation through hospitalization and at discharge unless contraindications arise. Abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided, and data are fewer on whether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative BB followed by rapid discontinuation is harmful. Special consideration is noted for patients taking clonidine or BB because stopping these medications acutely carries risk, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can cause rebound hypertension with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and without plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with coronary artery disease, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate guideline-directed medical therapy with ACEis, ARBs, or β-blockers as first-line therapy for compelling indications (such as recent myocardial infarction or angina) in adult patients with chronic coronary disease and HTN (SBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg), in addition to nonpharmacological strategies. Initiate additional antihypertensive medications (such as dihydropyridine CCBs, long-acting thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) as needed to optimize BP control.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension management — continuation and class-specific considerations are as follows: ongoing treatment of chronic hypertension is recommended in the perioperative period, and if hypertensive patients are unable to take oral medications, it is reasonable to use intravenous medications to control BP. The decision whether to hold or continue antihypertensive medications may be specific to drug class, because certain medications (eg, beta blockers, clonidine) may be associated with rebound hypertension if discontinued abruptly, whereas others have been associated with increased risk of intraoperative hypotension when continued (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi], angiotensin-receptor blockers [ARBs]).

Patients scheduled for surgical procedures — For patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery who have been on beta blockers (BBs) chronically, BBs should be continued throughout the preoperative period to assist with blood pressure (BP) control (Class 1, Level B-NR). For elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue most medications for hypertension throughout the preoperative period (Class 2a, Level C-EO). In major surgery, discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) preoperatively may be considered to prevent hypotension during surgery (Class 2b, Level B-R). In elective major surgery with systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg, deferring surgery may be considered especially in high-risk patients to minimize perioperative complications (Class 2b, Level C-LD). In patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of BB or clonidine may result in rebound hypertension and is potentially harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level B-NR). For patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, BB should not be started on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients because of increased risk of postoperative mortality (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R).

Key Points for Practice
- A blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in most patients with CAD and hypertension.
- A target of 130/80 mm Hg is reasonable in selected patients with CAD, including those with previous MI, stroke, or CAD risk equivalents.
- Recommended medications for patients with hypertension and chronic stable angina include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics.
- Medications with evidence that they reduce risks in patients with ACS include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and possibly aldosterone antagonists. From the AFP Editors The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and American Society of Hypertension have released a guideline on the management of hypertension in patients with coronary artery disease. It updates a previous AHA guideline to reflect newer data.

There is a strong association between hypertension and CAD. This guideline uses the best available evidence to make recommendations about blood pressure reduction and the management of CAD and its varying manifestations. If there are no contraindications to beta blockers, the initial therapy for hypertension in patients with ACS should be an oral short-acting beta. Beta-blocker therapy should be delayed in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or who have decompensated heart failure. A nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be substituted for the beta blocker in patients with ongoing ischemia and no left ventricular dysfunction, and a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker can be added if hypertension and angina are not controlled with initial treatment. An ACE inhibitor or ARB should be added if the patient has an anterior MI or diabetes, hypertension persists, or there is evidence of left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure.

An ACE inhibitor is first-line therapy for lower-risk patients. Aldosterone antagonists are indicated in patients already taking a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor after an MI, and have left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure or diabetes. Serum potassium levels should be monitored, and the medications should be avoided in patients with elevated serum creatinine levels.

Hypertension

Beta-blockers are no longer considered as a preferred initial therapy for essential hypertension. The changing approach and therapeutic options are further clarified in the most recent guidelines. However, many patients still receive beta-blockers or continue therapy from historical prescriptions. Our analysis confirms that beta-blockers are inferior to other agents (most notably CCB and RAS antagonists), particularly in preventing strokes. This may be partly explained by differences in achieved BP, including central systolic BP between different drug treatments, to which cerebrovascular events may be particularly sensitive. In addition, beta-blockers are somewhat less effective than RAS antagonists and CCB in preventing target organ damage.

Importantly, beta-blockers are a heterogeneous class. Whilst vasodilating beta-blockers, such as nebivolol, have demonstrated favourable effects on central BP and cardiovascular surrogates, RCTs with these newer beta-blockers in hypertensive patients are currently lacking. It is possible that there are important differences between beta-blockers in efficacy and safety; however, there are insufficient data to be certain as atenolol was utilised in ~ 75% of trials (our sensitivity analysis could only group together 'non-atenolol' studies). Although there remains a place for beta-blockers in resistant hypertension or those with cardiovascular comorbidities, our data would suggest that physicians should be more aggressive in switching to alternative classes of anti-hypertensive medication.
