## Question

What does an elevated BUN with normal creatinine mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) with normal creatinine means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiology of BUN versus creatinine handling and why they can diverge. Then, I should verify the most common clinical scenarios that produce this pattern, including prerenal azotemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, high protein intake or catabolism, and medication effects. Next, I will review the diagnostic value and limitations of the BUN-to-creatinine ratio, and finally, I should outline a practical, stepwise clinical approach to evaluation and management, making sure I double-check where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the core physiology, because if I get this wrong, everything downstream will be shaky. BUN reflects hepatic urea production and renal excretion, with significant proximal tubular reabsorption that increases when renal perfusion drops, whereas creatinine is produced at a relatively constant rate, filtered, and minimally secreted, so it tends to rise more slowly and later in hypoperfusion states; this asymmetry explains why BUN can be high while creatinine remains normal early on [^04c0622b] [^c3742241].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the most likely scenario. Prerenal azotemia from hypovolemia, heart failure, or vasodilatory states increases proximal tubular urea reabsorption and can raise BUN out of proportion to creatinine, producing a BUN-to-creatinine ratio above 20:1 in classic teaching, though I need to remember this ratio is imperfect and context-dependent in real-world settings [^58b6939a] [^0c152410].

> Wait, let me verify another common cause. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding increases BUN via protein catabolism and intestinal absorption of nitrogenous breakdown products, and concurrent hypovolemia further amplifies urea reabsorption; in this setting, a BUN-to-creatinine ratio above 30 has been used to suggest an upper GI source, although I should confirm that renal function and other confounders are considered before inferring location from this ratio alone [^9de7abd9] [^fac1a82f].

> I need to check for catabolic states and high protein load as well. Fever, sepsis, trauma, corticosteroids, and high-protein diets increase urea generation and can elevate BUN even when creatinine is unchanged, so I should ask about diet, supplements, and clinical stressors before attributing the pattern to renal hypoperfusion alone [^0c152410] [^f3a821b2].

> Let me consider medications next. Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and NSAIDs can reduce intravascular volume or renal perfusion and raise BUN disproportionately, and some drugs like zonisamide can modestly increase BUN; I should review the medication list carefully and correlate with volume status and hemodynamics before labeling this as prerenal azotemia [^9f6163a5] [^3f1c7543] [^2774fa2e].

> But wait, what if the BUN-to-creatinine ratio is not actually helpful diagnostically? I should double-check the evidence. Multiple contemporary studies in ED and ICU cohorts show that BUN-to-creatinine ratio has poor discrimination between prerenal and intrinsic AKI, with ROC AUCs around 0.5–0.55, so I must not overinterpret a single ratio without clinical context, urinalysis, and response to interventions [^0c152410] [^84a2f3da] [^4bed0917].

> Next, I should review a practical clinical approach. First, confirm the abnormality with repeat testing to exclude lab error, then assess volume status, hemodynamics, and urine output; obtain urinalysis with specific gravity, sediment, and if indicated, urinary sodium and fractional excretion of urea to help distinguish prerenal from intrinsic processes; review diet, protein intake, and medications; and consider GI bleeding if the ratio is markedly elevated with compatible symptoms, using endoscopy when indicated rather than relying on the ratio alone [^03899f8c] [^9de7abd9].

> I will now examine management principles, but I need to ensure I align with guidelines. If prerenal azotemia is suspected, treat the underlying cause with volume repletion, optimization of cardiac output, or withdrawal of offending agents; if GI bleeding is present, manage hemorrhage and hemodynamics; if high protein load or catabolism is contributory, adjust nutrition and treat the precipitating illness; and avoid reflexively escalating care based on BUN alone, especially in the ICU where isolated urea elevation is not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the absence of emergent indications [^370eb991] [^3d3715ba] [^ef98780c].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic implications, because clinicians often ask about risk. Elevated BUN has been associated with worse outcomes in heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, and critical illness even when creatinine is normal, likely reflecting neurohormonal activation and systemic illness severity; however, I need to emphasize that BUN is a marker of risk and illness severity rather than a direct therapeutic target, so management should focus on correcting the underlying drivers rather than lowering BUN per se [^89e2d710] [^40f63683] [^b9d807b4].

> In summary, I should confirm that an elevated BUN with normal creatinine most often reflects increased urea reabsorption from renal hypoperfusion, increased urea production from protein catabolism or GI bleeding, or medication effects, and that the BUN-to-creatinine ratio is a crude, context-sensitive clue rather than a definitive diagnostic test. The safest course is to integrate repeat labs, volume and hemodynamic assessment, urinalysis, and medication review to identify and treat the cause, and to avoid overinterpreting isolated BUN elevations without corroborating clinical evidence [^04c0622b] [^0c152410] [^03899f8c].

---

An elevated BUN with normal creatinine most often reflects **prerenal azotemia** (volume depletion, heart failure, or NSAID use) [^04c0622b] causing increased urea reabsorption, or **high protein intake** [^f3a821b2] or gastrointestinal bleeding [^9de7abd9] increasing urea production. Less common causes include **early CKD** [^c3742241], corticosteroids, or catabolic states [^0c152410]. The BUN/creatinine ratio is typically > 20:1 in prerenal states, but this is not specific and should be interpreted in clinical context [^0c152410]. Evaluate with history, exam, urinalysis, and volume assessment; treat the underlying cause and avoid overinterpreting isolated BUN elevations [^03899f8c].

---

## Physiological basis of BUN and creatinine

BUN is a **marker of renal function** [^f3a821b2] and protein metabolism, while creatinine reflects muscle metabolism and glomerular filtration. BUN rises with decreased renal perfusion or increased protein catabolism, whereas creatinine rises more slowly with reduced GFR, explaining why BUN can be elevated with normal creatinine in early or prerenal disease [^04c0622b].

---

## Common clinical scenarios

Several scenarios can elevate BUN while keeping creatinine normal:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Mechanism** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Prerenal azotemia | Increased urea reabsorption due to hypoperfusion | - Dehydration <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - ACE inhibitors [^04c0622b] [^3f1c7543] |
| High protein intake or catabolism | Increased urea production | - High protein diet <br/> - GI bleeding <br/> - Corticosteroids <br/> - Sepsis [^f3a821b2] [^9de7abd9] [^0c152410] |
| Early chronic kidney disease (CKD) | Mild reduction in GFR with preserved creatinine clearance | Early CKD [^c3742241] |
| Laboratory or physiological variability | Analytical or biological variation | - Lab error <br/> - Age <br/> - Sex <br/> - Diurnal variation [^f3a821b2] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach is essential:

- **Confirm the abnormality**: Repeat BUN and creatinine to exclude lab error [^fb485483].
- **History and examination**: Assess volume status, heart failure, GI bleeding, protein intake, and medications [^03899f8c].
- **Urinalysis**: Evaluate for concentrating ability, proteinuria, and sediment [^03899f8c].
- **Calculate BUN/creatinine ratio**: A ratio > 20:1 suggests prerenal azotemia, but is not specific [^0c152410].
- **Additional tests**: Consider urine sodium, FEUrea, or imaging if obstruction is suspected [^03899f8c].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

An elevated BUN with normal creatinine often signals **early or reversible renal hypoperfusion** [^04c0622b] or increased protein catabolism. It can precede overt AKI, so recognizing and treating the cause can prevent progression [^03899f8c]. Persistent elevation may indicate ongoing prerenal stress or early CKD, warranting closer monitoring [^c3742241].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Prerenal azotemia**: Restore volume, treat heart failure, stop NSAIDs/ACE inhibitors [^03899f8c].
- **High protein intake or catabolism**: Adjust diet, treat GI bleeding, manage catabolic states [^0c152410].
- **Early CKD**: Monitor renal function, control blood pressure, and avoid nephrotoxins [^fb485483].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

BUN is influenced by many non-renal factors — diet, hydration, catabolism, and drugs — so isolated elevation can be misleading [^0c152410]. Creatinine is affected by muscle mass, age, and sex, and normal values can mask early GFR decline [^c486f6a4]. Thus, interpret the pattern in clinical context and avoid overcalling disease [^03899f8c].

---

An elevated BUN with normal creatinine usually reflects **prerenal hypoperfusion** or increased protein catabolism; confirm with repeat testing, history, exam, and urinalysis, then treat the cause. This pattern can be an early warning of renal stress, so timely evaluation prevents progression.

### Blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio in the general population and in patients with acute heart failure [^058c4876]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine (BUN/creatinine) ratio has been proposed as a useful parameter in acute heart failure (AHF), but data on the normal range and the added value of the ratio compared with its separate components in patients with AHF are lacking. The aim of this study is to define the normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio and to investigate its clinical significance in patients with AHF.

Methods

In 4484 subjects from the general population without cardiovascular comorbidities, we calculated age-specific and sex-specific normal values of the BUN/creatinine ratio, deriving a higher and lower than normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio (exceeding the 95% prediction intervals). Association of abnormal range to prognosis was tested in 2033 patients with AHF for the outcome of all-cause death through 180days, death or cardiovascular or renal rehospitalisation through 60days and heart failure (HF) rehospitalisation within 60days.

Results

In a cohort of patients with AHF, 482 (24.6%) and 28 (1.4%) patients with HF were classified into higher and lower than normal range groups, respectively. In Cox regression analysis, higher than normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio group was an independent predictor for all-cause death (HR: 1.86, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.66) and death or cardiovascular or renal rehospitalisation (HR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.82), but not for HF rehospitalisation (HR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.86) after adjustment for other prognostic factors including both creatinine and BUN.

Conclusions

In patients with AHF, BUN/creatinine higher than age-specific and sex-specific normal range is associated with worse prognosis independently from both creatinine and BUN. CLINICAL TRIALS: gov identifier NCT00328692 and NCT00354458.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^ef98780c]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the optimal timing for commencement is a difficult decision faced by clinicians when treating acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care setting. Without clinically significant ureamic symptoms or emergent indications (electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload) the timing of RRT initiation remains contentious and inconsistent across health providers. Current trends of initiating RRT in the ICU are often based on isolated blood urea levels without clear guidelines demonstrating an upper limit for treatment. Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

Alanine aminotransferase measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain liver diseases and heart diseases. Elevated levels of the transaminases can indicate myocardial infarction, hepatic disease, muscular dystrophy, or organ damage. Serum elevations of ALT activity are rarely observed, except in parenchymal liver disease since ALT is a more liver-specific enzyme than aspartate aminotransferase. Blood Urea Nitrogen BUN measurements are used in the diagnosis of certain renal and metabolic diseases. The determination of serum urea nitrogen is the most widely used test for the evaluation of kidney function. The test is frequently requested in conjunction with the serum creatinine test for the differential diagnosis of prerenal, renal, and post renal uremia.

High BUN levels are associated with impaired renal function, increased protein catabolism, nephritis, intestinal obstruction, urinary obstruction, metallic poisoning, cardiac failure, peritonitis, dehydration, malignancy, pneumonia, surgical shock, Addison's disease, and uremia. Low BUN levels are associated with amyloidosis, acute liver disease, pregnancy, and nephrosis. Normal variations are observed according to a person's age and sex, the time of day, and their diet – particularly in their protein intake. proportional to the amount of bicarbonate in the specimen. Blood Urea Nitrogen The method to measure blood urea nitrogen utilizes a coupled enzyme reaction, with measurement of NADH occurring at 340 nm. Creatinine is measured using an enzymatic method in which creatinine is converted to creatine under the activity of creatininase. Creatine is then acted upon by creatinase to form sarcosine and urea.

Sarcosine oxidase converts sarcosine to glycine and hydrogen peroxide, and the hydrogen peroxide reacts with a chromophore in the presence of peroxidase to produce a colored product that is measured at 546 nm. Albumin in g/dL was converted to g/L by multiplying by 10 LBXSBU conversion to LBDSBUSI Blood urea nitrogen in mg/dL was converted to mmol/L by multiplying by.

### Blood urea nitrogen / creatinine ratio identifies a high-risk but potentially reversible form of renal dysfunction in patients with decompensated heart failure [^54842031]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Identifying reversible renal dysfunction (RD) in the setting of heart failure is challenging. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether elevated admission blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) could identify decompensated heart failure patients likely to experience improvement in renal function (IRF) with treatment.

Methods and Results

Consecutive hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis of heart failure were reviewed. IRF was defined as ≥ 20% increase and worsening renal function as ≥ 20% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate. IRF occurred in 31% of the 896 patients meeting eligibility criteria. Higher admission BUN/Cr was associated with in-hospital IRF (odds ratio, 1.5 per 10 increase; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–1.8; P < 0.001), an association persisting after adjustment for baseline characteristics (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8; P = 0.004). However, higher admission BUN/Cr was also associated with post-discharge worsening renal function (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8; P = 0.011). Notably, in patients with an elevated admission BUN/Cr, the risk of death associated with RD (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45) was substantial (hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6–3.1; P < 0.001). However, in patients with a normal admission BUN/Cr, RD was not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.67–2.0; P = 0.59; p interaction = 0.03).

Conclusions

An elevated admission BUN/Cr identifies decompensated patients with heart failure likely to experience IRF with treatment, providing proof of concept that reversible RD may be a discernible entity. However, this improvement seems to be largely transient, and RD, in the setting of an elevated BUN/Cr, remains strongly associated with death. Further research is warranted to develop strategies for the optimal detection and treatment of these high-risk patients.

### Serum blood urea nitrogen as an independent marker of subsequent mortality among patients with acute coronary syndromes and normal to mildly reduced glomerular filtration rates [^89e2d710]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

We hypothesized that elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) would be associated with adverse outcomes independent of serum creatinine (sCr)-based estimates of kidney function in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Background

Although lower glomerular filtration rates (GFR) have prognostic significance among patients with ACS, estimates of GFR based on sCr may perform less accurately among patients with milder kidney dysfunction. In this population in particular, BUN, which can reflect increased proximal tubular reabsorption in addition to decreased GFR, may have independent prognostic value.

Methods

Data were drawn from 9,420 patients with unstable coronary syndromes from Orbofiban in Patients With Unstable Coronary Syndromes-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (OPUS-TIMI)-16, a trial that excluded patients with sCr > 1.6 mg/dl or estimated creatinine clearance < 40 ml/min.

Results

Patients with elevated BUN were older, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, and had higher heart rates, lower systolic blood pressures, and an abnormal Killip class more often on admission. In univariate analyses, as well as in stratified and multivariable analyses including sCr-based estimates of GFR as a covariate, a stepwise increase in mortality occurred with increasing BUN (multivariable hazard ratio with BUN 20 to 25 mg/dl 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 2.6; with BUN ≥ 25 mg/dl 3.2 [95% confidence interval 2.2 to 4.7]) compared with BUN ≤ 20 mg/dl. A higher BUN was also associated with increased mortality among strata of troponin-I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein concentrations.

Conclusions

Among patients with unstable coronary syndromes and predominantly normal or mildly reduced GFR, an elevated BUN is associated with increased mortality, independent of sCr-based estimates of GFR and other biomarkers.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^ef0bd6c4]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite early meta-analysis suggesting early RRT improves survival in critical illness, more recent analysis does not support that view. The most comprehensive data regarding optimal timing for RRT initiation comes from a 2017 meta-analysis of RCTs assessing early versus late initiation of RRT in patients with AKI that concluded there was no added benefit of early initiation with respect to 30, 60, and 90-day mortality, overall ICU and hospital mortality, and dialysis dependence. Older studies have demonstrated increased mortality when serum urea reaches higher ranges (50.7–71.4 mmol/L), which perhaps established the tendency to initiate RRT therapy at lower levels.

Evaluation of the available data led to the proposal of serum urea > 35.7 mmol/L as an absolute indication for RRT but no recent RCTs have looked at urea as an independent variable for initiation. The only study found to consider serum urea in isolation confirmed a declining trend of threshold urea level for RRT initiation and no association with in-hospital mortality. Most recent studies did, however, implement an upper limit at which interventional RRT was initiated Table 1.

Table 1
Collation of recent studies with blood urea level criteria in exclusion or intervention

As no recent RCTs assess urea independently, it is reasonable to extrapolate the correlating urea levels to make a plausible appraisal of what level is acceptable to commence RRT. The recently examined upper limit was > 35.7 mmol/L to the onset of clinical signs or symptoms, although most studies initiated treatment no higher than 40 mmol/L. With evidence that no added benefit is derived from early therapy, in the absence of emergent indications a serum urea level of 40 mmol/L is therefore not unreasonable.

The practical implications are balancing the theoretical assumption that early initiation of RRT may lead to earlier removal of uraemic toxins, against the possibility that delayed treatment may result in spontaneous recovery and avoidance of RRT entirely. The KDIGO guidelines conclude that it is unclear whether the risks outweigh the benefits and that RRT should be initiated emergently when life threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte and acid–base balance exist. Furthermore, it recommends considering the broader clinical context, the presence of modifiable conditions and trends of laboratory tests rather than serum urea and creatinine thresholds alone.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^71ce38d4]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Currently there is no well-established upper-limit of serum urea that serves as an indication for initiation of RRT in AKI. Using urea in isolation is difficult and potentially flawed given the variation in base level and production rates amongst different populations as well as it's negligibility as an accurate measure of metabolite toxicity. Furthermore, AKI is a multifactorial condition and it is likely to present earlier with other concerning metabolic or fluid overload abnormalities requiring dialysis rather than isolated elevated blood urea levels. Studies have considered the appropriate timing of initial RRT including early and delayed/late commencement of therapy, with a recent meta-analysis concluding there is no added benefit. Most studies initiated RRT once blood urea level exceeded 40 mmol/L, which is reflected in clinical practice despite evidence to suggest it does not correlate well with onset of uraemic symptoms.

Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT therapy, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^41dc1030]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Without definitive guidelines, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that initiation of RRT in a patient with a urea level less than 40 mmol/L in an otherwise stable clinical context is erroneously exposing them to risks of dialysis without any increased survival benefit. Furthermore, a reasonable argument can be made that even above 40 mmol/L, delaying RRT may be warranted in an otherwise clinically well patient with preserved kidney function.

Correlating clinical symptoms with blood urea levels in the ICU to aid the decision to commence RRT is complicated by many factors that have been identified as contributors to elevated urea levels such as dehydration, increased tubular urea reabsorption, heart failure, glucocorticoid use, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and exogenous protein sources (dietary intake, PEG feeds and colloids). At moderate serum urea levels (21.4 mmol/L) these factors do not appear to elicit ureamic symptoms in isolation from severely impaired kidney function.

Despite reliance on historical data and lack of recent quality evidence, it is plausible that, in the context of established kidney injury, the onset of ureamic symptoms is likely when the blood urea level is greater than 50 mmol/L. However, given the poor correlation with clinical symptoms, the multifactorial nature of AKI and variation in production and excretion, serum urea alone remains a poor indicator of ureamic toxicity, especially in the presence of additional urea-elevating factors, or the absence of other symptomatic or biochemical markers of severe kidney impairment.

### Screening with blood urea nitrogen before intravenous contrast [^34747c94]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

In some settings, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values are available well in advance of creatinine values. We wanted to determine whether BUN values can be used to screen for renal insufficiency for the purpose of intravenous contrast administration. From laboratory records, we derived and validated cutpoints for BUN values to detect creatinine values ≥ 2.0 mg/dL. "Sensitive" and "high-yield" cutpoints were derived using records from 5000 consecutive patients and validated using a random set of 2000 patients. BUN ≥ 15 mg/dL, the "sensitive" cutpoint, had sensitivity of 0.997 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.987–1.0) and specificity of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54–0.59). BUN ≥ 20 mg/dL, the "high-yield cutpoint", had sensitivity of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95–0.99) and specificity of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69–0.73). Negative likelihood ratios for these cutpoints were 0.005 and 0.03, respectively. BUN values < 15–20 mg/dL provide strong evidence against renal insufficiency.

### Elevation of blood urea nitrogen is predictive of long-term mortality in critically ill patients independent of "normal" creatinine [^40f63683]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We hypothesized that elevated blood urea nitrogen can be associated with all-cause mortality independent of creatinine in a heterogeneous critically ill population.

Design

Multicenter observational study of patients treated in medical and surgical intensive care units.

Setting

Twenty intensive care units in two teaching hospitals in Boston, MA.

Patients

A total of 26,288 patients, age ≥ 18 yrs, hospitalized between 1997 and 2007 with creatinine of 0.80–1.30 mg/dL.

Interventions

None.

Measurements

Blood urea nitrogen at intensive care unit admission was categorized as 10–20, 20–40, and > 40 mg/dL. Logistic regression examined death at days 30, 90, and 365 after intensive care unit admission as well as in-hospital mortality. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by multivariable logistic regression models.

Main Results

Blood urea nitrogen at intensive care unit admission was predictive for short- and long-term mortality independent of creatinine. Thirty days following intensive care unit admission, patients with blood urea nitrogen of > 40 mg/dL had an odds ratio for mortality of 5.12 (95% confidence interval, 4.30–6.09; p < .0001) relative to patients with blood urea nitrogen of 10–20 mg/dL. Blood urea nitrogen remained a significant predictor of mortality at 30 days after intensive care unit admission following multivariable adjustment for confounders; patients with blood urea nitrogen of > 40 mg/dL had an odds ratio for mortality of 2.78 (95% confidence interval, 2.27–3.39; p < .0001) relative to patients with blood urea nitrogen of 10–20 mg/dL. Thirty days following intensive care unit admission, patients with blood urea nitrogen of 20–40 mg/dL had an odds ratio of 2.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.98–2.33; < .0001) and a multivariable odds ratio of 1.53 (95% confidence interval, 1.40–1.68; p < .0001) relative to patients with blood urea nitrogen of 10–20 mg/dL. Results were similar at 90 and 365 days following intensive care unit admission as well as for in-hospital mortality. A subanalysis of patients with blood cultures (n = 7,482) demonstrated that blood urea nitrogen at intensive care unit admission was associated with the risk of blood culture positivity.

Conclusion

Among critically ill patients with creatinine of 0.8–1.3 mg/dL, an elevated blood urea nitrogen was associated with increased mortality, independent of serum creatinine.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^0c152410]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study is the largest concerning the diagnostic performance of BCR for differentiating prerenal from intrinsic AKI. It is the first to specifically investigate BCR in an unselected population of patients admitted to the Emergency Department. We have found that BCR had no overall discriminative capacity in this setting, no matter what threshold of BCR is chosen.

Even though the rationale underlying the use of BCR is seducing, our results show that it simply doesn't work in the real world. Indeed, many factors are known to modify BCR independently of effective circulating volume. Gastro intestinal bleeding, a high protein diet, the catabolic effects of fever, trauma, infection, thyrotoxicosis, drugs such as tetracycline or corticosteroids, all increase protein turnover resulting in increased hepatic production of urea and increase BCR. Conversely, in osmotic diuresis and with the use of acetazolamide, proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water is impaired leading to an increase in excreted urea and a decrease in BCR even in states of hypovolemia. BCR also decreases in patients with liver failure or protein malnutrition due to lower levels of BUN. One can also speculate that AKI is probably due to functional and intrinsic disease coexisting in different proportions, in a given patient at a given time. Indeed, it is assumed that a continuum exists which leads from prerenal to intrinsic AKI, the proportion of each changing over time. It can then easily be assumed that BCR would only be reliable if the underlying disease was 100% prerenal or 100% intrinsic, which is probably rarely the case.

We chose a "cut off creatinine" for inclusion of patients at 133 μmol/L. The reason for this was twofold: 1/ This threshold is recognized as the highest creatinine level one can have with a normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ie 75 mL/min per 1.73 m². Indeed, a young (20–29 years old) black male with a creatinine of 133 μmol/L would have a normal GFR. However, all creatinine levels above 133 μmol/L are associated with altered GFRs. By including only patients with creatinine levels greater than 133 μmol/L we were sure to only include patients with renal failure. 2/ If we had included all 26,229 patients with a measured creatinine, we would have selected many healthy individuals admitted to hospital for the first time. Many patients would have met our exclusion criteria because of a short hospital stay (< 48 h) and or no baseline creatinine.

*The article mentions creatinine in ng/dL, but it was assumed that mg/dL was intended

Table 3
Summary of included articles assessing the relation between UCR and protein intake in critically Ill patients

Overview of studies that have examined the effect of a protein intervention on UCR (urea-to-creatinine ratio) responses during critical illness. The table focuses on UCR and the most important inclusion and exclusion criteria; other possible study outcomes unrelated to UCR are not described. The table reports whether the studies used blood urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratios or urea-to-creatinine ratios, both of which are encompassed under the term UCR. Furthermore, in the event of a reported value, the unit of measurement utilised in the UCR is explicitly stated (mg/dL: mg/dL or mmol/L:mmol/L). For details regarding unit conversion, see Fig. 4. F female, HR hazard ratio, ICU intensive care unit, M male, RCT randomized controlled trial, REDOXS trial REducing deaths due to oxidative stress trial, Urea/Cr/UCR urea-to-creatinine ratio

In this review, the term UCR is used to refer to both the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-to-creatinine ratio and the urea-to-creatinine ratio due to both measurements being reported as UCR in the studies under review. If values are referenced in the review, they pertain to the BUN-to-creatinine ratio in mg/dL:mg/dL, unless otherwise indicated. In instances where five or more studies employed the same outcome measure and sufficient event data were available to calculate risk ratios, post-hoc meta-analyses were conducted with a random effects model using R Studio version 2023.06.1 and R version 4.4.1 and presented in forest plots. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I² measure, and a P -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The established cut-off values for UCR were maintained, as presented in the original studies, with the UCR cut-off value illustrated in the meta-analysis. In cases where multiple cut-off values were reported, the one most consistent with the other studies was used.

KDIGO AKI dialysis initiation and discontinuation — renal replacement therapy (RRT): Initiate RRT emergently when life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance exist (Not Graded). When making the decision to start RRT, consider the broader clinical context, conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests — rather than single blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine thresholds alone (Not Graded). Discontinue RRT when it is no longer required because intrinsic kidney function is adequate to meet patient needs or because RRT is no longer consistent with the goals of care (Not Graded).

### Blood urea nitrogen levels to verify estimated glomerular filtration rate, as derived from 2 commonly used equations [^c20aeef7]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) of 20 or greater indicates various physiological conditions. Whether glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimates obtained using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) study equations are affected by a high BCR remains unknown.

Methods

Patients who underwent urine creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine assessments on the same day were enrolled in our study. Those with BCR of 20 or greater and less than 20 were categorized into high- and low-BCR groups. The concordance on diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages by using urine CrCl level and serum GFR estimates was assessed.

Results

More disagreement in CKD stage diagnosis was observed in the high-BCR group (weighted κ = 0.600 and 0.541 for the MDRD and CKD-EPI study equations, respectively) than in the low-BCR group (weighted κ = 0.816 and 0.758, respectively).

Conclusions

A BCR of 20 or greater caused misestimation of the CKD stage. GFR estimates for patients with high BCR should be interpreted cautiously.

### Blood urea nitrogen, blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and incident stroke: the dongfeng-tongji cohort [^838f0393]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

It remains unclear whether extreme levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and BUN to creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) can increase future risk of stroke. We conducted this study to investigate the associations of BUN and BUN/Cr with incident stroke and its subtypes.

Methods

A total of 26,835 and 26,379 participants with a mean follow-up of 7.9 years were included to investigate the associations of BUN and BUN/Cr with incident stroke, respectively. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident stroke and its subtypes.

Results

Compared with participants in the third quintile of BUN, the adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for participants in the lowest quintile were 1.21 (1.04–1.40), 1.41 (1.18–1.68) and 1.36 (0.97–1.91) for total, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively; while for those in the highest quintile, the corresponding HRs (95% CIs) were 1.16 (1.01–1.32), 1.30 (1.11–1.53), and 1.24 (0.90–1.71). The associations remained robust when restricting the analyses to participants within clinically normal range of BUN. For BUN/Cr, compared with participants in the third quintile, participants in the lowest quintile had significant higher risks of stroke (HRs [95% CIs] were 1.19 [1.04–1.37], 1.26 [1.07–1.48], and 1.22 [0.90–1.67] for total, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke).

Conclusions

Both high and low levels of BUN were associated with higher risks of total and ischemic stroke. Low level of BUN/Cr was associated with excess risks of total and ischemic stroke.

### Independent prognostic importance of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio in heart failure [^395bd1f0]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratio is associated with worse outcomes in acute heart failure (HF) but little is known about its importance in chronic HF.

Methods and Results

We combined individual patient data from clinical trials (HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]: PARADIGM-HF, ATMOSPHERE and DAPA-HF, and HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]: PARAGON-HF and I-PRESERVE). The primary outcome examined was a composite time to first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death; its components and all-cause death were also examined. Each HF phenotype was categorized according to median BUN/creatinine ratio, generating four groups that is, HFpEF ≤ and > median BUN/creatinine ratio and HFrEF ≤ and > median BUN/creatinine ratio. The association between BUN/creatinine ratio and outcomes was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazard models. Overall, 28820 patients were analysed. The median (IQR) BUN/creatinine ratio was 20.1 (Q1-Q3 16.7–24.7) in HFpEF and 18.7 (15.2–22.8) in HFrEF. In both HFpEF and HFrEF, higher BUN/creatinine ratio was associated with older age, female sex, and diabetes, but similar estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The risk of each outcome examined was significantly higher in patients with BUN/creatinine ratio ≥ median, compared to < median, even after adjustment for other prognostic variables, including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and eGFR.

Conclusion

Higher BUN/creatinine ratio was associated with worse outcomes in patients with chronic HF across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction, independently of eGFR and NT-proBNP. BUN/creatinine ratio may reflect neurohumoral activation (especially increased arginine vasopressin), altered renal blood flow or other pathophysiologic mechanisms not incorporated in conventional prognostic variables.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^066131f8]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) has been used since the early 1940s to help clinicians differentiate between prerenal acute kidney injury (PR AKI) and intrinsic AKI (I AKI). This ratio is simple to use and is often put forward as a reliable diagnostic tool. Indeed many textbooks of internal medicine, nephrology and critical care continue to advocate the use of BCR even though its usefulness in the diagnosis and clinical management of AKI remains unclear.

Under normal conditions, BCR is less than 100 (with urea and creatinine concentrations expressed in mmol/L). In states of renal hypoperfusion with intact tubular function, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is considered to rise out of proportion to plasma creatinine concentration, due to avid urea reabsorption by the proximal tubule, the BCR typically becoming > 100.

One of the first to put forward this tool was Fishberg in 1939 when he observed that " an increase in urea content of the blood may be considerable before the creatinine value rises in prerenal azotemia". However, as soon as 1947, other investigators found no such relationship. Since then, very few studies (human or animal) have addressed the question and their results are conflicting. These studies consisted of small series of patients, essentially from intensive care units, the largest of which included only 103 patients and this study was not specifically aimed at investigating BCR.

AKI is common in Emergency Departments (ED). It can be challenging to differentiate prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in this setting. Indeed, the ED physician has a short time frame to make decisions, he may not have access to current medication or baseline creatinine, have incomplete medical history and doesn't have by definition the responsiveness to a fluid challenge.

The BCR is one of the diagnostic tools recommended to ED physicians for differentiating between PR and I AKI, yet it has never been specifically studied in this setting.

The aim of this study was to determine whether BCR is a reliable parameter for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic AKI in a population of patients admitted to hospital via the ED.

### The fallacy of the BUN: creatinine ratio in critically ill patients [^9d84d581]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and is associated with a high mortality rate. Pre-renal azotemia, suggested by a high blood urea nitrogen to serum creatinine (BUN:Cr) ratio (BCR), has traditionally been associated with a better prognosis than other forms of AKI. Whether this pertains to critically ill patients is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study of two cohorts of critically ill patients admitted to a single center: a derivation cohort, in which AKI was diagnosed, and a larger validation cohort. We analyzed associations between BCR and clinical outcomes: mortality and renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Results

Patients in the derivation cohort (N = 1010) with BCR > 20 were older, predominantly female and white, and more severely ill. A BCR > 20 was significantly associated with increased mortality and a lower likelihood of RRT in all patients, patients with AKI and patients at risk for AKI. Patients in the validation cohort (N = 10228) with a BCR > 20 were older, predominantly female and white, and more severely ill. A BCR > 20 was associated with increased mortality and a lower likelihood of RRT in all patients and in those at risk for AKI, BUN correlated with age and severity of illness.

Conclusions

A BCR > 20 is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. It is also associated with a lower likelihood of RRT, perhaps because of misinterpretation of the BCR. Clinicians should not use a BCR > 20 to classify AKI in critically ill patients.

### Analysis of prognostic risk factors in critically ill elderly patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury [^65f5dda1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and staging of AKI still rely predominantly on serum creatinine levels and urine output, despite the inherent limitations of these indicators when used in isolation. It is well established that creatinine is a sensitive marker of glomerular filtration rate. Liu et al. demonstrated that infection-induced inflammation and renal hypoperfusion can lead to elevated creatinine levels. However, factors such as medication effects, volume status, and nutritional deficiencies may obscure the accuracy of serum creatinine concentrations, particularly in elderly patients. In this study, elderly patients with SA-AKI and serum creatinine levels ≥ 1.5 mg/dL had a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is crucial to closely monitor serum creatinine levels in elderly septic patients to assess AKI risk. Timely clinical intervention may help reduce the risk of mortality.

UCR ≥ 20 was found to be associated with poor prognosis in elderly patients with SA-AKI, consistent with previous studies. Sepsis often leads to hemodynamic instability. Under hypovolemic conditions, aberrant activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) increases renal tubular sodium and water reabsorption, reduces urea excretion, and results in elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels due to partial reabsorption of BUN in the renal tubules. Both creatinine and BUN levels are susceptible to various confounding factors. The UCR may offer greater stability and diagnostic accuracy by minimizing the influence of these variables. UCR of 10 is considered normal and clinically relevant for identifying prerenal causes of kidney injury, thereby aiding in early AKI detection and improving patient outcomes.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio increased the risk of coronary artery disease in patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^c4fd82fb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

High Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and high Serum Creatinine (SCr) levels are risk factors for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). However, the relationship between the Blood Urea Nitrogen to Creatinine (BUN/SCr) ratio (UCR) and the risk of CAD in patients living with new-onset diabetes is unclear. This study aimed to examine the relationship between blood UCR and the risk of CAD in patients living with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

We analyzed the data from the cohort of 12,299 patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Primary endpoints were the events of CAD. The ANOVA test (continuous indicators) and χ 2 test (categorical indicators) were used to assess the differences of baseline characteristics across the groups of UCR. In order to understand the correlation between variables, we performed correlation analysis on variables that have significant differences between CAD group and non-CAD group. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to estimate the association of the blood UCR with the risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM. The Kaplan–Meier survival function plotting and the log-rank test were used to evaluate the event-free survival according to the groups of UCR. The restricted cubic spline model was used to show the adjusted association between blood UCR and risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM.

Results

During a median follow-up of 2.66 years, 1173 CAD were recorded with an event rate of 28.49 events per 1000 person-years. In multivariate-adjusted Cox regression models, elevated blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (UCR) was associated with higher risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM [hazard ratio (HR), 1.782; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.237–2.567]. The Kaplan–Meier survival curves indicated that the high group of UCR tended to have a lower event-free survival than the low group and medium group. There was a nonlinear trend toward increasing risk of CAD across the groups of UCR. And cubic spline function graph suggested that the influence of UCR level on HR for CAD increased significantly at UCR levels above 6.67.

Conclusions

An elevated UCR was significantly associated with an increased risk for CAD in patients living with T2DM.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen level as a predictor of mortality in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure [^b9d807b4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalization for decompensated heart failure is associated with high mortality after discharge. In heart failure, renal function involves both cardiovascular and hemodynamic properties. We studied the relation between renal dysfunction and mortality in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure.

Methods

The prognostic importance of four measures of renal function-blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio, and estimated creatinine clearance-was evaluated in 541 patients (mean [± SD] age, 63 ± 14 years; 377 men [70%]) with a previous diagnosis of heart failure (96% with New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms) who were admitted for clinical decompensation.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 343 ± 185 days, 177 patients (33%) died. In multivariable Cox regression models, the risk of all-cause mortality increased with each quartile of blood urea nitrogen, with an adjusted relative risk of 2.3 in patients in the upper compared with the lower quartiles (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 4.1; P = 0.005). Creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance were not significant predictors of mortality after adjustment for other covariates. Blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio yielded similar prognostic information as blood urea nitrogen (adjusted relative risk = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4 to 3.8; P = 0.0007 for patients in the upper compared with the lower quartiles).

Conclusion

Blood urea nitrogen is a simple clinical variable that provides useful prognostic information in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure. In this setting, elevated blood urea nitrogen levels probably reflect the cumulative effects of hemodynamic and neurohormonal alterations that result in renal hypoperfusion.

Lastly, recognising that the UCR is reported in disparate units is also crucial. In Europe, the urea/creatinine ratio is frequently used, whereas in the United States, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio is commonly reported. Conversion factors are available for calculating BUN, which is approximately one-half (28/60 or 0.446) of blood urea. It is essential to ensure that both BUN or urea and creatinine are reported in the same units to ensure the accuracy of the ratio calculation (Fig. 4). Standardisation in reporting facilitates comparison between studies and provides a uniform approach to assessing patient outcomes and formulating clinical decision-making.

Fig. 4
Conversion factors BUN and urea. The chemical formula of urea is CO(NH₂)₂, with a molecular weight of approximately 60. Each of the two nitrogen molecules has a weight of approximately 14 g/mol. The ratio 60/28 can be expressed as follows: To convert from BUN to urea, one must multiply by 2.14. Similarly, to convert from urea to BUN, one must divide by 2.14. To convert from mg/dL to mmol/L for BUN and urea, the value should be multiplied by the weight in mol and then multiplied by 10 to convert L to dL. For BUN, this is 2 × nitrogen (2 × 14 = 10/28 = 0.357), while for urea it is CO(NH₂)₂ (10/60 = 0.166). Both BUN and urea in mmol/L are molecular weight units and can be converted without the use of a conversion factor. All of these values are approximations and have been rounded for simplicity.

### Blood urea nitrogen to albumin ratio is a predictor of in-hospital mortality in older emergency department patients [^51f44f7d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the first measured blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/albumin ratio in the emergency department (ED) as a predictor of in-hospital mortality in older ED patients.

Methods

This retrospective observational study was conducted at a university hospital ED. Consecutive patients aged 65 and over who visited the ED in a three-month period were included in the study. The BUN, albumin, creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of patients were recorded. The primary end point of the study was in-hospital mortality.

Results

A total of 1253 patients were included in the statistical analyses of the study. Non-survivors had increased BUN levels (32.9 (23.3–55.4) vs. 20.2 (15.4–28.3) mg/dL, p < 0.001), decreased albumin levels (3.27 (2.74–3.75) vs. 3.96 (3.52–4.25) g/dL, p < 0.001), and increased BUN/albumin ratios (10.19 (6.56–18.94) vs. 5.21 (3.88–7.72) mg/g, p < 0.001) compared to survivors. An increased BUN/albumin ratio was a powerful predictor of in-hospital mortality with an area under the curve of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.753–0.833). Malignancy (OR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.59–3.74, p < 0.001), albumin level < 3.5 g/dL (OR: 2.75; 95% CI: 1.74–4.36, p < 0.001), and BUN/albumin ratio > 6.25 (OR: 2.82; 95% CI: 1.22–6.50, p < 0.015) were found to be independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in older ED patients.

Conclusion

According to our findings, older patients with a BUN level > 23 mg/dL, an albumin level < 3.5 g/dL, and a BUN/albumin ratio > 6.25 mg/g in the ED have a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Additionally, the BUN/albumin ratio is a more powerful independent predictor of in-hospital mortality than the BUN level, albumin level, creatinine level, and eGFR in older ED patients.

This ratio is primarily used to differentiate between prerenal and renal causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). A high BUN/Creatinine ratio (> 20:1) is typically suggestive of a prerenal cause such as dehydration or decreased blood flow to the kidneys, while a low ratio (< 10:1) is more indicative of intrinsic renal disease or postrenal obstruction.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is applicable to patients with suspected kidney disease or injury, or those with known renal conditions where monitoring of renal function is necessary. It is also used in the evaluation of patients with altered mental status or suspected metabolic disorders.

Renal replacement therapy

In critically ill patients with AKI, urea and creatinine are not well performing indicators of renal function given the lack of steady state in terms of production and the influence of catabolism, volume status and production rates, particularly in sepsis. Consequently, physicians treating critically ill patients put an increasing emphasis on fluid overload, oliguria, impaired oxygenation and acidosis as triggers for initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) with a general trend to initiate RRT earlier in sicker patients. Thakar and colleagues performed an international survey predominantly among North American nephrologists consulting in the ICU. They evaluated practice patterns for the initiation of RRT using three different scenarios representing patients with increased severity of disease. The majority of the 172 respondents (70% USA) expressed a reticence in commencing RRT early given the lack of evidence, preferring to base their decision on absolute levels of creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (> 442 μmol/l (> 5 mg/dl), > 35.6 mmol/l (> 100 mg/dl), respectively) rather than any relative rise. Despite this, 94% of physicians reported that they would be likely to start dialysis early in patients with the highest disease burden with early RRT described as a lower BUN on commencing treatment. Thus, the proportion of physicians starting dialysis at a BUN < 75 mg/dl tripled in the more severe case. Finally, given a selection of five parameters (BUN, creatinine, urine output, oxygenation and potassium) for starting RRT, the latter two were given the highest priority, with oxygen saturation appearing as the most frequent trigger in severe cases. These results also differ from a recently published survey among 275, mainly European, intensivists. Whereas the median thresholds with regard to sCr (300 μmol/l) or urea (40 mmol/l) were similar, there was a higher priority with hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and volume overload. In addition, they demonstrated a trend towards early initiation of RRT, with the majority favoring initiation when a diagnosis of AKI was made based on AKIN/RIFLE criteria, particularly with regard to oliguria. As usual, it must be remarked that data from surveys have a high risk of self-selection of participants; however, these results should not be overlooked as they represent the view of a large panel of experts.

Chart review

Patient's records were reviewed using the hospital admissions and discharges database. Relevant data was entered in a format that could be converted to an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. The following information was obtained for each admission: basic demographics, dates of hospital admission and discharge, admission plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and BCR, information concerning urinary obstruction, lowest creatinine measured 12 months before/after admission, lowest creatinine measured during the 7 days following admission and presence or absence of AKI using KDIGO classification.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Software (La Jolla, CA, USA). Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Comparison of biochemical and clinical data between prerenal AKI (PR AKI) and intrinsic AKI (I AKI) patients was done using unpaired t-tests. Predictive performance of BCR in terms of specificity and sensitivity was performed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. For all analyses, a P value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

### Intraperitoneal extravasation of urine… [^72fba8ae]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Two patients with nontraumatic bladder rupture and intraperitoneal extravasation of urine were found to have an elevation of blood urea nitrogen content disproportionate to the normal or mildly elevated serum creatinine value. In the absence of other causes for this disproportion, and supported by observations on BUN and creatinine removal in peritoneal dialysis, it is suggested that in azotemic subjects a ratio of BUN to creatinine level far in excess of the mean figure of 10.8 to 1 may occur as a result of intraperitoneal extravasation of urine.

### Blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio: a good predictor of in-hospital and 90-day all-cause mortality in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^8d90de5c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Blood urea nitrogen(BUN) is the nitrogen component in urea, the final product of metabolism, which originates from the liver and is excreted by the kidney. Based on previous research findings, and compared with survivors, a higher BUN level was found in those who died in hospital. In this study, our results also showed that the non-survivor group had a higher BUN level than the survivor group during hospitalization. Thus, we suggest that elevated BUN levels reflect the severity of the disease. In addition, BUN was shown to have a predictive effect on the prognosis of the disease. One retrospective cohort study from China performed by Chen et al. found that an elevated BUN level was related to hospital mortality in COPD patients with exacerbations for those who presented at the emergency department. Figure 2 shows that BUN levels could predict hospitalization outcomes of the hospitalized patients with AECOPD (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.92, P < 0.001). This was similar to previous findings that indicated elevated BUN levels were associated with increased mortality.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^c2c12fe6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Our methodology induces 2 limitations. Firstly our study was retrospective with the well-known limitations of such studies and in particular it was not possible for us to assess the contribution of the "urine output", component of the KDIGO criteria. Secondly there is no widely accepted definition of prerenal AKI. The common observation is that it is a reversible condition, but diagnostic criteria such as the amount, nature and duration of fluid resuscitation, time frame for reversibility, or target creatinine improvement have not been addressed. We defined prerenal AKI as a return of serum creatinine to 110% (or less) of the baseline value during the 7 days following admission. In their review of AKI, Bagshaw et al. reported that time frames for defining reversibility ie PR AKI, varied considerably from 48 h to 7 days or more and sometimes were not reported at all. The shorter (48–72 h) is the most published time frame but concerns almost exclusively patients from intensive care units, where blood samples are drawn every day which is not necessarily the case for most patients, such as ours, admitted to medical wards. By choosing a 72 h time frame for reversibility we would have had to exclude many patients who didn't have blood samples precisely on day 3. We did however carry out a subgroup analysis of these patients. We found 418 (38%) patients that had BUN and creatinine measured at 72 h. Again there was no statistical difference between mean BCR of the prerenal and the intrinsic AKI groups, the area under the ROC curve was 0.55.

Separating prerenal from intrinsic AKI remains challenging. No biological marker, whether old school (fractional excretion of sodium or urea, urinary sodium (UNa,) urine-to-plasma creatinine ratio (U:PCr), etc) or new biomarkers such as Cystatin C, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (N-GAL), has clearly demonstrated a capacity to correctly classify AKI. On the ED, the importance of taking a complete medical history, obtaining the list of current potentially nephrotoxic medication, assessing hemodynamic status and if required initiating a fluid challenge, still remains "cornerstone" management of AKI.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^832cfd81]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Urea production is directly proportional to the daily protein intake, and restriction of dietary protein intake results in a reduction of urea generation. Many studies regarding the efficacy of dietary protein restriction on kidney disease progression have been conducted; however, results have been inconsistent. The largest randomized controlled trial, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study, demonstrated that a very low-protein diet (VLPD) supplemented with ketoacids slowed the rate of CKD progression compared with a low-protein diet (LPD), but this was not statistically significant. Two meta-analyses in the 2000s noted that an LPD significantly decreased the risk of adverse renal outcomes in nondiabetic patients but not in diabetic patients. A recent meta-analysis investigated the effects of LPD and VLPD on various outcome measures in CKD patients. Patients who received an LPD had a significantly reduced risk of progression to ESRD compared with those who received higher protein diets. In addition, the risk of progression to ESRD was significantly lower in patients who received a VLPD than in those who received an LPD. Garneata et al. also noted that a vegetarian VLPD supplemented with ketoanalogues could delay the need to initiate dialysis compared with an LPD and that VLPD recipients showed improvement in metabolic parameters, including a decrease in serum urea, compared with LPD recipients. In the present study, we did not assess dietary protein intake or BUN levels in each patient after discharge. Therefore, we could not evaluate whether the amount of protein intake after discharge affected changes in BUN levels or adverse renal outcomes or whether the degree of change in BUN levels was related to the rate of CKD progression.

The line in the middle of the box is plotted at the median and whiskers delimit min to max values. a - BUN values at admission of patients with prerenal (PR AKI) and intrinsic AKI (I AKI); (b) - Plasma creatinine values at admission of patients with PR AKI and I AKI; (c) - Lowest plasma creatinine during the 7 days following admission (Adm.) of patients with PR AKI and I AKI

During the 7 days following admission, the patient's lowest plasma creatinine concentrations were selected and compared with their baseline creatinines (Fig. 2c and Table 2). In the PR AKI group, the mean lowest creatinine concentrations during the 7 days follow-up was 118.0 ± 65.2 μmol/L (range [30–606]; median 105). The mean difference with plasma creatinine concentrations at admission was 91.6 μmol/L. In the intrinsic AKI group, the mean lowest creatinine concentrations during the 7 days follow-up was 162.4 ± 96.6 μmol/L (range [32–832]; median 138). The mean difference with plasma creatinine concentrations at admission was 69.7 μmol/L. Mean difference between baseline and lowest 7 day follow-up creatinine was significantly lower in the PR AKI group than in I AKI group (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2c).

The distribution of the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) in the 2 groups is shown in Fig. 3. At admission, BCR was 90.6 ± 39.3 (range [24.4–262.7]; median 83.0) and 91.3 ± 39.8 (range [9.8–269.1]; median 81.8) in PR AKI and I AKI groups respectively. There was no statistical difference between mean BCR of the prerenal AKI group and the intrinsic AKI group, p = 0.758 (Fig. 3 and Table 2).

### A low BUN / creatinine ratio predicts histologically confirmed acute interstitial nephritis [^4455c396]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In hospitalized patients with AKI, the presence of BCR ≤ 12 is a robust parameter that suggests the diagnosis of AIN. The BCR is obtained from a basic metabolic panel, and its low cost allows for longitudinal quantification. Additionally, if urinalysis and clinical course are atypical for AIN, a low BCR could provide additional support and allow for the avoidance of kidney biopsy in some patients.

### Biomarkers for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury [^28d097b8]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The identification of acute kidney injury relies on tests like blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine that were identified and incorporated into clinical practice several decades ago. This review summarizes clinical studies of newer biomarkers that may permit earlier and more accurate identification of acute kidney injury.

Recent Findings

The urine may contain sensitive and specific markers of kidney injury that are present due to either impaired tubular reabsorption and catabolism of filtered molecules or release of tubular cell proteins in response to ischemic or nephrotoxic injury. Many potential markers have been studied. Promising injury markers in the urine include N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, kidney injury molecule-1, and interleukin-18. Serum cystatin C may be a better measure of glomerular filtration rate than serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen.

Summary

New biomarkers of kidney injury and glomerular filtration rate hold the promise of substantially improving the diagnostic approach to acute kidney injury. Adequately powered clinical studies of multiple biomarkers are needed to qualify the biomarkers before they can be fully adopted in clinical practice. Once adopted, more sensitive biomarkers of acute kidney injury hold the potential to transform the care of patients with renal disease.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^4bed0917]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The prediction of the capacity of BCR to correctly classify AKI as intrinsic or prerenal was further tested by a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The area under the curve was 0.5 indicating that the BCR had no capacity to discriminate between prerenal and intrinsic AKI (Fig. 4). At the threshold of 100 commonly used to distinguish PR AKI (BCR > 100) from I AKI (BCR < 100), the sensitivity was 70.1% and the specificity 32.6%.

Fig. 4
Receiver operating curve analysis of predictive performance of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR)

The distribution of patients with a BCR < 100 or > 100 was further analysed and compared to renal recovery (Table 4).

Table 4
Distribution of prerenal and intrinsic AKI patients according to whether BCR < or > 100

If prerenal AKI was redefined as a return of serum creatinine to 110% of baseline in 72 h (rather than 7 days), 418 (38%) patients could be analysed. These are the patients that had BUN and creatinine measured precisely at 72 h. Then 166 (39.7%) patients had PR AKI and 252 (60.3%) I AKI. At admission, mean BCR was 88.4 ± 39.6 (range [24.4–229.8]; median 82.8) and 95.3 ± 42.7 (range [9.8–269.1]; median 86.2) in PR AKI and I AKI groups respectively. There was no statistical difference between mean BCR of the prerenal AKI group and the intrinsic AKI group, p = 0.094. The area under the ROC curve was 0.55.

Analysis of patients presenting with acute heart failure (n = 191), typically associated with increased BCR, showed that 33% had PR AKI and 67% had I AKI, mean BCR was 98.3 ± 38 (range [37.3–250.6]; median 90.2).

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^f8be9a0b]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO dialysis interventions for treatment of AKI — RRT initiation, decision context, discontinuation, and diuretics: Initiate RRT emergently when life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance exist (Not Graded). Consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests — rather than single BUN and creatinine thresholds alone — when making the decision to start RRT (Not Graded). Discontinue RRT when it is no longer required, either because intrinsic kidney function has recovered to the point that it is adequate to meet patient needs, or because RRT is no longer consistent with the goals of care (Not Graded). We suggest not using diuretics to enhance kidney function recovery, or to reduce the duration or frequency of RRT (2B).

Results

During the study period, 60,160 patients ≥ 16 years old were consecutively admitted to the Emergency Department of Nantes University Hospital. Creatinine levels were measured 28,149 times for 26,299 patients. Two thousand seven hundred and fifty six had plasma creatinine levels in excess of 133 μmol/L but 1653 were excluded because they met one or more exclusion criteria, leaving 1103 patients for definitive inclusion (Fig. 1).

Study Flow-chart – Patients admitted with plasma creatinine > 133 μmol/L to the Medical Emergency Department of Nantes University Hospital from 1st of November 2013 to the 30th of November 2014

The demographic characteristics of the 1103 included patients are presented in Table 2. Mean age was 75.7 ± 14.8 years old (range [16–103]; median 80), 693 (62.8%) were male. According to our definitions, 498 (45%) patients had prerenal AKI (PR AKI) and 605 (55%) intrinsic AKI (I AKI). The PR AKI and I AKI groups do not differ in terms of age (p = 0.518) (Table 2). Patients are classified according to their stage of AKI in Table 3.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^03899f8c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury evaluation and stage-based management — Initial assessment, monitoring, nephrotoxin exposure, hemodynamic assessment, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk management are outlined as follows: Laboratory parameters — including SCr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolytes, complete blood count and differential — should be obtained, and urine analysis and microscopic examination as well as urinary chemistries may be helpful in determining the underlying cause of AKI; imaging tests, especially ultrasound, are important components of the evaluation for patients with AKI. Individualize frequency and duration of monitoring based on patient risk, exposure and clinical course, and it is advisable to tailor management to AKI stage. While stage-based actions provide a starting point, they are neither complete nor mandatory for an individual patient, and the measurement of urine output does not imply that the urinary bladder catheterization is mandatory for all patients. Nephrotoxic drugs account for some part of AKI in 20–30% of patients, and it seems prudent to limit exposure to these agents whenever possible and to weigh the risk of developing or worsening AKI against the risk associated with not using the agent. To ensure adequate circulating blood volume, static variables like central venous pressure are not nearly as useful as dynamic variables, such as pulse-pressure variation, inferior vena cava filling by ultrasound and echocardiographic appearance of the heart. Since AKI is a risk factor for CKD, it is important to evaluate patients with AKI for new onset or worsening of pre-existing CKD; if patients have CKD, manage patients as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline (Guidelines 7–15), and if patients do not have CKD, consider them to be at increased risk for CKD and care for them as detailed in the KDIGO CKD Guideline 3 for patients at increased risk for CKD.

### Major reductions in unnecessary aspartate aminotransferase and blood urea nitrogen tests with a quality improvement initiative [^11a5450d]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Background/Context

Unnecessary laboratory testing leads to considerable healthcare costs. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), commonly ordered with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), commonly ordered with creatinine (Cr), often add little value to patient management at significant cost. We undertook a choosing wisely based quality improvement initiative to reduce the frequency of testing.

Objectives

To reduce the ratio of AST/ALT and BUN/Cr to less than 5% for all inpatient and outpatient test orders.

Measures

Absolute number and ratio of AST/ALT and BUN/Cr; AST, ALT, BUN and Cr tests per 100 hospital days; projected annualised cost savings and monthly acute inpatient bed days.

Improvements

We created guidelines for appropriate indications of AST and BUN testing, provided education with audit and feedback and removed AST and BUN from institutional order sets.

Impact/Results

The ratios of AST/ALT and BUN/Cr decreased significantly over the study period (0.37 to 0.14, 0.57 to 0.14, respectively), although the goal of 0.05 was not achieved due to a delay in adopting the choosing wisely strategies during the study time period by some inpatient units. The number of tests per 100 hospital days decreased from 20 to 7 AST (95%CI 19 to 20.5, 5.6 to 8.7, p < 0.001) and from 72 to 17 BUN (95%CI 70 to 73.4, 16.6 to 22.9, p < 0.001). The initiative resulted in a projected annualised cost savings of C$221 749.

Discussion

A significant decrease in the AST/ALT and BUN/Cr ratios can be achieved with a multimodal approach and will result in substantial healthcare savings.

### Evaluation of short-term changes in serum creatinine level as a meaningful end point in randomized clinical trials [^ef3aae26]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Observational studies have shown that acute change in kidney function (specifically, AKI) is a strong risk factor for poor outcomes. Thus, the outcome of acute change in serum creatinine level, regardless of underlying biology or etiology, is frequently used in clinical trials as both efficacy and safety end points. We performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials to quantify the relationship between positive or negative short-term effects of interventions on change in serum creatinine level and more meaningful clinical outcomes. After a thorough literature search, we included 14 randomized trials of interventions that altered risk for an acute increase in serum creatinine level and had reported between-group differences in CKD and/or mortality rate ≥ 3 months after randomization. Seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, increased risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.89), and seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, reduced risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.74). However, pooled risks for CKD and mortality associated with interventions did not differ from those with placebo in either group. In conclusion, several interventions that affect risk of acute, mild to moderate, often temporary elevation in serum creatinine level in placebo-controlled randomized trials showed no appreciable effect on CKD or mortality months later, raising questions about the value of using small to moderate changes in serum creatinine level as end points in clinical trials.

### Association between the blood urea nitrogen-albumin ratio and mortality in critically ill patients with gastrointestinal bleeding: a retrospective cohort study [^580a11e7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common, high-risk emergency with heterogeneous etiologies. Clinical presentations — including hematemesis, melena, or fecal occult blood — vary depending on the bleeding site and severity. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding has an annual incidence of approximately 67 per 100,000 individuals, significantly higher than lower gastrointestinal bleeding (36 per 100,000). The mortality rate of GIB ranges from 5% to 10%. Advanced age, comorbidities (e.g. liver cirrhosis or renal dysfunction), and physiological derangements such as hypotension or hyperlactatemia are independent predictors of mortality.

Massive hemorrhage carries a significant risk of life-threatening complications, including hypovolemic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), myocardial ischemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), all requiring prompt resuscitation and intensive care. The management of severe bleeding typically involves a multimodal approach incorporating blood product transfusions, endoscopic hemostasis, vasoactive support, and often prolonged hospitalization, which significantly strains healthcare systems. Given the unpredictable disease progression, early and precise risk stratification is crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes.

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), a routinely assessed parameter of renal function, reflects not only glomerular filtration but also extrarenal influences such as dehydration, protein catabolism, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. In GIB patients, BUN elevation primarily results from intestinal absorption of nitrogenous blood breakdown products and diminished renal perfusion secondary to hypovolemia. Notably, marked BUN increases may predispose patients to AKI. Concurrent hypoalbuminemia exacerbates physiological derangements by reducing intravascular oncotic pressure while activating anti-inflammatory responses and oxidative stress during ischemia-reperfusion injury. These pathological cascades subsequently impair cellular metabolism and accelerate multiple organ dysfunction progression.

The Blood Urea Nitrogen-to-albumin ratio (BAR), integrating both BUN and Albumin (ALB) measurements, has emerged as a reliable prognostic marker across multiple clinical contexts, including acute pancreatitis, sepsis, and pneumonia. Elevated BAR values consistently correlate with worse clinical outcomes, and higher mortality rates in various systemic disorders. Nevertheless, its prognostic utility specifically for GIB patients remains inadequately characterized. This study seeks to (1) assess the prognostic value of BAR in GIB patients, and (2) establish the optimal BAR threshold for early detection and risk stratification of high-risk cases in clinical practice.

### Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide [^9f6163a5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests

Serum Potassium

The normal adult range of serum potassium is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L with 4.5 mEq often being used for a reference point. If hypokalemia should develop, corrective measures should be taken such as potassium supplementation or increased dietary intake of potassium-rich foods.

Institute such measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels. Potassium levels persistently above 6 mEq/L require careful observation and treatment. Serum potassium levels do not necessarily indicate true body potassium concentration. A rise in plasma pH may cause a decrease in plasma potassium concentration and an increase in the intracellular potassium concentration. Discontinue corrective measures for hypokalemia immediately if laboratory determinations reveal an abnormal elevation of serum potassium.

Discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules and substitute a thiazide diuretic alone until potassium levels return to normal.

Serum Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen

Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may produce an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, creatinine level, or both. This apparently is secondary to a reversible reduction of glomerular filtration rate or a depletion of intravascular fluid volume (prerenal azotemia) rather than renal toxicity; levels usually return to normal when triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules is discontinued. If azotemia increases, discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules. Periodic BUN or serum creatinine determinations should be made, especially in elderly patients and in patients with suspected or confirmed renal insufficiency.

Serum Protein-Bound Iodine

Thiazide may decrease serum protein-bound iodine (PBI) levels without sign of thyroid disturbance.

Parathyroid Function

Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides. Pathologic changes in the parathyroid glands with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy. The common complications of hyperparathyroidism such as bone resorption and peptic ulceration have not been seen.

Rhabdomyolysis and renal disease screening among stimulant users — There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for rhabdomyolysis or renal disease among patients who use stimulants; however, clinicians should have an elevated degree of suspicion for these conditions when evaluating patients with long-term or heavy stimulant use and consider ordering relevant tests — such as creatine kinase [CK] for rhabdomyolysis, blood urea nitrogen [BUN]/creatinine ratio [BCR], urine albumin (ie, proteinuria) for renal disease — at a lower threshold of suspicion based on patient history and physical exam findings.

### Acute kidney injury [^7664a59d]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (formerly known as acute renal failure) is a syndrome characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney's excretory function and is typically diagnosed by the accumulation of end products of nitrogen metabolism (urea and creatinine) or decreased urine output, or both. It is the clinical manifestation of several disorders that affect the kidney acutely. Acute kidney injury is common in hospital patients and very common in critically ill patients. In these patients, it is most often secondary to extrarenal events. How such events cause acute kidney injury is controversial. No specific therapies have emerged that can attenuate acute kidney injury or expedite recovery; thus, treatment is supportive. New diagnostic techniques (eg, renal biomarkers) might help with early diagnosis. Patients are given renal replacement therapy if acute kidney injury is severe and biochemical or volume-related, or if uraemic-toxaemia-related complications are of concern. If patients survive their illness and do not have premorbid chronic kidney disease, they typically recover to dialysis independence. However, evidence suggests that patients who have had acute kidney injury are at increased risk of subsequent chronic kidney disease.

### A low BUN / creatinine ratio predicts histologically confirmed acute interstitial nephritis [^0488b93e]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our retrospective study demonstrated that low BCR (BCR < 12) adequately predicts the diagnosis of histological AIN in patients with AKI. The diagnostic utility of low BCR was previously described in obstructive uropathy, in which low BCR correlated with elevated urea in hospitalized patients. Additionally, BCR < 10 identified AIN in Mesoamerican nephropathy. To our knowledge, there has been no other report on the diagnostic performance of BCR in a prospective study involving patients with AKI and AIN.

Creatinine is a product of muscle metabolism. Creatine is broken down into creatinine by a nonenzymatic mechanism. It is filtered in the glomerulus and secreted in the proximal tubule. At steady-state, the daily urinary creatinine that is excreted is equal to that produced, and this quantity is directly related to muscle mass. In contrast, urea is excreted at the same rate as creatinine in the glomerulus but is reabsorbed into the tubules. In the hemodynamic etiologies of AKI (prerenal), the activation by antidiuretic hormone causes preferential urea reabsorption, thus resulting in a BCR > 20. AIN is characterized by tubular dysfunction and an acute decrease in glomerular filtration rate. Edema, interstitial inflammation, and tubulitis are the main histopathological features of AIN. In AIN, the abnormal reabsorption of water and sodium leads to increased urea excretion and decreased reabsorption. The low BCR in patients with AIN can be explained by the combinatorial effects of the changes in urea excretion, filtration, and reabsorption with the reduction in creatinine secretion as the glomerular filtration rate declines.

### Investigating the simultaneous effect of longitudinal biomarkers on long-term kidney transplant failure in Iranian kidney transplant patients: a multivariate joint model [^dfcbb070]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

By conducting subgroup analysis, we examined the effectiveness of longitudinal biomarkers in various subgroups. Subgroup analysis revealed that elevated serum creatinine (mg/dL) is an effective biomarker for diagnosing graft failure and significantly increases the risk of rejection in patients over 33 years of age and in males. In contrast, elevated BUN (mg/dL) levels and decreased hematocrit (%) levels are effective biomarkers for diagnosing the risk of graft failure in patients aged 33 years or younger and in females. In patients with living donors and those with a time of dialysis ≤ 24 months, changes in all three longitudinal biomarkers are significantly associated with the risk of graft failure. In contrast, for patients with cadaveric donor type, hypertension, creatinine at transplant time ≥ 1.6 mg/dL, and time of dialysis > 24 months, changes in just serum creatinine are significantly associated with the risk of graft failure. These findings suggest that each biomarker may have greater diagnostic relevance within specific clinical subgroups.

It should be noted that multiple subgroup comparisons increase the likelihood of false-positive findings. Since our subgroup analyses were exploratory, we did not apply corrections such as Bonferroni or FDR. We encourage future confirmatory studies to test these subgroup effects with appropriate statistical adjustments.

The findings of this study have clinical relevance in the management of kidney transplant recipients. The observed association between increasing serum creatinine (mg/dL) and BUN (mg/dL) levels and declining hematocrit (%) levels with graft failure underscores the value of dynamic, individualized monitoring of these biomarkers. Clinicians may use these trajectories to stratify patients based on their risk of rejection and tailor follow-up schedules accordingly. For example, patients showing an upward trend in serum creatinine or BUN, even within the normal range, may benefit from more frequent monitoring or early intervention, such as imaging, biopsy, or adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy. Similarly, a declining hematocrit trajectory may serve as an early signal of impaired graft function, prompting timely clinical evaluation. Integrating multivariate biomarker trends into post-transplant care may facilitate the timely detection of subclinical graft injury and improve long-term outcomes by guiding preventive or therapeutic actions before irreversible damage occurs.

### Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide (triamterene hydrochlorothiazide) [^fff0a29c]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE AND BUN INCREASES

Patients receiving triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be carefully monitored for fluid or electrolyte imbalances; i.e., hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are especially important and should be frequently performed when the patient is vomiting or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Any chloride deficit during thiazide therapy is generally mild and usually does not require any specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hypokalemia may develop with thiazide therapy, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or during concomitant use of corticosteroids, ACTH, amphotericin B or after prolonged thiazide therapy. However, hypokalemia of this type is usually prevented by the triamterene component of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide.

Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability).

Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may produce an elevated blood urea nitrogen level (BUN), creatinine level or both. This is probably not the result of renal toxicity but is secondary to a reversible reduction of the glomerular filtration rate or a depletion of the intravascular fluid volume. Elevations in BUN and creatinine levels may be more frequent in patients receiving divided dose diuretic therapy. Periodic BUN and creatinine determinations should be made especially in elderly patients, patients with suspected or confirmed hepatic disease or renal insufficiencies. If azotemia increases, triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued.

HEPATIC COMA

Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

### Association between the blood urea nitrogen-albumin ratio and mortality in critically ill patients with gastrointestinal bleeding: a retrospective cohort study [^7a424ff6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The BAR combines two essential biomarkers — BUN and albumin — into a single integrative metric. Unlike isolated BUN or ALB measurements, BAR more comprehensively reflects systemic perturbations, including acute hemorrhage, metabolic dysregulation, and inflammatory stress. Given its sensitivity to these pathophysiological derangements, an elevated BAR serves as an efficient, cost-effective tool for early risk stratification and disease severity assessment, as it is readily calculable from routine laboratory data. Clinically, a high BAR value may signal increased risk, prompting closer monitoring and timely intervention, while a low BAR may indicate stability, potentially reducing unnecessary interventions. Due to its simplicity and accessibility, BAR has significant potential to improve risk assessment and optimize resource allocation in clinical practice.

While this large-scale, population-based study provides valuable clinical insights, several limitations warrant consideration. First, the single-center design, despite utilizing comprehensive real-world data, may limit the generalizability of findings to diverse geographic populations. Second, the lack of systematic assessment of disease severity and etiologic factors could introduce heterogeneity in subgroup analyses. Additionally, by focusing exclusively on all-cause mortality without causal attribution, the study does not account for the multifactorial nature of critical illness mortality. The restriction to ICU patients may further compound selection bias. Future multicenter studies incorporating standardized severity assessments and refined analytical approaches would help address these limitations.

### Investigating the simultaneous effect of longitudinal biomarkers on long-term kidney transplant failure in Iranian kidney transplant patients: a multivariate joint model [^0e6abc7b]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The results of this study showed that elevated serum creatinine and BUN levels, along with decreased hematocrit levels, are associated with an increased risk of graft failure. Accordingly, measuring these biomarkers in patients' visits after kidney transplantation is crucial. Although BUN was significantly associated with an increased risk of graft failure in the univariate joint models, this effect was not statistically significant in the multivariate joint model after adjusting for serum creatinine, hematocrit, and baseline covariates. This suggests that other correlated biomarkers, such as serum creatinine, may confound the apparent association between BUN and graft rejection. Therefore, the role of BUN as an independent predictor of graft failure should be interpreted cautiously, and future studies are warranted to clarify its clinical utility in multivariate contexts.

Previous studies have shown that serum creatinine and BUN are important biological markers, with increases in these levels being associated with decreased kidney function. In a study conducted on cohort data of kidney transplant patients using a multivariate joint model, Jaffa et al. concluded that there is a significant relationship between the trend of changes in serum creatinine and BUN and the risk of graft failure. In a 2016 study by Maraghi et al. that examined the effect of a single longitudinal biomarker, serum creatinine, on graft survival, each unit increase in serum creatinine (mg/dL) resulted in an estimated approximately 4-fold increase in the risk of graft failure. This risk is considerably higher than the risk calculated in our study, which could be attributed to differences in sample sizes between the two studies and the simultaneous examination of multiple longitudinal biomarkers in our research. According to Hariharan et al.'s study, serum creatinine levels increased one year after transplantation. Their studies showed a direct relationship between elevated creatinine levels and graft failure. Impaired kidneys and anti-rejection drugs cause elevated serum creatinine levels, which can lead to nephrotoxicity and kidney damage. Reduced urine output can be caused by poor kidney function or urinary tract obstruction. When kidney function is normal, the kidneys effectively clear waste products from the blood, leading to lower creatinine levels. However, when kidney function declines, waste products are not properly excreted, leading to an increase in blood creatinine and BUN levels. Anemia is a common complication of kidney failure, often caused by reduced erythropoietin production and disrupted iron homeostasis. In diagnosing anemia, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count are commonly measured. Hemoglobin is a complex hemoprotein found in red blood cells, while hematocrit represents the percentage volume of red blood cells in the blood, with its value depending on the number of red blood cells. Both hemoglobin and hematocrit are used in the diagnosis and management of hematologic disorders. In this regard, increasing trends in serum creatinine and BUN levels, along with decreasing hematocrit, may indicate declining kidney function and a higher risk of graft failure. Monitoring these biomarkers could support timely clinical evaluation and management.

### Acute renal failure… [^04c0622b]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Acute Renal Failure Defined The term acute renal failure can be used for any situation in which the patient's BUN and creatinine levels rise. However, I favor a more restrictive use of the term for situations in which the rise in BUN and creatinine levels are not reversible immediately by altering extrarenal factors. For example, when volume depletion occurs and the kidney is hypoperfused, there is increased tubular back-diffusion of urea into the circulation, with a resultant rise in BUN level. We use the term prerenal azotemia for this condition. The BUN concentration returns to normal within 24 hours if volume repletion is effected. The BUN level also will rise with bladder-outlet obstruction, since the accompanying slower flow of fluid through the renal tubules is also associated with back-diffusion of urea. This situation is termed postrenal azotemia, and a bladder catheter to relieve the obstruction. Schrier RW. Acute Renal Failure. JAMA.

### Ramipril [^3f1c7543]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.3 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings

Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen

Increases in creatinine levels occurred in 1.2% of patients receiving ramipril alone, and in 1.5% of patients receiving ramipril and a diuretic. Increases in blood urea nitrogen levels occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving ramipril alone and in 3% of patients receiving ramipril with a diuretic. None of these increases required discontinuation of treatment. Increases in these laboratory values are more likely to occur in patients with renal insufficiency or those pretreated with a diuretic and, based on experience with other ACE inhibitors, would be expected to be especially likely in patients with renal artery stenosis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. As ramipril decreases aldosterone secretion, elevation of serum potassium can occur. Use potassium supplements and potassium sparing diuretics with caution, and monitor the patient's serum potassium frequently [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)].

Hemoglobin and Hematocrit

Decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit (a low value and a decrease of 5 g/dL or 5%, respectively) were rare, occurring in 0.4% of patients receiving ramipril alone and in 1.5% of patients receiving ramipril plus a diuretic. No US patients discontinued treatment because of decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit.

Other (causal relationships unknown)

Clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with ramipril administration. Elevations of liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, uric acid, and blood glucose have been reported, as have cases of hyponatremia and scattered incidents of leucopenia, eosinophilia, and proteinuria. In US trials, less than 0.2% of patients discontinued treatment for laboratory abnormalities; all of these were cases of proteinuria or abnormal liver-function tests.

### Renal function status [^48533a6a]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article is to review and evaluate the various parameters used in determining renal status.

Conclusion

The physiologic determination of renal status is the measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR). Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and estimated GFR (eGFR), based on serum creatinine have failed to replace mGFR. All physicians should be aware of limitations of substituted mGFR.

Results

1. Proposal for uniform standards for definition and classification of AKI

Definition and diagnostic criteria of AKI

For any condition, the clinician needs to know whether the disease is present and, if so, where and when the patient falls in the natural history of the disease. The former facilitates recognition whereas the latter defines time points for intervention. Unfortunately, there has been no uniformly accepted definition of AKI. Studies describe ARF or AKI based on serum creatinine changes, absolute levels of serum creatinine, changes in blood urea nitrogen or urine output, or the need for dialysis. The wide variation in definitions has made it difficult to compare information across studies and populations.

Diagnostic criteria

Recognition of AKI requires the delineation of easily measured criteria that can be widely applied. Serum creatinine levels and changes in urine output are the most commonly applied measures of renal function; however, they are each influenced by factors other than the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and do not provide any information about the nature or site of kidney injury. The proposed diagnostic criteria (Table 1) were based on consideration of the following concepts:

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury

The above criteria include both an absolute and a percentage change in creatinine to accommodate variations related to age, gender, and body mass index and to reduce the need for a baseline creatinine but do require at least two creatinine values within 48 hours. The urine output criterion was included based on the predictive importance of this measure but with the awareness that urine outputs may not be measured routinely in non-intensive care unit settings. It is assumed that the diagnosis based on the urine output criterion alone will require exclusion of urinary tract obstructions that reduce urine output or of other easily reversible causes of reduced urine output. The above criteria should be used in the context of the clinical presentation and following adequate fluid resuscitation when applicable. Note: Many acute kidney diseases exist, and some (but not all) of them may result in acute kidney injury (AKI). Because diagnostic criteria are not documented, some cases of AKI may not be diagnosed. Furthermore, AKI may be superimposed on or lead to chronic kidney disease.

### Prediction of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with serum creatinine levels in the upper normal range by cystatin C: a prospective study in 374 patients [^0ff6652c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Preexisting renal impairment is a risk factor for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). In patients with creatinine in the upper normal level, cystatin C might be a more sensitive predictor of CIN than creatinine. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the usefulness of cystatin C to predict CIN.

Subjects and Methods

In 400 consecutive patients with creatinine baseline levels between 0.8 and 1.3 mg/dL undergoing coronary angiography (n = 200) or CT (n = 200), baseline values of cystatin C, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and risk factors of CIN were determined. Creatinine was also assessed 24 and 48 hours after contrast administration.

Results

Creatinine significantly (p < 0.001) increased after 24 hours and 48 hours compared with baseline (1.06 ± 0.28 and 1.07 ± 0.28 vs 0.99 ± 0.18 mg/dL). Fifty-three of 373 evaluable patients (14.2%) had an increase in creatinine of ≥ 25% or ≥ 0.5 mg/dL within 48 hours. CIN according to this definition was significantly more frequent after intraarterial contrast administration (38/190, 20%) compared with IV contrast administration (15/183, 8.2%; p = 0.001). CIN was predicted by baseline cystatin C (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC], 0.715; p < 0.001), whereas creatinine, creatinine clearance, and BUN were not predictive. The best predictive capabilities were provided by cystatin C/creatinine-ratio (AUC, 0.826; p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that intraarterial contrast administration (p = 0.002) and higher baseline cystatin C (p < 0.001) combined with low creatinine (p = 0.044) were independently associated with higher increases in creatinine within 48 hours after contrast administration.

Conclusion

CIN in patients with creatinine within the upper normal range is significantly more frequent after intraarterial than after IV contrast administration. In these patients, renal impairment after contrast administration is independently predicted by cystatin C and cystatin C/creatinine-ratio, whereas BUN and creatinine were not predictive.

The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Medium credibility.

Mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) candidacy — renal function: Class I recommendation specifies, "All patients evaluated for MCSD therapy should have their creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) measured. Patients with a creatinine > 3.0 mg/dl are at higher risk". It adds, "Patients with serum creatinine above this value may be considered MCSD candidates if renal failure is acute and renal recovery is likely (e.g., acute renal failure in young patients with previously normal renal function) (Level of Evidence: C)". Class III recommendation states, "Patients dependent on long-term dialysis should not be considered MCSD candidates (Level of Evidence: C)". Background notes, "Renal dysfunction is a strong determinant of unsuccessful MCSD support but in many cases it recovers after adequate circulatory support".

### Hypoalbuminemia and acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis of observational clinical studies [^f41cf154]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Albumin and AKI

Lower serum albumin was a significant independent predictor of AKI development. With each 10 g L −1 decrement in serum albumin the odds of AKI increased by 134% (pooled OR, 2.34; CI, 1.74–3.14). The odds of AKI development were more than doubled in association with lower albumin among the six studies of surgical or ICU patients and nearly tripled among studies in other hospital settings. Serum albumin was the first or second most powerful independent predictor of AKI in 7 of the 11 studies evaluating this end point (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Meta-analysis of adjusted odds ratio for acute kidney injury (AKI) per 10 g L −1 decrement in serum albumin. Data points scaled in proportion to meta-analytic weight. Error bars indicate 95% confidence interval (CI). ICU Intensive care unit

Significant heterogeneity was present (p < 0.001), confirming the appropriateness of the random effects model. Approximately two-thirds of the total variance was attributable to heterogeneity (I² 67.9%). There was no evidence of publication bias (p = 0.21). Heterogeneity persisted among studies on surgical and ICU patients (p = 0.001; I² 75.7%) but not on other indications (p = 0.32; I² 14.9%).

The increase in odds of AKI associated with lower serum album was greater among studies with prospective design and larger size (Table 3). Significant heterogeneity was absent in both the prospective (p = 0.56; I² 0%) and larger (p = 0.33; I² 13.3%) studies, but remained present in the retrospective (p < 0.001; I² 76.5%) and smaller (p = 0.002; I² 71.2%) studies. The differences between recent and older studies and between studies adopting AKI definitions based on fixed versus graded SCr increases were relatively minor (Table 3).

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^84a2f3da]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) has been used since the early 1940s to help clinicians differentiate between prerenal acute kidney injury (PR AKI) and intrinsic AKI (I AKI). This ratio is simple to use and often put forward as a reliable diagnostic tool even though little scientific evidence supports this. The aim of this study was to determine whether BCR is a reliable tool for distinguishing PR AKI from I AKI.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study over a 13 months period, in the Emergency Department (ED) of Nantes University Hospital. Eligible for inclusion were all adult patients consecutively admitted to the ED with a creatinine > 133 μmol/L (1.5 mg/dL).

Results

Sixty thousand one hundred sixty patients were consecutively admitted to the ED. 2756 patients had plasma creatinine levels in excess of 133 μmol/L, 1653 were excluded, leaving 1103 patients for definitive inclusion. Mean age was 75.7 ± 14.8 years old, 498 (45%) patients had PR AKI and 605 (55%) I AKI. BCR was 90.55 ± 39.32 and 91.29 ± 39.79 in PR AKI and I AKI groups respectively. There was no statistical difference between mean BCR of the PR AKI and I AKI groups, p = 0.758. The area under the ROC curve was 0.5 indicating that BCR had no capacity to discriminate between PR AKI and I AKI.

Conclusions

Our study is the largest to investigate the diagnostic performance of BCR. BCR is not a reliable parameter for distinguishing prerenal AKI from intrinsic AKI.

### Predictive values of blood urea nitrogen / creatinine ratio and other routine blood parameters on disease severity and survival of COVID-19 patients [^13712960]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

We aimed to examine independent predictive factors for the severity and survival of COVID-19 disease, from routine blood parameters, especially the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cr) ratio. A total of 139 patients with COVID-19 were investigated at Siirt State Hospital. According to the disease severity, the patients were categorized as three groups (moderate: 85, severe: 54, and critical: 20). Then, patients were divided into two groups: nonsevere (moderate) and severe (severe and critical). Demographic, clinical data, and routine blood parameters were analyzed. In multivariate model adjusted for potential confounders BUN/Cr ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20–2.40; P = 0.002) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 1.20–4.30; P < .001) were independent predictive factors for disease severity. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard model BUN/Cr ratio (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01–1.05; P = 0.030), and NLR (HR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06–1.30; P = 0.020) were independent predictors for survival of COVID-19 disease. The optimal thresholds of the BUN/Cr ratio at 33.5 and 51.7 had the superior possibility for severe disease and mortality, area under the curve (AUC) were 0.98 and 0.95, respectively. The optimal thresholds of NLR at 3.27 and 5.72 had a superior possibility for severe disease and mortality, AUC were 0.87 and 0.85, respectively. BUN/Cr and NLR are independent predictors for COVID-19 patient severity and survival. Routine evaluation of BUN/Cr and NLR can help identify high-risk cases with COVID-19.

### Diagnostic performance of a point-of-care saliva urea nitrogen dipstick to screen for kidney disease in low-resource settings where serum creatinine is unavailable [^c82d6dec]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

We have previously assessed the utility of SUN in the management of kidney disease in high-income settings, and in admissions to tertiary hospitals in sub-Sahara Africa. In this study, we tested its feasibility and performance in the management of patients at risk of kidney disease presenting to low-resource healthcare facilities where serum creatinine is largely unavailable. Hence, the cohort in which the strip was tested, and the settings where this was done, are highly representative of those where we envisage this strip to be of greatest utility, and is the major strength of this study. We did this in a large number of patients, across multiple centres, in community, rural and urban settings, across all seasons of the year. In addition to assessing the strip's performance, we also demonstrated that in almost 1500 tests, SUN as a continuous variable correlated with creatinine and eGFR, across multiple observation time points (ie, as renal function changed with treatment). This supports previous findings that SUN may not only be able to be used for diagnosis of kidney disease, but also to monitor response to treatment. Moreover, we demonstrated that in-hospital mortality increased according to presenting SUN, supporting previous work, which highlighted SUN can identify patients at increased risk, and be used to predict their outcome.

The high proportion of patients at increased risk of kidney disease undergoing successful SUN testing supports its feasibility, but we would have liked to collect reasons for inability to undertake the test. The study was undertaken in a pragmatic manner and resource and logistical restrictions meant BUN was not measured, and we were, therefore, not able to make a direct correlation between SUN and BUN. We included only patients at increased risk of kidney disease according to one risk score, and therefore, the strips performance in those not at increased risk, or those at increased risk according to alternative risk scores, in this study's settings is unknown. The cohort is this study was small with low muscle mass, and creatinine measurements may have overestimated true glomerular filtration rate. Similarly, BUN (and hence SUN) may have been disproportionately raised compared with creatinine due to the high proportion of patients presenting with acute infectious illness and dehydration. While we feel the cohort in this study is representative of populations presenting to community and district settings in other regions, to understand the strip's performance more comprehensively and make our results truly generalisable globally, an international multicentre study would have to be performed.

### Who's at risk? A prognostic model for severity prediction in pediatric acute pancreatitis [^efc5cbfd]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Several adult studies have linked elevated BUN levels to increased severity in AP, whether as part of the bedside index for severity of AP scoring or as a stand-alone predictor of severity (,–). The proposed mechanism is that the elevated BUN reflects intravascular volume depletion as opposed to renal involvement, given the lack of observed change in the creatinine between the 2 groups. There is also adult data to suggest that decreased albumin on admission is an independent predictor of disease severity in AP as a marker of persistent organ failure, both at admission and then again at 48 hours after admission, likely reflecting the underlying inflammatory state, although the precise mechanism remains unclear.

Persistent BUN elevation in our population was also predictive of severity, and BUN elevation at 24–48 hours was an independent predictor of severity in this population. This is a novel finding not previously reported in the pediatric literature. Although it showed similar trends from the adult literature, previous studies did not address the management effects on the BUN change. We have shown that persistent elevation of BUN was a predictor of SAP independent from rates and types of fluids the patient had received.

Multiple attempts have been made to develop prognostic models for severity in pediatric AP. DeBanto et al developed the Pediatric Acute Pancreatitis Score, which was modeled after adult scoring metrics and involves demographic and biochemical data at admission and then again at 48 hours to calculate the score. In 2013, it was reported that a significantly elevated lipase (≥ 7× upper limit of normal [ULN]) at time of admission was predictive of severity, but validation of the model had varying sensitivities and specificities. Thus, previous attempts to develop a predictive tool in the pediatric population either lacked a common definition of severity or required up to 48 hours from admission to calculate the predictive score, or had varying specificity and sensitivities when replicated in validation studies. To our knowledge, the first model to use the severity classification consensus published in 2017 and laboratory values on presentation is the BUN model in the derivation cohort and we have now replicated that model successfully.

### The acute decompensated heart failure national registry (ADHERE): opportunities to improve care of patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure [^c0dbb122]. Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) Algorithm" for heart failure.

The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) Algorithm is a clinical decision tool designed for patients presenting with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). This algorithm aids clinicians in risk stratification, guiding therapeutic decisions based on the severity of the patient's condition. It utilizes key parameters such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), systolic blood pressure, and creatinine levels to predict in-hospital mortality.

The ADHERE Algorithm is particularly useful in the emergency department setting, where rapid assessment and treatment initiation are critical. It assists in identifying patients at high risk of adverse outcomes, thereby facilitating prompt intervention and potentially improving patient prognosis.

However, it is important to note that the ADHERE Algorithm may not be applicable to patients with acute heart failure secondary to acute coronary syndromes, severe valvular disease, or congenital heart disease. Additionally, it may not be suitable for patients with end-stage renal disease or those on dialysis, as their BUN and creatinine levels may be significantly altered.

The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) Algorithm helps assess the risk level of heart failure patients by evaluating three specific health metrics. Here's how it works:

Inputs:

- **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level**: This input is "Yes" if the BUN is equal to or exceeds 43 mg/dL (15.35 mmol/L); otherwise, it's "No".
- **Systolic Blood Pressure (sBP)**: This input is "Yes" if the sBP is lower than 115 mmHg; otherwise, it's "No".
- **Creatinine level**: This input is "Yes" if Creatinine is equal to or exceeds 2.75 mg/dL (243.1 mmol/L); otherwise, it's "No".

Computation:

- The algorithm checks these inputs to categorize risk levels:

- **Low Risk**: If neither BUN nor sBP is "Yes", the patient falls into the low-risk category.
- **Intermediate Risk**: If either BUN or sBP is "Yes", but not both, it indicates an intermediate risk.
- **High Risk**: If all three inputs — BUN, sBP, and Creatinine — are "Yes", it denotes a high risk.

Interpretation:

- The classification into low, intermediate, or high risk aids healthcare providers in making informed clinical decisions, allowing them to tailor treatment plans to improve patient outcomes. This risk stratification helps in determining the necessary level of monitoring and intervention required for the patient.

### Impact of renal function and protein intake on blood urea nitrogen in preterm infants in the first 3 weeks of life [^8e76aec3]. Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the relationship between blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during the first 3 weeks of life and protein intake and creatinine (Cr) and to quantify the effect of protein intake on postnatal growth in preterm infants.

Study Design

This is a 4-year, single-center, retrospective cohort study. We used multivariable linear regression models to examine the relationships between mean weekly BUN and protein intake adjusted for mean weekly Cr and potential confounders. We used additional regression models to examine the effect of protein intake on growth during this period.

Result

Overall, 249 infants met study criteria. As protein intake increased over the first 3 weeks of life, both BUN and Cr decreased significantly. Linear regression models showed protein intake and Cr were each significantly associated with mean BUN for each study week.

Conclusion

Protein intake and Cr were each significantly associated with BUN. Significant amelioration of growth failure was seen with higher protein intake.

### Metabolic consequences of cystinuria [^91c97442]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Previous reports showed elevation of BUN in some Slc3a1 −/− mice strains but no elevation in serum creatinine in others. We therefore sought to evaluate for the development of CKD in this mouse strain with a mixed C57Bl/6 and 129/SvJ background. Interestingly, male mice fed only normal chow showed elevated BUN, whereas male mice fed breeder chow showed both elevated BUN and creatinine (Fig. 4). Mice evaluated were between 40 and 87 weeks old (Additional files 1 and 2). Histologic evaluation of the kidney tissue from Slc3a1 −/− mice with higher creatinine on normal chow (Fig. 5 b) demonstrated dilated tubules from obstruction and increased fibrosis when compared to those with normal creatinine (Fig. 5 a). The observed dilation of tubules and fibrosis was also observed in mice with elevated creatinine (Fig. 5 d) compared to normal creatinine when placed on the breeder chow (Fig. 5 c). Histologic evaluation of the bladders of male Slc3a1 −/− mice revealed increased inflammatory infiltrate within the bladder wall and cystine stones in the bladder in mice having a normal serum creatinine (Fig. 5 f) when compared to the bladders of wild type mice (Fig. 5 e). Some Slc3a1 −/− mice with an elevated serum creatinine showed embedded cystine crystals within the bladder wall in addition to bladder inflammatory infiltrate (Fig. 5 g). It is known that cystinuria results in stone formation leading to obstruction and CKD. However, we sought to determine if there might be other metabolic consequences of cystinuria beyond just stone formation. Glutathione, or γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine (GSH), serves as a detoxifier, protector from oxidative damage, and is arguably the most important low molecular weight antioxidant in cells. The availability of cysteine, formed by two molecules of cystine, is a major determinant of the regulation of GSH synthesis. Therefore, cystine deficiency could affect GSH levels. Martensson et al. previously reported decreased leukocyte GSH levels in homozygous cystinuric patients. We sought to evaluate GSH levels in male Slc3a1 −/− mice which exhibited lower plasma cystine levels. Therefore, we evaluated the levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in the livers of Slc3a1 −/− mice. We observed lower GSH and lower GSSG in the livers of Slc3a1 −/− mice compared to WT controls (Fig. 6). The total amount of glutathione (GSH + GSSG) was lower (Fig. 6), implying a possible connection between the lower availability of cysteine and total glutathione reserve. A reduction of the ratio of reduced to oxidized forms of glutathione was also observed (Fig. 6), suggesting that the ability of the liver to respond to oxidative stress is reduced in Slc3a1 −/− mice.

The association of ALT/AST ratio, BUN and BUN/Cr ratio with depression

Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that elevated ALT/AST ratios remained significantly associated with increased depression risk after full covariate adjustment (Model 3, Table 2), demonstrating a 106% risk elevation per unit increase (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.41–3.01, P < 0.001).

### The link between alcohol consumption and kidney injury [^c0a56dfa]. The American Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Alcohol consumption contributes to systemic organ dysfunction, but its direct effect on kidney health is unclear. Epidemiological studies show inconsistent findings due to reliance on conventional markers like serum creatinine (sCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which are insensitive to early chronic kidney disease (CKD) and influenced by factors such as muscle mass, diet, and hydration status. Experimental studies indicate that alcohol may directly exacerbate renal damage through mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Furthermore, indirect effects from alcohol-induced altered intestinal permeability and microbiome, liver injury, microcirculatory/cardiac dysfunction and muscle damage may also facilitate kidney damage. Notably, alcohol-related liver disease can lead to hepatorenal syndrome, a severe form of kidney dysfunction driven by circulatory disturbances and systemic inflammation. This overview explores the adverse effects of alcohol misuse on kidney health and disease, emphasizing the need for comprehensive epidemiological studies with more sensitive kidney injury biomarkers. It also highlights the importance of using clinically relevant preclinical models to clarify the underlying mechanisms of alcohol-related kidney injury and to enhance our understanding of its long-term clinical consequences.

### Diagnostic value of the urea-to-creatinine ratio for gastrointestinal bleeding source: influence of renal function [^fac1a82f]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common cause of hospital admissions, accounting for approximately 1–2% of cases and ranking among the top ten causes of urgent GI-related admissions in developed countries. Clinical presentation varies depending on the bleeding's severity and location: upper GI bleeding typically manifests as melena or hematemesis, while lower GI bleeding often presents with hematochezia. However, overlap in symptoms is frequent. Importantly, upper GI bleeding is often more severe and associated with hemodynamic instability. Still, lower GI bleeding can also be life-threatening, particularly in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. History-taking, physical examination, and assessment of vital signs, as well as laboratory testing form the cornerstone of the diagnostic workup of suspected GI bleeding. Severity and extent of bleeding depend on various factors, including coagulation status, blood count, renal function, and volume status, and determine the necessity for transfusion of blood and coagulation products. In fact, differentiation of upper and lower GI bleeding is clinically relevant since the outcome differs significantly. While endoscopy remains the gold standard for localizing bleeding, it is not always immediately available. As a potential aid, the urea-to-creatinine ratio (UCR) has been proposed, with higher values suggesting upper GI bleeding. This may result from an increased digestion of hemoglobin in the upper GI tract and/or accumulation of urea resulting from renal hypoperfusion. It remains unclear, however, whether UCR is also applicable in patients with impaired kidney function. We therefore aimed to assess the effect of AKI and/or CKD on the UCR and its impact on predicting the localization of GI bleeding. This may be particularly of interest in severe renal hypoperfusion due to GI bleeding, which can in turn lead to prerenal AKI. An increase in UCR might occur independently of the location of the GI bleeding, solely due to increased urea reabsorption in the kidney.

### Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene (triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide) [^663f925e]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Hypochloremia

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis. Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Renal Stones

Triamterene has been found in renal stones in association with the other usual calculus components. Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules should be used with caution in patients with a history of renal stones.

Serum Potassium

The normal adult range of serum potassium is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq per liter with 4.5 mEq often being used for a reference point. If hypokalemia should develop, corrective measures should be taken such as potassium supplementation or increased dietary intake of potassium-rich foods.

Institute such measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels. Potassium levels persistently above 6 mEq per liter require careful observation and treatment. Serum potassium levels do not necessarily indicate true body potassium concentration. A rise in plasma pH may cause a decrease in plasma potassium concentration and an increase in the intracellular potassium concentration. Discontinue corrective measures for hypokalemia immediately if laboratory determinations reveal an abnormal elevation of serum potassium. Discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules and substitute a thiazide diuretic alone until potassium levels return to normal.

Serum Creatinine and BUN

Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may produce an elevated blood urea nitrogen level, creatinine level or both. This apparently is secondary to a reversible reduction of glomerular filtration rate or a depletion of intravascular fluid volume (prerenal azotemia) rather than renal toxicity; levels usually return to normal when triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules are discontinued. If azotemia increases, discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules. Periodic BUN or serum creatinine determinations should be made, especially in elderly patients and in patients with suspected or confirmed renal insufficiency.

Serum PBI

Thiazide may decrease serum PBI levels without sign of thyroid disturbance.

### Diagnostic value of urinary sodium, chloride, urea, and flow [^4fca00f1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of hospitalized critically ill patients may have a rise in serum creatinine concentration. In addition to history and physical examination, there is diagnostic value in assessing urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in these patients. The correct interpretation of these urinary parameters can avoid unnecessary volume overload and mechanical ventilation, risk factors for increased mortality in patients with rising serum creatinine. The present article also discusses the role of arterial underfilling in causing prerenal azotemia in the presence of an increase in total body sodium and extracellular fluid expansion. As with extracellular fluid volume depletion, arterial underfilling secondary to impaired cardiac function or primary arterial vasodilation can delay or prevent recovery from ischemic or toxic acute tubular necrosis. The present brief review discusses the various aspects of the correct interpretation of urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in the setting of a rising serum creatinine concentration.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^236be4e8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities

In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen

Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide due to a minor increase in serum creatinine.

Liver Function Tests

Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes.

### Stroke outcome related to initial volume status and diuretic use [^58a64a6e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

To untangle these phenomena, we used this commonly collected biomarker. Given that most stroke trials routinely collected BUN or urea and creatinine, we used BUN/creatinine ratio as a proxy for volume status and found that BUN/creatinine ratio > 20, as has been used previously, defines about half of the subjects as VCS. This finding suggests that either VCS is extremely common, or the definition is too imprecise, likely including other causes of elevated BUN/creatinine ratio such as gastrointestinal bleeding or steroid use. This is a significant limitation to interpreting these results and underscores the issue with not having a gold standard, objective definition for a VCS. Other studies have defined aVCS as BUN/creatinine ratio > 15, given that this ratio is frequently thought to indicate azotemia and dehydration. Had we used this definition in this study, 78% of subjects would have been defined as VCS. We also evaluated a more stringent ratio of 30, present in about 8% of patients, with largely similar results.

Despite these limitations, this is an important study to assist in understanding the complex relationship between hydration status and clinical outcome after stroke. For the majority of patients with stroke, avoiding metabolic complications in the early stroke period is the primary approach to improving patient outcomes. This cohort of patients takes an important next step in exploring possible mechanisms and begins developing clinical protocols to modify relevant variables. It is the first analysis of a cohort of international patients with prospective and hyperacute data. It is a large sample size, with a standardized and monitored data collection methodology. Investigators were blinded to the hypothesis of this study, and therefore hydration practices were likely consistent with real‐world practices, which are useful to clinicians who are treating similar patients around the world. Although these results cannot directly support a change in clinical practice related to rehydration after stroke, it provides critical foundational information to better understanding these associations.

### Rapid weight loss can increase the risk of acute kidney injury in wrestlers [^7328bce6]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The kidney is an organ that can tolerate exposure to various factors, whereby a predisposing factor such as dehydration may represent an additional risk for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). Although dehydration was thought not to be associated with long-term adverse effects on kidney function, this opinion has been disproved. The possible factor causing acute kidney failure is dehydration, and even mild dehydration can be a risk factor in the progression of kidney disease. Since athletes in combat sports reduce their body mass up to 10 times yearly, frequent dehydration can affect kidney function. There is no evidence that sport practising can lead to chronic kidney problems. However, early detection of AKI in athletes who regularly use RWL methods is of utmost importance for preventing more severe kidney disease. Dehydration and soft drink intake during and following exercise may lead to acute kidney dysfunction. Also, repeated episodes of acute kidney failure may lead to chronic kidney disease. Several classification systems have been developed to streamline research and clinical practice concerning AKI. Changes in serum creatinine (CRE) levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid (URCA) and Cystatin-C (CysC) levels are indicators of kidney function. However, CRE and BUN are influenced by many renal and nonrenal factors independent of kidney function. Unlike CRE and BUN, CysC levels are much less influenced by factors such as gender, age and muscle mass. CysC is a suitable marker for assessing kidney functions during and after exercise. Elevating URCA levels are also associated with strenuous exercise.

Athletes are usually healthy by definition, but the combination of RWL and high training workload may modify their homeostasis, inducing pathological biochemical kidney marker values. This study examined the impact of high-intensity specific training combined with RWL and without RWL on body composition and biochemical markers of kidney function.

### The importance of low blood urea nitrogen levels in pregnant patients undergoing hemodialysis to optimize birth weight and gestational age [^b491fa24]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Most published reports indicate that intensified hemodialysis results in better pregnancy outcomes. Here we studied clinical characteristics and the outcomes of 28 pregnant women receiving hemodialysis. We found an association between maternal blood data and birth weight, and gestational age and outcomes. There were 18 surviving infants who were followed up for one year. In the others there were 4 spontaneous abortions, 1 stillbirth, 3 neonatal deaths and 2 deaths after birth. Analysis of blood chemistry for 20 pregnancies from 12 weeks of gestation until delivery showed that the average hemoglobin level was significantly higher in the group that successfully delivered than in the unsuccessful group. There were significant negative relationships between the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level and the birth weight or gestational age in the latter cohort. A birth weight equal to or greater than 1500 g or a gestational age equal to or exceeding 32 weeks corresponded to BUN levels of 48–49 mg/dl or less. Whether the low BUN is the direct cause of the improved outcome remains to be examined.

### Relation between renal function and response to cardiac resynchronization therapy in multicenter automatic defibrillator implantation trial – cardiac resynchronization therapy (MADIT-CRT) [^2db4e126]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiorenal interactions have been shown to affect outcome in heart failure patients but were not related to response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to test our hypothesis that assessment of markers of prerenal failure may help identify mildly symptomatic HF patients with diminished effective circulating blood volume who will benefit from CRT.

Methods

The benefit of CRT with a defibrillator (CRT-D) as compared with defibrillator-only therapy in reducing the risk of HF or death was assessed by renal function parameters (including serum creatinine [SCr], blood urea nitrogen [BUN], and the ratio of BUN to SCr [BUN:SCr], dichotomized at median values and into approximate quartiles) among 1,803 patients enrolled in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy.

Results

Multivariate analysis showed that the benefit of CRT-D was inversely related to SCr levels and directly related to BUN levels. Combined assessment of the two renal function parameters showed a significant difference in the benefit of CRT-D between patients with low (≤ 18 mg/dL, HR = 0.85, P = 0.28) and elevated (> 18 mg/dL, HR = 0.46, P < .001) BUN:SCr (P-value for interaction = .005). Consistently, the benefit of CRT-D was significantly increased with increasing quartiles of BUN:SCr (Q(1): HR = 1.06 [P = 0.79], Q(2): HR = 0.64 [P = 0.04], Q(3): HR = 0.47 [P < .001], Q(4): HR = 0.44 [P < .001]; P-value for trend = .005).

Conclusions

In MADIT-CRT, patients with an elevated ratio of BUN to SCr experienced a significantly greater reduction in the risk of HF or death with CRT-D therapy as compared with patients with a low ratio. These findings suggest an association between prerenal function and response to CRT.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^8d0632f6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis predictive laboratory thresholds and fluid management — Elevated HCT (≥ 44), BUN (≥ 20 mg/dL), and creatinine (≥ 2 mg/dL) have been reported to have a significant predictive value for determining moderately severe and severe disease. In another study, a BUN ≤ 22 mg/dL, or falling BUN called for reducing the intravenous fluids to 1.5 mL/kg per hour from 3 mL/kg per hour and if no such reduction is observed, to re-bolus, and the presence of organ failure, SIRS, or Bedside Index for Severity Scoring System score of 3 or more suggested to the treating physicians to consider intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Several investigators have found a rise in HCT and/or rising BUN at 24 hours to be a reliable test in predicting mortality and persistent multiorgan failure in patients with AP, a rising BUN within the first 24 hours has been shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with AP, and C-reactive protein is not practical because it takes 48–72 hours to become accurate in predicting necrosis and/or death.

### The management of children with gastroenteritis and dehydration in the emergency department [^f18d0061]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute gastroenteritis is characterized by diarrhea, which may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain.

Objective

To review the evidence on the assessment of dehydration, methods of rehydration, and the utility of antiemetics in the child presenting with acute gastroenteritis.

Discussion

The evidence suggests that the three most useful predictors of 5% or more dehydration are abnormal capillary refill, abnormal skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern. Studies are conflicting on whether blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or BUN/creatinine ratio correlates with dehydration, but several studies found that low serum bicarbonate combined with certain clinical parameters predicts dehydration. In most studies, oral or nasogastric rehydration with an oral rehydration solution was equally efficacious as intravenous (i.v.) rehydration. Many experts discourage the routine use of antiemetics in young children. However, children receiving ondensetron are less likely to vomit, have greater oral intake, and are less likely to be treated by intravenous rehydration. Mean length of Emergency Department (ED) stay is also less, and very few serious side effects have been reported.

Conclusions

In the ED, dehydration is evaluated by synthesizing the historical and physical examination, and obtaining laboratory data points in select patients. No single laboratory value has been found to be accurate in predicting the degree of dehydration and this is not routinely recommended. The evidence suggests that the majority of children with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated successfully with oral rehydration therapy. Ondansetron (orally or intravenously) may be effective in decreasing the rate of vomiting, improving the success rate of oral hydration, preventing the need for i.v. hydration, and preventing the need for hospital admission in those receiving i.v. hydration.

### Biomarkers of renal injury and function: diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications in heart failure [^c1fdd2d2]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure guidelines suggest evaluating renal function as a routine work-up in every patient with heart failure. Specifically, it is advised to calculate glomerular filtration rate and determine blood urea nitrogen. The reason for this is that renal impairment and worsening renal function (WRF) are common in heart failure, and strongly associate with poor outcome. Renal function, however, consists of more than glomerular filtration alone, and includes tubulointerstitial damage and albuminuria. For each of these renal entities, different biomarkers exist that have been investigated in heart failure. Hypothetically, and in parallel to data in nephrology, these markers may aid in the diagnosis of renal dysfunction, or for risk stratification, or could help in therapeutic decision-making. However, as reviewed in the present manuscript, while these markers may carry prognostic information (although not always additive to established markers of renal function), their role in predicting WRF is limited at best. More importantly, none of these markers have been evaluated as a therapeutic target nor have their serial values been used to guide therapy. The evidence is most compelling for the oldest-serum creatinine (in combination with glomerular filtration rate)-but even for this biomarker, evidence to guide therapy to improve outcome is circumstantial at best. Although many new renal biomarkers have emerged at the horizon, they have only limited usefulness in clinical practice until thoroughly and prospectively studied. For now, routine measurement of (novel) renal biomarkers can help to determine cardiovascular risk, but there is no role for these biomarkers to change therapy to improve clinical outcome in heart failure.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^fb485483]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Practice Point 1.1.1.2 — repeat testing after incidental abnormal findings: Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria, or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests to confirm presence of CKD. There is known biological and analytical variability in serum creatinine (SCr) and in urine albumin or urine protein not related to their properties as markers of kidney disease. In people without risk factors for CKD, there is a low pretest probability for CKD and any unexpected results should be verified before diagnosing a person as having CKD. In people with risk factors for CKD, there is a higher probability that the person does have CKD even with an unexpected finding, and subsequent testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to complete the evaluation, as is required. Timing of the repeat sample should be determined based on clinical setting including risk factors for CKD as well as concern for AKI/AKD.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^010c4d4d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Baseline evaluation for chronic hypertension in pregnancy — initial testing before or at presentation is used to detect possible end-organ involvement, and if testing was not done before pregnancy, it should be performed at entry to prenatal care. Recommended baseline tests include serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes (specifically potassium), blood urea nitrogen, complete blood count, spot urine protein/creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine for total protein and creatinine (to calculate creatinine clearance) as appropriate, and electrocardiogram or echocardiogram as appropriate; uric acid is no longer a recommended routine baseline test. Because the kidneys are usually the first end-organ to be affected, baseline renal function assessment commonly includes serum creatinine, a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and, if needed, a 24-hour urinary collection for total protein and creatinine clearance; for patients with borderline or abnormal urine protein-to-creatinine ratios or serum creatinine values, a 24-hour urine collection is recommended. A spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of less than 0.15 safely indicates a level of proteinuria less than 300 mg for a 24-hour sample and, in the absence of an abnormality in serum creatinine, likely does not warrant further evaluation with a 24-hour urine collection, unless there is a need to assess creatinine clearance. Evidence includes a systematic review reporting protein-to-creatinine ratio cutoffs of 0.13–0.15 with sensitivities ranging from 90% to 99% to rule out significant proteinuria of 300 mg or more, and a meta-analysis with sensitivities of 86% (95% CI, 86–93%) for a cutoff of 0.13 and 88% (95% CI, 85–92%) for a cutoff of 0.15 to detect 300 mg or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample. Assessment of creatinine clearance may be helpful in some cases; with mild renal impairment (serum creatinine between 0.9 mg/dL and 1.4 mg/dL), there is normal intravascular volume expansion and an incremental increase in creatinine clearance.

### Investigating associated factors with glomerular filtration rate: structural equation modeling [^c3742241]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis showed that there is a U-shape relationship between eGFR and death rate; eGFR < 60 ml/min/173 m² increases death rate incrementally, but eGFR > 105 ml/min/173 m² results in a sharp decrease in death rate.

In the RaNCD cohort study, low value of eGFR in females was due to inadequate physical activity and high prevalence of metabolic risk factors such as obesity, high blood lipids, and hypertension. eGFR was also related to BUN which had a negative direct and indirect relationship with GFR in both males and females. The value for BUN is, in fact, a sign of proper kidney functioning. The main causes of increased BUN are high-protein diets, low GFR, and congestive heart failure. An increase in BUN may be independent of changes in creatinine and GFR. Such increase is due to reabsorption from proximal tube through the activity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone sympathetic nervous systems. There is a non-linear relationship between increasing BUN and decreasing GFR. Significant GFR decrease (> 75%) is associated with an increase in BUN in the early stage of a renal disease. On the other hand, a relatively minor decrease in GFR is associated with a relatively high increase in urea concentrations and serum creatinine. In our study, BUN had a negative and indirect effect via high blood pressure, as an intermediate variable on GFR. Findings of previous studies suggested that high blood pressure is significantly associated with increased kidney damage in females and males. A meta-analysis study in 2014 showed a significant relationship between high blood pressure and incidence of ESRD. In the current research, hypertension was directly related to decrease in GFR. Meat consumption in women has a direct and indirect effect on GFR, which is consistent with similar studies.

Relationship between BUN/CR and clinical outcomes of female patients with CABG

Cox regression models (Table 2) were used to assess the independent effects of BUN/Cr on mortality. BUN/Cr was categorized into five groups, with the Q4 group serving as the reference. After adjusting for confounders, In Model 5 of the fully adjusted Cox regression analysis, a significant association between the BUN/Cr and mortality was observed across various time points. The continuous variable for BUN/Cr demonstrated a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91–0.98, p = 0.002) for one-year mortality, indicating that each unit increase in BUN/Cr is associated with a 5% decrease in mortality risk. Participants in the lowest BUN/Cr category (Q1, ≤ 15) exhibited a markedly higher risk of mortality (HR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.36–5.27, p = 0.004) compared to the reference group (Q4). This trend persisted over two to five years, with continuous BUN/Cr values consistently showing protective effects against mortality (HRs ranging from 0.95 to 0.97) and Q1 maintaining a significant association with increased mortality risk (HRs between 2.17 and 2.61).

### Plasma ALKAL2 levels are associated with coronary atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^f24d5f18]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the study population

A total of 550 subjects were enrolled in this study. Despite comparable distributions of age and gender between groups, individuals in the T2DM-CAD group exhibited a higher prevalence of smoking, hypertension, and dyslipidemia compared with those in the non-CAD group. Furthermore, serum hsCRP levels were modestly elevated in the T2DM-CAD cohort, suggesting the presence of a chronic inflammatory state. Notably, levels of Lp(a), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (SCr) were significantly higher in the CAD group, reflecting dyslipidemia and impaired renal function. In addition, patients with CAD had markedly elevated levels of HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (FBG), indicating suboptimal glycemic control (Table 1).

### Association between the blood urea nitrogen-albumin ratio and mortality in critically ill patients with gastrointestinal bleeding: a retrospective cohort study [^2bc75b3b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The BAR has recently been recognized as a valuable prognostic marker across various clinical conditions. Among ICU patients with acute pancreatitis, retrospective evidence indicated that a BAR value greater than 16.92 was strongly linked to higher rates of all-cause mortality (ACM). The AUC for BAR on day 14 was 73.23%, notably higher than that of BUN (69.73%) or albumin alone (64.29%). In 137 patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), Asano et al. found a positive correlation between BAR and 28-day in-hospital mortality, with an AUC of 0.83. Similarly, Cao et al. identified BAR as an independent predictor of mortality in sepsis (HR = 1.032 95% CI: 1.010–1.055). Collectively, these findings across infectious, pancreatitis, and pneumonia highlight BAR as a robust and broadly applicable biochemical marker. Its integrative nature and consistent predictive performance continue to attract increasing clinical attention.

In patients with GIB, an elevated BAR arises from multiple pathophysiological mechanisms. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to increased intestinal absorption of protein degradation products, such as amino acids. Within the liver, these amino acids undergo transamination, generating ammonia that is further metabolized into urea, contributing to elevated BUN levels. Additionally, upper GIB frequently induces hemorrhagic hypovolemia, predisposing patients to prerenal azotemia. Elevated BUN levels have been strongly associated with mortality in GIB. Under hypovolemic conditions, diminished renal perfusion triggers neurohormonal activation — including sympathetic nervous system stimulation and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system upregulation — enhancing proximal tubular urea reabsorption and further increasing BUN levels. Consequently, in hemodynamically unstable patients, BUN not only reflects renal perfusion but also serves as a proxy for neuroendocrine activation.

A decreased serum albumin level is a well-recognized marker of physiological stress, malnutrition, or chronic inflammation. In acute hemorrhage, sympathetic nervous system activation and the release of inflammatory mediators markedly increase capillary permeability, facilitating albumin extravasation and a consequent rapid decline in circulating albumin levels. Furthermore, systemic inflammation — driven by cytokines such as interleukin-6 — suppresses hepatic albumin synthesis.

Integrated approach to AKI, AKD, and CKD — Clinical evaluation is necessary for all patients with alterations in kidney function or structure, the diagnostic approach will usually begin with assessment of GFR and serum creatinine (SCr), and evaluation is not complete unless markers of kidney damage — including urinalysis, urinary sediment examination, and imaging — have been performed; Table 14 summarizes the measures and, based on their interpretation, the clinical diagnosis indicated by an "X" can be reached.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) serum markers — in chronic RHF (CRHF), the transaminases may be normal or minimally elevated, whereas in acute RHF (ARHF) they are commonly high. In advanced CRHF, liver synthetic function may be impaired with reduced albumin and elevated international normalized ratio. Increased bilirubin can reflect passive congestion or cholestasis or suggest fibrosis and cirrhosis, and more severe cases with venous congestion and systemic hypoperfusion can lead to renal insufficiency with elevation in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^9de7abd9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding — assessing an upper gastrointestinal source and nasogastric tube utility is informed by the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN-to-Cr) ratio and stool findings: a BUN-to-Cr ratio of > 30 had a likelihood ratio (LR) of 7.5 (95% CI 2.8–12.0) for UGIB, while blood clots in stool decreased the likelihood (LR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01–0.38). In another diagnostic accuracy study, the BUN-to-Cr ratio had AUROC 0.63, although a BUN-to-Cr cutoff of 35 had a specificity 90.1% and positive predictive value 89.1% for UGIB vs LGIB, and a BUN threshold of 21 mg/dL predicted UGIB vs LGIB with a specificity of 93.0%. Nasogastric aspirate performance was poor with sensitivity only 28% and negative predictive value < 35%, and a systematic review reported negative LR < 0.6 for both tests in patients without hematemesis; routine placement of a nasogastric tube cannot be recommended, but may need to be used on a case-by-case basis, and in severe hematochezia clinicians ultimately should determine pretest probability and perform an urgent EGD if the risk is considered high.

### A low BUN / creatinine ratio predicts histologically confirmed acute interstitial nephritis [^745ecfe8]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In hospitalized patients with acute renal injury (AKI), acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (AIN) constitutes one of the leading etiologies. The objective of this study was to identify clinical and biochemical variables in patients with AKI associated with kidney biopsy-confirmed AIN.

Methods

For our prospective study, we recruited hospitalized patients aged 18 years and older who were diagnosed with AKI based on biochemical criteria. Prior to enrollment, each patient was assessed with a complete metabolic panel and a kidney biopsy.

Results

The study consisted of 42 patients (with a mean age of 45 years) and equal numbers of male and female patients. Diabetes and hypertension were the main comorbidities. Nineteen patients had histological findings consistent with AIN. There was a correlation between histology and the BUN/creatinine ratio (BCR) (r = -0.57, p = 0.001). The optimal Youden point for classifying AIN via a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was a BCR ≤ 12 (AUC = 0.73, p = 0.024). Additionally, in diagnosing AIN, BCR had a sensitivity of 76%, a specificity of 81%, a positive predictive value of 81%, a negative predictive value of 76%, and OR of 14 (95% CI = 2.6 to 75.7, p = 0.021). In the multivariable analysis, BCR was the sole variable associated with AIN.

Conclusion

A BCR ≤ 12 identifies AIN in patients with AKI. This study is the first to prospectively assess the relationship between renal biopsy results and BCR.
