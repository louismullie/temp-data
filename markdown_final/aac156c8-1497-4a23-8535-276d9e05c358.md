## Question

how to recognize reactive leukocytosis in blood smear?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recognizing reactive leukocytosis on peripheral blood smear. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the leukocytosis and anchoring the clinical context. Then, I should verify the smear quality and scanning strategy. Next, I will examine myeloid line features for toxic changes and left shift, followed by lymphoid line features for pleomorphism versus monomorphism. After that, I need to check for blasts and dysplasia, integrate red cell and platelet morphology, and correlate with ancillary tests. Finally, I will synthesize a diagnostic conclusion and outline pitfalls and follow-up steps, ensuring I continuously self-verify each inference against accepted standards and the provided sources.

> Let me first confirm the leukocytosis and its magnitude, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with an elevated WBC and not a spurious count from platelet clumping or instrument artifact; I should double-check the automated differential and, if discordant, proceed to a manual differential on the smear, as recommended by CAP/ASH for acute leukemia workups and by consensus statements emphasizing smear review to validate automated results [^1171Q2vL] [^113BURL8]. Hold on, I should verify pseudothrombocytopenia and other spurious causes of leukocytosis by scanning the feathered edge for platelet clumps, since clumps can be misclassified as leukocytes and inflate the WBC; if suspected, I should repeat the count in citrate or obtain a smear from a fingerstick to confirm [^116kgUiu]. I also need to check for age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges and consider that leukocytosis can double within hours in stress states, so I should correlate with timing and clinical events before concluding chronicity or clonality [^114QKP5w].

> Next, I should review the smear quality and scanning strategy; wait, let me verify that I am using a systematic approach across the monolayer at multiple magnifications, because consensus recommendations stress structured review and the ability to toggle magnifications to detect subtle toxic or dysplastic changes, and this reduces missed pathology and improves interobserver reliability [^114oVbFu] [^113bksJN]. I need to ensure I am not overcalling artifacts from automated smear preparation; traumatic changes can mimic cytoplasmic vacuolation or nuclear distortion, so I should correlate with the distribution of abnormal cells and with the tail and edges of the smear to distinguish artifact from true pathology [^114DXZ4Q].

> I will now examine myeloid features for evidence of a reactive granulocytosis; toxic granulation, Döhle bodies, and cytoplasmic vacuolation in neutrophils strongly support a reactive process, particularly infection or cytokine-driven stress, and I should confirm these changes are present in multiple cells rather than isolated events [^116uGvRE] [^111Kg9s6]. Let me think about the degree of left shift; a modest left shift with bands and metamyelocytes is expected in reactive states, but I should be cautious if there are excessive myelocytes or promyelocytes, which raise concern for myeloid neoplasia, and I should explicitly enumerate blasts because any circulating blasts should prompt hematology referral and further workup rather than attributing them to reaction [^1171Q2vL] [^111xbocB]. Hold on, I should verify that the absence of blasts supports a reactive process, but I must remember that growth factor–induced leukemoid reactions can transiently show up to about 39% circulating "blasts", so I need to correlate with medication history and consider flow cytometry to distinguish hematogones or blasts from true leukemic blasts before concluding malignancy [^111Kg9s6].

> Now, I will assess lymphoid features; pleomorphism with variation in size, shape, and cytoplasmic basophilia favors a reactive lymphocytosis, whereas a monomorphic population of uniformly small or intermediate-sized cells with similar chromatin and scant cytoplasm suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder and should trigger flow cytometry, even if the absolute lymphocyte count is only modestly elevated [^111xbocB] [^117ViRXT]. Wait, let me verify the threshold to trigger morphology review; while some studies suggest an ALC around 7×10⁹/L as an optimal cutoff, age-adjusted thresholds as low as 4.0–4.4×10⁹/L in older adults improve sensitivity for detecting clonal B-cell populations, so I should integrate age and ALC when deciding on flow cytometry [^117ViRXT] [^113afG6h]. I should also look for large granular lymphocytes; if present, I need to distinguish reactive LGL expansion from T-LGLL using flow cytometry and T-cell clonality studies, because morphology alone cannot reliably separate these entities [^111yJwn9] [^116RMpvw].

> I need to check for blasts and dysplasia across all lineages; any circulating blasts, even in small numbers, are incompatible with a purely reactive leukocytosis and mandate urgent hematology evaluation and appropriate molecular testing, so I should confirm the blast percentage and morphology carefully before proceeding [^111xbocB]. But wait, what if I see pseudo–Pelger-Huët neutrophils or hypogranulation; these dysplastic features, especially if persistent, point toward myelodysplasia rather than a transient reaction, and I should correlate with cytopenias and consider bone marrow evaluation if dysplasia is suspected [^114EUrzm]. I should double-check that I am not overcalling dysplasia in the setting of severe infection or cytokine therapy, where reactive changes can mimic dysplasia; clinical context and serial smears help avoid misclassification [^111zsUHd].

> Next, I should review red cell and platelet morphology for additional clues; schistocytes would redirect me to TMA rather than a simple reactive leukocytosis, and I should confirm their presence on a well-prepared smear because automated fragmented RBC counts are supportive but not definitive [^113G8pHq]. Let me consider macrocytosis with anisopoikilocytosis, which can suggest B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, or MDS; if present, I should verify nutritional status and medication history before concluding a myeloid neoplasm [^114EUrzm]. I should also check for Howell-Jolly bodies or target forms that might indicate functional asplenia, which can alter leukocyte kinetics and contribute to leukocytosis, prompting me to review the spleen status and consider vaccination history [^111i5Q8z].

> I will now correlate with ancillary tests; a high leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score supports a reactive neutrophilia, whereas a low score suggests CML, so I should order LAP when CML is in the differential and follow with BCR-ABL1 testing if indicated [^116uGvRE]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing a paraneoplastic leukemoid reaction; if extreme neutrophilia persists without infection, I should evaluate for occult malignancy and consider cytokine levels or tumor immunohistochemistry for G-CSF/GM-CSF when a cytokine-secreting tumor is suspected [^111Kg9s6]. If lymphocytosis is present, I should confirm clonality with flow cytometry, and if blasts are identified, I should proceed with acute leukemia workup including cytogenetics and molecular testing rather than delaying for additional smears [^111xbocB].

> Let me synthesize the diagnosis; reactive leukocytosis is most likely when there is a clear clinical trigger, toxic neutrophil changes, a modest left shift without blasts, and a pleomorphic lymphocyte population, especially if the leukocytosis trends toward resolution as the underlying process improves [^116uGvRE] [^111xbocB]. I should confirm that the absence of blasts, dysplasia, and monomorphic lymphocytes, together with supportive ancillary tests such as a high LAP, collectively decrease the probability of malignancy and support a reactive etiology, while acknowledging that rare mimics can occur and require vigilance [^116uGvRE] [^117ViRXT]. If the smear shows blasts, dysplasia, or a monomorphic lymphoid population, I should not jump to conclusions; instead, I should escalate to hematology, flow cytometry, and molecular testing to exclude leukemia or lymphoma before labeling the process as reactive [^1171Q2vL] [^111xbocB].

> Finally, I should double-check common pitfalls; growth factors can cause extreme leukocytosis and even circulating "blasts", so I must ask about recent G-CSF/GM-CSF and interpret the smear in that context to avoid overdiagnosis of leukemia [^111Kg9s6]. I need to ensure I do not misread viral reactive lymphocytes as lymphoblasts; their pleomorphism and activated cytoplasm contrast with the uniform, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio blasts of ALL, but if uncertain, I should confirm with flow cytometry rather than risk misclassification [^111xbocB]. I should also remember that some reactive states, including COVID-19, can show striking neutrophil activation and left shift with acquired pseudo–Pelger-Huët forms, so I must integrate the full clinical picture and, if the leukocytosis persists beyond the expected course, revisit the differential and consider bone marrow evaluation [^112HHxRy] [^111Wbtu2]. In short, I need to ensure that my morphologic interpretation is reproducible, context-aware, and complemented by appropriate ancillary testing to confidently distinguish reactive leukocytosis from neoplastic disease [^114oVbFu] [^113bksJN].

Reactive leukocytosis on smear is identified by **neutrophilia with toxic changes** (toxic granulation, Döhle bodies, cytoplasmic vacuolation) [^116uGvRE] and a **left shift** (bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes) without blasts or dysplasia [^111xbocB]. Lymphocytosis shows **pleomorphic reactive lymphocytes** (large, basophilic cytoplasm, scalloped borders) [^114hcmEG] without a monomorphic clone [^111xbocB]. Eosinophilia and monocytosis are common in allergic, parasitic, or chronic inflammatory states [^114QKP5w]. No circulating blasts, dysplasia, or monomorphic lymphocytes support a reactive process; if present, evaluate for malignancy [^111xbocB].

## Morphological features of reactive leukocytosis

### Neutrophilic leukocytosis

- **Toxic granulation**: Coarse, dark-blue granules in neutrophils, indicating activation by infection or inflammation [^116uGvRE].
- **Döhle bodies**: Small, pale-blue cytoplasmic inclusions, reflecting RNA accumulation during stress [^notfound].
- **Cytoplasmic vacuolation**: Vacuoles in neutrophils, often from bacterial toxins or cytokines [^notfound].
- **Left shift**: Increased bands and earlier myeloid precursors (metamyelocytes, myelocytes) without blasts [^116uGvRE].
- **Pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly**: Hyposegmented neutrophils from drugs or cytokines; transient and reversible [^notfound].

---

### Lymphocytic leukocytosis

- **Pleomorphic lymphocytes**: Variably sized cells with abundant basophilic cytoplasm and scalloped borders ("ballerina skirt") [^114hcmEG].
- **Immunoblasts**: Large lymphocytes with prominent nucleoli, seen in viral infections (e.g. EBV, CMV, COVID-19) [^115Vzmnc].
- **Plasmacytoid lymphocytes**: Eccentric nuclei with perinuclear hof, reflecting B-cell activation [^1164JWcH].

---

### Eosinophilic leukocytosis

Eosinophilia shows **increased eosinophils** with normal morphology, typically reflecting allergic, parasitic, or chronic inflammatory states [^111oZzBy].

---

### Monocytic leukocytosis

Monocytosis shows **increased monocytes** with normal morphology, often in chronic infections, autoimmune disease, or malignancy [^notfound].

---

## Differentiation from neoplastic leukocytosis

| **Feature** | **Reactive leukocytosis** | **Neoplastic leukocytosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Blasts | Absent | Present (≥ 1%) [^notfound] |
| Dysplasia | Absent | Present (e.g. Pelger-Huet, hypogranulation) [^114EUrzm] |
| Lymphocyte morphology | Pleomorphic | Monomorphic [^111xbocB] |
| Eosinophil morphology | Normal | Atypical (e.g. hypogranulation, vacuolation) [^111VXptT] |
| Clinical context | Infection, inflammation, stress | Hematologic malignancy |

---

## Clinical correlates and ancillary tests

- **Infection**: Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections often cause neutrophilia with toxic changes or lymphocytosis with reactive lymphocytes [^114QKP5w] [^115r3i6Z].
- **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, IBD) can cause neutrophilia or monocytosis [^notfound].
- **Stress**: Exercise, surgery, trauma, or emotional stress can acutely elevate WBC counts [^114QKP5w].
- **Medications**: Corticosteroids, lithium, and growth factors can cause leukocytosis [^116bSyJr] [^111Kg9s6].
- **Paraneoplastic syndromes**: Cytokine-secreting tumors (e.g. lung, renal cell) can cause leukemoid reactions [^111Kg9s6].

---

## Ancillary tests

- **Flow cytometry**: Differentiates reactive from clonal lymphocytosis [^111xbocB].
- **Molecular testing**: BCR-ABL1, JAK2, CSF3R, and others help exclude myeloid neoplasms [^notfound].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Indicated if blasts, dysplasia, or persistent unexplained leukocytosis [^111xbocB].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Reactive leukocytosis reflects an **appropriate marrow response** to infection, inflammation, or stress; management targets the underlying cause, with resolution as the trigger abates [^116uGvRE]. Persistent or unexplained leukocytosis, especially with blasts or dysplasia, warrants hematology referral and further workup [^114QKP5w].

---

Reactive leukocytosis shows **neutrophilia with toxic changes** or **lymphocytosis with pleomorphic reactive cells**, without blasts or dysplasia. Recognizing these features — along with clinical context and ancillary tests — allows accurate distinction from neoplastic leukocytosis and guides appropriate management.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^111xbocB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^114QKP5w]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

### Reactive versus neoplastic bone marrow: problems and pitfalls [^111zsUHd]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Examination of the bone marrow poses several unique challenges to the pathologist: it is a semisolid organ without helpful gross correlation, it exists in a dynamic state with the peripheral blood and other organs of the lymphohemopoietic system, and the diagnosis of diseases affecting bone marrow often depends heavily on ancillary special studies. The bone marrow examination ideally encompasses review of the bone marrow biopsy histology (with or without additional nondecalcified clot preparation material), bone marrow aspirate smear cytology, and the peripheral blood smear; optimal procurement and processing of these samples is critical in ensuring that a maximal level of diagnostic information can be extracted. The pathologist must be aware of the clinical context of the bone marrow and the results of ancillary tests, whether these are ordered by the pathologist or the clinician. A combination of excellent diagnostic samples, appropriate ancillary tests, and knowledge of the clinical context provides the best background to distinguish between the common reactive and neoplastic processes that involve the bone marrow and to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in making these distinctions.

### Predictive significance of absolute lymphocyte count and morphology in adults with a new onset peripheral blood lymphocytosis [^117ViRXT]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Lymphocytosis is commonly encountered in the haematology laboratory. Evaluation of blood films is an important screening tool for differentiating between reactive and malignant processes. The optimal lymphocyte number to trigger morphological evaluation of the smear has not been well defined in the literature. Likewise, the significance of lymphocyte morphology has not been well studied and there are no consensus guidelines or follow-up recommendations available. We attempt to evaluate the significance of lymphocyte morphology and to define the best possible cut-off value of absolute lymphocyte count for morphology review.

Methods

71 adult patients with newly detected lymphocytosis of 5.0×10⁹/L or more were categorised to either a reactive process or a lymphoproliferative disorder. We performed statistical analysis and morphology review to compare the difference in age, gender, lymphocyte count and morphological features between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine an optimal lymphocyte number to trigger morphology review.

Results

Lymphoproliferative disorders are associated with advanced age and higher lymphocyte count. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of lymphocyte morphology as a screening test were 0.9, 0.59, 0.60, 0.58 and 0.71, respectively. The optimal cut-off of lymphocyte number for morphology review was found to be close to 7×10⁹/L.

Conclusions

We found a moderate interobserver agreement for the morphological assessment. 'Reactive' morphology was very predictive of a reactive process, but 'malignant' morphology was a poor predictor of a lymphoproliferative disorder.

### An unusual case of reactive lymphocytosis mimicking acute leukemia [^1179NR9N]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute leukemia is based on a combination of clinical, hematological, morphological, cytogenetic, and immunophenotypic data. The authors report a case of reactive lymphocytosis with extremely elevated lymphocytic and lymphoblastic leukocytosis that mimicked acute lymphoblastic leukemia, not only morphologically, but also in immunophenotypic analysis. They could not determine any underlying disease marker other than infectious symptoms that were present for 20 days prior to presentation to their clinic. Although this case presented with extremely high lymphocytic leukocytosis, the patient had normal blood cell lineage, a moderate level of blastic cells in bone marrow, and normal physical findings. These findings convinced the authors to follow up the patient before beginning treatment.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^114oVbFu]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Manual review of the PBS via light microscopy or digital whole slide imaging is strongly preferred over single high-power field images. Independent use of the compound light microscope is a mandatory skill that should be attained by graduation. Expertise in the identification of normal morphology aids in the recognition of more subtle pathology on PBS. Trainees should be wellversed in the identification of both normal and pathologic cytoplasmic and nuclear characteristics. The identification of staining and preparation artifact is necessary to allow for proper clinical reasoning. Curricula should emphasize the utility of PBS in the context of contemporary testing as it can augment or eliminate the need for other diagnostic testing, minimize medical waste, and reduce time to diagnosis. Adept fellows will contextualize PBS morphology within the greater clinical context of the patient's clinical history, laboratory, and pathologic data; and harbor an understanding of how positive and negative PBS findings affect Bayesian reasoning. Trainees should have a thorough and reproducible methodologic approach to PBS evaluation, although all educators need not be expected to teach a uniform approach across all ACGME training institutions. Specific emphasis should be placed on distinction of malignant and benign etiologies of leukocytosis and lymphocytosis. Finally, trainees should identify morphology suggestive of hemolytic anemias and suspect specific diagnoses based on PBS review with otherwise limited clinical information. In the institutions, participants practice with high resource availability and low exposure to tropical diseases. It was felt that the outsized global impact of malaria (247 million cases, and 619 000 deaths in 2021) warranted specific attention.

Broad consensus existed on the specific morphologies and diagnoses within the fellow's purview. This is an important development that can guide PBS curricular design (Tables 3 and 4). The high interrater agreement on included morphology and diagnoses indicates that hematologists likely have a shared mental model of what constitutes fellow competency, despite the lack of current formally accepted theory.

Qualitative data from the focus group sessions offer potential insights into the importance that participants place in various aspects of fellow competency. The high proportion of time spent on the specific diagnoses of acute leukemia and TMA possibly indicates a bias among attending hematologists to place heightened emphasis on the recognition of these conditions. The domains of PBS review do not appear to be weighted equally in the minds of hematologists, with an excess of attention focused on conditions that predispose patients to a high risk of short-term morbidity and mortality. Similarly, the relatively minimal discussion on the identification of abnormal platelet morphology and primary disorders of platelets potentially indicates a relative perceived lack of importance.

### Leukemoid reaction: a 21st-century cohort study [^116uGvRE]. International Journal of Laboratory Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on leukemoid reaction:

- **Definition**: A leukemoid reaction is a reactive and non-malignant leukocytosis characterized by a markedly elevated WBC count, typically exceeding 50,000/mcL, which can resemble leukemia in peripheral smear findings. It is a physiologic response to a severe stressor or inflammatory stimulus and resolves with treatment of the underlying cause.
- **Pathophysiology**: The leukemoid response is driven by cytokine-mediated bone marrow stimulation, most notably by G-CSF and IL-6, leading to accelerated myelopoiesis and the premature release of mature and immature myeloid cells into the circulation. This reactive, non-clonal proliferation is typically accompanied by an elevated leukocyte ALP score and a peripheral smear showing a left shift, toxic granulation, and Döhle bodies, without circulating blasts or BCR-ABL1 rearrangement. This exaggerated marrow response may result from a range of underlying conditions. The most common causes are severe infections such as C. difficile infection, disseminated tuberculosis, and severe shigellosis, in which the leukemoid reaction may indicate disease severity or precede complications such as hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Malignancies, including lung and renal cell carcinomas, can induce leukemoid responses through the secretion of hematopoietic growth factors, with extreme leukocytosis often reflecting a paraneoplastic process. Additional neoplastic associations include melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and sarcomas, where the leukemoid response may resolve with tumor-directed therapy but is frequently associated with a poor prognosis. Non-infectious stimuli such as extensive tissue necrosis from trauma, severe burns, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage, as well as acute hemorrhage or hemolysis, can also activate this response. Certain medications, including corticosteroids, minocycline, and recombinant hematopoietic growth factors, are recognized pharmacologic triggers. Toxic exposures such as ethylene glycol ingestion have also been implicated. Less common causes include mesenteric inflammatory pseudotumor and alcoholic steatohepatitis.
- **Epidemiology**: Leukemoid reactions are relatively rare, reported to account for approximately 0.59% of hospital admissions. They are more frequently encountered in critically ill patients.
- **Disease course**: Patients with a leukemoid reaction usually present with signs and symptoms related to the inciting condition rather than the leukocytosis itself. The leukocyte count may rise rapidly but generally stabilizes or declines once the underlying process is controlled. In cases of infection or inflammation, this may occur within several days to a week. If the leukocytosis persists despite resolution of the suspected trigger, further investigation is warranted to exclude hematologic malignancy. The overall prognosis depends on the underlying cause rather than the leukemoid response. The diagnostic evaluation of a leukemoid reaction focuses on distinguishing it from clonal hematologic malignancies, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic neutrophilic leukemia, while identifying the underlying reactive trigger. Initial assessment should include a thorough clinical history, physical examination, and focused laboratory and imaging studies to identify infections, malignancies, drug exposures, or toxic insults. A CBC with differential, peripheral blood smear, and leukocyte ALP (LAP) score are key first-line investigations. Leukemoid reaction typically presents with leukocytosis exceeding 50,000/mcL, marked neutrophilia with a left shift, toxic granulation, and high LAP scores. A peripheral smear helps exclude chronic myeloid leukemia, which often shows basophilia and a broader spectrum of immature cells. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may reveal myeloid hyperplasia with orderly maturation, distinguishing leukemoid reaction from acute leukemia or advanced myeloproliferative neoplasms. Cytogenetic analysis, including BCR-ABL1 testing via PCR or FISH, is essential to rule out chronic myeloid leukemia. In ambiguous cases, clonality studies such as the HUMARA assay may be used to demonstrate polyclonal myelopoiesis consistent with LR. Additional tests may include cultures (blood, sputum, stool) to evaluate for infectious causes, especially C. difficile or Shigella species. Imaging (such as chest and abdominal CT) is warranted when malignancy is suspected. If a solid tumor is identified, biopsy with immunohistochemical staining for granulocyte- or GM-CSF may confirm a cytokine-secreting source. While measurement of circulating hematopoietic growth factors is not routine, elevated levels may support a paraneoplastic etiology.

### Systematic evaluation of hematologic parameters and blood smear findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 vs other viral respiratory infections [^115r3i6Z]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated and compared the peripheral blood findings in patients with acute COVID-19 vs other viral respiratory infections.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed peripheral blood counts and smear morphology in patients with a positive viral respiratory panel (VRP) or SARS-CoV-2 test.

Results

A total of 97 peripheral blood samples (COVID-19 infection, 53; VRP positive, 44) from 50 patients (mean [SD] age, 45.8 [20.8] years; females 52%) were reviewed. There were no statistically significant differences in the demographic characteristics between the 2 groups. The most common peripheral blood abnormalities were anemia, thrombocytopenia, absolute lymphopenia, and reactive lymphocytes. The following peripheral blood findings were significantly associated with other viral respiratory infections compared with COVID-19 infection: low red blood cell count, low hematocrit, high mean corpuscular volume, thrombocytopenia, low mean platelet volume, high red cell distribution width, band neutrophilia, and toxic granulation in neutrophils.

Conclusions

Our study showed that there are several peripheral blood count and morphologic abnormalities seen in patients with COVID-19, but most of these findings lack specificity as they are also seen in the other viral respiratory infections.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^1133Ar1S]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points

- Fellows should have a methodology for PBS review and be competent in identifying morphology suggestive of both common and morbid diagnoses.
- Curricular emphasis should be placed on the competency of identifying morphologic features of acute leukemias and hemolytic anemias.

### Rapid presumptive diagnosis of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome by peripheral blood smear review [^115Vzmnc]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is a rare but frequently lethal acute zoonotic viral infection in rural North America. The rapidity of progression from febrile prodrome to cardiogenic shock and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema requiring intensive care creates high diagnostic urgency and a need for a rapid screening tool. In this retrospective cohort study, 2 pathologists scored blinded peripheral blood smears from 52 patients with HCPS and 128 seronegative patients referred for diagnosis of suspected hantavirus infection. During the prodromal phase, thrombocytopenia was the only consistent abnormality and could be used to indicate hantavirus serologic testing. After the onset of pulmonary edema detected radiographically, the presence of 4 of 5 findings (thrombocytopenia, myelocytosis, hemoconcentration, lack of significant toxic granulation in neutrophils, and more than 10% of lymphocytes with immunoblastic morphologic features) has a sensitivity for HCPS of 96% and a specificity of 99% and missed no patients with HCPS who required intensive care. While each abnormality is commonly seen, the combination of at least 4 of these CBC count data and peripheral blood smear findings can guide early treatment and patient transport decisions until rapid, specific, serologic testing becomes widely available.

Pathological features and differential diagnoses: the role of the pathologist in making the diagnosis

The morphological features of PLR can be identical to features seen in LRs due to other causes, such as infection. They can also be very similar to findings seen in patients being treated with exogenous haematopoietic growth factors (EHGFs), which are commonly used to shorten the period of neutropaenia after myeloablative chemotherapy. Besides causing LR, EHGFs can also lead to a transient increase in peripheral blood blasts count (up to 39% in one study). This can mimic acute leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blast. The use of EHGFs is the most common cause of extreme leukocytosis in patients with non-haematolymphoid malignancies, according to a study done on 758 patients. In this study, the aetiology of extreme leukocytosis was due to EHGFs in 69% of patients, followed by infection (15%), and lastly PLR (10%). Therefore, before entertaining a diagnosis of PLR, the use of EHGFs must be first excluded.

PLR can present in a similar way to MPNs. Therefore, it is not uncommon for the pathologist to encounter a peripheral blood smear or a bone marrow biopsy from one of these patients. The main differential diagnoses for a LR are as follows: chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) and chronic neutrophilic leukaemia (CNL).CNL is much rarer than CML or CMML. Distinguishing the LR from a MPN is the most essential step in reaching the correct diagnosis. The role of the pathologist goes beyond reporting the absence of a haematological malignancy. In addition, he or she must alert the treating physician by pointing out to the possibility of an occult CST.

Peripheral blood findings

Most PLRs are neutrophilic predominant, although eosinophilic PLRs or mixed neutrophilic–eosinophilic PLRs have been also reported. Blood smears from patients with PLR (figures 1 and 2) show neutrophilia with marked left shift due to increased late granulocytic precursors (band forms, metamyelocytes and myelocytes). Characteristic features of reactive granulocytosis include toxic granulation, prominent Döhle bodies and cytoplasmic vacuolation.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### Leukemia: an overview for primary care [^1113Q9nd]. American Family Physician (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, AAFP 2014 guidelines recommend to suspect common causes such as infection, inflammation, and stress response when evaluating a patient with leukocytosis. Obtain peripheral blood smear in patients with a WBC count > 20, 000/mcL and with associated anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes, or constitutional symptoms.

### Establishing absolute lymphocyte count thresholds for further review of peripheral blood lymphocytosis to judiciously screen for monoclonal B-cell populations in older adults [^113afG6h]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Lymphocytosis may represent either a lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) or a reactive process. The absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) threshold for further evaluation of lymphocytosis is not well established.

Methods

We prospectively performed flow cytometry on blood samples from patients 50 years or older with ALCs of 4.0 × 10⁹ cells/L or greater without a history of an LPD.

Results

Monoclonal B-cell populations were found in 34 (19.1%) of 178 cases, with incidence increasing with age. In patients younger than 75 years, no monoclonal B-cell population was identified in patients with ALCs less than 4.4 × 10⁹ cells/L, while such clones were found below and above this threshold in patients 75 years and older.

Conclusions

These findings support a threshold for smear review and flow cytometry no lower than 4.4 × 10⁹ cells/L in patients younger than 75 years and a threshold as low as 4.0 × 10⁹ cells/L in patients 75 years and older.

### Photo quiz: unexpected pathogens in the Gram staining of a blood culture smear [^116RtaHf]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

PHOTO QUIZ

A 57-year-old woman with known arterial hypertension consulted her general practitioner because of malaise and fever of undetermined character and duration. She was empirically treated with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. One week later, she was admitted to the hospital and transferred to the intensive care unit due to impaired consciousness, shock (lactate 7.9 mmol/L), fever, leukocytosis (leukocytes 23.22 /nL), elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein 231.9 mg/L, procalcitonin 150.4 µg/L), anemia (hemoglobin 86 g/L), thrombocytopenia (platelets 128 /nL), acute renal dysfunction (serum creatinine 41.6 mg/L), and acute liver failure. The patient was intubated, and mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement were started. Due to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis, also aiming for normothermic temperature management, no statements can be made about the course of the fever while being treated in the intensive care unit. Computed tomography of the head did not show any pathological findings. Blood cultures were sampled as part of standard microbiology diagnostics. After 3 h and 13 min of incubation, the aerobic blood culture bottle signaled growth (BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F blood culture bottle; BACTEC FX blood culture system, Becton Dickinson GmbH, Germany), and the Gram stain of a blood culture smear revealed numerous circular pathogens (Fig. 1A). Despite prompt treatment and maximal intensive care, multi-organ failure progressed, and the patient died within 1 day.

### Hematological abnormalities in COVID-19: a narrative review [^111Wbtu2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

WHITE BLOOD CELL ABNORMALITIES IN COVID-19

Twenty to 40% of COVID-19 patients have leucopenia, and 3–24% have leukocytosis (Table 1). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count ≤ 1,100 cells/μL) was seen in 30–75% of COVID-19 patients (Table 1). A meta-analysis performed by Huan and Pranata found a strong association between lymphopenia and severe COVID-19.CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes are predominantly reduced in the COVID-19 patients requiring ICU care. There was increased expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 in surviving T cells, suggesting functional exhaustion. Neutrophilia has been reported in severe COVID-19 patients (Table 1). An elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was identified as a marker for in-hospital mortality and severe COVID-19 disease. Reactive lymphocytes have been described in many viral infections including COVID-19. Reactive lymphocyte and antibody secreting lymphocytes identified based on automated hematology analyzer scattergrams were shown to rise toward the second week of infection. Although not many studies have commented on changes in eosinophil counts in COVID-19, Zhang et al.found 52.9% COVID-19 patients to have reduced eosinophils count.

Zini et al.found morphological changes in neutrophils (such as abnormal shape of the nucleus and cytoplasmic granulation) and platelets (hyperchromatic forms). Apoptotic and immature granulocytes were observed in the peripheral blood smear and may be due to the perturbation of normal granulopoiesis. The cytokine storm and hyperinflammation were proposed as possible causal factors for these changes. Immature granulocytes (small myelocytes and metamyelocytes) were also observed. Following antiviral treatment, the neutrophil morphology reverted to normal, and lymphocytes showed morphological heterogeneity suggesting activation. Further studies would clarify the clinical relevance of the observed changes.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^112edrh8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

We present an automated protocol for the detection and characterization of thousands of blood cells in PBS linked with machine-learning methods that can use these cellular descriptions to distinguish between clinical conditions and identify novel associations between cytomorphological phenotypes and clinical diagnoses. Importantly, we show that our approach generalizes to other centers and scanners.

Haemorasis, our open-source method to extract and characterize large numbers of WBC and RBC from digitized PBS, demonstrates how this can be automated with no recourse to proprietary software. We make it publicly available as a Docker container, enabling its straightforward application. Using Haemorasis, we detect and characterize over half a million WBC and millions of RBC. With morphometric moments (the mean and variance of morphometric features for each PBS) we show the diagnostic importance of cytomorphological heterogeneity for various conditions. This observation bears similarity to previous reports that associated RDW with increased AML transformation risk. It is also worth considering that quantifying morphological variation, especially of subtle features, is likely to be challenging to achieve by visual assessment, as it requires the absolute quantification and evaluation of large numbers of cells.

### Elimination of instrument-driven reflex manual differential leukocyte counts. optimization of manual blood smear review criteria in a high-volume automated hematology laboratory [^113BURL8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Automated peripheral blood leukocyte differential counts (LDCs) are widely accepted in routine practice. However, many laboratories still reflexively perform manual LDCs based solely on abnormal automated results or instrument "flags", before any manual triage step. We describe our transition to a procedure that uses manual methods to validate, rather than to replace, automated LDCs (an approach recommended early in the development of automated methods, but still not used in many clinical laboratories). Manual microscopic scans were performed in lieu of manual LDCs. Each scan that revealed cell types not quantifiable by the instrument triggered a manual LDC. However, if the manual scan simply confirmed the cell types seen on automated LDC, then the automated result was released, even if clinically significant quantitative abnormalities were present. This policy reduced manual LDCs by more than 70% and was validated by a manual retrospective audit. Patient care and laboratory operations can be optimized by using manual microscopic examination as a validation procedure rather than as a reflexive substitute for automated methods. There is no clinical rationale for reflex performance of manual LDCs based solely on instrument warnings.

### Pitfalls in obtaining and interpreting bone marrow aspirates: to err is human [^113N1twt]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Pitfalls relating to bone marrow aspirates and their interpretation start even before the aspirate is obtained. There can be failure to perform an aspiration that is clinically indicated or, conversely, an aspiration may be done that is not actually necessary. Once an aspirate is obtained it may be unhelpful because it is a blood tap or very dilute, or because of the sampling error that is intrinsic to the procedure. Even if an adequate aspirate is obtained, it may be misinterpreted. Megaloblastic marrows and children's marrows with increased haematogones or marked reactive changes are particularly prone to misinterpretation. A constant awareness of potential pitfalls and an assessment of the aspirate in the appropriate clinical context will help to reduce errors.

### Comparison of hematologic abnormalities between hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 positive and negative patients with correlation to disease severity and outcome [^112HHxRy]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Peripheral blood smear (PBS) changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are diverse and have been reported in the literature in the form of case series with relatively smaller sample sizes and with a handful of studies showing the association between PBS and clinical severity. This study aims to highlight the numerical and morphological changes in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients and to compare the same in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings as well as with disease severity and outcome. The study included 80 COVID-19 positive (41 ICU and 39 non-ICU) patients and 32 COVID-19 negative ICU patients. Complete blood counts (CBCs) and PBS findings were studied and scored by two pathologists blindfolded. Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and absolute eosinophil count (AEC) were significantly lower in COVID-19 positive cases as compared to the COVID-19 negative group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001). COVID-19 positive group showed significant left myeloid shift (p = 0.021), Dohle bodies (p = 0.025) with significant prominence of acquired pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly, ring-shaped neutrophils, monolobate neutrophils, and plasmacytoid lymphocytes as compared to control group (p = 0.000, p = 0.009, p = 0.046, and p = 0.011, respectively). The overall mean white blood cell (WBC) counts were higher in COVID-19 positive ICU patients as compared to non-ICU COVID patients with significant shift to left, presence of ring-shaped neutrophils, monocyte vacuolation, and large granular lymphocytes (p = 0.017, p = 0.007, p = 0.008, and p = 0.004, respectively). Deceased group showed significantly higher WBC count (p = 0.018) with marked neutrophilia (p = 0.024) and toxic granulation (p = 0.01) with prominence of monocyte vacuolization, ring-shaped neutrophils, large granular lymphocytes, and reactive lymphocytes. Parameters like myeloid left shift, ring-shaped neutrophils, monocyte vacuolation, and large granular lymphocytes emerged as highly sensitive markers of disease severity. Therefore, serial CBC with comprehensive PBS analysis should be done in every newly diagnosed hospitalized COVID-19 patient which potentially predicts the course of the disease.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^1149qiXj]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of hematological malignancies relies on expert cytomorphological examination of blood, bone marrow and/or other tissue biopsies, together with molecular analyses that aid subclassification and prognosis. For example, anemias, characterized by reduced hemoglobin concentration (Hb) and altered red blood cell (RBC) numbers, can be both a disease and a feature of other conditions such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms that can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) –. For this reason, the diagnosis and further subtyping of MDS requires the detection of cytopenias, changes to white blood cell (WBC) and RBC maturation blood cell through cytomorphologic analysis of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood slides (PBS), cyto- and histochemistry, karyotyping and immunophenotyping –.

### Evaluating pathologist practices in peripheral blood smear review: a comprehensive practice survey [^112tuZbc]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Widely accepted standardized criteria for peripheral blood (PB) smear review do not exist. The aim of this study was to collect data regarding PB smear review practices across multiple institutions, with a focus on pathologist review.

Methods

A 23-question survey was developed by members of the Society for Hematopathology (SH) Education Committee and distributed to SH members. The survey included questions on practice environment and PB smear review practices, including trainee involvement.

Results

Of 725 members contacted, 137 (19%) completed the entire survey. Over half of practices examined 5 to 20 smears a day. All respondents reported using complete blood count/differential leukocyte count data and clinical history as part of smear review. The reported proportion of laboratory-initiated vs clinician-requested reviews varied across respondents. Clinician-requested smear reviews were more likely to be billed and issued as a separate pathology report. Glass slide review (as opposed to digital microscopy) was used by most respondents. All respondents affirmed that PB smear review is an essential component of pathology training programs. Numerous free-text comments were submitted by respondents regarding their own experiences with PB smear review and suggested improvements.

Conclusions

This survey elucidated the spectrum of practice patterns for pathologist review of blood smears and identified potential areas for process improvement.

### Automatic wedge smears preparation may cause traumatic morphological changes in peripheral blood cells [^114DXZ4Q]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

In recent years, several automated analysers that prepare and stain blood smears have been introduced in clinical laboratories. Despite the use of instrumental settings based on physical characteristic of individual samples, traumatic injuries of neutrophil and lymphocytes can be observed. Some samples present a very high percentage of damaged cells, allowing the speculation that a cellular susceptibility may enhance mechanical traumatism. These artefacts can puzzle morphological evaluation in both traditional and digitised microscopy; in addition, unskilled operators can be misled.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^116kgUiu]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 3.
Platelet agglutinates in a peripheral blood smear in EDTA. Blood was taken from a patient with fever and cough. Her platelet count was 38×10⁹/L in EDTA and 176×10⁹/L in CPT. An activated lymphocyte is visible. The final diagnosis was upper airway infection. EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; CPT: citrate, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, tris. Reproduced, with permission, from Nagler M, et al.

Diagnosis of pseudothrombocytopenia

PTCP must be suspected in subjects with severely decreased platelet counts and no bleeding diathesis. In cases of mildly or moderately decreased platelet counts, which are not usually associated with an overt bleeding diathesis even in patients with true thrombocytopenia, the presence of platelet clumps in blood samples could be suspected based on specific warning flags and histogram patterns provided by electronic counters. However, the accuracy of currently available counters at detecting platelet clumps has been shown to be inadequate,20, lacking acceptable sensitivity and specificity. For example, small platelet clumps may be mistaken for leukocytes by the counter, resulting in the lack of platelet flags and in spurious leukocytosis, Although strategies are being implemented to increase their sensitivity, the absence of platelet flags will likely never allow the certain exclusion of PTCP in a sample with a low platelet count. For these reasons, the diagnosis of PTCP must rely solely on the microscopic examination of blood smears of EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples (possibly the same one on which blood cell counts had been performed), which allows the visual detection of platelet clumps (Figure 3). After all, therefore, the diagnosis of PTCP does not require any specific diagnostic procedure in addition to those recommended for thrombocytopenia and any other kind of abnormalities in the complete blood cell count, which all require the visual inspection of blood smears as the first step in the diagnostic work-up. According to the consensus of the Groupe Francophone d'Hématologie Cellulaire, a clump of platelets is defined as a cluster of at least five attached platelets, which are usually easily detected at the margins and the tail of the blood smear. Visual inspection of blood smears carrying platelet clumps in the primary care laboratories that first identify a subject displaying a low platelet count will decrease the undue referral of patients to specialized centers for the diagnostic work-up of thrombocytopenia.

### Lymphoid aggregates in bone marrow: a diagnostic pitfall [^116K8hfX]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Lymphoid aggregates in bone marrow specimens are a relatively frequent finding that may pose a diagnostic challenge for a pathologist. The distinction between reactive and neoplastic aggregates has significant clinical relevance. Although many testing modalities such as immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and molecular studies are currently available in clinical laboratories, the appropriate utilisation of these modalities and the awareness of their potential pitfalls are important. When a neoplastic process is ruled out, the significance of benign lymphoid aggregates in bone marrow is often unclear, as they may be associated with a broad spectrum of conditions including infections, autoimmune disorders, medications, or may even be idiopathic. This review focuses on evidence-based criteria that can aid in making the distinction between benign and malignant lymphoid aggregates and discusses the advantages, disadvantages and limits of ancillary tests used for this purpose. Finally, the most common aetiologies of benign lymphoid aggregates and their associations with specific diseases are discussed.

Eosinophilia — definitions and bone marrow biopsy indications — Eosinophilia is defined as an elevation of the eosinophil count in peripheral blood, usually above 0.5 × 10⁹ eosinophils/L, whereas HE is defined as eosinophil count above 1.5 × 10⁹ eosinophils/L, and tissue eosinophilia is defined as > 20% eosinophils in the bone marrow. Bone marrow biopsy is indicated in evaluation of eosinophilia when there are persistent eosinophilia without obvious reactive etiology, changes in the complete blood count other than eosinophilia, peripheral blood smear that shows atypical eosinophils or dysplasia in other lineages, organomegaly, an elevated tryptase, or an elevated serum vitamin B12, and other reasons based on clinical suspicion may prompt the need. In addition, bone marrow biopsy should be performed in patients with HE in which reactive etiologies have been excluded or if complete blood count/lab data raise suspicion for the likelihood for neoplastic processes.

### Peripheral blood smear demonstration of lymphocyte changes in severe COVID-19 [^114hcmEG]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

A 60-year-old man with type two diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease came to the emergency department complaining of a 4-day history of unrelenting fever and cough. He was hemodynamically stable with a normal respiratory examination. Chest radiograph showed ground-glass opacities in the lower zones, and COVID-19 RNA PCR nasopharyngeal swab was positive. His full blood count showed a leukocyte count of 2.4 × 10⁹/L, hemoglobin of 16.2 g/L, platelet of 152 × 10⁹/L, and a low absolute lymphocyte of 0.8 × 10⁹/L. In addition, ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at 850 ng/mL and 258 mg/L, respectively. Blood smears showed lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes with a round eccentric nucleus, deeply basophilic cytoplasm, and a perinuclear clear area (perinuclear hof) denoting the Golgi apparatus (Figure 1B). Reactive lymphocytes (Figure 1C) with abundant cytoplasm scalloping around the neighboring cells imparting a ballerina skirt appearance were encountered. Plasma cells with intracellular inclusions of immunoglobulins (Russell bodies), known as Mott cells, were seen in the blood film. Two days later, his condition deteriorated with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Repeat chest radiograph showed diffuse pulmonary infiltrations in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

During the incubation period of COVID-19, adaptive immunity plays a crucial role in eliminating the virus. In immunocompromised patients, because of medical comorbidities, an effective antiviral immunity cannot be mounted, leading to a hyperinflammatory state that culminates into ARDS. This case illustrates the morphological evolution of lymphocyte activation seen in a patient with COVID-19. During viral infection, B-lymphocytes are activated to become lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes and immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells which have a distinctive morphology. – There is emerging evidence that, in addition to elevated inflammatory markers and lymphopenia, elevated lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes, which correlate with antibody secreting and CD38 + antigen secreting B-lymphocytes, may predict clinical severity in COVID-19.

T-Cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) — diagnosis — requires the presence of an expanded clonal population of T- or NK-cell large granular lymphocytes, and the diagnosis of T-LGLL should be based on clinicopathologic findings. Morphologic examinations of peripheral blood smear, flow cytometry with adequate immunophenotyping, and assessment of T-cell clonality are essential to confirm T-LGLL, and small, clinically non-significant clones can occur in bone marrow failure disorders; therefore, it is essential to rule out reactive large granular lymphocytosis in patients with autoimmune or bone marrow failure disorders. TRBC1 expression by flow cytometry has been reported as a highly sensitive method for assessing T-cell clonality with good correlation with molecular methods.

### Incidental neutropenia: an emergency medicine focused approach [^111NDrP5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 cells/microL and may be discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic, afebrile patient.

Objective

This narrative review provides an approach to the afebrile emergency department patient with incidental neutropenia.

Discussion

Neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL, with mild neutropenia defined as an ANC ≥ 1000 to < 1500 cells/microL, moderate ≥ 500 to < 1000 cells/microL, severe < 500 cells/microL, and agranulocytosis < 200 cells/microL. Incidental or isolated neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL discovered on laboratory testing unrelated to the patient's chief complaint (e.g., chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, etc.) and not associated with fever or infectious signs and symptoms. There are a variety of etiologies, with inherited forms, dose-dependent drug-induced neutropenia, and infections the most common causes. Testing includes complete blood count with differential and peripheral smear. Management is based on the patient's hemodynamic status, presence of fever, severity of neutropenia, and the peripheral smear. Patients who are critically ill, febrile, have severe neutropenia, or have a concerning peripheral smear (schistocytes, atypical lymphocytes) should undergo hematology consultation. Those with critical illness or fever with neutropenia should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients who are afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and non-toxic appearing with mild or moderate neutropenia can likely be discharged for repeat testing in one to two weeks.

Conclusion

Understanding the approach to incidental neutropenia can improve patient care. Critically ill or febrile patients should be admitted, but select patients may be discharged.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^113bksJN]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus recommendation generation

Previously coded data were used to develop 4 domains of recommendations, ie, curricular considerations, method of PBS review, morphologic considerations, and specific disorders. Disorders were further subcategorized into disorders of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Response rates per round of revision were 87.5%, 87.5%, and 100%.

Strong and unanimous consensus was reached on multiple aspects of PBS education, including curricular considerations, method of review, and morphology (Table 2). All agreed that trainees should learn PBS review through a structured approach that includes the identification of monolayer, use of various magnifications, switching between magnifications, and systematic review of each cell line. Procurement of PBS slides should encompass both patients under the care of the trainee and slide "libraries" to ensure all trainees see similar morphology regardless of personal experience on ward and consult rotations.

Ideal curricula should include education on how PBS review can augment or eliminate the need for more advanced testing and should include discussions on the practical use of PBS within the context of resource limited vs resource rich settings. Trainees should be aware of the growing use of digital microscopy and understand the benefits and limitations of digital microscopy.

Trainees should be able to name and identify common cytoplasmic and nuclear features that aid in diagnosis. CR on individual disorders of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets can be seen in Table 2. Participants agreed that specific emphasis should be placed on disorders in which correct and timely diagnosis is paramount to avoiding significant patient morbidity, acute decompensation, or death. Acute leukemias and hemolytic anemias, specifically TMA, were felt to warrant explicit curricular emphasis. Conversely, fellows should also be competent in the recognition of commonly encountered diagnoses that are more indolent in nature, eg, iron deficiency anemia. However, consensus was not reached on how to balance education in these competing interests.

### Does extreme leukocytosis predict serious bacterial infections in infants in the post-pneumococcal vaccine era? The experience of a large, tertiary care pediatric hospital [^112E2AKj]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Extreme leukocytosis, defined as a peripheral white blood cell count greater than 25,000/mm, may alarm clinicians and prompt extensive evaluation in infants with fever, especially in the pediatric emergency department.

Methods

We reviewed data from children aged 3 to 36 months with extreme leukocytosis, fever and the risk of serious bacterial infections (SBI) at our institution from July 2010 to December 2012, a period after the universal introduction of pneumococcal vaccine.

Results

Serious bacterial infection was recorded in 57 (39%) of the 147 infants. The most common SBI were segmental or lobar pneumonia, in 28 (19%) patients, and urinary tract infection in 16 (10.9%) patients. Three patients had positive blood cultures, corresponding to a bacteremia rate of 2%. C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the SBI group than in the non-SBI group.

Conclusions

All well-looking febrile infants with white blood cell greater than 25,000/mm should undergo a chest radiograph unless there are clear physical findings that indicate a different etiology. Urine culture should be considered in women. C-reactive protein can have an added value in the differential diagnosis.

During a 4-week study period, participants enrolled in the College of American Pathologists Q-Probes program submitted data on PB smear reviews including review request source, reason for review request, and if the pathologist's review resulted in a clinically relevant morphologic finding.

Results —

Twenty-two institutions submitted data on 835 eligible PB smears. Pathologists identified clinically relevant findings on a median 53.4% of technologist-requested PB smear reviews and a median 14.3% of provider-ordered PB smear reviews. The most frequently identified pathologist finding on technologist-requested PB smear reviews was "blasts" in 91 of 532 (17.1%) followed by "atypical (possibly neoplastic) lymphocytes" in 74 of 532 (13.9%); the most frequent finding on provider-ordered reviews was "other" in 55 of 315 (17.5%) followed by "immature cells/left shift in myeloid cells or monocytes" in 12 of 315 (3.8%). Pathologists agreed with technologists' indications for review in 458 of 513 requested reviews (89.3%). Institutions that conducted postanalytic follow-up on previously reviewed PB smears had a higher rate of clinically relevant findings detected on technologist-requested smears.

Conclusions —

Pathologist review of PB smears flagged by technologists for review frequently yielded clinically relevant findings. This was higher in institutions that conducted postanalytic reviews. Provider-ordered reviews resulted in clinically relevant findings in a median of 14.3% of smears.

First, the digitized PBS goes through a deep-learning-based quality control (QC) algorithm that filters out parts of the PBS which are too high or low in cellular density or too blurred. Then, white blood cells (WBC) and red blood cells (RBC) are detected separately — WBC are detected using a U-Net model, a deep-learning algorithm for segmentation, while RBC are detected using simple computer vision methods and filtered using machine-learning. Following this, each individual cell is characterized in terms of shape, texture and color distribution, and annotated for visualization in QuPath. b U-Net performance on WBC segmentation.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^111vJ6cz]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The interpretation of peripheral blood smear (PBS) morphology is a core skill of the practicing hematologist and plays a key role in their ability to provide a timely diagnosis. The morphologic evaluation can reveal pathologic findings, which allow for timely diagnosis and rapid treatment for intracellular parasitic infections, hemolytic anemias, suspected thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), and acute leukemias. However, the absence of pathologic findings required when diagnoses of exclusion, such as immune thrombocytopenia purpura, are under consideration.

Identification of pathologic morphology on PBS is an acquired skill that requires iterative visuospatial training to allow for high fidelity object recognition. Object recognition theories suggest that iterative training and the repetitive exposure to unique combinations of visual stimuli, including shapes, contours, colors, and textures, are needed to develop rapid object recognition with retained fidelity. Hematologists in the United States hone these skills during fellowship training.

In North America, graduate medical education (GME) training programs are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). During the training, fellows routinely order and interpret PBSs under the supervision of an attending hematologist. The ACGME outlines fellowship specific milestones across several domains in an effort to ensure a minimum level of clinical exposure and competency across programs. The ACGME milestones for hematology mandate competency in the "interpretation of peripheral blood smears". Despite this mandate, there neither is an established "gold standard", nor are there published, peer-reviewed recommendations on the methodology of teaching PBS review.

Other medical specialties require trainees to be competent in the interpretation of analogous visuospatial tasks. Examples include the interpretation of radiographic images (radiology, pulmonology, and internal medicine), echocardiography (cardiology), anatomic pathology (pathology), and urine sediment (nephrology). Clinical competency in the use of echocardiographic imaging is among the most granular and developed among these, but is still largely based on expert consensus. There are no agreed upon interdisciplinary best practices in skill acquisition in object recognition despite the seemingly ubiquitous nature of visuospatial skill mastery at the GME level.

We convened a focus group of academic hematologists, well-versed in the clinical application and teaching of PBS review with the goal to develop a theoretical framework for PBS education at the GME level. Here, we describe proposed theory and the consensus recommendations (CR) of a multiinstitutional focus group, developed using constructivist grounded theory and modified nominal group technique (NGT).

### Sweet syndrome in infancy [^113xXH6F]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Sweet syndrome, or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is characterized by the presence of fever, peripheral leukocytosis, painful erythematous plaques and nodules, and a predominately neutrophilic dermal infiltrate. We report a case occurring in a 10-week-old male child, with preceding upper respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal infection symptoms. Sweet syndrome occurring in an infant should prompt a work-up for immunodeficiency, as well as a review of the peripheral blood smear to rule out the rare case of malignancy.

### Acquired pure red cell aplasia: updated review of treatment [^116iYKUx]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

The evidence of a granular lymphocytosis greater than 2 × 10⁹ /l lasting for more than 6 months has been regarded as the criteria for defining the disease. However, the normal range for peripheral blood LGL counts is 0.223 ± 0.099 × 10⁹ /l and clonal disease has been documented in 8% of patients when absolute LGL counts are between 0.6 to 1.0 × 10⁹ /l. Thus, an expansion of a restricted LGL subset demonstrates the diagnosis of LGL-leukaemia and a 6-month follow-up criterion is not necessary when clonality is established. The characteristic finding is the presence of increased numbers of LGL, usually identified by a greater size than normal lymphocytes, abundant pale cytoplasm, and prominent azurophilic granules. However, these features may vary, even among cells from the same patient. The granulation can range from fine to coarse, and some cells may have otherwise characteristic features but lack granules (sometimes called large agranular lymphocytes). Occasionally, clonally expanded lymphocytes with a characteristic CD3 +, CD57 + phenotype may not have LGL morphology on a peripheral smear but may represent in vivo antigen-activated cytotoxic effector T cells. An increase of CD3 + /CD56 − or CD3 − /CD56 + cells by peripheral-blood flow cytometry and/or an inverted CD4 + /CD8 + cell ratio (< 1.0) suggests the existence of LGL leukaemia.

### Atypical lymphoid cells circulating in blood in COVID-19 infection: morphology, immunophenotype and prognosis value [^115Mo644]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Atypical lymphocytes circulating in blood have been reported in COVID-19 patients. This study aims to (1) analyse if patients with reactive lymphocytes (COVID-19 RL) show clinical or biological characteristics related to outcome; (2) develop an automatic system to recognise them in an objective way and (3) study their immunophenotype.

Methods

Clinical and laboratory findings in 36 COVID-19 patients were compared between those showing COVID-19 RL in blood (18) and those without (18). Blood samples were analysed in Advia2120i and stained with May Grünwald-Giemsa. Digital images were acquired in CellaVisionDM96. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to accurately recognise COVID-19 RL. Immunophenotypic study was performed throughflow cytometry.

Results

Neutrophils, D-dimer, procalcitonin, glomerular filtration rate and total protein values were higher in patients without COVID-19 RL (p < 0.05) and four of these patients died. Haemoglobin and lymphocyte counts were higher (p < 0.02) and no patients died in the group showing COVID-19 RL. COVID-19 RL showed a distinct deep blue cytoplasm with nucleus mostly in eccentric position. Through two sequential CNNs, they were automatically distinguished from normal lymphocytes and classical RL with sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy values of 90.5%, 99.4% and 98.7%, respectively. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed COVID-19 RL are mostly activated effector memory CD4 and CD8 T cells.

Conclusion

We found that COVID-19 RL are related to a better evolution and prognosis. They can be detected by morphology in the smear review, being the computerised approach proposed useful to enhance a more objective recognition. Their presence suggests an abundant production of virus-specific T cells, thus explaining the better outcome of patients showing these cells circulating in blood.

Focus group results

Transcribed statements from focus group 1 were coded thematically in an iterative fashion. Individual statements could be coded in several thematic categories if multiple dimensions were identified. Major emerging thematic categories included benefit provided by PBS review, cell lineage, medium used for PBS review, procedure of PBS review, source of slide, specific diagnosis, and specific morphology (Figure 2). Subtopics were developed within each theme.

Figure 2.
Participant statement coding. Statements were categorized and subcategorized following inductive coding. Seven emerging domains of theory are shown. Subdomains are noted where applicable. ∗Further subcategorization can be found in the supplemental Data. The number of further subcategories are noted in parentheses.

Most discussion centered on specific cell lineage (32.8% of the statements), specific diagnosis (39.7% of the statements), and specific morphology (26.0% of the statements). The procedure of PBS review was discussed the least (9.2% of the statements).

Participants reported the majority of their slides for PBS teaching as having originated from clinic or consult service patients currently being seen by the educator or trainee. Some voiced the importance of reviewing PBSs from collated slide libraries to ensure that trainees get a full breadth of exposure. Thorough systematic review was most commonly discussed as the appropriate method for trainee review, whereas some noted abbreviated methods were used in clinical practice by attending hematologists.

White blood cells and red blood cells accounted for the vast majority of cell lineage–based discussion (48.8% and 41.9%, respectively). The most commonly discussed morphologies were schistocytes, spherocytes, blasts, and macro-ovalocytes (supplemental Appendix). Acute leukemia (including acute promyelocytic leukemia), TMA, and hemolytic anemias were the most discussed diagnostic subcategories.

Several benefits of PBS review were stated. First, PBS review is often available at the time of consultation which can improve time to initial diagnosis. The rapid availability to review PBS is specifically important because it pertains to confirming or refuting "can't miss diagnoses" that convey a high likelihood of morbidity or mortality if misdiagnosed. Furthermore, the identification of morphologic characteristics informs Bayesian reasoning and aid in clinical decision making, and in turn, allows for early initiation of therapeutic interventions.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Histoplasmosis — diagnosis in HIV emphasizes antigen detection, with detection of Histoplasma antigen in blood or urine being a sensitive method for rapid diagnosis of disseminated and acute pulmonary histoplasmosis but insensitive for chronic pulmonary infection. In a study using a newer quantitative assay, Histoplasma antigen was detected in 100% of urine samples and 92% of serum samples from people with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis, and antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may also be useful method for diagnosis of pulmonary histoplasmosis; in severe disseminated disease, peripheral blood smears can show organisms engulfed by white blood cells and biopsy often demonstrates characteristic 2 to 4 μm budding yeast cells. Culture of H. capsulatum from blood, bone marrow, respiratory secretions, or other sites is possible in > 85% of patients with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis but requires several weeks to grow, while serologic tests are less useful than antigen assays in AIDS-related disseminated disease but may help in pulmonary disease with reasonably intact immune responses. For central nervous system (CNS) disease, usual cerebrospinal fluid findings are lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low glucose; fungal stains are usually negative and cultures are positive in a minority of cases, with a review including patients with HIV reporting cultures positive in 38% of patients. Histoplasma antigen can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a far greater number of cases and antibodies are seen in approximately one-half of cases, and a positive antigen or antibody test result from CSF is diagnostic for histoplasmosis; if specific tests are negative, a presumptive diagnosis of Histoplasma meningitis is appropriate when the patient has disseminated histoplasmosis and findings of CNS infection not attributable to another cause.

### Using peripheral smear review, age and absolute lymphocyte count as predictors of abnormal peripheral blood lymphocytoses diagnosed by flow cytometry [^113gyBXN]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

Absolute lymphocytosis in the elderly raises the possibility of malignancy and generally warrants further investigation. To better correlate clinical variables with the frequency of neoplastic lymphoid processes in this population, we retrospectively reviewed archived flow cytometric analyses from peripheral blood specimens on patients of 50 years of age and older that had been deemed suspicious for a lymphoproliferative process after peripheral smear review. Age, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), white blood cell count and relative lymphocyte count were correlated with the results of flow cytometry. Of 71 total cases, 42 (59%) had an abnormal immunophenotype. Independent variables that showed significant differences between normal and abnormal immunophenotype were mean age (p = 0.001) and ALC (p = 0.0032). We combined age and absolute lymphocyte count variables to look for the best possible cutoff values to predict the likelihood of an abnormal immunophenotype. ALC cutoff values of ≥ 4 × 10⁹ cells/L for patients over 67 years of age, and > 6.7 × 10⁹ cells/L for patients between 50 and 67 years of age, had a high sensitivity for detecting an abnormal immunophenotype.

### Comparative analysis reveals potential utility of digital microscopy in the evaluation of peripheral blood smears with some barriers to implementation [^1159iutE]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear (PBS) is an essential diagnostic test in current medical practice. We aimed to evaluate the use of digital microscopy for the examination of PBS as an option to provide expert interpretation to remote sites and in "on-call" situations.

Methods

We collected 100 Wright-Giemsa-stained PBS slides representing normal and abnormal findings seen at a community-based hospital. Four hematopathologists independently evaluated the cases using conventional light and digital microscopy.

Results

When comparing digital vs light microscopy, most of the cellular features evaluated showed at least a moderate degree of agreement in at least three of the reviewers. Discrepancies in final diagnosis were identified in a minority of the cases, most of which were attributed to the poorer resolution of digital microscopy at high magnification (×400).

Conclusions

These results support the limited use of digital microscopy for evaluation and triage of peripheral blood smears as a practical option to obtain expert opinion in locations where experienced staff is not available on site. Our results indicate that while digital microscopy is well suited for basic triage of these blood smears, limitations in quality of imaging at higher magnification as well as large file size may limit its utility in certain settings and situations.

NCCN T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia — diagnosis includes peripheral blood smear analysis for cytology with presence of LGLs characterized by reniform or round nucleus and abundant cytoplasm containing azurophilic granules; peripheral blood flow cytometry with adequate immunophenotyping to establish diagnosis; a flow cytometry panel that may include CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD56, CD57, TCRδ, TCRγδ, TRBC1; and assessment of T-cell clonality. Useful in certain circumstances are bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, an IHC panel that may include CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD56, CD57, TCRβ, TCRδ, TIA1, perforin, granzyme B, mutational analysis of STAT3 and STAT5B, and EBER-ISH. The guideline advises to rule out reactive large granular lymphocytosis and to repeat peripheral blood flow cytometry and T-cell clonality studies in 6 months in asymptomatic patients with small clonal large granular lymphocyte populations (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L) or polyclonal LGL, and notes that bone marrow evaluation is typically needed to confirm diagnosis and is essential for cases with low LGL counts (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L) and cases suspicious for concurrent bone marrow failure disorders. Typical immunophenotype for T-LGLL is CD3+, CD8+, CD16+, CD57+, CD56 ±, CD28-, CD5 dim, and/or CD7 dim, CD45RA+, CD62L-, TCRαβ+, TIA1+, granzyme B+, or granzyme M+, and approximately 10% of LGLL cases will be of the NK-cell subtype and are treated with a similar approach to T-LGLL. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Smear campaign: misattribution of pancytopenia to a tick-borne illness [^112s4Mux]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 51-year-old woman presenting with a targetoid rash and pancytopenia after a tick bite. Initial evaluation was notable for severe neutropenia on the complete blood cell count differential, a positive Lyme IgM antibody, and a peripheral blood smear demonstrating atypical lymphocytes. While her pancytopenia was initially attributed to tick-borne illness, peripheral flow cytometry showed 7% myeloblasts, and a bone marrow biopsy confirmed 60% blasts. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, in addition to early, localized Lyme disease. This case highlights the differential diagnosis for pancytopenia, cytopenia patterns for different tick-borne illnesses, the risk of premature closure in internal medicine, and management of Lyme disease in hosts with altered immunity.

### Diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia during mohs micrographic surgery [^115QLrXj]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunohistochemical stains can help distinguish between leukemic and reactive infiltrates present during MMS. Leukemic infiltrates are typically CD20+/CD23+/CD5+/CD43+/CD3-. In contrast, benign reactive infiltrates are composed of T-cells that are CD20-/CD23-/CD5+/CD43+. Cytokeratin staining can also be used to evaluate for residual tumor or perineural invasion.

Workup of suspected CLL should include a complete blood count with differential count, peripheral blood flow cytometry, and a peripheral blood smear.CLL is characterized by an absolute peripheral blood B lymphocyte count of > 5 × 10⁹/L for at least 3 months. Flow cytometry should be ordered to determine the clonality of B cells. Immunophenotyping will show expression of CD5 as well as B-cell antigens CD19, CD20, CD23, and low levels of surface membrane immunoglobulin with either κ or λ light chain expression. Peripheral blood smear will show small, mature lymphocytes with dark staining nuclei and densely condensed chromatin with a narrow rim of cytoplasm. Smudge cells may be seen along with larger, atypical prolymphocytes. Though not necessary for establishing diagnosis of CLL, FISH can be performed on peripheral blood cells to identify chromosomal abnormalities common in CLL.

This case of CLL diagnosed during MMS highlights the increased risk of cutaneous malignancies associated with CLL, as well as the importance of recognizing atypical lymphocytic aggregates on Mohs sections, and the value of familiarizing oneself with the workup for such a finding.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^113kf1WJ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Across all cohorts, for each PBS we detected an average of 26,000 (range 70 to 133,916) RBC per PBS (a total of 12,042,425 RBC) and around 1,400 (range 12 to 39,862) WBC/PBS (a total of 646,952; Fig. 2e)). The cellular density for the MLL cohort was on average smaller by 44% for RBC/mm² and 10.5% for WBC/mm² compared to CUH (Supplementary Table S4; Supplementary Fig. S3a). Further heterogeneity was observed across conditions, with controls having the highest WBC density and the lowest RBC density (28.9 WBC/mm², 189 RBC/mm²), anemia having the highest RBC density (383 RBC/mm²) and MDS having the lowest WBC density (13.8 WBC/mm²; Supplementary Fig. S3b). Lastly, we also noted that automated blood films produced a higher fraction of good tiles compared to manually prepared slides while controlling for cohort and condition — an additional 5%, highlighting the utility of standardization (Supplementary Fig. S3c).

In line with the findings in Fig. 1c, we extracted on average more cells in controls than in individuals with either MDS or anemia (Supplementary Table S4), although heterogeneity across slides rendered this trend statistically insignificant. Generally, the cellular density of detected WBC in the PBS correlated with WBCCs from automated analysers, validating our detection protocol through an orthogonal approach (robust; Fig. 2f), and demonstarting that we detect a representative number of WBC in PBS. Finally, we characterized all individual cells using morphological features used in other morphometric software programs – (Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Fig. S3). For each cell, we quantified its size, shape, color distribution and texture and for WBCs we also characterized their nuclear size and shape (Supplementary Fig. S4). We note here that our method for WBC nuclei segmentation underperforms in conditions of low contrast (where nucleus and cytoplasm are hard to distinguish) or high granularity (particularly for eosinophils and basophils; Supplementary Fig. S5), leading us to focus on cases of high contrast and avoiding conclusions pertaining to eosinophils or basophils.

### Computer vision quantitation of erythrocyte shape abnormalities provides diagnostic, prognostic, and mechanistic insight [^116xHUzj]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The automated capture of peripheral blood smear images and artificial intelligence have the potential to address many of these limitations. Digital peripheral smear images are already automatically captured in many hospitals and are regularly used to conduct remote manual reviews. Current state-of-the-art for automated RBC morphology analysis includes CellaVision analyzers, which provide some preclassification of RBCs to assist with manual grading of smears. These systems assist in creating semiquantitative grading but are not sufficiently calibrated for important RBC subtypes, such as schistocytes, and the corresponding hardware may not be available in resource-limited settings. Research and development of additional tools have been hampered by poor reproducibility, inadequately small image data sets, limited clinical testing, or narrow focus on a few morphologies. Although some recent approaches have shown promise, they have not been validated at the cell population level, at which clinical assessments are made, nor have they been shown to add value in clinical diagnosis.

Here, we address these limitations by presenting a novel, open-source machine-learning pipeline (denoted as RBC-diff) for the calculation of an RBC morphology differential from peripheral blood smear images. We validated the RBC-diff performance at single-cell and cell population levels using a clinical grading from a multicenter database of 338 577 smears. We then retrospectively applied the RBC-diff in multiple clinical contexts, demonstrating its value in differential diagnosis and prognosis. Finally, we illustrated the utility of RBC-diff in a research setting by showing how this tool can derive novel single-cell data that can help improve the understanding of how morphology contributes to routine blood count indices.

Diagnosis

Clinical presentation and diagnostic workup

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare and frequently fatal myeloproliferative neoplasm of early childhood with an estimated incidence of 1.2 cases per million and a median age at disease onset of ~ 2 years. Patients typically present with fever, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and a high circulating white blood cell (WBC) count with peripheral monocytosis and a leukoerythroblastic blood smear. Cough, bloody stools, an erythematous rash, or failure to thrive may also be observed. These symptoms are likely related to infiltration of monocytes into the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and spleen, respectively. Elevated hemoglobin F corrected for age is found in ~ 50% of patients. Apart from an extended infectious disease workup, further traditional diagnostic tools include bone marrow aspiration, a peripheral blood smear, and flow cytometry (diagnostic criteria per the 2016 Revision to World Health Organization [WHO] Classificationare summarized in Table 1). Bone marrow examination can display varying degrees of abnormal myelo- or megakaryopoiesis but must identify fewer than 20% blasts to rule out acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bone marrow findings typically include hypercellularity with granulocytic hyperplasia and full maturation of myeloid progenitors, although increased monocytes are not always present. Dysplasia can be noted across all 3 hematopoietic lineages, and reticulin fibrosis is occasionally observed. In patients with monosomy 7, a predominance of erythroid precursors can be seen. Leukoerythroblastosis is not part of the WHO criteria for diagnosis of JMML but is commonly seen on peripheral blood smear and recapitulates the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative properties of this overlap syndrome. Flow cytometry is often helpful at diagnosisto rule out other acute leukemias but does not play an important role thereafter unless the clinician is worried about progression to AML. Hyperphosphorylation of STAT5 was previously used as an adjunctive criterion for diagnosis but is not routinely offered in clinical laboratories. Similarly, hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitor cells to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in colony-forming assays is a hallmark laboratory feature of JMML. However, GM-CSF hypersensitivity can be present in certain viral infections, is not routinely available, is difficult to interpret even in expert hands, and is therefore rarely used to establish a clinical diagnosis of JMML. A molecular confirmation is now possible in nearly every patient with JMML.

### Flow cytometric, morphologic, and laboratory comparative study in patients with leukocytosis and cytopenia [^114adcqH]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCI) as a screening test for patients with leukocytosis and cytopenia.

Methods

We identified 320 patients during August 2016 to December 2016 and evaluated FCI and morphology of peripheral blood smears (PBSs).

Results

The most common indications for FCI included history of hematologic malignancy (HHM, n = 126), leukocytosis (n = 80), and cytopenia (n = 53). Positive FCI rate was low with a range of 4.4% to 12.5% in patients with absolute neutrophilia regardless of HHM, if cases with circulating blasts were excluded. Patients with absolute lymphocytosis had a 93% positive FCI rate. Patients with HHM and pancytopenia showed a higher incidence of positive FCI findings than patients without HHM and with isolated cytopenia. PBS morphology correlated strongly with FCI (P = 0.0001).

Conclusion

PBS evaluation is an accurate and cost-effective screening test. FCI for patients with mature neutrophilia and isolated cytopenia has a very low yield.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: guideline from the college of American pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^114zZFHA]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia — referral and deferring invasive procedures: If after examination of a peripheral blood smear, it is determined that the patient will require immediate referral to another institution with expertise in the management of acute leukemia for treatment, the initial institution should, whenever possible, defer invasive procedures including bone marrow aspiration and biopsies to the treatment center to avoid duplicate procedures, associated patient discomfort, and additional costs. The panel does not suggest that care be delayed or prohibited; however, the panel strongly believes that patients will benefit from having the treating center take the primary role in performing invasive procedures.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology — representative patterns are illustrated as follows: Predominance of alveolar macrophages in BAL from a normal subject; BAL lymphocytosis; BAL neutrophil predominance with intracellular bacteria; BAL eosinophilia; unsatisfactory BAL specimen with squamous and degenerating columnar epithelial cells; BAL with alveolar macrophages and degenerating neutrophils; hemosiderin-laden macrophages indicating diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; and amorphous, predominantly acellular debris consistent with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.

### Autoimmune myelofibrosis: report of three cases and review of the literature [^116ZUQEr]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2004). Low credibility.

Autoimmune myelofibrosis is a distinct clinicopathological entity, recognizing immunopathogenetic mechanisms and occurring isolately or in association with systemic and/or organ-specific autoimmune diseases. It results in chronic cytopenias, and is defined by a pattern including bone marrow, peripheral blood, serological and clinical features. It has to be distinguished from other disorders having myelofibrosis. Among these, the most relevant differential diagnosis is with chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, particularly when disclosing autoimmune clinical and/or laboratory features as epiphenomenon related to a secondary immune-dysregulation. Here we report on 3 patients admitted because of chronic cytopenias. In all of them, the clinicopathological evaluation essentially demonstrated myelofibrosis, not clustered megakaryocytes, reactive lymphoid infiltration in marrow biopsies, absence of significant tear-drop poikilocytosis and leukoerythroblastosis on peripheral blood smears, normal-sized spleen, positive autoimmune serology. The resulting patterns met the diagnosis of autoimmune myelofibrosis occurring isolately in a patient and associated with Sjögren's syndrome or concomitant Sjögren's syndrome and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in the other two, respectively. Transient improvements in cytopenias and unmodified myelofibrosis were observed following corticosteroid treatment. It is noteworthy the lack of a specific therapy, being the underlying pathophisiology of myelofibrosis still unclear. In conclusion, increased awareness of the clinicopathological pattern identifying autoimmune myelofibrosis is recommended in order to improve basic and clinical knowledge of this emerging entity.

### Developing a standardized approach for assessing mast cells and eosinophils on tissue biopsies: a Work group report of the AAAAI allergic skin diseases committee [^116JaxPj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Bone marrow biopsy technique and specimen utility — A bone marrow biopsy is usually performed at the iliac crest and involves 2 stages: an aspirate and a core biopsy, and for adequacy at least a 1.5-cm length of the bone marrow core is required. It is essential to collect peripheral blood for a complete blood count with differential and peripheral blood smear evaluation before or shortly after the bone marrow biopsy for correlation of findings, and due to the excellent cellular detail and single-cell suspension of the aspirate smear it is the preferred specimen for performing a differential cell count and determining the percentage of individual cell types in the bone marrow.

### The role of eosinophil morphology in distinguishing between reactive eosinophilia and eosinophilia as a feature of a myeloid neoplasm [^111VXptT]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 60 cases were selected of which three were healthy control subjects with no history of allergy, 26 had a myeloid neoplasm, 28 had reactive eosinophilia and three had a diagnosis of iHES made after detailed investigations to exclude known causes of eosinophilia (Table II).

Table II
Summary of cases selected.

The frequency with which codes were assigned in the four groups is shown in Table III and Fig 1 (a cell can be assigned more than one code). Among the 5594 eosinophils evaluated, 459 cells did not meet a consensus (≥ 4/7) between the seven evaluators. The global consensus was 91.8%.

### Where does morphology fit in myelodysplastic syndrome diagnosis in the era of molecular testing? [^111azhVo]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The recognition of cytologic dysplasia in blood and bone marrow remains the cornerstone of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) diagnosis because it distinguishes MDS from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential or clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance. Expert morphologists achieve high concordance in the diagnosis of MDS if appropriate clinical information is provided. Because of the low prevalence of MDS, diagnostic approaches based solely on molecular diagnosis will likely be erroneous.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2020 guideline on diagnosis and management of babesiosis [^111md7Co]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA 2020 babesiosis — diagnosis and treatment emphasize that babesiosis has no easily recognized clinical features such as the erythema migrans skin lesion of Lyme disease; a diagnosis should be considered in a patient who resides in or has traveled to an endemic area, experiences clinical symptoms that are consistent with babesiosis, and has characteristic laboratory test abnormalities. Diagnosis is confirmed with the identification of Babesia parasites by microscopic evaluation of blood smears or amplification of Babesia DNA using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and the diagnosis of acute babesiosis cannot be confirmed solely by the presence of Babesia antibody in a serum sample collected at a single time point. Treatment with a combination of atovaquone plus azithromycin for 7 to 10 days achieves cure in most cases, delay in diagnosis and treatment is associated with severe disease, and prolonged antibiotic therapy should be reserved for highly immunocompromised patients.

### Thrombocytosis in systemic lupus erythematosus: a possible clue to autosplenectomy? [^111i5Q8z]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Thrombocytosis can be due to a myeloproliferative disorder or to a reactive or secondary process; among these are connective tissue disorders, in particular systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Besides being an expression of active disease, this unusual finding has also been described in SLE complicated by autosplenectomy. We evaluated the prevalence of thrombocytosis in a series of SLE patients and its relationship to functional asplenia.

Methods

Platelet count was evaluated in 465 consecutive Caucasian patients with SLE (387 women, 78 men, median age 54 yrs). Thrombocytosis was defined as platelet count > 400 x 10(9)/l in at least 3 blood samples. All patients with thrombocytosis underwent peripheral blood smears for erythrocyte abnormalities and instrumental spleen evaluation.

Results

Seventeen patients (3.7%) with thrombocytosis were observed. Peripheral blood smear showed Howell-Jolly bodies, spherocytes, and target cells in 3/17 patients (17.6%). In the same 3 patients, ultrasound and computed tomography failed to evidence the spleen, and liver-spleen scans showed absence of splenic uptake (a finding indicative of functional autosplenectomy). One satisfied criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and the other 2 patients had positive IgG antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) at medium titer.

Conclusion

The sudden appearance and persistence of thrombocytosis or even the apparent reversal of thrombocytopenia in patients with SLE should raise suspicion of autosplenectomy, in particular if secondary APS or aPL is present.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^113Gem9X]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Nonspecific tests of immunologic inflammation — routine laboratory tests such as complete blood cell count with differential, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and other acute-phase reactants are useful in determining the inflammatory consequences of innate immunity, and functional assays of neutrophils and macrophages may be necessary to pinpoint inflammatory responses (B); functional assays of macrophages and neutrophils may indicate either impaired defense or uncontrolled inflammatory responses (ie, the macrophage activation syndrome), neutrophil and macrophage function tests may only be available in specialized medical centers, and high ferritin levels associated with the macrophage activation syndrome can be used to monitor treatment of this disorder.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^1176yBmc]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

### Guide to the diagnosis of myeloid neoplasms: a bone marrow pathology group approach [^115CjUQD]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The practicing pathologist is challenged by the ever-increasing diagnostic complexity of myeloid neoplasms. This guide is intended to provide a general roadmap from initial case detection, often triggered by complete blood count results with subsequent blood smear review, to final diagnosis.

Methods

The integration of hematologic, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features into routine practice is standard of care. The requirement for molecular genetic testing has increased along with the complexity of test types, the utility of different testing modalities in identifying key gene mutations, and the sensitivity and turnaround time for various assays.

Results

Classification systems for myeloid neoplasms have evolved to achieve the goal of providing a pathology diagnosis that enhances patient care, outcome prediction, and treatment options for individual patients and is formulated, endorsed, and adopted by hematologists/oncologists.

Conclusions

This guide provides diagnostic strategies for all myeloid neoplasm subtypes. Special considerations are provided for each category of testing and neoplasm category, along with classification information, genetic testing requirements, interpretation information, and case reporting recommendations based on the experience of 11 Bone Marrow Pathology Group members.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2020 guideline on diagnosis and management of babesiosis [^115U37ps]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA 2020 babesiosis guideline — diagnostic confirmation of acute babesiosis states "we recommend peripheral blood smear examination or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) rather than antibody testing (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)" and comments that diagnosis should be based on epidemiological risk factors and clinical evidence and confirmed by smear or PCR. PCR is described as "more sensitive than a blood smear examination" and "If blood smears are negative and babesiosis is still suspected, PCR testing should be performed". Smear technique notes that "A review of at least 200–300 fields under oil immersion will increase sensitivity", that "Both thick and thin smears should be prepared and examined by experienced personnel", and that "merozoites organized in tetrads (Maltese cross forms) are pathognomonic of babesiosis". Antibody testing guidance states "Babesia-specific antibody testing should not be used for routine diagnosis of acute babesiosis", in part because many patients "remain seropositive for a year or more after resolution of disease".

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^117StTM6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic procedures — laboratory tests in the diabetic foot — Consideration should be given to the following tests, but many lack the ability to impart a definitive diagnosis, necessitating clinical correlation. Clinical laboratory tests that may be needed include fasting or random blood glucose, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), complete blood count (CBC) with or without differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum chemistries, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, wound and blood cultures, and urinalysis. Caution must be exercised in the interpretation of laboratory tests because several reports have documented the absence of leukocytosis in the presence of severe foot infections, and a common sign of persistent infection is recalcitrant hyperglycemia despite usual antihyperglycemic regimens.

### Paraneoplastic leukemoid reactions induced by cytokine-secreting tumours [^115LmmX1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Distinguishing LR from CNL

In contrast to LRs, the neutrophilia in CNL is characterised by the lack of left shift. Segmented neutrophils constitute most of the cells. The more immature granulocytic precursors and nucleated erythrocytes are infrequent to find. However, it is important to mention that features of reactive granulocytosis can infrequently be seen in CNL, making the distinction challenging. The morphological overlap between PLR and CNL can likely be explained by the mechanistic similarity of these two processes. G-CSF is the ligand for colony-stimulating factor three receptor (CSF3R). In CNL, mutations in the CSF3R gene lead to constitutive activation of downstream signalling protein mediators, leading to granulocytic proliferation. In PLR, the ligand (G-CSF) is markedly increased which will lead to a similar end result.

Bone marrow examination and ancillary testing

Marrow examination in patients with PLR usually shows hypercellular marrow with myeloid hyperplasia, and no increase in blasts percentage. Left shifted myelopoiesis with toxic granulation can be also seen (figures 3 and 4). Erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes are usually unremarkable. The characteristic 'dwarf' megacaryocytes of CML are not seen. Cytogenetic and molecular studies must be negative for the known molecular drivers of MPNs (BCR/ABL1, CSF3R, TET2, SRSF2, SETPB1 and ASXL1).

Figure 3
Bone marrow aspirate examination showing markedly increased M:E ratio due to increased and left shifted granulopoiesis.

Figure 4

Cytokine blood level

Testing for the suspected cytokine plasma level (G-CSF, GM-CSF, ILs or TNF-α) can be accomplished through enzyme immunoassays or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. However, these tests are not offered in many institutions.

Histological examination of the CST

Based on our knowledge, all reported PLRs occurred in the setting of malignant tumours. CSTs tend to have a higher grade and a lesser degree of differentiation than other tumours. Most reported tumours are poorly differentiated or undifferentiated. Dense intra-tumoural neutrophilic infiltration is a characteristic morphologic finding (figure 5).CST cells show diffuse cytoplasmic staining with immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence staining with G-CSF or GM-CSF antibody. However, some CSTs can stain negative even if their CSF-secreting ability has been confirmed by elevated CSF plasma levels.

### Two patients of trisomy 21 with transient abnormal myelopoiesis with hypereosinophilia without blasts in peripheral blood smears [^111cUx48]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) relies on the detection of characteristic blasts and leukocytosis in peripheral blood. We report two patients of trisomy 21 with TAM with hypereosinophilia, who had neither circulating blasts nor leukocytosis. Genetic testing of polymorphonuclear leukocytes isolated from whole blood revealed heterozygous mutations in GATA1, suggesting that the mutations were harbored in increased eosinophils. Both patients had direct hyperbilirubinemia and one died of liver fibrosis. Our findings emphasize the importance of screening for GATA1 mutations in neonatal infants with Down syndrome and hypereosinophilia even if blasts are not detected in peripheral blood smears.

### Diagnosis of atypical cases of infectious mononucleosis [^117LBFg8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The variable manifestations of infectious mononucleosis rarely cause clinicians to suspect primary Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus infection; consequently, costly diagnostic tests and unnecessary treatments are undertaken. Seventeen cases of clinically atypical and 11 cases of clinically typical infectious mononucleosis were diagnosed through screening for atypical and apoptotic lymphocytes in the peripheral blood samples by means of an automated hematologic analyzer. Atypical and typical cases did not differ significantly with respect to peripheral white blood cell counts; percentages of lymphocytes, atypical lymphocytes, CD4(+) lymphocytes, human leukocyte antigen — DR positivity in CD3 lymphocytes, or apoptotic cells in blood smear after incubation; or levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Only the percentage of CD8(+) lymphocytes was significantly higher in patients with typical infectious mononucleosis than it was in patients with atypical infectious mononucleosis. Because certain atypical cases of infectious mononucleosis display laboratory abnormalities that are characteristic of typical infectious mononucleosis, enhanced awareness can help in the diagnosis.

### Laboratory productivity and the rate of manual peripheral blood smear review: a college of American pathologists Q-probes study of 95, 141 complete blood count determinations performed in 263 institutions [^112JaYDv]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Automated laboratory hematology analyzers are capable of performing differential counts on peripheral blood smears with greater precision and more accurate detection of distributional and morphologic abnormalities than those performed by manual examinations of blood smears. Manual determinations of blood morphology and leukocyte differential counts are time-consuming, expensive, and may not always be necessary. The frequency with which hematology laboratory workers perform manual screens despite the availability of labor-saving features of automated analyzers is unknown.

Objective

To determine the normative rates with which manual peripheral blood smears were performed in clinical laboratories, to examine laboratory practices associated with higher or lower manual review rates, and to measure the effects of manual smear review on the efficiency of generating complete blood count (CBC) determinations.

Design

From each of 3 traditional shifts per day, participants were asked to select serially, 10 automated CBC specimens, and to indicate whether manual scans and/or reviews with complete differential counts were performed on blood smears prepared from those specimens. Sampling continued until a total of 60 peripheral smears were reviewed manually. For each specimen on which a manual review was performed, participants indicated the patient's age, hemoglobin value, white blood cell count, platelet count, and the primary reason why the manual review was performed. Participants also submitted data concerning their institutions' demographic profiles and their laboratories' staffing, work volume, and practices regarding CBC determinations. The rates of manual reviews and estimations of efficiency in performing CBC determinations were obtained from the data.

Setting

A total of 263 hospitals and independent laboratories, predominantly located in the United States, participating in the College of American Pathologists Q-Probes Program.

Results

There were 95,141 CBC determinations examined in this study; participants reviewed 15,423 (16.2%) peripheral blood smears manually. In the median institution (50th percentile), manual reviews of peripheral smears were performed on 26.7% of specimens. Manual differential count review rates were inversely associated with the magnitude of platelet counts that were required by laboratory policy to trigger smear reviews and with the efficiency of generating CBC reports. Lower manual differential count review rates were associated with laboratory policies that allowed manual reviews solely on the basis of abnormal automated red cell parameters and that precluded performing repeat manual reviews within designated time intervals. The manual scan rate elevated with increased number of hospital beds. In more than one third (35.7%) of the peripheral smears reviewed manually, participants claimed to have learned additional information beyond what was available on automated hematology analyzer printouts alone.

Conclusion

By adopting certain laboratory practices, it may be possible to reduce the rates of manual reviews of peripheral blood smears and increase the efficiency of generating CBC results.

### Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infection-a review of literature [^1127jfGP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 is a systemic viral infection which mainly targets the human respiratory system with many secondary clinical manifestations especially affecting the hematopoietic system and haemostasis. Few studies have highlighted the prognostic value of blood findings such as lymphopenia, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, LDH, CRP, cardiac troponin, low-density lipoproteins and chest radiographic abnormality. A study of progressions of blood and radiological results may help to identify patients at high risk of severe outcomes. This systematic review aimed to assess the temporal progression of blood and radiology findings of patients with COVID-19.

Methods

Comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted on Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases to identify articles published for peripheral blood investigation and radiological results of COVID-19 patients.

Results

A total of 27 studies were included in this review. The common laboratory features reported include lymphopenia, elevated levels of C-reactive proteins and lactate dehydrogenase. For radiological signs, ground-glass opacifications, consolidations, and crazy paving patterns were frequently reported. There is a correlation between lymphocyte count, neutrophil count and biomarkers such as C-reactive proteins and lactate dehydrogenase; at a later phase of the disease (more than 7 days since onset of symptoms), lymphopenia worsens while neutrophil count, C-reactive protein levels and lactate dehydrogenase levels increase. Frequencies of ground-glass opacifications and ground-glass opacifications with consolidations decrease at a later phase of the disease while that of consolidation and crazy paving pattern rises as the disease progresses. More extensive lung involvement was also seen more frequently in the later phases.

Conclusion

The correlation between temporal progression and the reported blood and radiological results may be helpful to monitor and evaluate disease progression and severity.

### New onset pancytopenia in adults: a review of underlying pathologies and their associated clinical and laboratory findings [^111M66xJ]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract Pancytopenia is regularly encountered in hematology practice, yet there exist few published assessments of the frequencies of various etiologies, and these frequencies exhibit substantial geographic variation. We reviewed bone marrow specimens from pancytopenic adults to determine the most common etiologies and to identify associations with clinical and laboratory findings. Of 132 patients with no history of hematolymphoid neoplasia, no prior bone marrow study for pancytopenia and no recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, 64% had clonal hematopoietic disorders. Most common were myeloid processes: 26% of patients had acute myeloid leukemia, and 17% had myelodysplasia. Less common were lymphoid neoplasms such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (6%), hairy cell leukemia (5%) and precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4%). Among non-clonal cases, the most common specific diagnoses were aplastic anemia (5%), megaloblastic anemia (2%) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related changes (2%). Clonal diagnoses were associated with more severe cytopenias than non-clonal cases. Circulating nucleated erythroid precursors, immature granulocytes and blasts were seen more frequently in clonal cases. Nearly two-thirds of cases of new onset pancytopenia in adults in our North American practice setting have a clonal etiology, with myeloid neoplasms being most common. Blood counts and peripheral smear findings can provide insights into the likelihood of a clonal etiology.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^116bSyJr]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In interpreting WBC counts, physicians should consider recent initiation of steroids and their dosage. While increases of as much as 4.84 × 10⁹ cells may be seen 48 h after initiating large doses, larger increases, increases following a daily dose of 320 mg or less of hydrocortisone equivalent, and increases greater than 1 × 10⁹ cells occurring within 24 h post‐steroid initiation should trigger concern for other causes of leukocytosis.

### A cutaneous interstitial granulomatous dermatitis-like eruption arising in myelodysplasia with leukemic progression [^115HT32q]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2013). Low credibility.

Cutaneous manifestations associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are uncommon and can occur as specific or nonspecific lesions. Recognizing these cutaneous manifestations is important as they can precede blood or bone marrow transformation to leukemia. Granulomatous reactions have rarely been described as nonspecific lesions of MDS. These rare cases histologically resembled granuloma annulare, sarcoid, and a generalized dermal interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) which were not associated with leukemic infiltration. The authors report an interesting case of an IGD-like eruption evolving over the course of MDS with eventual progression to systemic leukemia. IGD is an inflammatory reaction that refers to a varied spectrum of histologic patterns and is associated with a variety of systemic illnesses and hypersensitivity reactions, including lymphoma and leukemia. In patients with MDS, surveillance for leukemia is a critical component of their follow-up care. Normally, this surveillance occurs through serial peripheral blood smears and bone marrow studies. IGD-like eruptions are a cutaneous reaction pattern that may serve as an additional clinical indicator of leukemic progression in patients with MDS. Although primarily a reactive pattern, this entity can rarely harbor leukemic blasts.

### PROSER: a web-based peripheral blood smear interpretation support tool utilizing electronic health record data [^114gMczK]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Peripheral blood smear (PBS) interpretation represents a cornerstone of pathology practice and resident training but has remained largely static for decades. Here, we describe a novel PBS interpretation support tool.

Methods

In a mixed-methods quality improvement study, a web-based clinical decision support (CDS) tool to assist pathologists in PBS interpretation, PROSER, was deployed in an academic hospital over a 2-month period in 2022. PROSER interfaced with the hospital system's electronic health record and data warehouse to obtain and display relevant demographic, laboratory, and medication information for patients with pending PBS consults. PROSER used these data along with morphologic findings entered by the pathologist to draft a PBS interpretation using rule-based logic. We evaluated users' perceptions of PROSER with a Likert-type survey.

Results

PROSER displayed 46 laboratory values with corresponding reference ranges and abnormal flags, allowed for entry of 14 microscopy findings, and computed 2 calculations based on laboratory values; it composed automated PBS reports using a library of 92 prewritten phrases. Overall, PROSER was well received by residents.

Conclusions

In this quality improvement study, we successfully deployed a web-based CDS tool for PBS interpretation. Future work is needed to quantitatively evaluate this intervention's effects on clinical outcomes and resident training.

### Lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy: benign or malignant? [^114JtQ6Z]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The increasing use of immunophenotypic and molecular analysis in the routine evaluation of patients with lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, or other hematologic disorders has led to the identification of unexpected small clonal lymphoid populations. These clones, sometimes with disease-specific markers, such as the t(14;18), are especially challenging for the clinician because of their unknown biologic potential and uncertain clinical behavior. Study of these early lymphoid lesions is providing important clues to the process of lymphomagenesis, and may provide the rationale for preemptive therapy in the future. More and more, the hematologist/oncologist is consulted regarding otherwise healthy individuals with lymphadenopathy and/or lymphocytosis, and pathology reports that confound the referring internist or surgeon. The report does not name a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder, but is not completely "normal". Does the patient have a benign or malignant condition? How should they be evaluated? Is treatment indicated? These patients prove challenging for the consulting hematologist as well as the referring physician. In this review, we will focus on some of these scenarios and attempt to provide guidance for their management.

### Computer vision quantitation of erythrocyte shape abnormalities provides diagnostic, prognostic, and mechanistic insight [^113G8pHq]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 4 shows that RBC-diff counts may in some scenarios be predictive of patient outcomes or track with patient prognosis. The surprising associations with mortality in Figure 4 B persisted after adjusting for multiple factors, including morphology grading flags, comorbidities, and RDW, suggesting the presence of valuable and underutilized clinical information in blood smears. We note that the population of patients with blood smears at MGH is not representative of the general patient population, and further study of this signal in healthy cohorts is required.

RBC-diff can also help provide single-cell insights into the influence of morphology on CBC indices (Figure 5) via the estimation of single-cell volumes. Estimation of blood count parameters from imaging data has previously been shown to be promising, with prototype approaches showing similar accuracy to flow-cytometry approaches. By connecting estimated CBC indices to morphology, RBC-diff can generate morphology-corrected CBC indices that may provide improved discrimination of pathologic states or response to treatment. It has been shown that hemoglobin levels can be estimated from blood smear images, suggesting that RBC-diff could potentially be extended to other blood count measures such as hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin.

This study focuses primarily on the quantitation of schistocytes because they are commonly elevated in important acute care settings, and existing automated systems show limited specificity of detection. Schistocyte counts can be approximated via the fragmented red cell count (FRC), which can be calculated via flow-cytometry. FRC counts are sensitively but nonspecifically associated with imaging-derived schistocyte countsand may have diagnostic value for TMAs. However, FRC counts do not provide information on other RBC morphologic classes, a key feature for differential diagnosis in our study (Figure 3) and a part of the current recommendations for TMA diagnosis. Although FRC is a valuable correlate of schistocyte levels, it is typically used to highlight the need for manual smear review, and thus may provide value in tandem with the RBC-diff. A robust comparison of the RBC-diff schistocyte counts and FRC was not possible in this study because the primary clinical hematology analyzers at the MGH and BWH do not routinely record FRC values.

Interpretation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) differential cell counts — abnormal thresholds and patterns — states that "A BAL fluid cell differential count with greater than 15% lymphocytes, greater than 3% neutrophils, greater than 1% eosinophils, or greater than 0.5% mast cells indicates BAL lymphocytosis… BAL neutrophilia… BAL eosinophilia… or BAL mastocytosis, respectively", and that "A lymphocyte differential count greater than or equal to 25% suggests granulomatous lung disease". The text also notes that "An increased number of nucleated immune cells and abnormal proportions of immune cell types may suggest or support specific types of ILD" in the absence of infection.
