## Question

Tell me about targeted temperature management post cardiac arrest

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about targeted temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why TTM was adopted. Then, I should verify the historical evidence base and its limitations. Next, I will examine the pivotal trials that reshaped practice, including TTM-1, TTM-2, and the 48-hour duration trial. After that, I need to review contemporary meta-analyses and guideline shifts. Then, I should consider subgroup nuances, implementation quality, and practical protocols. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced, clinically actionable bottom line and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice again.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and rationale. Post–cardiac arrest brain injury from ischemia–reperfusion is the dominant driver of morbidity and mortality; TTM was adopted to mitigate secondary brain injury by reducing metabolic demand, limiting excitotoxicity, and attenuating inflammatory cascades, with early observational and small RCT signals suggesting benefit in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms [^53916e6e] [^7e69d219].

> Wait, let me verify the historical evidence base before drawing conclusions. The two 2002 trials in OHCA with ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT) suggested improved survival and neurologic outcomes with 32–34°C for 12–24 hours, but both were small, unblinded, and had methodologic limitations; importantly, the control groups often permitted fever, which complicates attribution of benefit to hypothermia versus fever avoidance [^7e69d219] [^5ebef45f].

> I will now examine the TTM-1 trial, which fundamentally shifted practice. In 939 comatose OHCA adults, 33°C was not superior to 36°C for mortality or 6-month neurologic outcomes; both targets actively prevented fever, implying that strict normothermia may be as effective as mild hypothermia in many patients, though the trial did not include a true "no temperature control" arm, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret equivalence as proof of no benefit from cooling per se [^dd3f2bdd] [^99f852ef].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the TTM-2 trial. In 1,861 OHCA patients, targeted hypothermia at 33°C for 24 hours did not improve survival or functional outcome versus active normothermia with fever prevention, and the hypothermia arm had more arrhythmias requiring treatment; this strengthens the case that routine 33°C cooling is not superior to strict normothermia in broad OHCA populations, though again, both arms avoided fever, so fever prevention remains a consistent theme [^8aea94f0] [^53a08b72].

> Next, I should review the duration question. The 48-hour versus 24-hour TTM trial found no significant improvement in 6-month neurologic outcomes with 48 hours at 33°C, and adverse events were more frequent with the longer duration; thus, extending cooling beyond 24 hours is not supported for routine practice in adults [^762b0423].

> Let me consider the totality of evidence via meta-analyses. Contemporary meta-analyses and Bayesian syntheses show no consistent mortality or neurologic benefit for 32–34°C versus normothermia when fever is actively prevented, with posterior probabilities suggesting any benefit of hypothermia is small and uncertain; this aligns with the neutral results of TTM-1 and TTM-2 and reinforces a shift toward fever prevention as the core intervention [^024406fd] [^f1aa25ee] [^6cc554f2].

> I should confirm how guidelines have responded. ILCOR and ERC/ESICM now emphasize active temperature control to prevent fever (generally < 37.5°C) for comatose post–cardiac arrest patients rather than mandating hypothermia; the AHA science advisory similarly prioritizes strict normothermia while acknowledging uncertainty and the need for individualized decisions pending updated guidelines [^6edb8c9f] [^5ca75c6c] [^dc3a9f7d].

> But wait, what if certain subgroups still benefit from 33°C? Observational and post hoc analyses suggest that patients with more severe post–cardiac arrest illness (e.g., cardiopulmonary failure, high lactate, malignant EEG) may have better survival with 33°C than with 36°C, whereas those with milder illness fare better with 36°C; however, these are retrospective and hypothesis-generating, so I should be cautious and avoid overgeneralization [^b78ae7dc] [^1106136f] [^e2dd2aee].

> I need to check in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and nonshockable rhythms. Evidence is weaker and mixed; a post hoc analysis of the HYPERION trial suggested better 90-day neurologic outcomes with 33°C versus normothermia in IHCA with nonshockable rhythms, but the sample was small and the analysis exploratory, so routine 33°C for IHCA or nonshockable rhythms is not firmly established and should be individualized [^28e26ffd].

> Next, I should review implementation quality, because poor delivery can obscure benefits. Real-world data show substantial variation and frequent deviations from TTM protocols, with higher rates of fever and worse outcomes when temperature control is lax; "high-quality TTM" with precise monitoring, shivering control, and standardized rewarming is essential if any temperature strategy is chosen, and prehospital cooling with large-volume cold fluids has not shown benefit and may be harmful [^743d97fb] [^e434de0a] [^5ebef45f].

> Let me think about practical protocols. If using TTM, target 32–36°C for at least 24 hours with controlled rewarming at 0.25–0.5°C/hour and vigilant fever prevention for 48–72 hours after rewarming; if following the contemporary normothermia approach, maintain 36–37.5°C with continuous core temperature monitoring and active cooling as needed to prevent fever, recognizing that sedation and device reliability are critical to avoid temperature excursions [^53916e6e] [^315538a5] [^6edb8c9f].

> Hold on, I should verify shivering management because it materially affects feasibility. Pharmacologic antishivering bundles (e.g., buspirone, meperidine, acetaminophen, dexmedetomidine) reduce shivering and may reduce reliance on neuromuscular blockade; protocols that incorporate these agents improve adherence to temperature targets and may indirectly improve outcomes, though prospective outcome data are limited [^cb30ae11].

> I should double-check prognostication implications. Modern practice delays neuroprognostication until at least 72 hours after rewarming, uses multimodal assessments (clinical examination, EEG, somatosensory evoked potentials, neuroimaging), and avoids the self-fulfilling prophecy of early WLST; this is especially important when interpreting neutral TTM trials, as early withdrawal can mask potential benefits [^53916e6e] [^41c67f7d].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating. The most defensible, evidence-aligned approach today is active temperature control to prevent fever, with a target of 36–37.5°C for all comatose post–cardiac arrest patients; hypothermia at 33°C may be considered selectively for patients with severe post–arrest illness after reversible causes are addressed, while acknowledging uncertain benefit and increased adverse effects, and 48-hour cooling should not be routine [^6edb8c9f] [^b78ae7dc] [^762b0423].

> Finally, I need to ensure I identify knowledge gaps. We still need RCTs stratified by illness severity, etiology, and rhythm; trials of truly early initiation (within 2 hours) with high-quality delivery; and studies of adjuncts like optimized sedation, hemodynamics, and antishivering. Until then, meticulous fever prevention and high-quality implementation of whichever temperature strategy is chosen are the safest, most evidence-concordant path forward [^7c816b7c] [^e434de0a] [^8147c0c9].

Targeted temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest is best understood as **active temperature control to prevent fever** [^6edb8c9f], with a target of 32–36°C for 24 hours followed by slow rewarming, because fever worsens neurologic injury [^76b740cc]. Early TTM is recommended for comatose adults after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^5ebef45f], but **recent trials show no superiority of 33°C over 36°C or strict normothermia** [^dd3f2bdd] [^8aea94f0], so the emphasis is on avoiding hyperthermia rather than a specific hypothermic target [^dc3a9f7d]. TTM is not routinely indicated for awake patients or those with a non-shockable rhythm, and prehospital cooling is not recommended [^5ebef45f] [^bff0c7c7]. Complications include shivering, infection, and electrolyte disturbances, which require close monitoring and protocolized care [^e25cf6bb] [^53916e6e].

---

## Physiological rationale

TTM reduces secondary brain injury by **lowering cerebral metabolic rate**, decreasing oxygen demand, and attenuating excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation [^e33cdc13]. Fever is common after cardiac arrest and independently associated with worse neurologic outcomes, so **preventing hyperthermia is a key goal** [^76b740cc].

---

## Historical evidence and evolution of practice

Early randomized trials suggested that cooling to 32–34°C improved survival and neurologic outcomes in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms [^7e69d219]. However, the 2013 TTM trial found **no difference between 33°C and 36°C**, prompting a shift toward active temperature control rather than fixed hypothermia targets [^dd3f2bdd]. The 2021 TTM2 trial further showed no benefit of 33°C over strict normothermia (≤ 37.5°C), reinforcing the primacy of fever prevention [^8aea94f0] [^53a08b72].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines emphasize **active temperature control to prevent fever**:

- **Target temperature**: 32–36°C for at least 24 hours, followed by slow rewarming (≤ 0.5°C/hour) [^5ebef45f].
- **Indications**: Comatose adults after OHCA with shockable rhythms; consider in non-shockable rhythms or in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) [^5ebef45f].
- **Contraindications**: Awake patients, active bleeding, severe infection, or hemodynamic instability [^notfound].
- **Prehospital cooling**: Not recommended due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^5ebef45f] [^bff0c7c7].

---

## Clinical outcomes

TTM improves neurologic outcomes and may reduce mortality in selected patients, but **benefit varies by rhythm, arrest setting, and illness severity** [^7e69d219]. The strongest evidence supports use in OHCA with shockable rhythms, whereas **benefit in non-shockable rhythms or IHCA remains uncertain** [^024406fd] [^28e26ffd].

---

## Potential complications and risks

TTM carries risks that require **careful monitoring and protocolized management**:

- **Shivering**: Common and can increase metabolic demand; requires sedation and antishivering strategies [^cb30ae11].
- **Infection**: Increased risk of pneumonia and sepsis; monitor closely [^e25cf6bb].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia are common [^53916e6e].
- **Coagulopathy**: Mild hypothermia can impair coagulation, though clinically significant bleeding is uncommon [^1932f971].

---

## Practical implementation

Effective TTM requires **standardized protocols**, continuous core temperature monitoring, and trained staff [^e434de0a]. Surface and endovascular devices are both acceptable, with endovascular systems offering more precise control but requiring invasive placement [^18807237]. Sedation and antishivering protocols are essential to maintain target temperatures and prevent complications [^cb30ae11].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Non-shockable rhythms**: Evidence is limited; TTM may be considered case-by-case, but routine use is not strongly supported [^024406fd] [^28e26ffd].
- **Pediatric patients**: TTM is recommended to maintain normothermia (≤ 37.5°C); evidence for hypothermia is limited [^e0c09aec].
- **Elderly patients**: Outcomes are generally poorer, but TTM is still considered if indicated [^69f46705].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Current research focuses on **personalizing temperature targets** based on illness severity, optimizing timing and duration, and identifying subgroups that benefit from deeper hypothermia [^7c816b7c] [^24d05fea]. Novel cooling methods and biomarkers to guide therapy are also under investigation [^7c816b7c].

---

Targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest is best understood as **active temperature control to prevent fever**, with a target of 32–36°C for 24 hours followed by slow rewarming. Recent evidence shows no superiority of 33°C over 36°C or strict normothermia, so the emphasis is on avoiding hyperthermia rather than achieving a specific hypothermic target.

### Questions remain about targeted temperature management in cardiac arrest [^7e69d219]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

For decades, targeted temperature management (TTM) has been a promising intervention for mitigating brain damage after cardiac arrest. Early landmark studies of TTM for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) with shockable rhythms showed benefits in mortality and neurologic outcome. 1,2 On the basis of these results, TTM was established as standard practice and was given a class I recommendation in the 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care for use in OHCA with initial shockable rhythms, as well as a class IIb recommendation in patients with initial nonshockable rhythms and for in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCAs). 3.

### Temperature management after cardiac arrest: an advisory statement by the advanced life support task force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and the American Heart Association emergency cardiovascular care committee and the council on cardiopulmonary, critical care, perioperative and resuscitation [^5ebef45f]. Resuscitation (2016). Low credibility.

For more than a decade, mild induced hypothermia (32 °C-34 °C) has been standard of care for patients remaining comatose after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm, and this has been extrapolated to survivors of cardiac arrest with initially nonshockable rhythms and to patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Two randomized trials published in 2002 reported a survival and neurological benefit with mild induced hypothermia. One recent randomized trial reported similar outcomes in patients treated with targeted temperature management at either 33 °C or 36 °C. In response to these new data, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation Advanced Life Support Task Force performed a systematic review to evaluate 3 key questions: (1) Should mild induced hypothermia (or some form of targeted temperature management) be used in comatose post-cardiac arrest patients? (2) If used, what is the ideal timing of the intervention? (3) If used, what is the ideal duration of the intervention? The task force used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to assess and summarize the evidence and to provide a consensus on science statement and treatment recommendations. The task force recommends targeted temperature management for adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm at a constant temperature between 32 °C and 36 °C for at least 24 hours. Similar suggestions are made for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a nonshockable rhythm and in-hospital cardiac arrest. The task force recommends against prehospital cooling with rapid infusion of large volumes of cold intravenous fluid. Additional and specific recommendations are provided in the document.

### Targeted temperature management for 48 vs 24 hours and neurologic outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a randomized clinical trial [^762b0423]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

International resuscitation guidelines recommend targeted temperature management (TTM) at 33°C to 36°C in unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for at least 24 hours, but the optimal duration of TTM is uncertain.

Objective

To determine whether TTM at 33°C for 48 hours results in better neurologic outcomes compared with currently recommended, standard, 24-hour TTM.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was an international, investigator-initiated, blinded-outcome-assessor, parallel, pragmatic, multicenter, randomized clinical superiority trial in 10 intensive care units (ICUs) at 10 university hospitals in 6 European countries. Three hundred fifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were enrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on December 27, 2016.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to TTM (33 ± 1°C) for 48 hours (n = 176) or 24 hours (n = 179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5°C per hour until reaching 37°C.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, with a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define favorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time to death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource use.

Results

In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] men), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 69% (120/175) in the 48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 64% (112/176) in the 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], 1.08; 95% CI, 0.93–1.25; P = 0.33). Six-month mortality was 27% (48/175) in the 48-hour group and 34% (60/177) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, -16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59–1.11; P = 0.19). There was no significant difference in the time to mortality between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.54–1.15; P = 0.22). Adverse events were more common in the 48-hour group (97%) than in the 24-hour group (91%) (difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-10.6%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01–1.12; P = 0.04). The median length of intensive care unit stay (151 vs 117 hours; P < .001), but not hospital stay (11 vs 12 days; P = 0.50), was longer in the 48-hour group than in the 24-hour group.

Conclusions and Relevance

In unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest admitted to the ICU, targeted temperature management at 33°C for 48 hours did not significantly improve 6-month neurologic outcome compared with targeted temperature management at 33°C for 24 hours. However, the study may have had limited power to detect clinically important differences, and further research may be warranted.

### Use of targeted temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^bb0531df]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Individual randomized trials have yielded variable results regarding the benefits of targeted temperature management in patients encountering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This study aimed to systemically determine if targeted temperature management initiated after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was associated with improved outcomes.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched for published randomized trials that compared targeted temperature management (core body temperature 32–34°C) vs control (core body temperature ≥ 36°C) after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The main outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality and poor neurological outcome.

Results

Six trials with 1391 patients were included in the analysis. Compared with the control group, targeted temperature management was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77–1.04; P = 0.15, I(2) = 34%), which was similar among those with a shockable rhythm (RR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.74–1.08, P = 0.25, I(2) = 46%). All-cause mortality was significantly reduced with targeted temperature management after exclusion of one trial that allowed for mild hypothermia in the control arm (RR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.96; P = 0.01, I(2) = 0%). There was a nonsignificant reduction in poor neurological outcome with targeted temperature management compared with control (RR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74–1.03, P = 0.10, I(2) = 54%), which was similar among those with a shockable rhythm (RR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.70–1.07, P = 0.19, I(2) = 63%). Poor neurological outcome was significantly reduced with targeted temperature management after exclusion of one trial that allowed for mild hypothermia in the control arm (RR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70–0.95; P = 0.01, I(2) = 19%).

Conclusion

Targeted temperature management initiated after successful resuscitation in patients who encountered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in mortality and poor neurological outcome. Lack of benefit was strongly influenced by inclusion of one study that used mild hypothermia in the control arm. These results indicate that only mild hypothermia may be needed to improve outcomes among patients presenting with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

### Targeted temperature management in adult cardiac arrest: systematic review and meta-analysis [^024406fd]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on targeted temperature management in adult cardiac arrest patients.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched on June 17, 2021 for clinical trials. The population included adult patients with cardiac arrest. The review included all aspects of targeted temperature management including timing, temperature, duration, method of induction and maintenance, and rewarming. Two investigators reviewed trials for relevance, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE.

Results

The systematic search identified 32 trials. Risk of bias was assessed as intermediate for most of the outcomes. For targeted temperature management with a target of 32–34 °C vs. normothermia (which often required active cooling), 9 trials were identified, with six trials included in meta-analyses. Targeted temperature management with a target of 32–34 °C did not result in an improvement in survival (risk ratio: 1.08 [95%CI: 0.89, 1.30]) or favorable neurologic outcome (risk ratio: 1.21 [95%CI: 0.91, 1.61]) at 90 to 180 days after the cardiac arrest (low certainty of evidence). Three trials assessed different hypothermic temperature targets and found no difference in outcomes (low certainty of evidence). Ten trials were identified comparing prehospital cooling vs. no prehospital cooling with no improvement in survival (risk ratio: 1.01 [95%CI: 0.92, 1.11]) or favorable neurologic outcome (risk ratio: 1.00 [95%CI: 0.90, 1.11]) at hospital discharge (moderate certainty of evidence).

Conclusions

Among adult patients with cardiac arrest, the use of targeted temperature management at 32–34 °C, when compared to normothermia, did not result in improved outcomes in this meta-analysis. There was no effect of initiating targeted temperature management prior to hospital arrival. These findings warrant an update of international cardiac arrest guidelines.

### Targeted temperature management at 33 ° C versus 36 ° C after cardiac arrest [^99f852ef]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study TTM was published by Nielsen N and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac arrest. In the TTM study, the trial question was: what is the role of targeted temperature at 33 degree C in unconscious adults after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest? In the TTM study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the TTM study, the population was: 939 patients (178 female, 761 male). The inclusion criteria were unconscious adult patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause. The key exclusion criteria were interval from the return of spontaneous circulation to screening > 240 minutes, unwitnessed arrest with asystole as the initial rhythm, acute ICH or stroke, and a body temperature < 30 degree C. In the TTM study, the interventions were: n = 473 cooling to 33 degree C (target body temperature of 33 °C) n = 466 cooling to 36 degree C (target body temperature of 36 °C). In the TTM study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in all-cause death (50% vs. 48%; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.28). In the TTM study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in poor neurologic function (CPC scale) or death at 6 months (54% vs. 52%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.16) No significant difference in poor neurologic function by mRS or death at 6 months (52% vs. 52%; HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.14). In the TTM study, the conclusion was: in unconscious adult patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause, cooling to 33 degree C was not superior to cooling to 36 degree C with respect to a all-cause death.

### Targeted temperature management for cardiac arrest [^2148cd13]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic hypothermia, or targeted temperature management (TTM), is a strategy of reducing the core body temperature of survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) to minimize neurological damage caused by severe hypoxia. Initial clinical trials examining this technique demonstrated significant improvement in neurological function among survivors of out-of-hospital SCA with an initial shockable rhythm. Since then, TTM has become an integral part of the care provided to comatose survivors of SCA. However, multiple questions persist regarding the target cooling temperature, duration of cooling, and utility of TTM in patient populations such as survivors of out-of-hospital SCA with non-shockable rhythms or in-hospital SCA. This review article summarizes the current evidence regarding optimal application of TTM and compares the recommendations for TTM in current guidelines.

### Targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest: systematic review and meta-analyses [^c1449fae]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Targeted temperature management (TTM) with therapeutic hypothermia is an integral component of postarrest care for survivors. However, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have failed to demonstrate the benefit of TTM on clinical outcomes. We sought to determine if the pooled data from available RCTs support the use of prehospital and/or in-hospital TTM after cardiac arrest.

Methods

A comprehensive search of SCOPUS, Elsevier's abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature, from 1966 to November 2016 was performed using predefined criteria. Therapeutic hypothermia was defined as any strategy that aimed to cool post-cardiac arrest survivors to a temperature ≤ 34°C. Normothermia was temperature of ≥ 36°C. We compared mortality and neurologic outcomes in patients by categorizing the studies into 2 groups: (1) hypothermia versus normothermia and (2) prehospital hypothermia versus in-hospital hypothermia using standard meta-analytic methods. A random effects modeling was utilized to estimate comparative risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

The hypothermia and normothermia strategies were compared in 5 RCTs with 1389 patients, whereas prehospital hypothermia and in-hospital hypothermia were compared in 6 RCTs with 3393 patients. We observed no difference in mortality (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73–1.05) or neurologic outcomes (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.92–1.72) between the hypothermia and normothermia strategies. Similarly, no difference was observed in mortality (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97–1.03) or neurologic outcome (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85–1.08) between the prehospital hypothermia versus in-hospital hypothermia strategies.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that TTM with therapeutic hypothermia may not improve mortality or neurologic outcomes in postarrest survivors. Using therapeutic hypothermia as a standard of care strategy of postarrest care in survivors may need to be reevaluated.

### Target temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest – a randomized, parallel-group, assessor-blinded clinical trial – rationale and design [^2a3e9ce3]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Experimental animal studies and previous randomized trials suggest an improvement in mortality and neurologic function with induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest. International guidelines advocate the use of a target temperature management of 32°C to 34°C for 12 to 24 hours after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. A systematic review indicates that the evidence for recommending this intervention is inconclusive, and the GRADE level of evidence is low. Previous trials were small, with high risk of bias, evaluated select populations, and did not treat hyperthermia in the control groups. The optimal target temperature management strategy is not known.

Methods

The TTM trial is an investigator-initiated, international, randomized, parallel-group, and assessor-blinded clinical trial designed to enroll at least 850 adult, unconscious patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of a presumed cardiac cause. The patients will be randomized to a target temperature management of either 33°C or 36°C after return of spontaneous circulation. In both groups, the intervention will last 36 hours. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at maximal follow-up. The main secondary outcomes are the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and poor neurologic function (cerebral performance categories 3 and 4) at hospital discharge and at 180 days, cognitive status and quality of life at 180 days, assessment of safety and harm.

Discussion

The TTM trial will investigate potential benefit and harm of 2 target temperature strategies, both avoiding hyperthermia in a large proportion of the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest population.

Questions were allocated to experts who reviewed their areas, made formal presentations, and responded to questions. Jurors also performed independent searches. Sources used for consensus derived exclusively from peer-reviewed reports of human and animal studies.

Study Selection

Question-specific studies were selected from literature searches; jurors independently determined the relevance of each study included in the synthesis.

Conclusions and Recommendations

1) The jury opines that the term "targeted temperature management" replace "therapeutic hypothermia". 2) The jury opines that descriptors (e.g., "mild") be replaced with explicit targeted temperature management profiles. 3) The jury opines that each report of a targeted temperature management trial enumerate the physiologic effects anticipated by the investigators and actually observed and/or measured in subjects in each arm of the trial as a strategy for increasing knowledge of the dose/duration/response characteristics of temperature management. This enumeration should be kept separate from the body of the report, be organized by body systems, and be made without assertions about the impact of any specific effect on the clinical outcome. 4) The jury STRONGLY RECOMMENDS targeted temperature management to a target of 32°C-34°C as the preferred treatment (vs. unstructured temperature management) of out-of-hospital adult cardiac arrest victims with a first registered electrocardiography rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and still unconscious after restoration of spontaneous circulation (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 5) The jury WEAKLY RECOMMENDS the use of targeted temperature management to 33°C-35.5°C (vs. less structured management) in the treatment of term newborns who sustained asphyxia and exhibit acidosis and/or encephalopathy (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

### Postresuscitation care after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: clinical update and focus on targeted temperature management [^53916e6e]. Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. With the introduction of targeted temperature management more than a decade ago, postresuscitation care has attracted increased attention. In the present review, we discuss best practice hospital management of unconscious out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with a special focus on targeted temperature management. What is termed post-cardiac arrest syndrome strikes all organs and mandates access to specialized intensive care. All patients need a secured airway, and most patients need hemodynamic support with fluids and/or vasopressors. Furthermore, immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, when indicated, has become an essential part of the postresuscitation treatment. Targeted temperature management with controlled sedation and mechanical ventilation is the most important neuroprotective strategy to take. Targeted temperature management should be initiated as quickly as possible, and according to international guidelines, it should be maintained at 32° to 36°C for at least 24h, whereas rewarming should not increase more than 0.5°C per hour. However, uncertainty remains regarding targeted temperature management components, warranting further research into the optimal cooling rate, target temperature, duration of cooling, and the rewarming rate. Moreover, targeted temperature management is linked to some adverse effects. The risk of infection and bleeding is moderately increased, as is the risk of hypokalemia and magnesemia. Circulation needs to be monitored invasively and any deviances corrected in a timely fashion. Outcome prediction in the individual patient is challenging, and a self-fulfilling prophecy poses a real threat to early prognostication based on clinical assessment alone. Therefore, delayed and multimodal prognostication is now considered a key element of postresuscitation care. Finally, modern postresuscitation care can produce good outcomes in the majority of patients but requires major diagnostic and therapeutic resources and specific training. Hence, recent international guidelines strongly recommend the implementation of regional prehospital resuscitation systems with integrated and specialized cardiac arrest centers.

### Targeted temperature management after in-hospital cardiac arrest: an ancillary analysis of targeted temperature management for cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythm trial data [^28e26ffd]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Targeted temperature management (TTM) currently is the only treatment with demonstrated efficacy in attenuating the harmful effects on the brain of ischemia-reperfusion injury after cardiac arrest. However, whether TTM is beneficial in the subset of patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) remains unclear.

Research Question

Is TTM at 33 °C associated with better neurological outcomes after IHCA in a nonshockable rhythm compared with targeted normothermia (TN; 37 °C)?

Study Design and Methods

We performed a post hoc analysis of data from the published Targeted Temperature Management for Cardiac Arrest with Nonshockable Rhythm randomized controlled trial in 584 patients. We included the 159 patients with IHCA; 73 were randomized to 33 °C treatment and 86 were randomized to 37 °C treatment. The primary outcome was survival with a good neurologic outcome (cerebral performance category [CPC] score of 1 or 2) on day 90. Mixed multivariate adjusted logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether survival with CPC score of 1 or 2 on day 90 was associated with type of temperature management after adjustment on baseline characteristics not balanced by randomization.

Results

Compared with TN for 48 h, hypothermia at 33 °C for 24 h was associated with a higher percentage of patients who were alive with good neurologic outcomes on day 90 (16.4% vs 5.8%; P = 0.03). Day 90 mortality was not significantly different between the two groups (68.5% vs 76.7%; P = 0.24). By mixed multivariate analysis adjusted by Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis score and circulatory shock status, hypothermia was associated significantly with good day 90 neurologic outcomes (OR, 2.40 [95% CI, 1.17–13.03]; P = 0.03).

Interpretation

Hypothermia at 33 °C was associated with better day 90 neurologic outcomes after IHCA in a nonshockable rhythm compared with TN. However, the limited sample size resulted in wide CIs. Further studies of patients after cardiac arrest resulting from any cause, including IHCA, are needed.

### Targeted temperature management and cardiac arrest after the TTM-2 study [^9731e55e]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

TTM in cardiac arrest

How can we interpret the TTM-2 findings? The first conclusion could be the lack of benefits of TTM after cardiac arrest. Indeed, the TTM-2 study had the largest cohort of patients so far and was conducted using the best statistical methodology, while previous studies had many methodological biases (i.e. no power calculation, limited cohorts, early stopping, no blinded assessors of primary outcome, no prognostication guidelines). Also, as the general management of patients after cardiac arrest has improved over time (i.e. early recognition and treatment of the cause, hemodynamic and ventilatory management, organ support), TTM might add only minimal benefits. Moreover, the experimental literature supporting the effectiveness of TTM may not be easily translated in humans, with a lack of clinically relevant long-term neurological outcomes and of reproducibility in all species.

A second interpretation could be that all the randomized studies on TTM after cardiac arrest are not entirely comparable (Table 1); the TTM-2 study findings would be applicable in the setting of OHCA of cardiac causes, with frequent use of bystander CPR (i.e. short no-flow time and less severe initial anoxic injury), a high proportion of patients with acute myocardial infarction and a low occurrence of shock on admission. On the contrary, in patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm due to respiratory/hypoxic causes and hemodynamic instability, the use of hypothermia at 33 °C could be considered more effective than normothermia, in particular for in-hospital cardiac arrest. Secondary analyses of the TTM-2 study and individual patient meta-analyses from available datasets of randomized trials may identify some subgroups of patients who are better candidates for TTM and should be considered for future research.

### Association of initial illness severity and outcomes after cardiac arrest with targeted temperature management at 36 ° C or 33 ° C [^b78ae7dc]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the optimal target temperature for targeted temperature management (TTM) in comatose patients after cardiac arrest?

Findings

In a cohort study of 1319 patients, of whom 911 did not have severe cerebral edema or highly malignant electroencephalogram, TTM at 33 °C was associated with better survival than TTM at 36 °C for patients with the most severe post–cardiac arrest illness, but TTM at 36 °C was associated with better survival in patients with mild- to moderate-severity illness. Patients with severe cerebral edema or highly malignant electroencephalogram had poor outcomes regardless of TTM strategy.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that measuring initial illness severity in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest may guide selection of the optimal TTM strategy.

### Targeted temperature management and postcardiac arrest care [^3e56201e]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite recent advances, care of the post-cardiac arrest patient remains a challenge. In this article, the authors discuss an approach to the initial care of post-cardiac arrest patients with particular focus on targeted temperature management (TTM). The article starts with history, physiologic rationale, and the major randomized controlled trials that have shaped guidelines for post-cardiac arrest care. It also reviews controversial topics, including TTM for nonshockable rhythms, TTM dose, and surface versus endovascular cooling. The article concludes with a brief review of other key aspects of post-arrest care: coronary angiography, hemodynamic optimization, ventilator management, and prognostication.

### Hospital variation in the utilization and implementation of targeted temperature management in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^743d97fb]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

Background Targeted temperature management (TTM) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with improved functional survival and is a class I recommendation in resuscitation guidelines. However, patterns of utilization of TTM and adherence to recommended TTM guidelines in contemporary practice are unknown. Methods and Results In a multicenter, prospective cohort of consecutive adults with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium in 2012 to 2015, we identified all adults (≥ 18 years) who were potential candidates for TTM. Of 37898 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients at 186 hospitals across 10 Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium sites, 8313 survived for ≥ 4 hours after hospital arrival, of which, 2878 (34.6%) received TTM. Mean age was 61.5 years and 36.3% were women. Median hospital rate of TTM use was 27% (interquartile range [IQR]: 14%, 45%), with an over 2-fold difference across sites after accounting for differences in presentation characteristics (median odds ratio, 2.10 [1.83–2.26]). Notably, TTM utilization decreased during the study period (57.5% [2012] to 26.5% [2015], P < 0.001) including among shockable out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (73.4% to 46.3%, P < 0.001). When administered, the median rate of deviation from one or more recommended practices was 60% (IQR: 40%, 78%). The median rate for delayed onset of TTM was 13% (IQR: 0%, 25%), varying by 70% for identical patients across 2 randomly chosen hospitals (median odds ratio 1.70 [1.39–1.97]). Similarly, the median rate for TTM < 24 hours was 20% (IQR: 0%, 34%) and for achieved temperature < 32°C was 18% (IQR: 0%, 39%), with marked variation across sites (median odds ratios of 1.44 [1.18–1.64] and 1.98 [1.62–2.31], respectively). Conclusions There has been a substantial decline in the utilization of TTM with significant variation in its real-world implementation. Further standardization of contemporary post-resuscitation practices, like TTM, is critical to ensure that their potential survival benefit is realized.

### Targeted temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: certainties and uncertainties [^89a32578]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Targeted temperature management was adopted as part of the treatment of unconscious survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest following the publication of two landmark studies which concluded that mild induced hypothermia (32°C to 34°C) improved survival and neurological outcome, substantiating the neuroprotective effect of mild hypothermia described in experimental animal data. Subsequently, this therapy was recommended by international guidelines and became a standard of care. Although both trials had exclusion criteria limiting generalizability, mild induced hypothermia was applied to the wider cardiac arrest population.

Until recently, despite uncertainties over what represents the optimal target population, temperature, duration of therapy, or rate of rewarming, no large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) had been conducted since 2003. A systematic review and meta-analysis performed by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system and trial sequential analysis concluded that the existing quality of evidence was low and that firm evidence in support of induced hypothermia was lacking.

To further investigate targeted temperature management, the Target Temperature Management (TTM) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest trial group was established. As mild induced hypothermia had become ingrained in clinical practice, it was considered infeasible to compare 32°C to 34°C with no temperature control, as failing to control fever would have been unacceptable to many clinicians. The primary objective of the TTM trial was to compare 33°C with 36°C in unconscious survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for survival for a minimum follow-up of 6 months. A temperature of 36°C was chosen as registry data showed that 36°C was the median temperature of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients arriving at the hospital. Furthermore, it was unlikely that, if feedback-controlled cooling devices were used, the temperature in the 36°C group would stray into the febrile range.

### Changes in practice of controlled hypothermia after cardiac arrest in the past 20 years: a critical care perspective [^7066701a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

For 20years, induced hypothermia and targeted temperature management have been recommended to mitigate brain injury and increase survival after cardiac arrest. On the basis of animal research and small clinical trials, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation strongly advocated hypothermia at 32–34°C for 12-24hours for comatose patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or nonperfusing ventricular tachycardia. The intervention was implemented worldwide. In the past decade, hypothermia and targeted temperature management have been investigated in larger clinical randomized trials focusing on target temperature depth, target temperature duration, prehospital versus in-hospital initiation, nonshockable rhythms, and in-hospital cardiac arrest. Systematic reviews suggest little or no effect of delivering the intervention on the basis of the summary of evidence, and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation today recommends only to treat fever and keep body temperature below 37.5°C (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence). Here we describe the evolution of temperature management for patients with cardiac arrest during the past 20years and how the accrued evidence has influenced not only the recommendations but also the guideline process. We also discuss possible paths forward in this field, bringing up both whether fever management is at all beneficial for patients with cardiac arrest and which knowledge gaps future clinical trials in temperature management should address.

### High quality targeted temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest [^e434de0a]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) is a complex intervention used with the aim of minimizing post-anoxic injury and improving neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. There is large variability in the devices used to achieve cooling and in protocols (e.g., for induction, target temperature, maintenance, rewarming, sedation, management of post-TTM fever). This variability can explain the limited benefits of TTM that have sometimes been reported. We therefore propose the concept of "high-quality TTM" as a way to increase the effectiveness of TTM and standardize its use in future interventional studies.

### Temperature management for comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^dc3a9f7d]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management has been a cornerstone of post-cardiac arrest care for patients remaining unresponsive after return of spontaneous circulation since the initial trials in 2002 found that mild therapeutic hypothermia improves neurological outcome. The suggested temperature range expanded in 2015 in response to a large trial finding that outcomes were not better with treatment at 33°C compared with 36°C. In 2021, another large trial was published in which outcomes with temperature control at 33°C were not better than those of patients treated with a strategy of strict normothermia. On the basis of these new data, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and other organizations have altered their treatment recommendations for temperature management after cardiac arrest. The new American Heart Association guidelines on this topic will be introduced in a 2023 focused update. To provide guidance to clinicians while this focused update is forthcoming, the American Heart Association's Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee convened a writing group to review the TTM2 trial (Hypothermia Versus Normothermia After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest) in the context of other recent evidence and to present an opinion on how this trial may influence clinical practice. This science advisory was informed by review of the TTM2 trial, consideration of other recent influential studies, and discussion between cardiac arrest experts in the fields of cardiology, critical care, emergency medicine, and neurology. Conclusions presented in this advisory statement do not replace current guidelines but are intended to provide an expert opinion on novel literature that will be incorporated into future guidelines and suggest the opportunity for reassessment of current clinical practice.

### Target temperature management following cardiac arrest: a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis [^f1aa25ee]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Temperature control with target temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest has been endorsed by expert societies and adopted in international clinical practice guidelines but recent evidence challenges the use of hypothermic TTM.

Methods

Systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis of clinical trials on adult survivors from cardiac arrest undergoing TTM for at least 12 h comparing TTM versus no TTM or with a separation > 2 °C between intervention and control groups using the PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL databases from inception to 1 September 2021 (PROSPERO CRD42021248140). All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were considered. The risk ratio and 95% confidence interval for death (primary outcome) and unfavourable neurological recovery (secondary outcome) were captured using the original study definitions censored up to 180 days after cardiac arrest. Bias was assessed using the updated Cochrane risk-of-bias for randomised trials tool and certainty of evidence assessed using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. A hierarchical robust Bayesian model-averaged meta-analysis was performed using both minimally informative and data-driven priors and reported by mean risk ratio (RR) and its 95% credible interval (95% CrI).

Results

In seven studies (three low bias, three intermediate bias, one high bias, very low to low certainty) recruiting 3792 patients the RR by TTM 32–34 °C was 0.95 [95% CrI 0.78–1.09] for death and RR 0.93 [95% CrI 0.84–1.02] for unfavourable neurological outcome. The posterior probability for no benefit (RR ≥ 1) by TTM 32–34 °C was 24% for death and 12% for unfavourable neurological outcome. The posterior probabilities for favourable treatment effects of TTM 32–34 °C were the highest for an absolute risk reduction of 2–4% for death (28–53% chance) and unfavourable neurological outcome (63–78% chance). Excluding four studies without active avoidance of fever in the control arm reduced the probability to achieve an absolute risk reduction > 2% for death or unfavourable neurological outcome to ≤ 50%.

Conclusions

The posterior probability distributions did not support the use of TTM at 32–34 °C compared to 36 °C also including active control of fever to reduce the risk of death and unfavourable neurological outcome at 90–180 days. Any likely benefit of hypothermic TTM is smaller than targeted in RCTs to date.

### Through the looking glass: the paradoxical evolution of targeted temperature management for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest [^6f36e609]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

For the past two decades, targeted temperature management (TTM) has been a staple in the care of comatose survivors following cardiac arrest. However, recent clinical trials have failed to replicate the benefit seen in earlier studies, bringing into question the very existence of such clinical practice. In this review, we explore clinical scenarios within critical care that appeared to share a similar fate, but in actuality changed the landscape of practice in a modern world. Accordingly, clinicians may apply these lessons to the utilization of TTM among comatose survivors following cardiac arrest, potentially paving way for a re-framing of clinical care amidst an environment where current data appears upside down in comparison to past successes.

### Target temperature management after cardiac arrest (TTM) [^aedc80ae]. ClinicalTrials (2009). Low credibility.

- Trial overview The TTM-trial is a multicentre, multinational, outcome assessor-blinded, parallel group, randomised clinical trial comparing two strict target temperature regimens of 33°C and 36°C in adult patients, who have sustained return of spontaneous circulation and are unconscious after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when admitted to hospital.
- Objective The primary aim of the TTM-trial is to compare the effects of two strict target temperature protocols for the first 36 hours of hospital stay after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in survival until the end of trial with a target temperature of 33°C compared to 36°C.

To demonstrate or reject a Hazard Ratio difference of 20% between the groups, equivalent to approximately one months difference in median survival time assuming proportional hazards in the groups during the observation time, a sample size of 900 patients would be necessary with a type-1 error risk of 5% and a type-2 error risk of 10%. To allow for patients lost-to-follow up the target population is set to 950 patients. Other secondary outcomes are Cerebral Performance Category at intensive care unit and hospital discharge, and best Cerebral Performance Category during entire trial period. We would like to emphasise that the main secondary outcome being the composite outcome of poor neurological function and mortality at 180 days after cardiac arrest will be of great importance in a situation of a neutral outcome in the primary outcome, when interpreting the results and deriving clinical implications from the TTM-trial.

As survival is an outcome with low risk of bias, not prone to competing risks, and earlier trials and registry data indicate a lower sample size needed to show the same risk reduction when the composite outcome of mortality and poor neurological function is used, this was the fundament for the order of the outcomes.
- Suspected or confirmed acute intracranial bleeding
- Suspected or confirmed acute stroke
- Unwitnessed asystole
- Known limitations in therapy and Do Not Resuscitate-order
- Known disease making 180 days survival unlikely
- Known pre-arrest CPC 3 or 4
- Temperature < 30°C on admission.

### High quality targeted temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest [^b6163c48]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Today, when treating patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest, the medical community is separated into TTM "believers" and "neutral", with a significant impact on patient management and a trend towards a less accurate TTM prescription or, in the worst scenario, a "nihilistic" approach, with the total abandon of any temperature control in a number of centers.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^180c5a7c]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) — guideline statements specify indications and temperature targets: Targeted temperature management is recommended in order to improve survival with good neurological outcome in patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable cardiac rhythm (ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia) and who remain comatose after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). (Strong recommendation; level of evidence not stated) Targeted temperature management should be used in unresponsive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with an initial shockable rhythm after ROSC. (Strong Recommendation; Low-Quality Evidence). It is recommended that a temperature between 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C, inclusively, be selected and maintained for patients who undergo TTM. (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

### Meta-analysis comparing hypothermia versus normothermia in patients after a cardiac arrest [^57dc9864]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The current American Heart Association 2022 guidelines recommend actively preventing fever by targeting a temperature ≤ 37.5°C for comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Contemporary randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show conflicting results regarding the benefit of targeted hypothermia (TH). We performed this updated meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate the role of hypothermia in patients after a cardiac arrest. We searched Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to December 2022. Trials with patients randomly allocated for targeted temperature monitoring and reported neurologic and mortality outcomes were included. Statistical analysis was performed using Cochrane Review Manager using the random-effects model and calculated the pooled risk ratios of outcomes using the Mantel-Haenszel method. A total of 12 RCTs and 4,262 patients were included in the review. Compared with normothermia, the TH group had significantly improved neurologic outcomes (risk ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.98). However, no significant difference in mortality was observed (risk ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 1.06) between the groups. This meta-analysis supports the role of TH in patients after a cardiac arrest, especially secondary to improvement in neurologic outcomes.

### What is the right temperature to cool post-cardiac arrest patients? [^5c63d8f8]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

In spite of these potential criticisms, the fact that good outcome was achieved in just under 50% of patients in both groups demonstrates that, in many patients, very strict fever control (36 °C) alone is sufficient to provide neuroprotection. The question still remains whether we can identify specific cohorts of CA patients who need different depth and duration of temperature management. A study by Lopez-de-Sa et al. published in 2012 found much better outcomes when patients were cooled to 32 °C compared with 34 °C. The targeted temperature management trial suggests that 33 °C is not better than 36 °C in many patients. The duration of temperature management also has not been conclusively settled.

### Targeted temperature management on outcome of older adult patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^69f46705]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Targeted temperature management (TTM) can potentially improve the prognosis of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, the effectiveness of TTM in older adults remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the outcomes of older adult patients with OHCA who underwent TTM.

Methods

This study was a multicenter, retrospective, nationwide observational analysis of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (JAAM-OHCA) registry. We included patients aged ≥ 18 years who had experienced OHCA and underwent TTM from June 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017, in Japan. The primary outcome was a 1-month neurological favorable outcome, and the secondary outcome was 1-month survival.

Results

A total of 1847 patients were included in the analysis. 79 of 389 patients aged ≥ 75 years (20.3%) had a 1-month neurological favorable outcome compared with 369 of 959 patients aged 18–64 years (38.5%) (adjusted odds ratios, 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21–0.45; P for trend < 0.001). With increasing age, 1-month mortality showed an increasing trend; however, there was no significant difference.

Conclusion

In this retrospective nationwide observational study in Japan, neurological outcomes worsened as age increased in patients with OHCA who underwent TTM.

### Association of initial illness severity and outcomes after cardiac arrest with targeted temperature management at 36 ° C or 33 ° C [^a59a5083]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac arrest and resuscitation often result in brain injury that impairs functional recovery for survivors. Severe brain injury contributes to in-hospital death for many other patients. Failure to awaken leads to withdrawal of life sustaining therapy (WLST) for most patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who have pulses restored.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) in a mild hypothermic range (32–36 °C) is an intervention that mitigates brain injury in the laboratory. In clinical trials, treating patients with TTM at 32 to 34 °C resulted in higher survival and better functional recovery than not regulating temperature after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, a trial reported in 2013 did not demonstrate the superiority of TTM at 36 °C vs 33 °C in patients with mild to moderate illness. Current practice includes TTM for comatose patients after cardiac arrest with a target temperature of 32 to 36 °C. There are few data to guide selection of the target temperature, which relies largely on clinician preference or institutional protocol.

Registries reported worse outcomes in cohorts of patients treated after 2013 with TTM at 36 °C compared with patients treated with TTM at 33 °Cor when TTM was not used at all. A 2019 trialfound TTM at 33 °C to be superior to normothermia in patients with more severe illness. Because the association of TTM at 33 °C with outcomes appears to differ between patients with mild to moderate illnessand severe illness, we speculated that TTM strategies might have different associations with outcomes among patients with different magnitudes of post–cardiac arrest injury. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that outcomes differed between patients with TTM at 33 °C and those with TTM at 36 °C, stratified by illness severity.

### Excluding the elephant in the room: cardiac arrest [^3ccd4dd0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

What are the barriers to creating parallel efforts for patients with cardiac arrest? Current guideline recommendations for patients with cardiac arrest and postresuscitation ST elevations on ECG are limited but exist. They call for targeted temperature management as soon as possible and immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention when indicated. 4 These guidelines have been supported and codified by recently published performance and quality measures for acute myocardial infarction. 5 However, even these recommendations are debated among practitioners and are challenging to measure. Readily identifiable, measurable, and achievable goals for postarrest care in STEMI are not yet established, and they require further and more comprehensive evaluation of both therapies and processes of care. Preliminary and ongoing studies are evaluating potential strategies and metrics for postarrest care, ranging from prehospital targeted temperature management 6 to direct transport of patients with arrest to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals. 7 These studies carry promise, but much work remains to be done. Standards of care and measurable quality metrics are needed for cardiac arrest, like those that have been established for STEMI. Perhaps existing quality improvement networks like Mission: Lifeline can be leveraged to help identify these standards and metrics. Expanding data collection or specifying specific elements for patients with cardiac arrest within existing or emerging registries may help identify opportunities to improve care. These registries can be vehicles to surveil postarrest processes of care and outcomes. Finally, national societies and organizations should promote and prioritize cardiac arrest care. Inclusion of emergent angiography and targeted temperature management for patients with cardiac arrest in professional society‐sponsored performance and quality metrics are promising steps. 5 Similar to what was seen for STEMI with Mission: Lifeline, further such sponsorship would help to sustain efforts to improve postarrest care.

### Targeted temperature management in postresuscitation care after incorporating results of the TTM2 trial [^53a08b72]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac arrest still accounts for a substantial proportion of cardiovascular related deaths and is associated with a tremendous risk of neurological injury and, among the few survivors, poor quality of life. Critical determinants of survival and long‐term functional status after cardiac arrest are timely initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use of an external defibrillator for patients with a shockable rhythm. Outcomes are still far from satisfactory, despite ongoing efforts to improve cardiac arrest response systems, as well as elaborate postresuscitation algorithms. Targeted temperature management at the wide range between 32 °C and 36 °C has been one of the main therapeutic strategies to improve neurological outcome in postresuscitation care. This recommendation has been mainly based on 2 small randomized trials that were published 20 years ago. Most recent data derived from the TTM2 (Targeted Hypothermia Versus Targeted Normothermia After Out‐of‐Hospital Cardiac Arrest) trial, which included 1861 patients, challenge this strategy. It showed no benefit of targeted hypothermia at 33 °C over normothermia at 36 °C to 37.5 °C with fever prevention. Because temperature management at lower temperatures also correlated with an increased risk of side effects without any benefit in the TTM2 trial, a modification of the guidelines with harmonizing temperature management to normothermia might be necessary.

### Targeted temperature management and cardiac arrest after the TTM-2 study [^8aea94f0]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of targeted temperature management (TTM) has been recommended for two decades in the management of patients after cardiac arrest; however, the quality of evidence behind this recommendation is moderate to low and refers only to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Recently, Dankiewicz et al. (TTM-2 study) reported that TTM at 33 °C did not lower the incidence of death or 6-month poor neurological outcome than targeted normothermia in 1900 unconscious OHCA patients, with more arrhythmias resulting in hemodynamic compromise observed in the 33 °C group. There was no benefit of hypothermia in any of the prespecified sub-groups, including age, initial rhythm or duration of resuscitation. It is likely that these recent data will affect the use of TTM in clinical practice.

### Targeted temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: certainties and uncertainties [^3d2d52f3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Mean bladder temperature in the 33°C and 36°C intervention groups of the Target Temperature Management trial, during the 36 hours of temperature intervention. The temperature graph in the initial publication showed mean body temperature with a dispersion of two standard deviations encompassing 95% of all observations. Temperature values are presented with 95% confidence intervals.

In this trial (the largest one to date), there was no difference in outcomes between unconscious survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated at 33°C or 36°C, giving clinicians the option of choosing either temperature management strategy, but the least invasive strategy is compelling. The most interesting aspect of the TTM trial may be that it indicates substantial knowledge gaps in post-cardiac arrest fever and temperature management. The optimal temperature, duration of temperature management, and target population remain to be defined.

### Comparison of hypothermic and normothermic targeted temperature management in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with acute coronary syndrome: a nationwide retrospective study [^612b2f22]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, while this study's patients experienced transient cardiac arrest, not all of them may have continued to present with circulatory instability. For instance, only about 40% of STEMI patients were reported to be in shock. Unfortunately, our registry does not include specific hemodynamic indicators, so we conducted sensitivity analyses for patients managed with IABP and ECMO, which also showed no significant differences. Notably, the proportion of patients treated with ECMO in our cohort was exceptionally high compared with international standards, highlighting the unique characteristics of our study population. Several recent studies have investigated the role of TTM in patients treated with ECMO, particularly in determining optimal target temperatures. Using the same JAAM-OHCA registry as this study, one analysis compared normothermic (35–36 °C) and hypothermic (32–34 °C) TTM in OHCA patients receiving ECMO and found no significant differences in neurological outcomes. Similarly, a randomized trial in patients with cardiogenic shock treated with ECMO reported no significant survival benefit of moderate hypothermia (33–34 °C) compared with normothermia (36–37 °C). These findings collectively suggest that the choice of target temperature may not have a substantial impact on outcomes in ECMO-treated patients. With ECMO increasingly recognized as a standard treatment for its combined benefits of circulatory support and intra-arrest cooling, it may play a crucial role in improving outcomes for cardiac arrest patients. Given that ACS is one of the most common causes of cardiac arrest, further research is essential to determine the most effective TTM strategies for this specific population, ensuring that temperature management is optimally integrated into evolving standards of care.

### Prolonged targeted temperature management reduces memory retrieval deficits six months post-cardiac arrest: a randomised controlled trial [^76db6c62]. Resuscitation (2019). Medium credibility.

The study TTH48 was published by Lars Evald and colleagues in 2019 in the journal Resuscitation. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac arrest. In the TTH48 study, the trial question was: what is the role of prolonged targeted temperature management in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest? In the TTH48 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TTH48 study, the population was: 79 patients (8 female, 71 male). The inclusion criteria were out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with perceived good cognitive outcome. The key exclusion criteria were out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of suspected origin other than cardiac, in-hospital cardiac arrest, terminal disease, coagulation disorders, unwitnessed asystolia. In the TTH48 study, the interventions were: n = 43 TTM48 (prolonged target temperature management for 48 hours) n = 36 TTM24 (standard targeted temperature management for 24 hours). In the TTH48 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in cognitive impairment at 6 months (12% vs. 33%; RR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 7.4). In the TTH48 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in attention, executive function. In the TTH48 study, the conclusion was: in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with perceived good cognitive outcome, TTM48 was superior to TTM24 with respect to cognitive impairment at 6 months.

### Targeted temperature management in postresuscitation care after incorporating results of the TTM2 trial [^0093e4b0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac arrest still accounts for a substantial proportion of cardiovascular related deaths and is associated with a tremendous risk of neurological injury and, among the few survivors, poor quality of life. Critical determinants of survival and long-term functional status after cardiac arrest are timely initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use of an external defibrillator for patients with a shockable rhythm. Outcomes are still far from satisfactory, despite ongoing efforts to improve cardiac arrest response systems, as well as elaborate postresuscitation algorithms. Targeted temperature management at the wide range between 32 °C and 36 °C has been one of the main therapeutic strategies to improve neurological outcome in postresuscitation care. This recommendation has been mainly based on 2 small randomized trials that were published 20years ago. Most recent data derived from the TTM2 (Targeted Hypothermia Versus Targeted Normothermia After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest) trial, which included 1861 patients, challenge this strategy. It showed no benefit of targeted hypothermia at 33 °C over normothermia at 36 °C to 37.5 °C with fever prevention. Because temperature management at lower temperatures also correlated with an increased risk of side effects without any benefit in the TTM2 trial, a modification of the guidelines with harmonizing temperature management to normothermia might be necessary.

### Targeted temperature management at 33 ° C versus 36 ° C after cardiac arrest [^dd3f2bdd]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Unconscious survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have a high risk of death or poor neurologic function. Therapeutic hypothermia is recommended by international guidelines, but the supporting evidence is limited, and the target temperature associated with the best outcome is unknown. Our objective was to compare two target temperatures, both intended to prevent fever.

Methods

In an international trial, we randomly assigned 950 unconscious adults after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause to targeted temperature management at either 33°C or 36°C. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality through the end of the trial. Secondary outcomes included a composite of poor neurologic function or death at 180 days, as evaluated with the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale and the modified Rankin scale.

Results

In total, 939 patients were included in the primary analysis. At the end of the trial, 50% of the patients in the 33°C group (235 of 473 patients) had died, as compared with 48% of the patients in the 36°C group (225 of 466 patients) (hazard ratio with a temperature of 33°C, 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89 to 1.28; P = 0.51). At the 180-day follow-up, 54% of the patients in the 33°C group had died or had poor neurologic function according to the CPC, as compared with 52% of patients in the 36°C group (risk ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.16; P = 0.78). In the analysis using the modified Rankin scale, the comparable rate was 52% in both groups (risk ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.14; P = 0.87). The results of analyses adjusted for known prognostic factors were similar.

Conclusions

In unconscious survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause, hypothermia at a targeted temperature of 33°C did not confer a benefit as compared with a targeted temperature of 36°C.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^72e74fdb]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Targeted temperature management (TTM) is often used in neurocritical care to minimize secondary neurologic injury and improve outcomes. TTM encompasses therapeutic hypothermia, controlled normothermia, and treatment of fever. TTM is best supported by evidence from neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, although it has also been explored in ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and intracranial hemorrhage patients. Critical care clinicians using TTM must select appropriate cooling techniques, provide a reasonable rate of cooling, manage shivering, and ensure adequate patient monitoring among other challenges.

Methods

The Neurocritical Care Society recruited experts in neurocritical care, nursing, and pharmacotherapy to form a writing Committee in 2015. The group generated a set of 16 clinical questions relevant to TTM using the PICO format. With the assistance of a research librarian, the Committee undertook a comprehensive literature search with no back date through November 2016 with additional references up to March 2017.

Results

The Committee utilized GRADE methodology to adjudicate the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on their confidence that the estimate of effect approximated the true effect. They generated recommendations regarding the implementation of TTM based on this systematic review only after considering the quality of evidence, relative risks and benefits, patient values and preferences, and resource allocation.

Conclusion

This guideline is intended for neurocritical care clinicians who have chosen to use TTM in patient care; it is not meant to provide guidance regarding the clinical indications for TTM itself. While there are areas of TTM practice where clear evidence guides strong recommendations, many of the recommendations are conditional, and must be contextualized to individual patient and system needs.

### Door-to-targeted temperature management initiation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a new quality metric in postresuscitation care? [^e33cdc13]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The administration of targeted temperature management (TTM) is considered standard of care in the treatment of comatose cardiac arrest survivors, particularly those with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest stemming from a shockable rhythm. 1, 2 Despite the lack of high‐quality evidence, current resuscitation guidelines encourage that TTM also be considered for unresponsive survivors of in‐hospital cardiac arrest or cardiac arrest stemming from a nonshockable rhythm 2 as the intervention appears to provide a net overall benefit. 3 Despite advances in postresuscitative care and routine use of TTM, the prognosis of comatose arrest survivors continues to be dismal. The dominant mechanism of death after a cardiac arrest is related to brain injury arising because of the combination of ischemia during the arrest and ensuing ischemia‐reperfusion injury on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). 4, 5 The remaining deaths after an arrest are a consequence of circulatory collapse in the setting of shock, resulting from initial cardiac dysfunction that is accompanied by a profound vasodilation and multiorgan failure. 4, 5 The observed benefits of TTM in cardiac arrest are mainly attributed to the reduction of brain metabolism and attenuation of the ischemia‐reperfusion cascade, whereas others propose an adjunctive cardioprotective effect. 6

Although a class I recommendation, the optimal TTM prescription for unresponsive arrest survivors remains largely unknown, and current practice predominantly mirrors landmark trial proceedings with minor adaptations. Endovascular and surface cooling remain the most used methods to decrease and maintain core temperature (surface and endovascular) during TTM and have been associated with similar clinical outcomes. Current guidelines discourage the routine infusion of large volumes of ice‐cold solution before hospital admission and immediately after ROSC because of concerns for harm, whereas high‐quality clinical data are lacking for novel methods, such as the cooling helmet and intranasal cooling. 7, 8, 9 Recent trials have established that active cooling is associated with similar outcomes when using temperature targets of 32°C to 36°C, 2, 10 and prolonged duration of cooling appears to confer no additional benefit and is rather associated with higher complication rates and longer intensive care length of stay. 11

### Targeted temperature management and cardiac arrest after the TTM-2 study [^403662ba]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Physicians treating patients resuscitated after OHCA should consider that active maintenance of normothermia (i.e. specific protocol for sedation, prognostication and active temperature control) appears to be the optimal strategy for cardiac arrest of cardiac origin and with early resuscitation. Whether TTM at 33 °C still could be indicated in non-shockable rhythms due to non-cardiac causes remains to be considered. Future studies in in-hospital cardiac arrest are warranted. Abandoning TTM completely is not an option.

### Door-to-targeted temperature management initiation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a new quality metric in postresuscitation care? [^6f537510]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The timing of hypothermia initiation after ROSC has been extensively evaluated. Although animal data suggested an incremental benefit with cooling initiated as early as within 15 minutes from ROSC, human observation studies have reported mixed results. 12 Although some reports suggested that TTM administration in this setting was time sensitive, others failed to identify such an association. 13, 14, 15, 16 The excitement about faster TTM initiation after ROSC was tempered by the negative results of 7 randomized studies comparing prehospital cooling, either during arrest or shortly after, against standard hospital initiation of TTM. 17 The interpretation of these trials was hampered by important design flaws, including small sample sizes, lack of blinding of outcomes assessment, absence of mandated rewarming protocols, and a significant proportion of patients who did not receive the intended treatment. In addition, concerns exist that the prehospital induction with large volumes of ice‐cold solution, as the designated test intervention, might have adverse consequences that confounded the results. 17, 18 Consequently, whether earlier initiation with TTM provides incremental benefit in cardiac arrest survivors remains debatable.

### Personalizing temperature targets after cardiac arrest: our neurologically driven approach [^24d05fea]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Future directions

Our suggested approach reflects a synthesis of evolving evidence and real-world experience. We apply temperature selection in an individualized fashion, using lower targets judiciously for higher-risk patients, supported by multidisciplinary coordination and vigilant monitoring. Our strategy seeks to reduce neurological injury while accounting for practice variability, clinician hesitancy, and current societal recommendations. We commend the scientific rigor and contributions of recent RCTs in temperature control, which have advanced clinical practice and helped us understand key factors in CA management.

As the science of postresuscitation care continues to evolve, it will be important to prioritize studies designed to evaluate temperature control strategies with respect to timing, arrest features, neurological risk stratification, and cooling methods to better inform clinical decision-making. Several ongoing trials are actively investigating some of these questions: ICECAP (Influence of Cooling Duration on Efficacy in Cardiac Arrest Patients; optimal duration of cooling at 33 °C for shockable and nonshockable rhythms), STEPCARE (Sedation, Temperature and Pressure after Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation; optimal temperature, sedation, and blood pressure targets), and PRINCESS 2 (Prehospital Resuscitation Intranasal Cooling Effectiveness Survival Study 2 benefit of ultrafast hypothermia at 33 °C).

Ultimately, we believe that a personalized, neuro-targeted approach to temperature control represents the next frontier in optimizing outcomes for CA survivors.

### Association of time-temperature curves with outcomes in temperature management for cardiac arrest [^10e11cfc]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac arrest is a common cause of death, and in survivors, neurological complications can be devastating. Studies have shown that therapeutic hypothermia improves neurologic outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. More recent data suggests moderate temperature management to a target of 36.0°C results in similar outcomes to targeting 33.0°C. While meta-analyses have debated the salutary effect of targeted temperature management, it has gained wide adoption.

Existing studies have investigated the effect of mild hypothermia compared with controlled euthermia. Despite numerous and ongoing trials on optimal cooling depth, the concept of temperature dose — the duration at a given depth of hypothermia — is not as well explored. While there has been some investigation into prolonged cooling beyond 24 hours, the focus has generally been on the effect at a fixed temperature, not the relative impact of different phases of cooling. In this retrospective study, we analysed 66 patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia between 2007 and 2010 for cardiac arrest to determine the impact of temperature dose on outcomes.

### Temperature control after cardiac arrest… [^8147c0c9]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Because more than 380 000 individuals each year in the US experience an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, neuroprotection to reduce morbidity and mortality following OHCA is a priority. Despite decades of preclinical and clinical research culminating in large, international randomized clinical trials, the target population, logistics of administration, and efficacy of temperature control remain in question. Although existing evidence suggests that moderate hypothermic temperature control is not effective in improving neurologic outcomes for all comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, there may be a population that does benefit from hypothermic temperature control. While efforts to identify this population are ongoing, aggressive fever prevention should be the current goal for most survivors of cardiac arrest, and rapid rewarming of patients with mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest should be avoided.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^4e461448]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) — duration versus goal-directed therapy — was evaluated across out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). In OHCA, both OHCA studies showed improved neurologic outcomes, and in severe TBI, TTM for five days as opposed to two days resulted in significantly improved functional outcomes. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of neonates with HIE randomized to 72 or 120 h of TTM at either 33.5 or 32.0 °C was stopped owing to safety concerns with longer or deeper hypothermia. We suggest at least 24 h of cooling in OHCA patients (Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest longer duration TTM for severe TBI patients should ICP control be the goal (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We advise against longer (> 72 h) or deeper (< 32.0 °C) hypothermia in neonates with HIE (Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### High quality targeted temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest [^d0b4cc6d]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-anoxic brain damage is the most dramatic complication of cardiac arrest. In international guidelines, targeted temperature management (TTM) is the only neuroprotective intervention currently recommended after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Nevertheless, the scientific community has raised concerns about the level of evidence supporting this recommendation. Two early randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showed that TTM at 33 °C for 12–24 h was associated with a greater proportion of survivors with intact neurological recovery compared to standard care in OHCA survivors with witnessed shockable rhythm, but subsequent observational studies questioned the efficacy of this intervention in other settings, such as non-shockable rhythms and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). After publication of the so-called "TTM trial" in 2013, which showed similar survival and neurological recovery rates in OHCA patients treated at 33 °C or at 36 °C for 24 h, the use of TTM decreased significantly as many physicians considered that keeping patient body temperature within normothermic ranges (i.e. at about 37 °C) would likely be as effective as using TTM at 36 °C, without the adverse events related to cooling procedures, including use of sedative drugs.

### Temporal trends in the use of targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest and association with outcome: insights from the paris sudden death expertise centre [^6934d60f]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Using a large regional registry of cardiac arrest, we report a progressive decrease in the use of TTM in post-cardiac arrest patients over the recent years. In parallel, we observed that the activation of early resuscitation improved over time as reflected by an increase in the proportion of patients who received bystander-initiated resuscitation and a shorter "no flow". Despite these improvements in early management, there was no significant change in neurological outcome over the study period. Further research is required to explore the consequence of this decrease in the use of TTM.

### Targeted temperature management and cardiac arrest after the TTM-2 study [^d5b59876]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

A fourth interpretation could be the large inclusion of patients with extreme patterns of brain injury, in whom TTM would provide only minimal benefits. The TTM-2 study required randomization within 3 h from return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) to avoid late application of hypothermia, so that patients with mild brain damage were also included. Also, patients with irreversible brain injury and no chance of recovery regardless of different therapeutic interventions might also be enrolled. Future studies are needed to identify prognostic tools able to quantify earlier the severity of hypoxic brain injury and to identify those patients in whom neuroprotective strategies, including TTM, should be evaluated.

How should we use then TTM after cardiac arrest? Clinicians should consider that the "normothermic" arm (i.e. aiming for a temperature below 37.8 °C) in the TTM-2 study required use of sedation for 40 h in all patients and active temperature management (i.e. cooling devices with temperature-feedback control; relatively slow rewarming and avoidance of fever for 72 h) in almost 50% of them. As such, abandoning any temperature control protocol in cardiac arrest patients is not acceptable. After the publication of the TTM study in 2013, observational studies have already indicated that changes temperature targets to 36 °C were associated with a less accurate TTM delivery and worse outcomes when compared to 33 °C target. Temperature control after CA remains a complex and time-consuming intervention, which, if inadequately applied (i.e. no sedation, no active temperature and fever control) might result in unpredictable temperature trajectories and in a less precise patients' management, with deleterious effects on neurological outcome. Interestingly, none of these randomized studies could provide a "high quality" TTM, because of human and technical constraints which could alter speed of cooling, reduce the accuracy of temperature control, shorten the rewarming period or expose patients to prolonged post-TTM fever. Although high-quality TTM was not an independent predictor of favorable neurological outcome in a recent study, additional research is required to understand how high-quality TTM could influence the results observed in large randomized trials.

### Door-to-targeted temperature management initiation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a new quality metric in postresuscitation care? [^abebe505]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The report by Stanger et al 19 in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) offers relevant evidence to the ongoing debate about the ideal timing of TTM initiation. Using data collected in British Columbia, Canada, from the CCC (Trial of Continuous or Interrupted Chest Compression During cardiopulmonary resuscitation), the investigators conducted a post hoc analysis evaluating the association between the time from hospital admission to TTM initiation (namely, door‐to‐TTM time [DTT]) and survival with favorable neurological outcome.

A total of 570 patients from the 3805 patients who experienced out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest met inclusion criteria. Enrollment was restricted to those surviving to hospital admission and undergoing TTM. The cohort was mainly composed of middle‐aged men presenting with a shockable rhythm. Patients underwent TTM using surface cooling (99.7%) and were dichotomized into those with DTT shorter than (early DTT) or longer than (delayed DTT) the median DTT of 122 minutes. The early DTT group exhibited a median DTT of 35 minutes (interquartile range, 20–81 minutes), whereas the delayed group had a median DTT of 218 minutes (interquartile range, 167–319 minutes). The early DTT group was a slightly less sick cohort given the marginally higher proportion of shockable rhythm, witnessed arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation by bystander with slightly shorter time to ROSC, and associated higher pH on admission. After adjustment for age, sex, initial rhythm, witnessed status, location of arrest, and time to ROSC, early DTT was associated with higher survival to hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.02–2.38), although it was not associated with good neurological outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.94–2.22); this was a likely function of power rather than treatment effect. When restricting analysis to those with shockable rhythm, early DTT was independently associated with higher rates of both survival (adjusted odds ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.1–3.0) and favorable neurological outcomes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.09–2.95). On the basis of these findings, the authors hypothesized that an expedited initiation of in‐hospital TTM, specifically in those presenting with shockable rhythm, would translate into better survival and neurological outcomes at hospital discharge.

### Association of initial illness severity and outcomes after cardiac arrest with targeted temperature management at 36 ° C or 33 ° C [^1106136f]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

It is uncertain what the optimal target temperature is for targeted temperature management (TTM) in patients who are comatose following cardiac arrest.

Objective

To examine whether illness severity is associated with changes in the association between target temperature and patient outcome.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study compared outcomes for 1319 patients who were comatose after cardiac arrest at a single center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from January 2010 to December 2018. Initial illness severity was based on coma and organ failure scores, presence of severe cerebral edema, and presence of highly malignant electroencephalogram (EEG) after resuscitation.

Exposure

TTM at 36 °C or 33 °C.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge, and secondary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale and cerebral performance category.

Results

Among 1319 patients, 728 (55.2%) had TTM at 33 °C (451 [62.0%] men; median [interquartile range] age, 61 [50–72] years) and 591 (44.8%) had TTM at 36 °C (353 [59.7%] men; median [interquartile range] age, 59 [48–69] years). Overall, 184 of 187 patients (98.4%) with severe cerebral edema died and 234 of 243 patients (96.3%) with highly malignant EEG died regardless of TTM strategy. Comparing TTM at 33 °C with TTM at 36 °C in 911 patients (69.1%) with neither severe cerebral edema nor highly malignant EEG, survival was lower in patients with mild to moderate coma and no shock (risk difference, -13.8%; 95% CI, -24.4% to -3.2%) but higher in patients with mild to moderate coma and cardiopulmonary failure (risk difference, 21.8%; 95% CI, 5.4% to 38.2%) or with severe coma (risk difference, 9.7%; 95% CI, 4.0% to 15.3%). Interactions were similar for functional outcomes. Most deaths (633 of 968 [65.4%]) resulted after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, TTM at 33 °C was associated with better survival than TTM at 36 °C among patients with the most severe post-cardiac arrest illness but without severe cerebral edema or malignant EEG. However, TTM at 36 °C was associated with better survival among patients with mild- to moderate-severity illness.

### Targeted temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: certainties and uncertainties [^41c67f7d]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The results of the TTM trial were unequivocal, demonstrating no difference in survival or the secondary outcome of combined survival and neurological outcome. An important design feature of the TTM trial, distinguishing it from earlier trials, was the approach to prognostication and withdrawal of care in patients remaining unconscious. Prognostication was delayed for 108 hours (unless specific withdrawal criteria were met) and performed by a clinician who was blinded to the intervention and who then recommended withdrawal, continuation, or no further escalation of care.

The robust design of the TTM trial has been recognized by a number of commentators, including an author of one of the landmark trials. However, others have questioned the validity of the study, raising concerns over the rate of rewarming, temperature separation and swings, and recruitment rates. It has been argued that the rate of rewarming was rapid, abrogating the benefits of cooling to 33°C. The optimal rate of rewarming remains unknown but was undertaken at a maximum speed of 0.5°C per hour in keeping with current guidelines. The actual rewarming rate in the TTM trial was 0.36 ± 0.13°C per hour, which seems comparable to the rate in the Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest trial, and the two temperature arms were clearly well controlled and separated (Figure 1). The TTM trial aimed to reflect current clinical practice, including as large a population as possible to make the results applicable to use by clinicians. On the basis of registries, 80% of patients meeting inclusion criteria in the TTM trial would be eligible for random assignment after exclusion criteria were considered. The 66% screening to inclusion (and 76% random assignment of patients meeting inclusion criteria) represents a considerable effort by participating sites. Although the study ran more than 26 months, it was not until 9 months that 50% of sites were open to recruitment. The median number of patients randomly assigned per site was 21, and sites above the median recruited 80% of all patients.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^8d60d59f]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Targeted temperature management rationale — In patients with coma after cardiac arrest, TTM may improve neurological recovery and is not associated with an increased incidence of complications, with evidence from two trials demonstrating improved survival and neurological recovery with TTM of 32°C to 34°C in OHCA with VF/VT; a subsequent randomized control trial compared 36°C vs 33°C and found survival and neurological recovery were not superior with 33°C vs 36°C. Based on this evidence and a low rate of adverse events, a TTM strategy targeting temperatures between 32°C to 36°C is selected for this performance measure. It has been argued that there are no patients in whom TTM between 32°C to 36°C is contraindicated; therefore, if an OHCA patient with VF or VT is deemed ineligible to receive TTM, the reason for ineligibility must be documented to comply with this performance measure.

Rationale

International guidelines recommend use of targeted temperature management following resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This treatment, however, is often neglected or delayed.

Objective

To determine whether multifaceted quality improvement interventions would increase the proportion of eligible patients receiving successful targeted temperature management.

Setting

A network of 6 regional emergency medical services systems and 32 academic and community hospitals serving a population of 8.8 million people providing post arrest care to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Interventions

Comparing interventions improve the implementation of targeted temperature management post out-of-hospital cardiac arrest through passive (education, generic protocol, order set, local champions) versus additional active quality improvement interventions (nurse specialist providing site-specific interventions, monthly audit-feedback, network educational events, internet blog) versus no intervention (baseline standard of care).

Measurements and Main Results

The primary process outcome was proportion of eligible patients receiving successful targeted temperature management, defined as a target temperature of 32–34ºC within 6 hours of emergency department arrival. Secondary clinical outcomes included survival and neurological outcome at hospital discharge. Four thousand three hundred seventeen out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were transported to hospital; 1,737 (40%) achieved spontaneous circulation, and 934 (22%) were eligible for targeted temperature management. After accounting for secular trends, patients admitted during the passive quality improvement phase were more likely to achieve successful targeted temperature management compared with those admitted during the baseline period (25.7% passive vs 9.0% baseline; odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.76–4.32; p < 0.001). Active quality improvement interventions conferred no additional improvements in rates of successful targeted temperature management (26.9% active vs 25.7% passive; odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.63–1.45; p = 0.84). Despite a significant increase in rates of successful targeted temperature management, survival to hospital discharge was unchanged.

Conclusion

Simple quality improvement interventions significantly increased the rates of achieving successful targeted temperature management following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a large network of hospitals but did not improve clinical outcomes.

### Relationship between time to target temperature and outcome in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest [^9c0994a9]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- In cardiac arrest managed with therapeutic hypothermia after resuscitation, reaching the 34°C target faster retrospectively predicts a poor neurologic outcome.

- A faster decline in body temperature may indicate a more severe ischemic insult with impaired thermoregulation and thus predicts a worse outcome.

- Prospective studies should address whether this finding is simply a marker for a more severe insult or whether controlling the rate of cooling can favorably alter outcome.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) and infection risk — One randomized controlled trial (RCT) of pneumonia in post-arrest patients found no significant difference between hypothermic patients and normothermic controls, and a separate RCT comparing hypothermia to relative normothermia found the same. A retrospective cohort study of cardiac arrest patients found that TTM is an independent risk factor for early onset pneumonia, although the retrospective nature and possible selection bias of TTM make the results difficult to interpret. One other RCT of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients found a greater incidence of pneumonia and meningitis although there were serious risks of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, and indirectness.

Post-cardiac arrest temperature control (targeted temperature management [TTM]) — in adults with sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who remain unconscious: Meta-analysis of data from six trials evaluating hypothermia at 32° C to 34° C for 12 to 24 hours did not show a statistically significant improvement when compared with normothermia for outcomes of survival or favorable neurological outcome, and meta-analyses of other temperature targets (33° C versus 36° C, and 33° C versus 34° C) did not show a difference in outcomes. Recommendations by ILCOR in 2021 emphasized the need to actively prevent fever and maintain normothermia for cardiac arrest patients with ROSC and persistent unconsciousness, while hypothermic temperature control may be considered for certain subpopulations based on the clinical situation.

### Functional outcomes associated with varying levels of targeted temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest-an INTCAR2 registry analysis [^ff0aa373]. Resuscitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Targeted temperature management (TTM) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has been recommended in international guidelines since 2005. The TTM-trial published in 2013 showed no difference in survival or neurological outcome for patients randomised to 33 °C or 36 °C, and many hospitals have changed practice. The optimal utilization of TTM is still debated. This study aimed to analyse if a difference in temperature goal was associated with outcome in an unselected international registry population.

Methods

This is a retrospective observational study based on a prospective registry - the International Cardiac Arrest Registry 2. Patients were categorized as receiving TTM in the lower range at 32–34 °C (TTM-low) or at 35–37 °C (TTM-high). Primary outcome was good functional status defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) of 1–2 at hospital discharge and secondary outcome was adverse events related to TTM. A logistic regression model was created to evaluate the independent effect of temperature by correcting for clinical and demographic factors associated with outcome.

Results

Of 1710 patients included, 1242 (72,6%) received TTM-low and 468 (27,4%) TTM-high. In patients receiving TTM-low, 31.3% survived with good outcome compared to 28.8% in the TTM-high group. There was no significant association between temperature and outcome (p = 0.352). In analyses adjusted for baseline differences the OR for a good outcome with TTM-low was 1.27, 95% CI (0.94–1.73). Haemodynamic instability leading to discontinuation of TTM was more common in TTM-low.

Conclusions

No significant difference in functional outcome at hospital discharge was found in patients receiving lower- versus higher targeted temperature management.

### Pediatric advanced life support. post-cardiac arrest care [^e0c09aec]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric post–cardiac arrest temperature management — infants and children who remain comatose after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC): A weak recommendation based on two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight observational studies suggests targeted temperature management (TTM) be used to maintain a central temperature of 37.5° C (99.5° F) or less; evidence was inconclusive to support or refute TTM at 32° C to 34° C compared with 36° C to 37.5° C or an alternative temperature; a 2021 evidence update identified eight new studies with secondary analyses reporting no difference between treatment groups of 32° C to 34° and 36° C to 37.5° C for multiple subgroups; one retrospective cohort study found no difference in survival with induced hypothermia to less than 35° C versus normothermia (36° C to 37.5° C) but improved quality of life measures; and ILCOR recommendations remain unchanged except for wording from "targeted temperature management" to "active control of temperature".

### Personalizing temperature targets after cardiac arrest: our neurologically driven approach [^e6ffb336]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurs in more than 300,000 people annually and remains a critical public health concern. Despite substantial advancements in life-saving measures for victims of cardiac arrest (CA), much work remains to improve survival and recovery. CA prognosis fundamentally depends on restoration of circulation and thereafter may be impacted by ischemic-hypoxic brain and reperfusion injury after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). This relationship underscores the need for prompt, effective interventions during post-CA care to improve neurologically meaningful recovery.

After promising findings from earlier, smaller trials demonstrating benefits of cooling OHCA patients with shockable rhythms using a temperature target of 32–34 °C, a number of large-scale, well-designed trials, with expanded inclusion criteria and protocolized neuroprognostication, set the stage for the current society guidelines to evolve from recommending cooling in a practice initially called "therapeutic hypothermia (TH)" to active targeted temperature management (TTM).TH has been replaced by TTM, which involves selecting a target temperature postarrest, ranging from 32 °C to 36 °C (hypothermia), 37 °C (normothermia), or < 37.5 °C (fever prevention). To distinguish TTM targeting mild hypothermia, we use the term "TTM-HT", and reserve "TTM-NT" for normothermia or fever prevention.

Evidence suggests temperature control and pyrexia prevention help limit more severe brain injury. However, variability in trial results and interpretation has led to misconceptions regarding when to target lower temperatures vs fever prevention. This uncertainty arises from differences in patient populations, CA phenotypes, neurological injury severity, cooling techniques/timing, and resuscitation approaches, leading to disparate risk. Protocol inconsistencies, physician biases, and technical limitations further contribute to practice variability. This ambiguity may have discouraged aggressive use of temperature control when appropriate.

### Target temperature management following cardiac arrest: a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis [^9e821b70]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Temperature control with target temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest has been endorsed by expert societies and adopted in international clinical practice guidelines based on several randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The original studies and systematic reviews have exclusively used frequentist methods for statistical inference. A growing body of literature is instead using Bayesian statistics to interpret the results of clinical trials, i.e. the likelihood, in the context of already existing beliefs on treatment effects, i.e. the prior, that when combined generate a posterior distribution of probabilities for the effect size. This brings the trial effect estimates beyond the dichotomous outcome as being significant or non-significant based on a p value of 0.05 in frequentist hypothesis testing and instead attributes probabilities to effect sizes contained in the 95% credible interval. Bayesian analyses have been proposed to supplement interpretations of clinical trials in critical care, to inform clinical practice guidelines in cardiology and the US Food and Drug Administration has issued guidelines for their use in clinical trials of medical devices.

The recently published trial by Dankiewicz et al. the largest study performed to date on the use of TTM in post-cardiac arrest care, compared the institution of TTM at 33–34 °C for 24 h with active measures to maintain normothermia (< 37.5 °C) if the body temperature increased above 37.8 °C. The study was powered to detect an absolute risk reduction for death by 7.5% by frequentist inference and did not observe any benefit of hypothermic TTM on all-cause mortality or poor functional recovery. The aim of this review and Bayesian meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of TTM on survival and neurological outcome compared to no TTM or avoiding pyrexia in the care of adult, comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. The null hypothesis of no difference between patients treated with TTM at 32–34 °C or TTM ≥ 36 °C was compared to the alternative hypothesis that hypothermic TTM confers a benefit using a range of data-informed priors to reflect optimism, pessimism or equipoise regarding the effect of TTM. By using Bayesian statistical inference, the posterior probabilities attributed to the absence of any benefit could be compared to a range of treatment effects, including ones smaller than targeted in the original studies.

### Temperature control after cardiac arrest [^94f4504f]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

To address the potential limitations of the two 2002 clinical trials, the Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) trial investigators randomized 950 unconscious adults after OHCA from cardiac cause and any initial rhythm to temperature control at 33 °C compared with a target of 36 °C for 24 h, followed by slow rewarming at 0.5 °C/h. There was no difference in all-cause mortality (the primary outcome) or 6-month functional outcome. Following this trial, many clinicians aimed for a target temperature of 36 °C in post-cardiac arrest patients, while others continued to aim for 33 °C. Some clinicians abandoned the use of temperature control completely. Analyses of large ICU registries in Australia and New Zealand and in the United Kingdom documented an increase in the lowest temperature of post-cardiac arrest patents in the first 24 h in ICU since publication of the TTM trial. This was associated with an increase in the frequency of fever in the first 24 h. The lowest temperature in the first 24 h was evaluated because this is collected routinely for sickness severity scoring and case mix adjustment. Although the unadjusted mortality rate was higher in the post-TTM period, analyses that removed all temperature-affected variables showed no difference in the adjusted mortality rate between pre- and post-TTM periods. If any of the components of a risk-adjustment model are affected by a treatment intervention — in this case temperature — it invalidates the risk calculation. In these studies, the changes in risk-adjusted mortality mirrored the changes in temperature. It is possible that the decreasing temperatures before publication of the TTM trial were interpreted by the risk models as increasing risk of death and the increasing temperature after publication of the TTM trial interpreted as a decrease in risk of death.

### Temporal trends in the use of therapeutic hypothermia for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^16abf107]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Despite evidence that therapeutic hypothermia improves patient outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, use of this therapy remains low.

Objective

To determine whether the use of therapeutic hypothermia and patient outcomes have changed after publication of the Targeted Temperature Management trial on December 5, 2013, which supported more lenient temperature management for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort was conducted between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016, of 45 935 US patients in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and survived to hospital admission.

Exposures

Calendar time by quarter year.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Use of therapeutic hypothermia and patient survival to hospital discharge.

Results

Among 45 935 patients (17 515 women and 28 420 men; mean [SD] age, 59.3 [18.3] years) who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and survived to admission at 649 US hospitals, overall use of therapeutic hypothermia during the study period was 46.4%. In unadjusted analyses, the use of therapeutic hypothermia dropped from 52.5% in the last quarter of 2013 to 46.0% in the first quarter of 2014 after the December 2013 publication of the Targeted Temperature Management trial. Use of therapeutic hypothermia remained at or below 46.5% through 2016. In segmented hierarchical logistic regression analysis, the risk-adjusted odds of use of therapeutic hypothermia was 18% lower in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the last quarter of 2013 (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71–0.94; P = 0.006). Similar point-estimate changes over time were observed in analyses stratified by presenting rhythm of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.71–1.13, P = 0.35) and pulseless electrical activity or asystole (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63–0.89; P = 0.001). Overall risk-adjusted patient survival was 36.9% in 2013, 37.5% in 2014, 34.8% in 2015, and 34.3% in 2016 (P < .001 for trend). In mediation analysis, temporal trends in use of hypothermia did not consistently explain trends in patient survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

In a US registry of patients who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the use of guideline-recommended therapeutic hypothermia decreased after publication of the Targeted Temperature Management trial, which supported more lenient temperature thresholds. Concurrent with this change, survival among patients admitted to the hospital decreased, but was not mediated by use of hypothermia.

### Temporal trends in the use of targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest and association with outcome: insights from the paris sudden death expertise centre [^12bb1ca7]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the last decades, implementation of the "chain of survival" led to a progressive improvement in outcome after cardiac arrest (CA) in many places across the world. In addition to pre-hospital management, post-cardiac arrest care is now considered as a major determinant of outcome. Among the interventions that can be provided during the post-resuscitation period, recent data raised some concerns regarding the benefit of targeted temperature management (TTM) for comatose CA survivors. Even if TTM is strongly recommended in out-of-hospital CA provoked by a ventricular arrhythmia, its effectiveness has been seriously challenged in several other situations, such as in non-shockable and in-hospital CA patients. Additionally, the TTM trial that showed no difference between 33 and 36° may have been falsely considered by some clinicians as a negative study regarding the effectiveness of TTM. On the whole, this may have resulted in a change in TTM modalities in post-cardiac patients, as reported by several investigators. In a recent survey, Deye et al. observed that 37% of responders changed their attitude regarding TTM over the recent years, many of them moving from 33 °C toward a higher temperature level.

Possible consequences of these changes on patients' outcome are unclear. After moving from a TTM target of 33 to 36 °C, Bray et al. reported low compliance with target temperature, higher rates of fever, and a trend toward clinical worsening in patient outcomes. In a recent retrospective study performed in Australia and New Zealand, similar changes in clinicians' attitude regarding target temperature after CA, which occurred in up to one third of ICU, were associated with an increased proportion of patients with fever. In the USA, where this treatment was historically less employed as compared with European countries, TTM use was shown to further decrease in many centers, as revealed by recent administrative data. In parallel, Khera et al. found that TTM use dropped in all subgroups of CA survivors (both shockable and non-shockable). On the whole, these uncertainties prompted to perform new large randomized trials testing this treatment in CA patients. The recently released HYPERION study showed an improvement in long-term neurological prognosis with TTM at 33° as compared to normothermia for CA patients with non-shockable rhythm, and the TTM2 trial comparing TTM at 33° versus fever control is actually ongoing.

### Temporal trends in the use of therapeutic hypothermia for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^6837fb21]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Therapeutic hypothermia is a guideline-recommended therapy for patients who remain comatose after resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. These recommendations are based largely on 2 randomized trials that demonstrated survival benefit with therapeutic hypothermia to a target temperature of 32°C to 34°C. However, debate remains as to whether these findings reflect the benefit of hypothermia or the harm of fever in the control group of prior studies.

A third trial was published in December 2013 that investigated the effect of 2 different temperature goals, both intended to avoid fever, on patient outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Active measures (eg, surface cooling, ice packs, intravascular catheters) were used in both treatment groups to achieve temperature goals. This Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) trial observed similar outcomes among patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia to a target temperature of 36°C as compared with a target temperature of 33°C. These findings suggest that a more lenient temperature threshold for therapeutic hypothermia is reasonable in the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

It is unknown how the findings of the TTM trial have been applied in routine clinical practice. Given the trial's emphasis on the use of hypothermia for fever avoidance, use of therapeutic hypothermia in clinical practice may be declining in favor of other untested approaches to fever avoidance in the management of out-of-hospital arrest (ie, administration of acetaminophen). Alternatively, the more lenient temperature goals supported by the TTM trial may have encouraged greater use of therapeutic hypothermia in clinical practice. Finally, the implications on patient outcomes in real-world practice have not been explored, to our knowledge.

To address this gap in knowledge, we examined temporal trends in the use of therapeutic hypothermia among patients who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and survived to hospital admission in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES). Given that the epidemiologic characteristics of presenting cardiac arrest rhythm have changed over time, with a decline in cardiac arrests with ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), and clinical trial evidence supporting therapeutic hypothermia is strongest for cardiac arrest with VT or VF, we evaluated overall trends in use of therapeutic hypothermia and also conducted stratified analyses on presenting arrest rhythm. Finally, we explored the association between patient-level and hospital-level trends in the use of therapeutic hypothermia and risk-adjusted patient survival. Understanding trends in the use of therapeutic hypothermia and associated patient outcomes may inform future strategies to achieve optimal use of this guideline-recommended therapy.

### Advanced life support. post-cardiac arrest care [^1838c6c1]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support — post–cardiac arrest care considerations clarify scope and context: The recommendation does not cover situations where antibiotics are used for confirmed or suspected infections; both included RCTs enrolled only out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who were treated with targeted temperature management (32° C to 35° C [89.6° F to 95° F]); pneumonia occurs in about 50% of intensive care unit patients after cardiac arrest but is unlikely to contribute to mortality, and the incidence would mean using prophylactic antibiotics in large numbers of patients without specific benefit.

### Temperature control after cardiac arrest [^76b740cc]. Resuscitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Managing temperature is an important part of post-cardiac arrest care. Fever or hyperthermia during the first few days after cardiac arrest is associated with worse outcomes in many studies. Clinical data have not determined any target temperature or duration of temperature management that clearly improves patient outcomes. Current guidelines and recent reviews recommend controlling temperature to prevent hyperthermia. Higher temperatures can lead to secondary brain injury by increasing seizures, brain edema and metabolic demand. Some data suggest that targeting temperature below normal could benefit select patients where this pathology is common. Clinical temperature management should address the physiology of heat balance. Core temperature reflects the heat content of the head and torso, and changes in core temperature result from changes in the balance of heat production and heat loss. Clinical management of patients after cardiac arrest should include measurement of core temperature at accurate sites and monitoring signs of heat production including shivering. Multiple methods can increase or decrease heat loss, including external and internal devices. Heat loss can trigger compensatory reflexes that increase stress and metabolic demand. Therefore, any active temperature management should include specific pharmacotherapy or other interventions to control thermogenesis, especially shivering. More research is required to determine whether individualized temperature management can improve outcomes.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to post-resuscitation care, temperature control, targeted management, ERC/ESICM 2022 guidelines recommend to maintain temperature control by exposing the patient, administering antipyretic agents, or if this is insufficient, using a cooling device with a target temperature of 37.5 °C.

### Atrial fibrillation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and targeted temperature management-are we giving It the attention it deserves? [^32bd184d]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Atrial fibrillation has been associated with increased mortality in the general population and mixed populations of critical ill. Atrial fibrillation can also affect patients during post-cardiac arrest care. We sought to assess the prognostic implications of atrial fibrillation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, including relation to the level of targeted temperature management.

Design

A post hoc analysis of a prospective randomized trial.

Setting

Thirty-six ICUs.

Patients

We included 897 (96%) of the 939 comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors from the targeted temperature management trial (year, 2010–2013) with data on heart rhythm on day 2.

Interventions

Targeted temperature management at 33°C or 36°C.

Measurements and Main Results

Endpoints included cumulative proportion of atrial fibrillation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and 180-day all-cause mortality and specific death causes stratified by atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation on day 2 was used as primary endpoint analyses to exclude effects of short-term atrial fibrillation related to resuscitation and initial management. The cumulative proportions of atrial fibrillation were 15% and 11% on days 1 and 2, respectively. Forty-three percent of patients with initial atrial fibrillation the first day were reported with sinus rhythm on day 2. No difference was found between the groups treated with targeted temperature management at 33°C and 36°C. Patients affected by atrial fibrillation had significantly higher 180-day mortality (atrial fibrillation: 66% vs no-atrial fibrillation: 43%; plogrank < 0.0001 and unadjusted hazard ratio, 1.75 [1.35–2.30]; p < 0.0001). The association between atrial fibrillation and higher mortality remained significant (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34 [1.01–1.79]; p < 0.05) adjusted for potential confounders. Atrial fibrillation was independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death and multiple-organ failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.07 [1.39–3.09]; p < 0.001), whereas no association with higher risk of death from cerebral causes was found.

Conclusions

Atrial fibrillation was independently associated with higher mortality, primarily driven by cardiovascular causes and multiple-organ failure, and may thus identify a vulnerable subpopulation. Whether treatment to prevent atrial fibrillation is associated with an improved prognosis remains to be established.

### Comparison of hypothermic and normothermic targeted temperature management in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with acute coronary syndrome: a nationwide retrospective study [^216ccf68]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of findings

Using the nationwide prospective JAAM-OHCA registry in Japan, we evaluated the impact of TTM on adult patients who experienced OHCA due to ACS. Approximately 70% of the patients in both groups showed ST segment elevation, and about half received ECMO. We found no significant differences in 30-day favorable neurological outcomes, 30-day survival, and adverse event incidence between hypothermic TTM and normothermic TTM. Additionally, sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results, further reinforcing our overall conclusion.

Comparison to previous studies and strength

Three large-scale RCTs have examined the differential effects of hypothermic temperature management versus other targeted temperatures during TTM on post-cardiac arrest treatment. The TTM trials one and two did not demonstrate a benefit for any specific targeted temperature, and as a result, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) does not specify any target temperature during post-cardiac arrest treatment. However, the Hyperion trial, which focused on patients with nonshockable rhythms, demonstrated the benefits of MTH. Based on these results, ILCOR has identified the need for further research to discover subgroups that could benefit from MTH. Conversely, the SHOCK-COOL trial, a small RCT that excluded post-cardiac arrest patients and investigated the effects of MTH in patients with ACS complicated by cardiogenic shock, showed no significant differences in cardiac power index, other hemodynamic parameters, and 30-day mortality between patients randomized to mild therapeutic hypothermia and control. Regarding previous observational studies with OHCA patients with varying degrees of circulatory compromise during TTM, post-hoc analyses of the TTM1 and TTM2 trials observed no significant differences in favorable outcomes. In TTM1, all arrests were presumed to be of cardiac etiology, with about 40% of patients having ST elevation, while in TTM2, 90% of arrests were presumed to be of cardiac etiology and about half of the patients had AMI. These findings align with our results.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^1932f971]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) — bleeding risk and coagulation monitoring: Temperatures "below 35 °C are known to affect the coagulation cascade as well as platelet function", and "a small RCT… found no influence on results within a range of 33–37 °C". In cardiac arrest, "Two meta-analyses… demonstrated higher rates of thrombocytopenia and subsequent transfusion of blood products without a difference in the rate of bleeding". In traumatic brain injury, "none of the multicentered RCTs demonstrated a significant increase in the rate of systemic or CNS bleeding in patients treated with hypothermia", and in ischemic stroke "several single-center non-randomized trials did not demonstrate an increased risk of bleeding", while the Stroke 2 RCT "did not demonstrate a higher rate of bleeding". The guideline notes, "None of these studies demonstrated a higher rate of mortality due to hemorrhagic complications", and "there was insufficient evidence available to make recommendations regarding the risk of bleeding and various cooling modalities". Recommendations are: "We strongly recommend no change in routine care with respect to monitoring for bleeding and preventing thrombosis in TTM (Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)" and "We suggest that thromboelastometry may be helpful in measuring coagulation and platelet aggregation in TTM patients (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence)".

### High quality targeted temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest [^315538a5]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Duration of the cooling phase

The cooling phase should last at least 24 h. A RCT showed no difference in neurological outcomes between TTM at 33 °C for 24 or 48 h, although the longer duration was associated with a 5% improvement in favorable long-term neurological outcome. Considering the promising results from prolonged (i.e. 72 h) cooling in newborns and the absence of increased complications from TTM given over 48 h, no data support the use of short duration TTM in adult cardiac arrest victims, which should be then avoided.

Duration of the rewarming phase

The rewarming rate should be slow (0.15–0.25 °C/h) and controlled using specific TTM devices, rather than spontaneous, which may result in unpredictable rewarming speeds. Recent small and highly biased studies have suggested that a slow and controlled rewarming rate is feasible and may be associated with better long-term neurological outcomes. Finally, because many studies have suggested a detrimental effect of post-TTM fever on outcome, careful control of body temperature for at least 48 h following the end of rewarming is mandatory; this strategy could be titrated to patient condition (i.e. shorter if immediate awakening or prolonged in case of signs of moderate to severe cerebral insult).

To briefly summarize the available data, targeted hypothermia at 32 °C to 34 °C does not improve survival after OHCA compared with targeted normothermia. An additional benefit of target temperatures < 36 °C, however, is unlikely when temperature management is initiated after hospital admission. Intravascular temperature management using large‐volume fluid delivery during/after CA in the field can be harmful and jeopardize resuscitation efforts. The positive effects of temperature management on neuroprotection are possibly mainly achieved by preventing hyperthermia. However, sufficient randomized data on fever prevention versus targeted normothermia and temperature management after targeted hypothermia/normothermia in the acute phase are not available yet, and further trials are urgently needed.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^dfb52651]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) definitions and scope — TTM encompasses therapeutic hypothermia (TH), controlled normothermia, and treatment of fever; TH is the controlled and intentional reduction of core body temperature to 32.0–35.9 °C, and "Undershoot" refers to temperature higher than goal temperature/not achieving goal temperature. TTM is often used in neurocritical care to minimize secondary neurologic injury and improve outcomes and is best supported by evidence from neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), although it has also been explored in ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and intracranial hemorrhage patients. This guideline is intended for neurocritical care clinicians who have chosen to use TTM and is not meant to provide guidance regarding clinical indications, and the use of TTM in the operative setting was not reviewed.

### Impact of rewarming rate on interleukin-6 levels in patients with shockable cardiac arrest receiving targeted temperature management at 33 ° C: the ISOCRATE pilot randomized controlled trial [^40aed174]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this single-center RCT, a slow rewarming rate of 0.25 °C/h after hypothermia at 33 °C in patients who were comatose after shockable OHCA did not significantly decrease serum IL6 levels compared to rewarming at 0.5 °C. The rewarming rate was not associated with significant differences in NF-L levels at H48 or functional outcome on day 90.

Whereas several RCTs have evaluated the role for TTM in patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest, none focused on the rewarming rate. Observational data are conflicting. An ancillary analysis of data from a multicenter prospective cohort study found a significant association between very slow rewarming at a median of 0.045 °C/h from 34 to 36 °C and a CPC of 1 or 2 at hospital discharge. In a retrospective study of 71 patients who received TTM with a target of 34 °C or lower after OHCA, the CPC score at 1 month was not significantly different between the groups rewarmed at 0.15 °C/h versus 0.25 °C/h. Another retrospective cohort study found no significant difference in the Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 6 months between the groups with rewarming rates < 0.5 °C/h or ≥ 0.5 °C/h. Differences in case-mix and in care delivered during TTM, together with residual confounding, complicate the interpretation of these results. This probably explains why the 2021 update of guidelines for cardiac arrest make no recommendations about the rewarming rate.

Our primary outcome was a surrogate, i.e. serum IL6 levels. Current guidelines recommend day-90 functional outcome determined by blinded assessors as the primary outcome for trials of TTM after cardiac arrest. However, given the paucity of data on rewarming rates, for this pilot trial, we chose a primary outcome that required a far smaller sample size, to help in designing a future RCT with day-90 functional status as the primary outcome. Higher IL6 values have been reported to be associated with higher mortality, worse PCAS, and CPC of 3–5 at 12 months. In a clinical RCT of patients with OHCA, the IL6-receptor antagonist tocilizumab decreased systemic inflammation and myocardial injury without improving the functional outcome, which was not, however, the primary endpoint. Finally, the IL6 half-life of less than 1 h means that rapid changes in IL6 levels can be readily detected by serial assays.

### Moving beyond one-size-fits-all treatment for patients after cardiac arrest… [^e2dd2aee]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Post–cardiac arrest syndrome is a heterogeneous entity that involves multiple organ systems and causes substantial morbidity and mortality after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 1 Several clinical trials have shown that targeted temperature management for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest improves survival and enhances the quality of life of survivors. 1 Practice guidelines vary in recommendations of temperature target. 2, 3 The initial clinical trials using 33 °C led to some adaptation of TTM in clinical practice. Still, another clinical trial using 36 °C as a target showing similar outcomes has led to some confusion on the temperature target for TTM. 4 The TTM trials have made brain injury a significant inclusion criteria with patients who are comatose after successful CPR. While comatose patients may appear similar clinically, the severity of brain injury varies widely. The TTM regimen studied did not account for the severity of brain injury.

2, 3 Currently, practice guideline recommendations vary. One guideline has different levels of recommendation based on target temperatures 33 °C vs 36 °C, 2 and another guideline provides a range from 32 °C to 36 °C.
3. 7 In the subgroup of patients who did not have severe cerebral edema or highly malignant EEG, the researchers tested the interaction of the Pittsburgh Cardiac Arrest Category and TTM strategy. They performed 2 sensitivity analyses: calculation of the relative risk for characteristics that were likely associated with the outcome or choice of TTM target and creation a propensity score for the likelihood of the decision of temperature target. The study by Callaway et al7 included 1319 patients from 2010 to 2018. 7 The key finding was that in patients without severe cerebral edema or highly malignant EEG, TTM at 33 °C was associated with better survival than TTM at 36 °C for patients with the most severe post–cardiac arrest illness.

TTM at 36 °C was associated with better survival in mild to moderate severity of illness. Patients with severe cerebral edema or highly malignant EEG had poor outcomes regardless of the TTM strategy. This study has several important limitations. The study is a retrospective review of a cohort that was initiated as a quality improvement database, in which clinician decisions on choice of target temperature were based on their assessment of the clinical situation. The authors are transparent about this major limitation and took steps to address it in the analysis. They appropriately cautioned readers not to "infer a causal connection based on these observational cohort data".

### Targeted temperature management processes and outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: an observational cohort study* [^da51c7d6]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Targeted temperature management has been shown to improve survival with good neurological outcome in patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The optimal approach to inducing and maintaining targeted temperature management, however, remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate these processes of care with survival and neurological function in patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Design

An observational cohort study evaluating the association of targeted temperature management processes with survival and neurological function using bivariate and generalized estimating equation analyses.

Setting

Thirty-two tertiary and community hospitals in eight urban and rural regions of southern Ontario, Canada.

Patients

Consecutive adult (≥ 18 yr) patients admitted between November 1, 2007, and January 31, 2012, and who were treated with targeted temperature management following nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Interventions

Evaluate the association of targeted temperature management processes with survival and neurologic function using bivariate and generalized estimating equation analyses.

Measurements and Main Results

There were 5,770 consecutive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, of whom 747 (12.9%) were eligible and received targeted temperature management. Among patients with available outcome data, 365 of 738 (49.5%) survived to hospital discharge and 241 of 675 (35.7%) had good neurological outcomes. After adjusting for the Utstein variables, a higher temperature prior to initiation of targeted temperature management was associated with improved neurological outcomes (odds ratio, 1.27 per °C; 95% CI, 1.08–1.50; p = 0.004) and survival (odds ratio, 1.26 per °C; 95% CI, 1.09–1.46; p = 0.002). A slower rate of cooling was associated with improved neurological outcomes (odds ratio, 0.74 per °C/hr; 95% CI, 0.57–0.97; p = 0.03) and survival (odds ratio, 0.73 per °C/hr; 95% CI, 0.54–1.00; p = 0.049).

Conclusions

A higher baseline temperature prior to initiation of targeted temperature management and a slower rate of cooling were associated with improved survival and neurological outcomes. This may reflect a complex relationship between the approach to targeted temperature management and the extent of underlying brain injury causing impaired thermoregulation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients.

### Intensive care medicine research agenda on cardiac arrest [^0ca240bf]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Over the last 15 years, treatment of comatose post-cardiac arrest patients has evolved to include therapeutic strategies such as urgent coronary angiography with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), targeted temperature management (TTM)-requiring mechanical ventilation and sedation-and more sophisticated and cautious prognostication. In 2015, collaboration between the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the European Society for Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) resulted in the first European guidelines on post-resuscitation care. This review addresses the major recent advances in the treatment of cardiac arrest, recent trials that have challenged current practice and the remaining areas of uncertainty.

In the HACA trial, which included 275 patients, mortality after 6 months was significantly lower in patients treated with targeted hypothermia (n = 137) compared with the control group (n = 138) (41% versus 55%, P = 0.02). Although overall survival after CA according to the EuReCa TWO registry is as low as 28%, the better survival in the HACA trial may be explained by its restrictive inclusion criteria (ie, initial shockable rhythm, witnessed CA, estimated interval of 5 to 15 minutes from CA to first resuscitation attempt, and a maximum timespan of 60 minutes from CA to ROSC). For the final enrollment of 275 patients into this trial, 3551 patients were initially screened, and of these, 3246 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria. Furthermore, the trial protocol did not specify a target temperature for the normothermic control group resulting in a median core temperature in this study arm of > 37 °C, over the 24‐hour intervention period. Bernard et al included adults suffering OHCA only if the initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation (VF). The authors detected no difference in mortality at hospital discharge between the hypothermia and normothermia group (51% versus 68%, P = 0.145). However, mortality was a prespecified secondary outcome in both trials.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^4d12ef7c]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management definitions — key temperature ranges and timing — are specified as follows: Controlled normothermia (NT) is between 36.0 and 37.4 °C; fever is core body temperature greater than 37.5 °C, with alternate definitions > 38.3 °C or > 38.5 °C; mild hypothermia is 32–34 °C, moderate hypothermia 28–32 °C, and deep/severe hypothermia less than 28 °C. Overshoot is defined as a temperature drop > 0.5 °C below target temperature or temperature 32 °C or lower. Prophylactic hypothermia is TH started within 2.5 h of neurologic injury and before evidence of secondary injury. Duration categories include longer duration hypothermia (greater than 24 h in the cardiac arrest population; greater than 48 h in other populations) and shorter duration hypothermia (less than 24 h in the cardiac arrest population; < 24–48 h in other populations). Conventional cooling methods include cold (4 °C) crystalloid IV fluids, cold sponge baths, bags of ice applied directly to axillae/groin, fans, water- or air-circulating blankets, and iced saline or water NG lavage/bladder instillations.

### Changes in temperature management and outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in United Kingdom intensive care units following publication of the targeted temperature management trial [^8003f89c]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate how the publication of the targeted temperature management (TTM) trial in December 2013 affected the trends in temperature management and outcome following admission to UK intensive care units (ICUs) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

Methods

We used a national ICU database of 1,181,405 consecutive admissions to 235 adult ICUs. OHCA admissions mechanically ventilated in the first 24 h in the ICU were divided into a pre-TTM trial cohort of patients admitted before publication of the TTM trial (January 2010-December 2013) and post-TTM cohort of patients admitted after TTM trial publication (January 2014-December 2017). The primary outcome variables were lowest temperature in the first 24 h in ICU and survival to hospital discharge.

Results

The lowest temperature recorded in the first-24 h of admission was significantly higher in the post-TTM cohort (n = 18,106) than in the pre-TTM cohort (n = 12,162) (mean 34.7 (± 1.6) versus 33.6 °C (± 1.8); absolute difference 1.12 °C (95% CI 1.08–1.16). The post-TTM cohort had a greater prevalence of fever (> 38.0 °C) (24.8% vs 14.7%; (odds ratio (OR) 1.91 (95% CI 1.80–2.03); p < 0.001)) and higher unadjusted in-hospital mortality (63.7% vs 61.6%). In a multilevel model, accounting for time trend and including site as a random effect, neither the step change in acute hospital mortality following publication of the TTM trial result (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95–1.15; p = 0.37), nor the change in slope (from OR 1.00 per year, 95% CI 0.97–1.04, to 1.04 per year, 95% CI 1.02–1.07; p = 0.059), was statistically significant. Adjusted analyses were limited by the models' dependence on temperature and temperature-related variables.

Conclusions

The lowest temperature recorded in the first-24 h of admission in OHCA patients was higher in the post-TTM cohort compared with the pre-TTM cohort. There has been an increase in the proportion of patients with fever (> 38 °C) in the first 24 h. Although crude mortality was slightly higher in the post-TTM cohort, an analysis accounting for time trend and variation between critical care units, found no significant change associated with the TTM publication.

### Door-to-targeted temperature management initiation time and outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: insights from the continuous chest compressions trial [^a89585e3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sudden cardiac death continues to be a major public health issue, with only 16% to 23% of patients with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who are admitted to a hospital being discharged with a favorable neurological outcome. 1, 2, 3 Based on randomized clinical trials, guidelines recommend the utilization of targeted temperature management (TTM) to improve survival and neurological outcomes among comatose survivors of patients with cardiac arrest. 4, 5, 6, 7 As prehospital systems of care yield increasing numbers of resuscitated patients, more OHCA patients survive to hospital admission, further emphasizing the need to optimize in‐hospital strategies to improve survival in this vulnerable population. 6

Despite demonstration of improved outcomes with TTM, the optimal timing of TTM initiation remains to be elucidated. Some studies have shown that early initiation of TTM (either prehospital or in the emergency department) may lead to improved neurological outcome and survival, but others have demonstrated inconsistent results. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Some variation may be due to the mode of TTM initiation (for example, cooled IV saline infusions resulted in worse outcomes in 1 study). 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Furthermore, these prior studies varied in the metrics measured (DTT initiation, door to target temperature) as well as end points. A study by Lee et al examined the relationship between TTM initiation and time to target temperature (induction). The investigators found that induction time was not independently associated with favorable neurological outcomes at hospital discharge. 15 To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the variability in clinical practice, specifically the association between the interval between admission to a hospital and TTM initiation (door‐to‐TTM; DTT) and outcomes among OHCA patients surviving to hospital arrival. It would be of clinical value to have further guidance on the effect of delay of TTM on neurological and survival outcomes using hard clinical outcomes such as favorable neurological status and survival to discharge. This is potentially an attractive metric, allowing in‐hospital providers to objectively assess the quality and efficiency of delivering TTM, and could support protocols to ensure prompt TTM initiation, which is a key priority in the OHCA patient population.

Targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest — percentage of adult patients with coma after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) due to a shockable rhythm with documentation of targeted temperature management (TTM) or a documented reason for ineligibility — is defined as follows: The numerator is patients with coma after OHCA due to ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT) who have documentation of TTM performed achieving a temperature of 32°C to 36°C, or, if deemed ineligible, the reason for ineligibility should be documented. The denominator includes all patients with coma after OHCA with a shockable presenting rhythm of VF or VT, excluding patients with a non-shockable presenting rhythm, patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, patients presenting to the hospital > 6 hours from time of return of spontaneous circulation, < 18 years of age, length of stay greater than 120 days, and patients with Comfort Measures Only documented after return of spontaneous circulation but prior to initiation of TTM. The period of assessment is from Emergency Department arrival through the first full hospital day.

### Therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest… [^d078d086]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Bougouin W, Dumas F, Cariou A. Therapeutic Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest. JAMA. 2017; 317:

644. doi: 10.1001/jama.2016.19829 To the Editor Dr Chan and colleagues1 evaluated the association between therapeutic hypothermia and survival to hospital discharge in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest and found lower survival among patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia than among non–hypothermia-treated patients. Induced hypothermia has been proposed for patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest, considering both the deleterious effect of hyperthermia after cardiac arrest2 and the potential benefit of reduction in cerebral injury with cooling. The Target Temperature Management 33°C vs 36°C After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest trial3 compared 2 levels of targeted temperature management and found no difference regarding survival or neurological function.

In the TTM trial, the authors emphasized that, even in the 36°C group, the natural evolution of temperature was not allowed, but rather the temperature was actively controlled to prevent fever. Accordingly, recent guidelines advocate for a strategy of targeted temperature management for comatose patients with return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest. 4 Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Changes in temperature management of cardiac arrest patients following publication of the target temperature management trial [^590cb911]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate knowledge translation after publication of the target temperature management 33°C versus 36°C after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest trial and associated patient outcomes. Our primary hypothesis was that target temperature management at 36°C was rapidly adopted in Australian and New Zealand ICUs. Secondary hypotheses were that temporal reductions in mortality would be seen and would have accelerated after publication of the target temperature management trial.

Design

Retrospective cohort study (January 2005 to December 2016).

Setting

The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation adult patient database containing greater than 2 million admission episodes from 186 Australian and New Zealand ICUs.

Patients

Sixteen-thousand two-hundred fifty-two adults from 140 hospitals admitted to ICU after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Interventions

The primary exposure of interest was admission before versus after publication of the target temperature management trial.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome variable to evaluate changes in temperature management was lowest temperature in the first 24 hours in ICU. The primary clinical outcome variable of interest was inhospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients with fever in the first 24 hours in ICU. Mean ± SD lowest temperature in the first 24 hours in ICU in pre- and posttarget temperature management trial patients was 33.80 ± 1.71°C and 34.70 ± 1.39°C, respectively (absolute difference, 0.98°C [99% CI, 0.89–1.06°C]). Inhospital mortality rate decreased by 1.3 (99% CI, -1.8 to -0.9) percentage points per year from January 2005 until December 2013 and increased by 0.6 (99% CI, -1.4 to 2.6) percentage points per year from January 2014 until December 2016 (change in slope 1.9 percentage points per year [99% CI, -0.6 to 4.4]). Fever occurred in 568 (12.8%) of 4,450 pretarget temperature management trial patients and 853 (16.5%) of 5,184 posttarget temperature management trial patients (odds ratio, 1.35 [99% CI, 1.16–1.57]).

Conclusions

The average lowest temperature of postcardiac arrest patients in the first 24 hours in ICU rose after publication of the target temperature management trial. This change was associated with an increased frequency of fever not seen in the target temperature management trial.

When is the best time to use these methods and measures?" and "What is the beneficial effect of TH and TTM on patients who suffered from IHCA as well as patients with OHCA with initial rhythms of PEA/asystole?" Optimal TTM parameters are queried: "What are optimal temperature settings… [e.g., 32°C, 34°C, 36°C], [e.g., 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours]", and timing: "What is the treatment window (time lapse after ROSC) in which TTM will be most effective and cost effective?" Delivery and adjuncts are emphasized: "What is the best method of delivering hypothermia (external vs internal, global vs regional cooling)?" and "What strategies (e.g. ECMO, pharmacologic agents) may provide benefit in addition to hypothermia". Outcomes-focused questions include effects of aggressive management of post–cardiac arrest neurologic complications "(e.g., brain edema, seizures or seizure prophylaxis, intracranial pressure elevation, and intensive care unit–related complications)" and of the etiology "(e.g., myocardial infarction)".

### Pre versus post implementation of a pharmacologic antishivering protocol during targeted temperature management following cardiac arrest [^cb30ae11]. Neurocritical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Targeted temperature management (TTM) is endorsed by various guidelines to improve neurologic outcomes following cardiac arrest. Shivering, a consequence of hypothermia, can counteract the benefits of TTM. Despite its frequent occurrence, consensus guidelines provide minimal guidance on the management of shivering. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a pharmacologic antishivering protocol in patients undergoing TTM following cardiac arrest on the incidence of shivering.

Methods

A retrospective observational cohort study at a large academic medical center of adult patients who underwent TTM targeting 33 °C following out-of-hospital (OHCA) or in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) was conducted between January 2013 and January 2019. Patients were included in the preprotocol group if they received TTM prior to the initiation of a pharmacologic antishivering protocol in 2015. The primary outcome was incidence of shivering between pre- and postprotocol patients. Secondary outcomes included time from arrest (IHCA) or admission to the hospital (OHCA) to goal body temperature, total time spent at goal body temperature, and percentage of patients alive at discharge. All pharmacologic agents listed as part of the antishivering protocol were recorded.

Results

Fifty-one patients were included in the preprotocol group, and 80 patients were included in the postprotocol group. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups, including percentage of patients experiencing OHCA (75% vs. 63%, p = 0.15) and time from arrest to return of spontaneous circulation (17.5 vs. 17.9 min, p = 0.96). Incidence of patients with shivering was significantly reduced in the postprotocol group (57% vs. 39%, p = 0.03). Time from arrest (IHCA) or admission to the hospital (OHCA) to goal body temperature was similar in both groups (5.1 vs. 5.3 h, p = 0.57), in addition to total time spent at goal body temperature (17.7 vs. 18 h, p = 0.93). The percentage of patients alive at discharge was significantly improved in the postprotocol group (35% vs. 55%, p = 0.02). Patients in the postprotocol group received significantly more buspirone (4% vs. 73%, p < 0.01), meperidine (8% vs. 34%, p < 0.01), and acetaminophen (12% vs. 65%, p < 0.01) as part of the pharmacologic antishivering protocol. Use of neuromuscular blockade significantly decreased post protocol (19% vs. 6%, p = 0.02).

Conclusions

In patients undergoing TTM following cardiac arrest, the implementation of a pharmacologic antishivering protocol reduced the incidence of shivering and the use neuromuscular blocking agents. Prospective data are needed to validate the results and further evaluate the safety and efficacy of an antishivering protocol on clinical outcomes.

### Targeted temperature management in postresuscitation care after incorporating results of the TTM2 trial [^8fa07487]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

IMPACT OF TARGET TEMPERATURE

The TTM1 trial showed that there is no additional neuroprotective benefit for patients undergoing temperature management with a lower target temperature at 33 °C as compared with more mild hypothermia at 36 °C. Whether more precise temperature settings lead to improved outcomes has been addressed in the FROST‐I (Finding the Optimal Cooling Temperature After Out‐of‐Hospital Cardiac Arrest) trial by Lopez‐de‐Sa et al in 2018 (Table 1). One hundred fifty OHCA survivors with shockable initial rhythms were randomized into 3 groups to receive targeted hypothermia at 32 °C, 33 °C, and 34 °C, respectively, for 24 hours. Temperature control was performed using an intravascular cooling device inserted into the femoral vein. Controlled rewarming was limited to 0.1 to 0.2 °C per hour, followed by a period of targeted normothermia, which was then maintained until 50 hours after starting temperature management. Favorable neurologic outcome, defined as a mRS score of ≤ 3 at 90 days, was observed in 63.3% of patients assigned to the 32 °C group, 68.2% in the 33 °C group, and 65.1% in the 34 °C group, without a significant difference. Ninety‐day all‐cause mortality was similar between all groups at 30.8%, 26.5%, and 28.5%, respectively.

Most of the relevant RCT protocols determined a constant target temperature of 33 °C in the intervention arm, which was then compared with a control group treated with targeted normothermia of 36.5 °C to 37.5 °C.
