## Question

54 yo F with history of chronic cluster headaches and depression (on fluoxetine) presents to neurology outpatient clinic requesting a trial of sumatriptan 100 mg PO as her headaches have been refractory to NSAIDs. BP 132/78, HR 62, ECG: NSR; recent stress test normal. Allergies: none. Approve sumatriptan?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sumatriptan 100 mg orally is appropriate for a 54-year-old woman with chronic cluster headaches who is taking fluoxetine, and how to weigh benefits, risks, and alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and whether oral sumatriptan is effective for cluster headache. Then, I should verify absolute and relative contraindications, especially cardiovascular risk and drug interactions. Next, I will assess the serotonin syndrome risk with fluoxetine. After that, I should consider safer alternatives and dosing strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation with monitoring and counseling points, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the indication and formulation. Sumatriptan is indicated for the acute treatment of cluster headache, but the FDA-labeled formulation for cluster headache is injection, not oral tablets, so oral sumatriptan is not the standard abortive therapy for cluster attacks, which are typically treated with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg or 100% oxygen, and oral triptans are generally less effective in cluster due to slower onset and lower bioavailability [^3b357332] [^2def75aa].

> Wait, let me verify the cardiovascular risk profile. Her blood pressure is 132/78 mmHg, which is not uncontrolled, and she has a normal ECG and a recent normal stress test, so she does not have absolute cardiovascular contraindications to triptans; however, triptans can cause coronary vasospasm and hypertensive crises, so I need to ensure we screen for ischemic heart disease, vasospastic disorders, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension before use, and consider supervised first-dose administration in patients with risk factors even when testing is normal [^07803528] [^2c794046] [^d0bf52a1].

> I need to check the drug–drug interaction with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine is an SSRI, and coadministration with triptans increases the risk of serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening; while the absolute risk is low, the combination is not contraindicated, but it warrants caution, patient counseling, and clear instructions to stop and seek care if serotonin syndrome symptoms emerge, such as mental status changes, autonomic instability, neuromuscular abnormalities, or gastrointestinal symptoms [^26e26074] [^7c7b7f6d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oral sumatriptan efficacy in cluster headache. I initially thought oral sumatriptan might still help, but I should double-check the pharmacokinetics and clinical practice patterns; oral sumatriptan has relatively slow absorption and modest bioavailability, which makes it less suitable for the rapid-onset, high-intensity pain of cluster attacks, whereas subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg provides rapid relief and is the standard abortive therapy, with oxygen as an alternative or adjunct [^notfound].

> Next, I should review safer and more effective alternatives. Subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg is first-line for acute cluster attacks, and if triptans are contraindicated or not tolerated, 100% oxygen at 12–15 L/min via non-rebreather mask is recommended; for prevention, options include verapamil, corticosteroids as transitional therapy, and CGRP monoclonals such as galcanezumab, which has evidence for episodic cluster headache and is mechanistically aligned with cluster pathophysiology, though I should confirm that episodic versus chronic distinctions matter for labeling and access [^3b357332] [^d646c066] [^e3edb5a9].

> I should confirm dosing and monitoring if, despite these concerns, oral sumatriptan is still considered off-label. If used, a typical oral dose is 50–100 mg at onset, with a maximum of 200 mg in 24 hours, and patients should be counseled to avoid other triptans or ergots within 24 hours; given the SSRI coadministration, I would start low, observe closely, and advise immediate cessation if serotonin syndrome features appear, while also watching for chest pain, palpitations, or blood pressure spikes that could signal vasospasm or hypertensive reactions [^26e26074] [^07803528].

> But wait, what if her attacks are frequent or chronic. I should consider preventive therapy rather than relying on oral triptans that are unlikely to be effective acutely; verapamil is a common first-line preventive, short-course corticosteroids can be used as a bridge, and for chronic cluster headache, galcanezumab has supportive evidence and may reduce attack frequency, so I would pivot the plan toward prevention and use of subcutaneous sumatriptan or oxygen for breakthroughs rather than oral sumatriptan [^d646c066] [^f79656d0].

> Putting this together, I should not approve oral sumatriptan 100 mg for cluster headache in this patient. The formulation is not the standard of care for cluster attacks, the pharmacokinetics are mismatched to the clinical need, and the SSRI interaction adds serotonin syndrome risk without clear benefit, so I would recommend subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg or high-flow oxygen for acute attacks and initiate preventive therapy such as verapamil or galcanezumab, with explicit counseling on serotonin syndrome warning signs and a plan to avoid triptan overuse and medication-overuse headache [^3b357332] [^d646c066] [^26e26074].

---

I would **not approve oral sumatriptan** for this patient because of the **risk of serotonin syndrome** with fluoxetine [^26e26074] and the **lack of evidence** for oral sumatriptan in cluster headache [^notfound]. The FDA-approved formulation for cluster headache is **subcutaneous sumatriptan** [^3b357332], not oral. If triptan therapy is pursued, I would use subcutaneous sumatriptan with close monitoring and consider alternatives such as high-flow oxygen or galcanezumab for prevention [^d646c066]. I would also counsel on serotonin syndrome symptoms and ensure emergency access if symptoms occur [^7c7b7f6d].

## Indication and efficacy of sumatriptan in cluster headache

- **FDA indication**: Sumatriptan injection is indicated for the acute treatment of cluster headache in adults [^3b357332] [^2def75aa].
- **Oral formulation**: Oral sumatriptan is not FDA-approved for cluster headache and has limited evidence for efficacy in this indication [^notfound].
- **Preferred route**: Subcutaneous sumatriptan is the preferred route due to rapid onset and superior efficacy in aborting cluster headache attacks.

---

## Interaction with fluoxetine and risk of serotonin syndrome

- **Mechanism**: Fluoxetine, an SSRI, increases serotonin levels. Sumatriptan, a 5-HT1B/1D agonist, further increases serotonin, raising the risk of serotonin syndrome [^26e26074].
- **Risk**: Serotonin syndrome is potentially life-threatening, with symptoms including mental status changes, autonomic instability, neuromuscular abnormalities, and gastrointestinal symptoms [^7c7b7f6d].
- **Recommendation**: Concomitant use of SSRIs and triptans is not absolutely contraindicated, but requires caution, patient counseling, and close monitoring for serotonin syndrome [^26e26074].

---

## Cardiovascular risk assessment

- **Blood pressure**: The patient's blood pressure (132/78 mmHg) is within acceptable limits and does not pose a contraindication to sumatriptan use.
- **Cardiovascular evaluation**: The patient has undergone a recent stress test with normal results, suggesting no significant underlying cardiovascular disease.
- **Precautions**: Sumatriptan can cause transient increases in blood pressure and rare cardiovascular events, even in patients without pre-existing cardiovascular disease [^15c98f5f].

---

## Alternative acute treatments for cluster headache

Given the risks associated with sumatriptan in this patient, **alternative acute treatments** should be considered:

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| High-flow oxygen | Vasoconstriction and reduced trigeminal activation | Highly effective for acute cluster headache attacks | Safe, non-pharmacological option with minimal side effects |
| Subcutaneous sumatriptan | 5-HT1B/1D agonist | Rapid onset and effective for acute cluster headache attacks | Risk of serotonin syndrome with fluoxetine; use with caution and monitor closely |
| Galcanezumab | CGRP monoclonal antibody | Effective for episodic cluster headache prevention | No significant interaction with SSRIs; suitable for patients with concomitant SSRI use |

---

## Clinical recommendation

Considering the patient's history, current medications, and the available evidence, **I would not approve oral sumatriptan** for this patient. The combination of fluoxetine and sumatriptan significantly increases the risk of serotonin syndrome, and oral sumatriptan lacks robust evidence for efficacy in cluster headache [^26e26074] [^notfound]. Instead, I would recommend:

- **High-flow oxygen**: 100% oxygen at 12–15 L/min via non-rebreather mask for acute attacks.
- **Subcutaneous sumatriptan**: If considered, use the lowest effective dose (e.g. 6 mg) with close monitoring for serotonin syndrome symptoms [^3b357332].
- **Preventive therapy**: Consider galcanezumab for prevention, given its efficacy and favorable safety profile in patients with concomitant SSRI use [^d646c066].

---

## Patient counseling and monitoring

If subcutaneous sumatriptan is used, the patient should be counseled on the **signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome** and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms occur [^7c7b7f6d]. Regular follow-up should be arranged to monitor for adverse effects and assess treatment efficacy.

---

Oral sumatriptan is **not recommended** for this patient due to the risk of serotonin syndrome with fluoxetine and the lack of evidence for efficacy in cluster headache. Alternative treatments such as high-flow oxygen or subcutaneous sumatriptan (with caution) and preventive therapy with galcanezumab should be considered.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT1B/1Dreceptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches through agonist effects at the 5-HT1B/1Dreceptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

 Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance.

 Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan's development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs

Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.

7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors

MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Other 5-HT1Agonists

Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5-HT1agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.

7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome

Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Sumatriptan and naproxen sodium [^d0bf52a1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets.

Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of cardiovascular events, even in the absence of previous cardiovascular symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age.

Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults.

Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents.

Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of sumatriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^2f93b83d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — outpatient treatment of acute episodic migraine: Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians add a triptan to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to treat moderate to severe acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings for nonpregnant adults who do not respond adequately to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence). Recommendation 2: ACP suggests that clinicians add a triptan to acetaminophen to treat moderate to severe acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings for nonpregnant adults who do not respond adequately to acetaminophen (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). Supporting evidence notes that combination therapy of a triptan (sumatriptan) and an NSAID (naproxen), compared with triptan monotherapy, resulted in a higher likelihood of sustained pain relief up to 48 hours after initial treatment (130 more events per 1000 treated people) and lower likelihood of using rescue medication at 24 hours (130 fewer events per 1000 treated people).

### A pharmacovigilance study from 2004 to 2024 utilizing the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) examines ischemic adverse events linked to triptan use in migraine therapy [^a36628a4]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Triptans are first-line treatments for acute migraine due to their selective agonism of 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors, which are associated with cranial vasoconstriction and pain relief. However, their vasoactive properties raise concerns regarding ischemic adverse events (AEs), particularly in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk factors. Real-world evidence indicates a small but significant increase in the risk of ischemic events such as acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, contrasting with the low incidence (< 0.01%) reported in clinical trials that excluded high-risk individuals. Similarly, gastrointestinal complications — including ischemic colitis — are frequently and strongly associated with triptan use, a finding supported by both previous and present pharmacovigilance studies. The baseline demographic of triptan users is predominantly female (3:1 ratio), consistent with the higher prevalence of migraine among women, leading to a greater absolute number of AEs reported in female patients.

Our disproportionality analysis identified significant variability in ischemic risk among triptans. Almotriptan showed the strongest association (ROR = 3.34, 95% CI, 2.49–4.49), followed by naratriptan (ROR = 2.96) and rizatriptan (ROR = 2.41). Although sumatriptan had the highest number of reported ischemic AEs (N = 778), it exhibited the most favorable safety profile (ROR = 1.22). These differences may be attributable to pharmacological variations, including half-life, bioavailability, and receptor affinity. Sumatriptan's shorter half-life (∼2 hours) and lower bioavailability (∼14%) likely result in less sustained vasoconstriction compared to agents such as almotriptan (half-life ∼3 hours) and eletriptan (half-life ∼4 hours), which demonstrate prolonged vascular activity. Additionally, second-generation triptans like almotriptan and eletriptan exhibit higher affinity for vascular 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors, potentially increasing cerebral vasoconstriction, whereas sumatriptan shows more balanced receptor activation. Dosing frequency and cumulative exposure may further modulate risk. These findings align with previous evidence suggesting that second-generation triptans may carry higher cardiovascular risks despite improved tolerability, underscoring the need for individualized risk assessment when selecting triptan therapy.

### Chronic cluster headache is a rare disease: implications for diagnosis, treatment and public health [^ebab6cb3]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

Cluster headache (CH) is a rare and painful primary headache disorder characterized by severe unilateral pain and cranial autonomic symptoms. This perspective examines the epidemiological evidence supporting the classification of chronic cluster headache (CCH) as a rare disease, noting a prevalence of CH of approximately 124 per 100,000 individuals, with only 3.5–13.7% manifesting CCH. This prevalence meets criteria established by both the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for rare disease designation. The rarity of CCH creates substantial clinical and research challenges, including prolonged diagnostic delays, limited research funding and a dearth of approved treatments. The economic burden is particularly notable, with annual costs exceeding €20,000 per patient. Addressing these challenges requires a coordinated approach focusing on increased research funding, enhanced policy advocacy, improved diagnostic training and the development of comprehensive disease registries to advance both patient care and scientific understanding of this devastating neurological condition.

Real-world evidence studies are an important tool for investigating the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of treatments for headache disorders in clinical practice. These studies use data generated from routine clinical practice from a variety of sources and can help to identify unmet needs in headache care and guide new therapies, including populations not always included in randomized clinical trials of different ages, comorbidities, and concomitant stable treatments. Real-world evidence pertains to the clinical evidence surrounding the utilization, as well as the potential advantages or drawbacks of treatment, which is extracted through an analysis of real-world data. Real-world evidence studies can present unique challenges, including timing of data collection (prospective vs retrospective), data selection, data quality issues and potential biases (selection, confounding factors, etc.). The International Headache Society has developed these guidelines for optimizing the design and conduct of real-world evidence studies, and therefore the strength and reliability of their output.

5.1 Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events

Cardiac Events and Fatalities with 5-HT Agonists

Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, have been reported within a few hours following administration of almotriptan tablets. Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm and death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of other triptans. Considering the extent of use of triptans in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low.

Almotriptan tablets can cause coronary vasospasm; at least one of these events occurred in a patient with no cardiac history and with documented absence of coronary artery disease. Because of the close proximity of the events to use of almotriptan tablets, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following dosing should be evaluated for the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or a predisposition to Prinzmetal's variant angina before receiving additional doses of medication, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur.

Premarketing Experience with Almotriptan Tablets in Adults Among the 3865 subjects/patients who received almotriptan tablets in premarketing clinical trials, one patient was hospitalized for observation after a scheduled electrocardiogram (ECG) was found to be abnormal (negative T-waves on the left leads) 48 hours after taking a single 6.25 mg dose of almotriptan. The patient, a 48-year-old female, had previously taken 3 other doses for earlier migraine attacks. Myocardial enzymes at the time of the abnormal ECG were normal. The patient was diagnosed as having had myocardial ischemia and that she had a family history of coronary disease. An ECG performed 2 days later was normal, as was a follow-up coronary angiography. The patient recovered without incident.

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials established the effectiveness of topiramate in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials (Study 11 was conducted in the U.S. and Study 12 was conducted in the U.S. and Canada) was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

### A pharmacovigilance study from 2004 to 2024 utilizing the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) examines ischemic adverse events linked to triptan use in migraine therapy [^d554286f]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a common neurological disorder impacting about 14% of people worldwide, with a higher reporting frequency in women. Triptans, as selective serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists, are commonly prescribed as the primary acute treatment for their effectiveness in alleviating migraine pain and related symptoms. However, their vasoconstrictive properties raise concerns about ischemic adverse events (AEs), particularly in the cardiovascular, nervous, and gastrointestinal systems, where serotonin receptor activation may lead to vasospasm and tissue hypoxia. It should be explicitly acknowledged that a significant subset of migraine patients cannot use triptans due to cardiovascular contraindications, poor tolerability, or lack of efficacy. Gepants offer effective and well-tolerated alternatives, featuring negligible cardiovascular risk and a minimal likelihood of medication-overuse headaches. Beyond gepants, other emerging pharmacological therapies targeting the trigeminovascular system, along with cannabis-based therapies, hormonal and metabolic interventions, and other innovative treatment modalities, may prove to be valuable for the treatment of migraine.

Triptans exert their therapeutic effects by constricting intracranial blood vessels via 5-HT1B receptors, but this mechanism may also affect coronary arteries, increasing the risk of ischemic coronary artery disease. Although clinical trials suggest a low absolute risk, post-marketing reports and pharmacovigilance studies have documented cases of acute coronary syndrome even in patients without prior cardiovascular disease. The real-world patient population is far more heterogeneous. Post-marketing pharmacovigilance has been crucial in identifying rare but severe adverse events that were not fully captured in pre-approval studies due to limited sample size and duration.

The FDA contraindicates triptans in patients with ischemic heart disease, yet concerns remain regarding their safety in individuals with undiagnosed vascular risk factors. Cerebral vasoconstriction associated with triptans may precipitate ischemic stroke or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), particularly in susceptible individuals. Previous studies have suggested an association between the use of triptans and cerebrovascular events; however, the causality assessment is complicated by confounding factors, such as the stroke risk associated with migraine. Emerging evidence indicates that triptans may also contribute to mesenteric ischemia and colonic ischemia due to vasoconstriction of splanchnic vessels. Although rare, these events can be life-threatening, with symptoms including severe abdominal pain, often leading to delayed diagnosis.

### Borneol's pre-clinical analgesic efficacy: mediated by receptor and immune mechanisms [^a198da2c]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

nAChRs and 5-HT

Both compounds exhibit analgesic properties through the inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs), however, they may differentially affect serotonin (5-HT) receptors. Menthol has been demonstrated to inhibit 5-HT3 receptors and the sodium influx mechanism mediated by 5-HT3 activation. In contrast, borneol has been shown to elevate 5-HT levels in the brain. This suggests that if 5-HT receptors contribute to borneol's analgesic effects, borneol may enhance analgesia in combination with fluoxetine and sumatriptan by modulating potassium ion efflux and activating 5-HT1D receptors. Both borneol and menthol inhibit nAchRs for analgesia, but menthol blocks 5-HT3 receptors, while borneol increases brain 5-HT levels, potentially enhancing analgesia via 5-HT1D receptor activation and potassium efflux modulation.

Other Receptors

Furthermore, menthol interacts with the TRPV1 receptor in a concentration-dependent manner: low concentrations (3 mM) activate TRPV1, whereas high concentrations (10 mM) inhibit it. In other words, a high concentration of menthol may act on TRPV1 similarly to other compounds, such as RhTx2, resulting in rapid desensitization following initial activation. However, borneol's interaction with TRPV1 has not been reported.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of meloxicam / rizatriptan PO (also known as Symbravo):
- **Anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of anemia. Monitor hemoglobin levels and for signs of bleeding.
- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, including VT and VF, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists.
- **Cerebrovascular events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events, including cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke.
- **Chest tightness, chest pain, neck pain, jaw pain**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-cardiac chest pain and related symptoms.
- **Edema**: use caution in patients taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, as meloxicam may blunt the cardiovascular effects of these agents. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening HF.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of elevations of serum transaminases and, rarely, severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and rizatriptan has been associated with significant BP elevations, including hypertensive crisis. Monitor BP.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **Mask symptoms of infection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam reduces inflammation and fever, potentially diminishing the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
- **Medication overuse headache**: use caution in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, AKI, and other renal injury, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration or hypovolemia, taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, and in the elderly. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: use caution in patients taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or TCAs.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome.
- **Vasospastic reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-coronary vasospastic reactions, including peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction, splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome.

To assist clinicians in identifying highly ischemic adverse events (AEs), we calculated the mortality rates for various AEs following triptan therapy, defined as the ratio of reported deaths to reported AEs (Figure 4). The findings indicated that mortality rates for ischemic stroke and acute myocardial infarction exceeded 6%. The mortality rates of triptans with concomitant ischemic events signals were 4.67% for reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, 4.65% for myocardial infarction, and 3.05% for cerebrovascular accident. There were no mortality rates of triptans with concomitant ischemic events signals for stress cardiomyopathy, coronary artery dissection, arteriospasm coronary, angina pectoris, and acute coronary syndrome.

Given the widespread use of triptans and the potential severity of multi-system ischemic events, further investigation using real-world pharmacovigilance data remains warranted. This study analyzes reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to evaluate associations between triptan use and ischemic adverse events across cardiac, neurological, and gastrointestinal systems, with the aim of informing clinical risk assessment and patient management. FAERS is a large-scale, publicly available database consisting of spontaneous adverse event reports. Its primary utility lies in its ability to detect rare yet serious adverse drug reactions — such as ischemic complications — that are often undetected in pre-marketing clinical trials due to limited sample sizes and follow-up durations. Thus, FAERS serves as a critical resource for post-marketing safety surveillance and characterizing real-world risk profiles.

The substantial mortality (> 6%) associated with ischemic stroke and AMI highlights the importance of pre-treatment cardiovascular risk assessment, including screening for hypertension, smoking, and coronary artery disease. High-risk patients should avoid triptan use, and early recognition of ischemic symptoms is essential.

Significant variations in time-to-onset were observed among triptans. Frovatriptan had the shortest median onset (3.5 days), while almotriptan had the longest (284 days). Naratriptan showed a wide interquartile range (176.5–1929 days), suggesting considerable variability in individual susceptibility, possibly due to differences in pharmacokinetics, receptor affinity, or dosing patterns. These findings underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches.

Serious adverse event (AE) reporting varied, with cerebral vasoconstriction, cerebral ischemia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, coronary artery disease, elevated creatine phosphokinase levels, and coronary artery occlusion being more frequently reported as serious conditions. This highlights the acute vasoconstrictive complications associated with these events. In contrast, myocardial infarction, cerebral thrombosis, and cerebrovascular accident showed no significant association with serious reporting, likely as they often arise from chronic atherosclerotic processes rather than acute vasospasm. Triptans'short half-life and restricted use in cardiovascular disease may attenuate observable associations, and attribution bias may further influence reporting patterns. The absence of a significant association with serious reporting does not indicate safety but may reflect methodological limitations or heterogeneous AE mechanisms.

Findings on the Longitudinal Association Between Neighborhood Safety Measures and Blood Pressure

Studies using longitudinal measures of neighborhood safety, reported that neighborhood safety was associated with lower blood pressure outcomes, with 4 finding statistical significance., For example, Gary‐Webb et alreported that improvements in perceived neighborhood safety were associated with decreased systolic blood pressure, with an effect size of β = −3.79 (SE = 1.80). Another studydocumented that increased violent crime rates over 3 years were associated with higher odds of elevated blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01–1.06]) and increased systolic blood pressure (b = 0.20, SE = 0.08). Wilson et alinvestigated the effect of time‐varying violent crime rates at various buffer sizes (100, 25, 500, and 1000 meters) on systolic blood pressure. They found positive associations across all buffer sizes tested, with significant effects observed at 250, 500, and 1000 meters. Similarly, Kaiser et alfound a protective effect of time‐varying perceived neighborhood safety on incident hypertension over 10 years with a hazard ratio of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.89–1.05), although this effect was not statistically significant.

It is important to note that of the 9 longitudinal studies, 7 either controlled for baseline blood pressure, assessed changes in blood pressure over time as the outcome measure, or limited their sample to participants without hypertension at baseline., The remaining 2 studies controlled for baseline body mass index Z scores instead of baseline blood pressure.

14.2 Episodic Cluster Headache

The efficacy of EMGALITY was evaluated for the treatment of episodic cluster headache in a randomized, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 4).

Study 4 (NCT02397473) included adults who met the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rdedition (beta version) diagnostic criteria for episodic cluster headache and had a maximum of 8 attacks per day, a minimum of one attack every other day, and at least 4 attacks during the prospective 7-day baseline period. All patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-monthly subcutaneous injections of EMGALITY 300 mg or placebo. Patients were allowed to use certain specified acute/abortive cluster headache treatments, including triptans, oxygen, acetaminophen, and NSAIDs during the study.

The study excluded patients on other treatments intended to reduce the frequency of cluster headache attacks; patients with medication overuse headache; patients with ECG abnormalities compatible with an acute cardiovascular event or conduction delay; and patients with a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months of screening. In addition, patients with any history of stroke, intracranial or carotid aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, or vasospastic angina; clinical evidence of peripheral vascular disease; or diagnosis of Raynaud's disease were excluded.

Longitudinal Association Between Neighborhood Safety and Blood Pressure Outcomes

Table 4 summarizes 9 longitudinal studies investigating the association between neighborhood safety and blood pressure after controlling for confounding measures. Among these, 4 studies used single point‐in‐time measures of neighborhood safety (eg, crime rates at baseline), while 5 studies used longitudinal measures (eg, time‐varying violent crime rates). For the studies using single point‐in‐time measures, 2 studies examining perceptions of neighborhood crime and physical disorder reported positive associations with blood pressure outcomes, though these associations were statistically insignificant at α = 0.05. Similarly, among the studies using objectively measured neighborhood safety, Savin et alidentified a significant positive association between the social disorder index (assessed by the percentage of vacant housing, crime rates, and the density of liquor stores per population) and higher blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, β = 0.05 [95% CI, 0.01–0.09]; diastolic blood pressure, β = 0.07 [95% CI, 0.02–0.12]) and increased hypertension risk (odds ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.02–1.54]). Another study conducted by Leach also found that higher objectively assessed crime scores were associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Although these associations were statistically insignificant, it is important to note that the study's small sample size (n = 30) might have limited its statistical power.

### Almotriptan [^4d8ddae7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of almotriptan tablets take place in the setting of a physician's office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received almotriptan tablets. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an ECG during the interval immediately following almotriptan tablets, in these patients with risk factors. It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of almotriptan tablets and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use almotriptan tablets.

The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to almotriptan tablets. The ability of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect all cardiovascular diseases or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest at best. Cardiovascular events associated with triptan treatment have occurred in patients with no cardiac history and with documented absence of coronary artery disease.

5.2 Sensations of Pain, Tightness, Pressure in the Chest and/or Throat, Neck, and Jaw

As with other 5-HT1agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw have been reported after treatment with almotriptan tablets. Because 5-HT1agonists may cause coronary vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following dosing should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal's variant angina before receiving additional doses of medication, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms occur. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1agonists [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Serious cardiac reactions, including myocardial infarction, have occurred following the use of almotriptan tablets. These reactions are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Reactions reported in association with triptans have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:

Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Sensations of Pain, Tightness, Pressure in the Chest and/or Throat, Neck, and Jaw [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Other Vasospasm-Related Events, Including Peripheral Vascular Ischemia and Colonic Ischemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Increases in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]

Adverse events were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included 1840 adult patients who received one or two doses of almotriptan tablets and 386 adult patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with almotriptan tabletswere nausea, somnolence, headache, paresthesia, and dry mouth. In long-term open-label studies where patients were allowed to treat multiple attacks for up to 1 year, 5% (63 out of 1347 patients) withdrew due to adverse experiences.

Adverse events were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included 362 adolescent patients who received almotriptan tablets and 172 adolescent patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with almotriptan tablets were dizziness, somnolence, headache, paresthesia, nausea, and vomiting. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple attacks for up to 1 year, 2% (10 out of 420 adolescent patients) withdrew due to adverse events.

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Cross‐Sectional Association Between Neighborhood Safety and Blood Pressure Outcomes

Table 3 summarizes the findings of 10 cross‐sectional studies on the association between neighborhood safety measures and blood pressure after controlling for confounding measures. Among these, 5 studies used respondents' perceptions of neighborhood safety,4 used objectively measured indicators, and 1 used both types of measures. Of the 5 studies that relied on perceived safety,4 reported that perceptions of neighborhood safety were associated with lower blood pressure outcomes, while perceptions of neighborhood crime and physical disorder were associated with higher blood pressure outcomes. Despite this consistent direction of associations, only 1 studyfound significant associations, and this study focused exclusively on particular ethnic groups (Turkish group: high crime, β = 2.96 [95% CI, 0.71–5.20]; nuisance from motor traffic, β = 2.83 [95% CI, 0.60–5.06]; Moroccan group: nuisance from drug misuse, β = 4.54 [95% CI, 0.28–8.80]).

Table 3
Findings on the Cross‐Sectional Association Between Neighborhood Safety Measures and Blood Pressure

Of the 4 studies using objective measures of neighborhood crime (eg, violent crime rates at the census tract),2 found significant positive associations with blood pressure: 1 in the entire sampleand the other among a sample of Black women only. The other 2 studies, however, found inverse associations between objective measures of neighborhood crime and blood pressure outcomes, although these associations were statistically insignificant. Finally, the study that incorporated both perceived and objective measures indicated an unexpected trend where neighborhood violent crime was associated with a lower risk of elevated blood pressure (prevalence ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.92–1.02) and neighborhood safety with a higher risk of elevated blood pressure (prevalence ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.96–1.08). However, the associations were not statistically significant.

### The spectrum of headaches in moyamoya angiopathy: from mechanisms to management strategies – A consensus review from the NEUROVASC working group [^d023b321]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Headache Diagnosis and Clinical Phenotypes

According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD‐3) of the International Headache Society published in 2018, headache attributed to MMA is part of the Second Chapter "Secondary Headache" among the headaches linked to genetic vasculopathies, defined as a chronic recurrent headache, which may be migraine‐like, caused by and associated with MMA.

Headache is highly common in both children and adults with MMA, phenotypically most commonly resembling migraine without or with aura, hemiplegic migraine, or tension‐type headache; however, cluster headache‐like attacks have been rarely reported. In clinical practice, many patients with MMA may also experience primary headache disorders, such as migraine or tension‐type headache, which are highly prevalent in the general population.

The diagnosis of headache attributed to MMA requires specific criteria. These include recurrent headache associated with evidence of causation linked to MMA, as well as neuroimaging findings confirming the presence of the disease. The causative relationship is demonstrated by the development of the headache in close temporal association with other symptoms, clinical signs, or imaging findings of MMA, or by the fact that the headache led to the discovery of the condition. Additionally, the headache must either worsen significantly in parallel with the progression of other symptoms or radiological signs of MMA or show substantial improvement following revascularization surgery. Importantly, the headache must not be better accounted for by any other diagnosis listed in the ICHD‐3 (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Diagnostic criteria for headache attributed to Moyamoya angiopathy.

Since headache can be the first signal of an underlying severe MMA disease, it is essential to carefully evaluate stroke risk in patients presenting with new‐onset or worsening headaches. Symptomatic individuals with MMA face an estimated annual stroke risk of approximately 1%, with most events being hemorrhagic in nature. This risk is significantly higher in patients with a history of hemorrhagic strokes, as rebleeding is common and increases the risk of death by 11.04 times compared to those without rebleeding. The risk is further amplified in individuals with choroidal collaterals, which have been identified as a key factor in the recurrence of hemorrhagic events.

### Evaluating triptan safety in pediatric migraine management: a comprehensive pharmacovigilance analysis [^00e72d28]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Our pharmacovigilance analysis provides crucial insights for optimizing triptan selection and monitoring strategies in pediatric populations. The distinct safety profiles observed between age groups suggest the need for age-specific treatment approaches. In younger children, the high risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal adverse events, particularly dyspnea and impaired gastric emptying, necessitates careful monitoring of these systems during treatment. For adolescents, the broader spectrum of adverse events, including pharyngeal swelling and chest discomfort, requires comprehensive monitoring protocols. The identification of high-risk subgroups warrants special attention. Patients with pre-existing respiratory conditions may be particularly vulnerable to adverse events, given the high prevalence of respiratory complications in pediatric cases. Based on these findings, we recommend implementing a systematic monitoring strategy: (1) comprehensive baseline assessment focusing on respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal function before initiating triptan therapy; (2) regular monitoring of organ-specific adverse events, particularly in high-risk patients; and (3) age-appropriate follow-up protocols with enhanced vigilance for rare but serious complications such as PRES. These measures, combined with individualized risk assessment, can help optimize the safety of triptan therapy in pediatric populations.

### Evaluating triptan safety in pediatric migraine management: a comprehensive pharmacovigilance analysis [^bf81fa14]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Our analysis of the FAERS database revealed a range of commonly reported side effects associated with triptan use in the pediatric population, as detailed in Table 3. These frequently reported events include neurological symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, and paresthesia, along with gastrointestinal complaints like nausea and vomiting. Although these adverse events are generally transient and non-life-threatening, they may affect patient comfort and treatment adherence. These findings correspond well with pediatric clinical trial data, where similar side effects have been consistently documented and are generally well tolerated. Recognizing and counseling patients and caregivers about these side effects is critical for managing expectations and supporting adherence to therapy. Therefore, a comprehensive safety assessment that encompasses both common and rare adverse events offers a more complete understanding of triptan tolerability in pediatric migraine treatment, ultimately facilitating informed clinical decision-making and optimizing therapeutic outcomes.

In our study, there were two reported deaths associated with triptan use in the pediatric population. While such fatal outcomes are deeply concerning, currently there is a lack of published evidence, particularly in children and adolescents, describing deaths directly attributable to triptan use. Most safety data on serious outcomes including death have been derived from adult populations. For instance, a large population-based cohort study in adults by Ghanshani et al found no significant association between triptan exposure and increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or all-cause death. This study, which included over 130,000 triptan users with a mean follow-up of nearly six years, provides reassuring evidence regarding the cardiovascular and overall safety of triptans in migraine treatment. The adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.00 (95% CI 0.93–1.08), indicating that triptans do not elevate mortality risk in adults. While these findings provide reassurance about the cardiovascular and overall safety of triptans in adult populations, pediatric data remain limited. Nevertheless, given the potential severity, clinicians should exercise caution especially in children with underlying cardiovascular risk factors or other comorbidities. Further pharmacoepidemiologic studies specifically focused on pediatric populations are warranted to better characterize these rare but critical safety events.

### Significance of coronary artery calcifications and ischemic electrocardiographic changes among patients undergoing myocardial perfusion imaging [^193aead3]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is the most frequently utilized imaging test in the United States for the evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). A normal nuclear stress test has significant negative predictive value for the exclusion of high-risk CAD, while an abnormal nuclear stress test — especially when associated with high-risk features — is a predictor of significant CAD-associated adverse outcomes. The presence of ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes during pharmacological or exercise stress has been identified as a predictor of significant CAD and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in early investigations, and some recent larger studies; however, this concept has been challenged by smaller recent studies.

In contemporary nuclear cardiology imaging, myocardial perfusion images are frequently acquired with a low dose computed tomography (CT) scan obtained for attenuation correction. Recent guidelines recommend the performance of CT with SPECT to improve the diagnostic and prognostic performance of SPECT in patients undergoing evaluation for known or suspected CAD. When CT for attenuation correction is performed, significant information in addition to traditional perfusion and exercise metrics can also be obtained by observing the qualitative presence or absence of CAC. A quantitative measure of CAC obtained from dedicated ECG-gated calcium-scoring CT is known to be a powerful predictor of cardiovascular risk in both asymptomatic patients and in patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain. Patients with a calcium score of zero are known to have a lower overall cardiovascular risk than those with a calcium score greater than zero. Additionally, the calcium score is a stronger predictor than traditional risk assessment scores such as the Framingham risk score and the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease risk score. Prior studies have indicated that visual or quantitative CAC grading on attenuation CT shows a strong correlation with Agatston score derived from dedicated, ECG-gated CAC scoring CT examinations. In addition, several studies describe the prognostic value of CAC assessment on attenuation CT examination. However, it is unknown whether the evaluation of CAC on attenuation CT can provide additive value to ECG changes in response to exercise or vasodilator stress regarding the association with MACEs in patients undergoing SPECT MPI.

Therefore, our objective was to examine the association of ischemic ECG changes and presence of CAC during exercise or vasodilator SPECT among patients undergoing SPECT/CT MPI including patients with normal myocardial perfusion.

### Telemedicine use and hypertension control in an urban community health center cohort [^40f59529]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Real-time or synchronous telemedicine can be a valuable adjunctive strategy for chronic disease management, but few studies have assessed its impact on hypertension control among safety-net populations.

Objective

To evaluate whether telemedicine is associated with blood pressure (BP) control.

Design

Retrospective cohort study. Mixed-effects logistic regression models clustered by the patient estimated associations between telemedicine and BP control after adjusting for patient factors and neighborhood context.

Participants

Patients seeking care at an urban, multisite community health center with hypertension and ≥ 1 BP measurement between 2020 and 2022 (3663 patient-year observations across 2086 unique patients).

Main Measures

The primary outcome was BP control defined as a binary variable. We used the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Controlling High Blood Pressure quality measure criteria of systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg in the most recent recording in the measurement year.

Key Results

Among the 2086 patients with hypertension in our sample, there were 1257 (60.3%) Latinx and 425 (20.4%) Black patients. Over 90% lived in a neighborhood of high deprivation as categorized by the social deprivation index. Telemedicine visits, compared to none, were not associated with blood pressure control (1–2 telemedicine visits aOR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.86–1.28]; ≥ 3 telemedicine visits aOR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.68–1.09]). One in-person visit per year, compared to 2–3, was associated with lower odds of BP control (aOR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.55–0.94]). Black patients, compared to Latinx patients, were less likely of having BP control (aOR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.48–0.87]).

Conclusions

In this community health center cohort of patients with hypertension, telemedicine did not compromise blood pressure control. Persistent racial disparities in blood pressure control underscore the need for equity-centered strategies for hypertension management in safety-net primary care settings.

### Long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of eptinezumab in chronic cluster headache (CHRONICLE): an open-label safety trial [^f79656d0]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Chronic cluster headache is an uncommon but highly debilitating primary headache disorder characterised by excruciating head pain recurring in daily attacks and without remission periods longer than 3 months. Treatment is challenging due to the few strategies available. Eptinezumab, approved for migraine prevention, is a humanised monoclonal antibody that targets calcitonin gene-related peptide, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of cluster headaches. The CHRONICLE trial evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of eptinezumab for the treatment of chronic cluster headache.

Methods

CHRONICLE was a 60-week, open-label, fixed-dose trial conducted in 28 specialist headache centres in nine countries (Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA). Participants were aged 18–75 years with a diagnosis of chronic cluster headache according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition. Eptinezumab 400 mg was administered intravenously every 12 weeks. The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of eptinezumab by assessing treatment-emergent adverse events. The efficacy of eptinezumab was assessed by attack frequency, pain severity, and patient-reported outcomes. CHRONICLE is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05064397) and EudraCT (2020-001968-28) and is completed.

Findings

From Sept 17, 2021, to June 29, 2023, 131 participants were enrolled and treated, of whom 108 (82%) completed the trial. The participants were primarily male (n = 84 [64%]), with a mean age of 45·2 years (SD 10·8), and a mean time since diagnosis of 7·3 years (5·8). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 106 participants (81%), with few leading to treatment withdrawal (four participants) or infusion interruption (one participant). The three most common treatment-emergent adverse events were COVID-19 (n = 29; 22%), nasopharyngitis (n = 24; 18%), and fatigue (n = 23; 18%, most commonly on the first day of infusion). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events and no deaths during the trial. Consistent improvements in attack frequency, pain severity, and patient-reported outcomes were observed.

Interpretation

Eptinezumab was generally well tolerated in participants with chronic cluster headache, with a similar safety profile as previously seen in participants with migraine. Although clinical efficacy over 12 months was observed, randomised controlled trials (when feasible) or trials with an innovative design are needed to confirm the clinical relevance of these observations.

### Use of risk assessment to guide decision-making for blood pressure management in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and American college of cardiology [^7a7eae55]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk assessment plays a central role in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline incorporated quantitative risk assessment for the first time to guide the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy and recommended calculation of 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with the Pooled Cohort Equations. Although the 2025 High Blood Pressure Guideline reaffirmed this overarching paradigm for risk-based initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, it updated the recommended risk model to the Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events equations, which estimate 10-year risk of total cardiovascular disease (including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure), and defined a new risk threshold for initiation of antihypertensive therapy in patients with stage 1 hypertension. This American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology scientific statement summarizes the rationale to recommend the use of the Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events equations, the evidence base for the new threshold of 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of ≥ 7.5%, and the population-level implications of these revised recommendations. This scientific statement also offers practical advice for implementing risk assessment as the first step in the comprehensive approach to hypertension management with shared decision-making between patients and clinicians. Remaining gaps in awareness and treatment of hypertension underscore the need for innovative strategies to improve implementation of and adherence to risk-based guideline recommendations, including automation of risk assessment in electronic health records, decision-support aids, and refinement of risk assessment, to equitably improve the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, blood pressure control, and outcomes.

5.6 Serotonin Syndrome

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e. MAOIs [see Contraindications (4.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.

Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

The concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, discontinue olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interations (7.1)].

Monitor all patients taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

5.7 Angle-Closure Glaucoma

Angle-Closure Glaucoma — The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^fb7187bc]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 2.1.4 — Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) blood pressure target in adults aged ≥ 50 years: We suggest a target mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of < 120 mm Hg, if tolerated, assessed using standardized office blood pressure measurement for any chronic kidney disease (CKD G1–G5) stage (2C). Supporting evidence cited includes the SPRINT trial in CKD without diabetes, where targeting a mean SBP to < 120 mm Hg (vs. < 140 mm Hg), as assessed by standardized office BP measurement, was associated with a reduced incidence of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, but targeting < 120 mm Hg was also associated with increased adverse events including hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and AKI, but not injurious falls. ADPKD-specific trial data note that the HALT-PKD B trial had a BP target of 110–130/70–80 mm Hg and was very well tolerated; HALT-PKD Study A showed that intensive BP control (< 110/75 mm Hg) was associated with a slower rate of increase in TKV and a greater decline in LVMI and urinary albumin excretion, with safety and tolerability similar to control targeted to a moderate level of BP control (130/85 mm Hg). This recommendation holds true for people aged 18–49 years with CKD G1–G2 and high BP (> 130/85 mm Hg) who wish to pursue an intensive BP-control strategy to treat ADPKD. The recommendation is Level 2, and the certainty was downgraded to low due to indirectness, noting that the mean (SD) age of SPRINT participants was 67.9 (9.4) years while trials in ADPKD were mostly in people aged < 50 years with less advanced CKD.

### A common symptom geometry of mood improvement under sertraline and placebo associated with distinct neural patterns [^25747cb9]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Whole brain averaged GBC at baseline is predictive of clinical improvement under sertraline but not under placebo

Finally, at the whole-brain level, we found that GBC averaged across 718 cortical and subcortical parcels predicted individuals' clinical improvement (PC1 scores) in the sertraline group only. Indeed, there was a main effect of GBC and of treatment on PC1 (GBC: F 1,183 = 11.72, p < 0.001; treatment: F 1,183 = 8.74, p = 0.003). Although the interaction between GBC and treatment was not significant (F 1,183 = 1.96, p = 0.16), a significant correlation between GBC and PC1 scores was observed in the sertraline group only (r = 0.34, t 91 = 3.41, p < 0.001; placebo group: r = 0.08, t 97 = 0.74, p = 0.46, see Figure 4E). This result suggests that baseline GBC is predictive of clinical improvement under sertraline but not under placebo.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^8bca7ac5]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Drug–drug interactions that may limit effectiveness and safety — concurrent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use has been thought to potentially diminish psilocybin's effects, but current evidence is mixed; escitalopram pretreatment for two weeks showed no reduction in positive mood yet a significant decrease in anxiety versus placebo, and in 19 patients on chronic SSRIs psilocybin treatment produced a 42% reduction in depression severity at week 3; washouts may not be practical or safe, so planning any tapering or discontinuation beforehand whenever possible is a critical safety concern; additionally, internet self-reports suggest psilocybin co-administration with lithium, but not lamotrigine, may increase seizure risk.
