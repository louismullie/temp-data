## Question

What's the treatment for erectile dysfunction in patients with spinal cord injuries?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for erectile dysfunction in spinal cord injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of neurogenic ED in SCI and how lesion level and completeness influence erectile mechanisms. Then, I should verify the first-line therapy and dosing strategy for PDE5 inhibitors, including safety counseling and contraindications. Next, I will examine second-line options such as intracavernosal injections and vacuum devices, followed by third-line surgical prostheses. After that, I need to consider ejaculation and fertility management, including autonomic dysreflexia precautions. Finally, I should integrate psychosocial care, monitoring, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking guideline concordance and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and clinical context. In SCI, erectile function depends on sacral S2–4 reflex arcs and descending supraspinal pathways; complete upper-motor-neuron lesions above T11 often retain reflex erections but lose psychogenic erections, whereas lower-motor-neuron or cauda equina injuries tend to preserve psychogenic erections but lose reflex erections, which shapes treatment expectations and response to therapy [^111uawRS]. I should also remember that most men with SCI will require treatment for ED, and that sexual counseling is integral to care to align goals and set realistic expectations [^1127o7Dk].

> Now, I will verify first-line therapy. Multiple guidelines converge on PDE5 inhibitors as first-line for neurogenic ED in SCI, with strong recommendations from EAN/EFAS/INUS and consistent support from AUA and EAU guidance, so I should anchor on sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil as initial options [^116dVL3X] [^111uawRS]. Wait, let me verify the evidence base: randomized trials and pooled analyses show robust efficacy for sildenafil in SCI, with 83% reporting improved erections and about 59% of attempts successful versus 12–13% on placebo, which is clinically meaningful and comparable to general ED populations [^113XU9Dj] [^111xe16X]. I should also note that vardenafil and tadalafil have RCT-level data in SCI showing significant improvements in erectile function and ejaculatory outcomes, supporting class-wide use with patient preference guiding agent selection [^1147S9LB] [^114KZUJd].

> Next, I should review dosing and counseling. Typical starting doses are sildenafil 50 mg, tadalafil 10 mg, or vardenafil 10 mg taken before anticipated sexual activity, with titration based on efficacy and tolerability; importantly, sexual stimulation is required for effect, and more than one trial may be needed to find the optimal dose, which I need to emphasize to avoid premature nonresponse labeling [^116A5Cmr] [^114KZUJd]. Hold on, I should verify safety counseling: men on nitrates should not use PDE5 inhibitors, and in SCI with autonomic instability, I should start conservatively and monitor for hypotension or autonomic symptoms, even though classic trials did not report autonomic dysreflexia with sildenafil; caution is prudent in higher lesions and early after injury [^116A5Cmr] [^114C3jvr]. I need to ensure I screen for cardiovascular comorbidities and drug interactions, including CYP3A4 inhibitors, before prescribing [^116A5Cmr].

> I will now examine predictors of response. Let me think about lesion characteristics: upper-motor-neuron lesions and incomplete injuries generally respond better than lower-motor-neuron or cauda equina lesions, and preservation of baseline erections and orgasmic perception predict greater benefit, which I should use to set expectations and guide agent choice or dose escalation [^114C3jvr] [^114CmQbs]. But wait, what if the patient has a complete lower-motor-neuron injury? In that scenario, I should prepare for a higher likelihood of PDE5 inhibitor failure and pivot earlier to second-line options rather than pushing maximal PDE5 dosing indefinitely [^114C3jvr].

> Next, I should review second-line therapy. Intracavernosal alprostadil is highly effective in neurogenic ED, with success rates around 90% in pooled series, and is recommended as second-line by EAU and NEUROGED when oral therapy fails or is contraindicated; I need to start at 1.25 mcg for pure neurogenic etiology and titrate in-office to an erection adequate for intercourse without exceeding 1 hour, limiting to no more than three times weekly with at least 24 hours between doses [^1147k7Jd] [^111S7Evn] [^116PTaAr] [^115AGWfe]. Hold on, I should verify safety: I must monitor for priapism, penile fibrosis, and autonomic dysreflexia during titration, and ensure patients receive hands-on training before home use to minimize complications [^111S7Evn] [^111uawRS].

> Let me consider vacuum erection devices as an alternative second-line. VEDs are guideline-supported, nonpharmacologic options with high satisfaction in general ED and utility in SCI; they can be offered when injections are undesirable or as an adjunct, and I should counsel on proper technique, time limits, and the use of constriction rings to avoid ischemic injury [^113Xei18] [^116dVL3X]. I should double-check expectations: while efficacy is lower than injections, acceptability may be higher for some couples, so shared decision-making is key here [^113Xei18] [^112Tpt13].

> I will now examine third-line therapy. Penile prosthesis implantation is appropriate after failure or intolerance of less invasive therapies; long-term series in neurologically impaired patients show high success and satisfaction but nontrivial infection and mechanical complication risks, which are higher in SCI and other high-risk groups, so meticulous infection prevention and device selection are critical [^113PBkxV] [^112dwTKg]. Wait, let me verify counseling points: patients should be informed about irreversibility, potential for revision, and the need to avoid implantation in the presence of systemic or urinary infection, with antibiotic-impregnated devices considered to mitigate infection risk [^115VVmN3] [^112dwTKg].

> Next, I should review ejaculation and fertility considerations. Most men with SCI have anejaculation and require assisted ejaculation for reproduction; penile vibratory stimulation is first-line, with electroejaculation as second-line, and surgical sperm retrieval if both fail, followed by IUI or IVF/ICSI as indicated by total motile sperm count [^113kY3kf] [^112omNAd] [^113X3zKb]. I need to ensure I counsel on autonomic dysreflexia risk during ejaculatory procedures, especially in injuries at or above T6, and have emergency antihypertensive protocols available during stimulation or retrieval [^116iv98Z] [^113wumqC].

> I should confirm psychosocial and rehabilitative care elements. Sexual counseling, education about altered but possible function, and addressing secondary factors such as spasticity, fatigue, incontinence, pain, depression, and body image changes are essential and should be revisited regularly; validated questionnaires like the IIEF help track outcomes and guide adjustments [^111S7Evn] [^112qUU3o]. Let me reconsider partner involvement: fixed partner status and relationship quality correlate with better sexual function and satisfaction, so couples-focused approaches can improve adherence and outcomes [^112ZEkwk] [^112qUU3o].

> Now, I need to ensure a coherent monitoring and follow-up plan. I should reassess efficacy, tolerability, and device technique within 4–6 weeks of initiating or changing therapy, titrating PDE5 doses or injection strength as needed, and screen annually for cardiovascular risk, testosterone deficiency, and complications such as penile fibrosis or device issues; long-term PDE5 use in SCI appears safe, though dropout for non-medical reasons is common, which I should anticipate and mitigate with education and preference-aligned choices [^112qUU3o] [^117L3FdH] [^112MEmbY]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not over-ordering tests: routine pelvic neurophysiology or MRI is not recommended unless there is an atypical presentation or medico-legal need, keeping care focused and cost-conscious [^113iGc4S].

> Finally, let me synthesize the practical algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines. Start with education and shared decision-making, then offer a PDE5 inhibitor as first-line with correct use counseling and dose titration; if inadequate or contraindicated, proceed to intracavernosal alprostadil or a vacuum device based on patient preference and risk profile; reserve penile prosthesis for refractory cases after thorough counseling on risks and expectations; throughout, integrate ejaculation/fertility planning when relevant and manage autonomic dysreflexia risk proactively, especially in higher lesions [^116dVL3X] [^1147k7Jd] [^11648WHM]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to place intraurethral alprostadil as a second-line option here, but I should correct that: while EAU lists topical/intraurethral alprostadil as an alternative first-line in selected patients, in SCI the stronger evidence and guideline emphasis support intracavernosal injections as the preferred second-line after PDE5 failure, with intraurethral alprostadil considered when injections are not acceptable, so I will keep ICI as second-line and note intraurethral as an alternative in well-informed patients declining injections [^117BatoP] [^111595S6] [^1147k7Jd].

For erectile dysfunction after spinal cord injury, **PDE5 inhibitors are first-line** [^116dVL3X] (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) and effective in most patients, with better response in upper motor neuron lesions and incomplete injuries [^114C3jvr] [^114JMXm8]. If PDE5 inhibitors are ineffective or contraindicated, **intracavernosal injections** [^1147k7Jd] (alprostadil or combinations) are highly effective second-line therapy [^115AGWfe]. Vacuum erection devices are a non-pharmacologic alternative with good satisfaction [^113Xei18]. Penile implants are reserved for refractory cases [^1127o7Dk] and have high satisfaction but carry surgical risks [^113PBkxV]. Management should be individualized, with counseling on sexual function, fertility, and autonomic dysreflexia risk [^1127o7Dk] [^113kY3kf] [^116iv98Z]; multidisciplinary care improves outcomes [^112qUU3o].

## Pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction in spinal cord injury

SCI disrupts both **psychogenic and reflex pathways**, producing distinct patterns of ED [^111uawRS]:

- **Upper motor neuron (UMN) lesions**: Loss of supraspinal control with preserved reflex arcs; reflex erections possible, psychogenic erections impaired.
- **Lower motor neuron (LMN) lesions**: Disruption of reflex arcs; reflex erections lost, psychogenic erections may persist.
- **Complete lesions**: Greater severity and higher likelihood of persistent ED than incomplete lesions.

---

## First-line treatment: phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5 inhibitors)

PDE5 inhibitors are the **first-line therapy** for ED in SCI, with robust evidence of efficacy and safety [^116dVL3X] [^114JMXm8].

| **Medication** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Sildenafil | - 79–94% improved erections <br/> - Higher success in incomplete and UMN lesions [^114C3jvr] [^113XU9Dj] | - Well tolerated <br/> - Headache <br/> - Flushing <br/> - Dyspepsia <br/> - No autonomic dysreflexia reported [^114C3jvr] | - 50–100 mg <br/> - 30–60 min before activity |
| Tadalafil | - 72–85% improved erections <br/> - Longer duration (24–36 h) [^116VBeei] [^114KZUJd] | - Well tolerated <br/> - Back pain <br/> - Muscle aches | - 10–20 mg <br/> - 30 min before activity |
| Vardenafil | - 72–85% improved erections <br/> - Rapid onset (15–30 min) [^116VBeei] [^1147S9LB] | - Well tolerated <br/> - Headache <br/> - Flushing <br/> - Nasal congestion | - 10–20 mg <br/> - 15–30 min before activity |

---

PDE5 inhibitors require sexual stimulation and are less effective in LMN lesions or complete injuries; **counseling and dose titration** improve outcomes [^116A5Cmr].

---

## Second-line treatment: intracavernosal injections

Intracavernosal injections are highly effective (**~90%**) [^115AGWfe] when PDE5 inhibitors fail or are contraindicated [^111S7Evn]. Agents include **alprostadil (prostaglandin E1)** — start at 1.25 mcg and titrate to effect [^116PTaAr] — and **combination therapy** (alprostadil, papaverine, phentolamine), which offers higher success but more side effects. Adverse effects include **priapism, penile fibrosis, and pain**; patients require training and close follow-up [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological treatments

### Vacuum erection devices (VEDs)

VEDs are a **non-invasive alternative** with ~70% success and high satisfaction, particularly when PDE5 inhibitors are ineffective or contraindicated [^113Xei18] [^116dVL3X]. Limitations include **mechanical feel, ring discomfort, and petechiae**.

---

### Penile implants

Implants are reserved for **refractory ED** or when other treatments are unacceptable [^116No1rM]. Options include **inflatable devices** (most natural, high satisfaction) and **malleable rods** (mechanically simpler, less natural). Risks include **infection, mechanical failure, and erosion**; infection risk is higher in SCI, but satisfaction remains high [^112dwTKg].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options include **low-intensity shockwave therapy** — investigational with limited SCI data — and **epidural spinal cord stimulation**, which is experimental and may improve sexual function in select patients [^1179QvVo] [^113sWXmk].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment selection is shaped by **neurological level and completeness of injury**, with UMN and incomplete lesions responding better to PDE5 inhibitors, whereas LMN and complete lesions may need injections or implants. Patient preferences, goals, and tolerance for invasiveness also guide therapy, and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autonomic dysreflexia may limit options [^114C3jvr].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and counseling

Comprehensive care improves outcomes: **urologists** manage ED therapies and complications; **physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists** address function and adaptation; **psychologists** provide counseling on sexual function, body image, and relationships; and **sex therapists** offer education on sexual techniques and assistive devices. Counseling should cover sexual function, fertility, and autonomic dysreflexia risk, especially in injuries at or above T6 [^113wumqC].

---

## Conclusion

ED after SCI is common but treatable; **PDE5 inhibitors are first-line**, with intracavernosal injections, VEDs, and penile implants as subsequent options. Individualized, multidisciplinary care and counseling are essential to optimize sexual function and quality of life.

### Specific aspects of erectile dysfunction in spinal cord injury [^1127o7Dk]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2004). Low credibility.

According to preliminary studies, the overall incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI; traumatic and medical) in Spain is estimated to be between 12 and 20 per million inhabitants, and almost 80% of these injuries occur in young men. SCI causes organic changes in men leading to erectile dysfunction (ED), impaired ejaculation, and changes in genital orgasmic perception. A vast majority of men with both complete and incomplete SCI will require treatment for ED, and the therapeutic options should include sexual counseling so that the patient can be informed about his disorder and can adjust his sexual behavior accordingly. The first-line treatment of choice is oral drugs, such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil). Sildenafil has been shown to be highly effective and well tolerated in men with ED of various etiologies, including SCI. Data are also presented on sublingual apomorphine, which has limited indications for the treatment of ED in SCI, and on constrictive rings and vacuum systems. Second-line treatments include intracavernous injections of prostaglandin E(1), papaverine, and phentolamine, alone or in combination, which have been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of ED in men with SCI. Finally, for third-line treatments, the indications for surgical methods are given, including penile prostheses and neuroprosthesis of anterior sacral roots. These devices should be reserved for the cases when the above-mentioned methods have repeatedly failed. Historically, the treatment of ED among patients with SCI has been managed by clinicians in physical medicine and rehabilitation. Thus, the criteria for referral and the competencies of these specialists are established, and they should be included as an integral part of the rehabilitation program.

### Efficacy and safety of sildenafil citrate (viagra) in men with erectile dysfunction and spinal cord injury: a review [^114C3jvr]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects a substantial number of men who are young, active, and otherwise healthy. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common consequence of SCI. Since its approval, sildenafil citrate (Viagra) has been shown to effectively treat ED of various etiologies. We review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of sildenafil treatment of ED in men with SCI. A literature search identified 2 randomized controlled trials and 4 prospective case series that evaluated sildenafil treatment for ED from SCI. Efficacy was evaluated using an assessment of global efficacy and a more specific assessment of erectile function. For general efficacy, the proportion of patients who reported improved erections and ability to have intercourse was as high as 94%. Up to 72% of intercourse attempts were successful. For measures of erectile function, 5 of the 6 studies showed statistically significant improvements among sildenafil-treated versus placebo-treated patients. Erectile response rates were generally higher in patients with incomplete versus complete SCI and in patients with upper versus lower motor neuron lesions. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of patients with complete lesions, regardless of level or lower motor neuron lesions, also benefited from sildenafil. Sildenafil was well tolerated. Incidence rates and types of adverse events that occurred in these studies were similar to those published previously. Symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia were not reported in any study. Existing evidence suggests that oral sildenafil is a highly effective and well-tolerated treatment for ED associated with SCI.

### Ten years of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in spinal cord injured patients [^114JMXm8]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The majority of men with spinal cord injury (SCI) require chronic treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED), but most of them, prior to taking phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, stopped therapy due to side-effects or low compliance rate.

Aim

Analysis of literature on oral PDE5 inhibitors in individuals with SCI and ED in order to evaluate how much their release changed the management of ED in SCI subjects and what remains to be seen of their potential or limits.

Main Outcome Measures

Questionnaires on sexual function.

Methods

18 internationally published clinical studies that enrolled SCI males treated with at least one of the PDE5 inhibitors were analyzed.

Results

The small numbers of papers with large and diverse outcome measures did not consent a meta-analysis of treatment results. 705 used sildenafil, 305 vardenafil and 224 tadalafil. Median age was less than 40 years. Only 1 study excluded tetraplegic individuals. For measures of ED evaluated, 11 out of 13 studies reported a significant statistical improvement with PDE5 inhibitors versus placebo or erectile baseline (P < 0.01, or p < 0.005). The most frequent predicable factor for the therapeutic success of PDE5 inhibitors was upper motoneuron lesion. Statistical impact on ejaculation success rates was shown in at least one paper for all PDE5 inhibitors (p < 0.05). Overall, 15 patients, (7 using sildenafil), discontinued the therapies due to drawbacks. Only 1 sildenafil study reported a follow-up maximum of 24 months.

Conclusions

Literature suggests that all oral PDE5 inhibitors represent a safe and effective treatment option for ED caused by SCI. Further research is needed on head-to-head comparative trials and SCI patient preference for these drugs; their impact on ejaculation and orgasm function, their early use after SCI for increasing the recovery rate of a spontaneous erection, and their effectiveness and tolerability in the long-term are still to be investigated.

### Erectile dysfunction in spinal cord-injured men: different treatment options [^112Tpt13]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2007). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy, safety and patients' preference of different treatment modalities of ED in men with SCI. Sixty SCI men with ED were included in the study. They were divided into three groups. Group A received sildenafil, group B received intracorporal injection (ICI) and were then shifted to sildenafil and group C used vacuum constriction devices (VCD) and were then shifted to sildenafil. Erection was evaluated before and after each treatment. Ninety percent of patients reported improvement of erection after sildenafil and ICI treatment according to IIEF-EF and only 70% of patients reported improvement in erection with VCD. However, 14 patients reported that they preferred sildenafil due to the easier route of administration. In men with SCI, sildenafil is the most effective treatment and is widely accepted. ICI, VCD therapy in SCI patients should be used according to patient's preference and choice.

### Treatment of infertility in men with spinal cord injury [^113kY3kf]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Most men with spinal cord injury (SCI) are infertile. Erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction and semen abnormalities contribute to the problem. Treatments for erectile dysfunction include phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, intracavernous injections of alprostadil, penile prostheses, and vacuum constriction devices. In anejaculatory patients who wish to father children, semen retrieval is necessary. Penile vibratory stimulation is recommended as the first line of treatment. Patients who fail penile vibratory stimulation can be referred for electroejaculation. If this approach is not possible, prostate massage is an alternative. Surgical sperm retrieval should be considered as a last resort when other methods fail. Most men with SCI have a unique semen profile characterized by normal sperm count but abnormally low sperm motility. Scientific investigations indicate that accessory gland dysfunction and abnormal semen constituents contribute to the problem. Despite abnormalities, sperm from men with SCI can successfully induce pregnancy. In selected couples, the simple method of intravaginal insemination is a viable option. Another option is intrauterine insemination. The efficacy of intrauterine insemination increases as the total motile sperm count inseminated increases. In vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection are options in cases of extremely low total motile sperm count. Reproductive outcomes for SCI male factor infertility are similar to outcomes for general male factor infertility.

### Male erectile dysfunction following spinal cord injury: a systematic review [^115AGWfe]. Spinal Cord (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To review sexuality in persons with spinal cord injuries (SCIs), and to report the effectiveness of erectile interventions.

Methods

Reports from six databases (1966–2003), selected annual proceedings (1997–2002) and manufacturer's information were screened against eligibility criteria. Included reports were abstracted and data pooled from case-series reports regarding intracavernous injections and sildenafil.

Results

From 2127 unique reports evaluated, 49 were included. Male sexual dysfunction was addressed in these reports of several interventions (behavioural therapy, topical agents, intraurethral alprosatadil, intracavernous injections, vacuum tumescence devices, penile implants, sacral stimulators and oral medication). Penile injections resulted in successful erectile function in 90% (95% CI: 83%, 97%) of men. Sildenafil resulted in 79% (95% CI: 68%, 90%) success; the difference in efficacy was not statistically significant. Five case-series reports involving 363 participants with penile implants demonstrated a high satisfaction rate, but a 10% complication rate.

Conclusions

A large body of evidence addressing sexuality in males focuses on erection. Penile injection, sildenafil and vacuum devices generally obviate the need for penile implants to address erectile dysfunction. Interventions may positively affect sexual activity in the short term. Long-term sexual adjustment and holistic approaches beyond erections remain to be studied. Rigorous study design and reporting, using common outcome measures, will facilitate higher quality research. This will positively impact patient care.

### Efficacy, safety and predictive factors of therapeutic success with sildenafil for erectile dysfunction in patients with different spinal cord injuries [^114CmQbs]. Spinal Cord (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

Multicenter, open, prospective, before-after study.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of sildenafil therapy for erectile dysfunction in patients with spinal cord injury, and the association between the response to sildenafil and factors such as causes and levels of spinal cord injury, grade of ASIA deficit, time since injury, orgasmic perception, and degree of baseline erection.

Setting

Homes of outpatients of 16 spinal cord injury units in Spain.

Method

One hundred and seventy patients with erectile dysfunction secondary to spinal cord injury, from whom baseline data were collected on their sexual function, and who started treatment with sildenafil 50 mg. An efficacy assessment was made by the patient and his partner, and the score of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) was recorded.

Results

It was reported by 88.2% of the patients and 85.3% of their partners that treatment with sildenafil had improved their erections, regardless of the baseline characteristics of the spinal cord injury and erectile function. In responders, this improvement was confirmed by an increase from 12.5 to 24.8 points (P < 0.001) of the Erectile Function Domain of IIEF. A significant improvement was also seen in patients' satisfaction with sexual activity and general satisfaction derived from sexual life. Preservation of orgasmic perception and a baseline degree of erection of 3 or 4 (P = 0.006) were predictors of therapeutic success. No serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusion

Sildenafil is an effective, well-tolerated treatment for erectile dysfunction caused by spinal cord injury, regardless of the cause, neurological level, ASIA grade, and time since injury.

### Diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunction in the male partner in the setting of infertility: a committee opinion [^111uawRS]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

Spinal cord injury (SCI)–related erectile dysfunction — pathophysiology and treatment — notes that with normal physiologic function the S2–4 nerve roots cause vasodilation of vessels in the corpora cavernosa enabling erections; in general, a complete upper-motor neuron injury above T11 can result in reflex erections in the absence of psychogenic erections, whereas injury impacting the sacral pathways yields psychogenic erections but no reflex erections; phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor therapy is the first-line treatment for men with SCI; another option is intracavernosal injections, which should be started at a lower dose than for men with vasculogenic impotence, and these men should be monitored for autonomic dysreflexia.

### Neurologic erectile dysfunction [^116vLQgV]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Neurologic erectile dysfunction presents a diagnostic and treatment challenge to the internist and urologist. Multiple chronic disease modalities and traumatic etiologies exist. Education regarding these conditions and a detailed and thorough history and office work-up are the best resources for the clinician. Treatment can follow the model of proceeding from the least to most invasive procedure (process of care), taking into account patient and partner satisfaction. Because the psychology of grief and loss may enter into treatment of some neurologic conditions (e.g., erectile dysfunction after radical retropubic prostatectomy, spinal cord injury, or chronic diseases), a whole-patient approach encompassing psychotherapy is warranted.

Common in the medically ill, sexual dysfunction results from disruption of one or more stages of the sexual response cycle. Increased understanding of sexual pathophysiology and the psychosocial forces whereby diseases impede normal function promotes more informed treatment choices. This review focuses on the pathophysiology, impact, and treatment options of sexual dysfunction in men and women with spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, dementia, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and HIV/AIDS.

### Ten-year follow-up of sildenafil use in spinal cord-injured patients with erectile dysfunction [^117L3FdH]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Data are sparse concerning the long-term effects of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors for erectile dysfunction (ED).

Aim

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term sildenafil use in subjects with ED caused by spinal cord injury (SCI).

Methods

Phase 1: From October 1998 to January 1999, 113 SCI patients with ED were given 50 mg of sildenafil after a 4-week treatment-free period. Those with a score lower than 26 on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) and with less than 75% total successful sexual attempts the dosage of sildenafil was increased to 100 mg. Attempts were evaluated using the Sexual Encounter Profile Questions 2 and 3 (SEP2 and 3) regarding respectively the capacity to penetrate their partner and to maintain the erection after penetration. Phase 2: Only responding patients entered phase 2 where they were evaluated every 6 months. The final visit was concluded by January 2009.

Main Outcome Measures

Follow-up using the IIEF-15 questionnaire every 6 months.

Results

Seventy-five patients entered Phase 2. Thirty-eight patients were excluded, 35 of them because they did not respond to the drug. Lesions higher than T12, an incompleteness of lesions, and higher residual erection were significant predictable factors for the success of the therapy (P < 0.05). Phase 2: the most frequent reason (68.3%) for discontinuing treatment was the desire to try a new oral therapy especially for patients using 100 mg. Thirty-four individuals continued treatment, 28 of whom took 50 mg.

Conclusion

Sildenafil represents an effective and safe long-term option for SCI subjects with ED. Further investigation of long-term use of oral PDE5 inhibitors in SCI patients is needed for evaluating both factors that are determinant in the choice of a starter treatment and in detecting elements that influence the switching from initial treatment.

### Spinal cord injury medicine. 3. rehabilitation outcomes [^111HygBM]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

This self-directed learning module highlights rehabilitation outcomes in spinal cord injury (SCI). It is part of the chapter on SCI medicine in the Self-Directed Physiatric Education Program for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. This article focuses on the multiple concerns for functional recovery after SCI, chiefly, the potential for ambulation, upper-extremity recovery, options for functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS), sexual activity, and optimal outcome after a metastatic lesion. Motor incomplete patients have a better prognosis for ambulation than persons with sensory incomplete injury. Positive predictors for ambulation, including pinprick and lower-extremity motor scores greater than 20, are discussed. Meaningful recovery can occur in the upper extremities for at least 1 year. FNS options have been developed to promote functional control of the upper extremities for persons with tetraplegia, phrenic pacing, and bladder continence. A critical component of an individual's expression of self is his/her sexuality; sexual function after SCI is described in detail, including options for treatment of erectile dysfunction and various birth control methods for women. Expectations for an appropriate rehabilitation stay for a person with metastatic SCI differ for an individual with traumatic SCI. Differences may include changing routine pathways and timelines to focus on patient-centered quality of life for transition to home.

Overall Article Objective

To identify potential outcomes in ambulation, upper-extremity function, FNS, and sexual function after SCI and after metastatic cancer.

### Time / duration effectiveness of sildenafil versus tadalafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in male spinal cord-injured patients [^114KZUJd]. Spinal Cord (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

A randomized, blinded, crossover clinical trial comparing sildenafil versus tadalafil for erectile dysfunction (ED) in male spinal cord-injured (SCI) patients.

Objectives

To compare the safety, time/duration effectiveness, and the impact on the quality of life (QoL) of tadalafil 10 mg versus sildenafil 50 mg.

Setting

Neurourology Section, Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy.

Methods

During a screening (visit 1), a diary card was distributed, in which the subjects assessed, after each attempt at intercourse the quality of their erection, responding (Yes/No) to both Sexual Encounter Profile Questions 2 (SEP2) and 3 (SEP3). The subjects made at least four attempts at intercourse. At visit 2, 15 patients (group 1) were assigned sildenafil and 15 (group 2) started with tadalafil. Responses to baseline International Index of Erectile Function 5 items (IIEF-5), Questions 13–14 (IIEF 15 items) and SEP diary were recorded. Patients attempted intercourse on four separate occasions: within 4 h of taking the first tablet, within 12 h for the second tablet, 24 h for the third, and the fourth from 24 to 36 h. At visit 3, the investigators evaluated the effectiveness with the same measures used at baseline. After a wash-out period, at visit 4, Group 1 was given tadalafil, and Group 2 was given sildenafil. Patients were required to observe the same criteria in taking the four tablets as in visit 2. After 4 weeks (visit 5), we evaluated the patients as we did in visit 3.

Results

Overall, 28 patients completed the study. No subjects discontinued the drugs due to drawbacks. Tadalafil allowed a majority of men in this trial to achieve both normal sexual functioning up to 24 h postdosing compared to sildenafil (P < 0.01) and improved overall sex life satisfaction as well as sexual relations with partner.

Conclusion

Based on these data, tadalafil may have the potential to become an important treatment option for ED in SCI patients.

### Efficacy and safety of medium and long-term tadalafil use in spinal cord patients with erectile dysfunction [^112MEmbY]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for a broad spectrum of erectile dysfunction (ED) is largely reported in literature. Data are lacking concerning medium and long-term effects and safety of these treatments.

Aim

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of medium and long-term use of tadalafil in subjects with ED because of spinal cord injury (SCI).

Methods

Phase 1: From March 2003 to March 2007, 103 SCI patients with ED, mean age 39 years, were given 10 mg of tadalafil after a 4-week treatment-free period. For patients with a score lower than 26 in the erectile domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF15) and with total unsuccessful sexual attempts of more than 25% according to the Sexual Encounter Profile questions 2 and 3 (SEP2–3), the dosage of tadalafil was increased to 20 mg. Phase 2: Only responding patients entered phase 2 where the subjects were evaluated in office visits every 6 months using the IIEF15 questionnaire and a diary reporting the day and time the drug was taken. All final visits were concluded by May 2008.

Main Outcome Measures

The improvement of ED was measured using the IIEF15 and the SEP2–3 questions.

Results

Twenty-nine patients were excluded from phase 2: Twenty-seven did not respond to the drug and two left the study because of mild drawbacks. During the 6-month follow-up, nine left the study. Sixty-five individuals continued treatment with median follow-up of 33.6 months, 31 of whom took 10 mg and 34 who used 20 mg. Each group maintained up until the final visit a significant statistical improvement in erectile function, sexual satisfaction, overall satisfaction and percentages of "yes" responses to the SEP2–3 compared with baseline using the Wilcoxon test (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Tadalafil represents an effective and safe long-term option for SCI patients with ED.

### What is a "Validated questionnaire"? A critical review of erectile function assessment [^112Knp7a]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In recent years, the assessment of erectile dysfunction (ED) has experienced a paradigm shift from objective, quantitative methods to subjective, qualitative patient-reported outcomes. Facilitated by this shift is the ongoing debate on questionnaire selection and need for standardization, particularly among sexual medicine specialists.

Aim

To review current literature on assessment of erectile function via patient-reported outcomes and discuss the context, advantages, and limitations of currently available questionnaires.

Methods

A thorough literature search of erectile function questionnaires developed from 1990 through 2019 was carried out using 3 methods: a search of the MedLine databases; hand-search of peer-reviewed urologic, sexual medicine, and health policy journals; and expert review. The following keywords were used: [assessment of] [inventory] [questionnaire], or [validated measure]; in combination with: [sexual function] or [erectile function]. Measures were stratified into one of the following 3 groups: screening, outcome, or disease-specific. 3 screening measures (International Index of Erectile Function, the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire, and Brief Male Sexual Inventory); 5 outcome measures (Sexual Health Inventory for Men, Erection Hardness Score, Erectile Dysfunction Inventory for Treatment and Satisfaction, and Treatment Satisfaction Scale); and 3 categories of disease-specific measures (cancer, Peyronie's disease, and spinal cord injury) were included.

Outcomes

Strengths, limitations, and valid uses of each erectile function questionnaire.

Results

There currently exists a wide variety of screening, outcome, and disease-specific measures for ED diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. Rigor of psychometric validation varies greatly across studies. However, depending on purpose of use, all abovementioned questionnaires have merit for use in clinical practice, are nonredundant, and can complement and supplement one another.

Clinical Implications

Before choosing a specific measure for ED diagnosis, assessment, or treatment, there must be careful consideration of the questionnaire's psychometric properties, context of validation, and its possible limitations.

Strengths & Limitations

The patient reported outcome measures highlighted in this article complement and supplement one another, as each emphasizes a related yet distinct central theme. During selection for use in clinical practice and research studies, special attention needs to be paid to the context, strengths, and weaknesses of each measure.

Conclusion

When used conscientiously, patient-reported questionnaires can significantly optimize patient management. Yafi FA, Huynh LM, Ahlering T, et al. What Is a "Validated Questionnaire"? A Critical Review of Erectile Function Assessment. J Sex Med 2020;17:849–860.

### Efficacy and safety of vardenafil in men with erectile dysfunction caused by spinal cord injury [^1147S9LB]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of vardenafil in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) due to traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 12-week study, 418 men aged 18 years and older with ED for more than 6 months consequent to SCI were randomized to vardenafil (n = 207) or placebo (n = 211) (10 mg for 4 weeks, then maintained or titrated to 5 or 20 mg at weeks 4 and 8). Efficacy assessments included the erectile function (EF) domain score of the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire and diary questions regarding penetration, maintenance of erection to completion of intercourse, and ejaculation.

Results

Baseline patient characteristics were similar in the vardenafil (mean age 40 years) and placebo (mean age 39 years) groups. Mean baseline EF domain scores were 11.6 in the vardenafil group and 12.1 (moderate ED) in the placebo group. EF domain score in the vardenafil group improved to 22.0 (mild ED) at last observation carried forward vs 13.5 in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Over 12 weeks of treatment, mean per-patient penetration (76% vs 41%), maintenance (59% vs 22%), and ejaculation (19% vs 10%) success rates were significantly greater vs placebo (all p < 0.001). The most frequently reported drug-related adverse events were headache (vardenafil 15%, placebo 4%), flushing (vardenafil 6%, placebo 0%), nasal congestion (vardenafil 5%, placebo 0%), and dyspepsia (vardenafil 4%, placebo 0%).

Conclusion

Vardenafil significantly improved erectile and ejaculatory function and was generally well tolerated in men with erectile dysfunction due to spinal cord injury.

### Phosphodiesterase inhibitors in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in spinal cord-injured men [^116VBeei]. Spinal Cord (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Open, before-after study.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors for erectile dysfunction (ED) in spinal cord-injured (SCI) patients.

Setting

Home- and clinic-based assessments in the outpatient department at the Centre Bouffard Vercelli, Cerbère France.

Methods

Clinic trials with Sildenafil (Viagra) on 120 patients, Tadalafil (Cialis) on 54 patients and Vardenafil (Levitra) on 66 patients were performed. Flexible doses of PDE5 inhibitors were given depending on efficacy and tolerability, from 50 to 100 mg for Sildenafil, and from 10 to 20 mg for Vardenafil and Tadalafil. Each trial was performed after a week's interval. The efficacy was self-assessed by the patients on a six-point quantitative scale assessment. The response to treatment was assessed at home in 90 patients (57 patients on Sildenafil, 12 patients on Vardenafil and 21 patients on Tadalafil) using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF).

Results

In clinic trials, PDE5 inhibitors were effective (rigidity enough for penetration) in 85% of the patients on Sildenafil, 74% of the patients on Vardenafil and 72% of the patients on Tadalafil. The mean duration of erection was 34, 28 and 26 min, respectively. Adverse effects were mild, usually attenuated with continued dosing. More than 70% of the patients on Vardenafil and Tadalafil required higher doses of 20 mg, whereas 50 mg of Sildenafil was effective in 55% of the patients. Two-thirds of our patients on Tadalafil reported a duration of action longer than 24 h. The presence of an upper motor neuron lesion was significantly associated with therapeutic success, lower motor neuron lesions and cauda equina patients were poor responders. Other variables such as completeness of lesion had no impact. In the follow-up visits, the IIEF global scores and three IIEF domains (erectile function, intercourse satisfaction and overall satisfaction) were significantly improved in all patients. Patients on Sildenafil showed a significant improvement of orgasmic function, ejaculation (Question 9) and orgasm (Question 10).

Conclusion

Sildenafil, Vardenafil and Tadalafil are all effective and well-tolerated treatments for ED in SCI patients. Although no statistical analysis could be applied on these data, these results might indicate that Sildenafil is more effective in treating ED. Clinic trials are important for proper dose titration and appropriate education of the patients.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^116A5Cmr]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) safety and counseling — men taking nitrates regularly should not use PDE5i medications, and in men with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment or men with spinal cord injury, PDE5i should be used with caution at least initially at lower doses; in men with severe renal or liver disease, use of PDE5i is generally not recommended. Given that incorrect use of PDE5i accounts for a large percentage of treatment failures, men should be carefully instructed in appropriate use, including that sexual stimulation is necessary and that more than one trial may be required, and initial doses may be titrated up or down until the optimal dose is identified.

### The management of neurogenic bladder and sexual dysfunction after spinal cord injury [^117WMK9C]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

Review article.

Objectives

To review the medical literature and comprehensively discuss the management of bladder and sexual dysfunction after spinal cord injury.

Summary Of Background Data

The physiologic alterations that accompany spinal cord injury can lead to significant bladder and sexual dysfunction. Fertility in men is also diminished. Without appropriate intervention, the above conditions can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.

Methods

Structured review of published reports obtained through a MED-LINE search and texts.

Results/Conclusion

With appropriate surveillance and management, morbidity and mortality from neurogenic bladder dysfunction can be successfully prevented. Current treatment interventions also facilitate the restoration of sexual function and fertility after spinal cord injury.

### Vardenafil improves ejaculation success rates and self-confidence in men with erectile dysfunction due to spinal cord injury [^116L3KDB]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.

Objective

To assess the effect of the oral phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, vardenafil, on ejaculation rates and self-confidence in men with spinal cord injury (SCI).

Summary Of Background Data

Spinal command of male sexual functions is often seriously impaired by traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). A high proportion of men with SCI cannot ejaculate during sexual intercourse. SCI-related ejaculatory disorders are often responsible for male infertility. Sexual dysfunction associated with SCI can also affect men's self-confidence.

Methods

In this 12-week study, 418 men aged ≥ 18 years with erectile dysfunction > 6 months resulting from a traumatic SCI were randomized to vardenafil (n = 207) or placebo (n = 211) 10 mg for 4 weeks, then maintained or titrated to 5 or 20 mg at weeks 4 and 8. Assessments included questions of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) about ejaculation success and orgasmic perception; the Global Confidence Question; and quality-of-life scales to measure psychological well-being, self-esteem, depression, and mental health status.

Results

Overall per patient ejaculation success rates were significantly greater with vardenafil than placebo over 12 weeks of treatment (19% vs. 10%; P < 0.001). At last observation carried forward, the IIEF "orgasmic function" score increased from 2.9 at baseline to 4.0 for vardenafil and from 3.0 at baseline to 3.4 for placebo. Sixteen percent of men receiving vardenafil and 8% receiving placebo felt orgasm "almost always" or "always" at weeks 8–12, compared with 4% and 6%, respectively, at baseline. Significant improvements in confidence scores were observed with vardenafil compared with placebo (P < 0.0001). There were no clinically significant differences between vardenafil and placebo in the quality-of-life measures at the study endpoint, but these had been in the normal range at baseline.

Conclusion

Vardenafil significantly improved ejaculation and self-confidence in men with erectile dysfunction due to SCI.

### Sildenafil citrate: lessons learned from 3 years of clinical experience [^113sDBqt]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2002). Low credibility.

In the 3 y since its initial approval, sildenafil has become the most widely used treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) and has been prescribed to more than 13 million patients worldwide. Significant improvements in erectile function have been demonstrated in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in diverse patient populations. A significant treatment effect has been shown with sildenafil in men with ED and a history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, minor depression, spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. In addition, promising results have been shown in patients with treated prostate cancer, end-stage renal disease, Parkinson's disease and spina bifida and in multiple-organ transplant recipients. Postmarketing data of the use of sildenafil in clinical practice confirm the efficacy and safety found in clinical trials and high satisfaction with treatment. Public awareness of the common occurrence of ED and the high likelihood of a potentially favorable response to an oral treatment increased dramatically with the introduction of sildenafil. Physicians, however, are still not comfortable with ED management, which negatively affects pharmacotherapy response rates and patients' compliance to treatment. Continuing medical education seems mandatory to overcome existing problems in ED management.

### Management of erectile dysfunction [^11623W7z]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most common sexual problem in men. The incidence increases with age and affects up to one third of men throughout their lives. It causes a substantial negative impact on intimate relationships, quality of life, and self-esteem. History and physical examination are sufficient to make a diagnosis of ED in most cases, because there is no preferred, first-line diagnostic test. Initial diagnostic workup should usually be limited to a fasting serum glucose level and lipid panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and morning total testosterone level. First-line therapy for ED consists of lifestyle changes, modifying drug therapy that may cause ED, and pharmacotherapy with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and smoking greatly increase the risk of ED. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are the most effective oral drugs for treatment of ED, including ED associated with diabetes mellitus, spinal cord injury, and antidepressants. Intraurethral and intracavernosal alprostadil, vacuum pump devices, and surgically implanted penile prostheses are alternative therapeutic options when phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors fail. Testosterone supplementation in men with hypogonadism improves ED and libido, but requires interval monitoring of hemoglobin, serum transaminase, and prostate-specific antigen levels because of an increased risk of prostate adenocarcinoma. Cognitive behavior therapy and therapy aimed at improving relationships may help to improve ED. Screening for cardiovascular risk factors should be considered in men with ED, because symptoms of ED present on average three years earlier than symptoms of coronary artery disease. Men with ED are at increased risk of coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular diseases.

### Treating erectile dysfunction and central neurological diseases with oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. review of the literature [^1142QZ2k]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is reported in a high percentage of patients with central neurological disorders (CND).

Aim

An up-to-date review on oral phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5): sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil for individuals with CND and ED.

Main Outcome Measures

Various questionnaires on ED, such as the International Index of Erectile Function composed of 15 questions.

Methods

Internationally published clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of PDE5 on subjects with CND and ED were selected.

Results

Overall, 28 articles on PDE5 used to treat patients with CND and ED were included. With each of the three PDE5 compared to placebo or erectile baseline, literature reported significant statistical improvement (P < 0.01; P < 0.05) only in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). PDE5 efficacy was documented for SCI patients up to 10 years. The most frequent predicable factor for PDE5 success was the presence of upper motoneuron lesion. Each of the three clinical sildenafil studies documented statistically significant improvement on erectile function in Parkinson's patients (P < 0.01; P < 0.05). Two studies reported discordant results about sildenafil's effectiveness on multiple sclerosis (MS) patients; one on tadalafil showed significant statistical efficacy on erection versus baseline (P < 0.01; P < 0.05). The only spina bifida article determined that sildenafil remarkably improved erectile function. Overall, drawbacks were mostly slight-moderate, except in subjects with multiple system atrophy where sildenafil caused severe hypotension.

Conclusions

PDE5 represent first line ED therapy only for SCI patients, though treatment results through meta-analysis were not possible. Encouraging results are reported for Parkinson's and MS patients. PDE5 use for other CND patients is limited for various reasons, such as ED and concomitant libido impairment caused by depression and/or sexual endocrinology dysfunctions, and because PDE5 may cause a worsening of neurological illness. Medical centers staffed by health professionals able to counsel patients on the possible use of PDE5 are needed.

European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Section 3: Assessment of Sexual Symptoms

Table 3 and Appendix S7 present the evidence supporting recommendations made for the assessment of sexual symptoms, and Figure 3 illustrates the assessment and treatment algorithm of sexual symptoms based on the recommendations.

Clinical question 26. Should neurologists obtain a history of a patient's sexual symptoms versus not asking about sexual symptoms? Should there be a multidimensional assessment about primary, secondary, and tertiary factors versus no multidimensional assessment?

History taking forms the cornerstone of the assessment, and this is summarised as a checklist in Table 5. High‐quality guidelines for individuals with neurological disease highlight the importance of a comprehensive medical and sexual history in evaluating sexual dysfunction, emphasising primary, secondary, and tertiary sexual dysfunctions. A detailed history should explore sexual dysfunction's nature, onset, and impact, including specific challenges faced by those with SCI or post‐stroke, considering both physical and psychosocial factors. Sexual orientation, relationship history, emotional well‐being, substance use, and previous treatments should also be assessed.

European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: The use of vibrators may be discussed with individuals with neurological diseases experiencing sexual problems. The benefits and potential risks/burdens should be discussed. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 85% in Delphi round 2).

Clinical Question 34. Should Vacuum Devices Be Used for Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Dysfunction vs. Placebo or no Treatment?

Individuals should consult healthcare professionals to select and learn to integrate appropriate vacuum devices into sexual relationships according to their preferences. While no guidelines address vacuum device use for female sexual issues, the FDA has approved a device to enhance female sexual function, addressing sensation, lubrication, and orgasmic ability.

Recommendations: Vacuum devices may be offered as a second‐line treatment to male individuals with neurological diseases who experience ED. The benefits and potential risks/burdens should be discussed. (Evidence‐based recommendation; Strength: weak; LoE III; Consensus: 88% for recommendation wording and 88% for recommendation strength).

To make an evidence‐based recommendation for female individuals, more research is required. However, the panel agrees that vacuum devices may be discussed with female individuals with neurological diseases having sexual arousal problems. (Consensus‐based recommendation; Consensus: 82% in Delphi round 2).

Clinical Question 35. Should Phosphodiesterase‐5 Inhibitors Be Used for Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Problems vs. Placebo or no Treatment?

Evidence supporting PDE5 inhibitors stems from two high‐quality guidelines and five randomized controlled trials across various neurological conditions, including SCI, MS, and PD. Given their potential side effects, PDE5 inhibitors should be prescribed by and discussed with a qualified healthcare professional.

Recommendation: PDE5 inhibitors should be offered as a first‐line treatment to male individuals with neurological diseases who experience ED. The benefits and potential risks/burdens should be discussed. (Evidence‐based recommendation; Strength: strong; LoE II; Consensus: 100% for recommendation wording, 97% for recommendation strength).

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^115NPifd]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of erectile dysfunction.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature using the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases (search dates 1/1/1965 to 7/29/17) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of erectile dysfunction. Evidence-based statements were based on body of evidence strength Grade A, B, or C and were designated as Strong, Moderate, and Conditional Recommendations with additional statements presented in the form of Clinical Principles or Expert Opinions.

Results

The American Urological Association has developed an evidence-based guideline on the management of erectile dysfunction. This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the associated treatment algorithm.

Conclusions

Using the shared decision-making process as a cornerstone for care, all patients should be informed of all treatment modalities that are not contraindicated, regardless of invasiveness or irreversibility, as potential first-line treatments. For each treatment, the clinician should ensure that the man and his partner have a full understanding of the benefits and risk/burdens associated with that choice.

### Sildenafil citrate: a therapeutic update [^117QZbxF]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in March 1998, sildenafil citrate has been used by millions of men for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Recent studies and consensus reports have expanded our understanding of its efficacy, safety, contraindications, and drug interactions.

Objective

This paper reviews recent studies of the efficacy of sildenafil, its adverse effects and drug interactions, and socioeconomic factors involved in its use, with a focus on specific patient populations (prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, spinal cord injuries, neurologic disorders).

Methods

Clinical studies, case reports, and commentaries and editorials concerning sildenafil published in the international literature between January 1999 and August 2000 were identified through searches of MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, using the terms sildenafil, Viagra, and erectile dysfunction.

Results

Sildenafil has demonstrated effectiveness in men with erectile dysfunction associated with prostatectomy, radiation therapy, diabetes mellitus, certain neurologic disorders, and drug therapy (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). It has not been as effective in women with sexual dysfunction, with the exception of SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction. Some disorders unrelated to sexual dysfunction (eg, esophageal motility dysfunction) may also respond to sildenafil. In the general population, sildenafil is considered to have an acceptable tolerability profile; however, patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking nitrate therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with sildenafil therapy. In addition, patients taking drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme, which metabolizes sildenafil, may experience increased drug concentrations and possible toxicity from normal doses of sildenafil.

Conclusions

Sildenafil is an effective first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction in men. The decision to prescribe this agent should include such considerations as the cost-risk-benefit balance, patient access, drug distribution pathways, and prescription drug coverage.

### Alprostadil (Caverject) [^116PTaAr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Erectile Dysfunction of Pure Neurogenic Etiology (e.g. Spinal Cord Injury).

Initiate dosing with 1.25 mcg of CAVERJECT intracavernosally, as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
If there is a partial response at 1.25 mcg, administer another dose of 1.25 mcg within 1 hour. Use a new vial for each dose of CAVERJECT.
If additional titration is required, administer a dose of 5 mcg at least 24 hours later.
During titration, no more than 2 doses should be given within a 24-hour period.
The optimal dose should produce an erection suitable for intercourse that does not exceed a duration of 1 hour.
The patient must stay in the health care provider's office until complete detumescence occurs.

Repeat the titration as necessary until the optimal dose is achieved. Doses greater than 60 mcg are not recommended.

Maintenance Dosage for Patient Home Use

Once the dose of CAVERJECT has been determined in the health care provider's office, additional dose adjustment may be required after consultation with the health care provider. Adjust the dose in accordance with the titration guidelines described above.
The recommended frequency of injection is no more than 3 times weekly, with at least 24 hours between each dose.

Adjunct to the Diagnosis of Erectile Dysfunction

As an adjunct to the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, inject CAVERJECT intracavernosally and monitor patients for the occurrence of an erection. Extensions of this testing are the use of CAVERJECT as an adjunct to laboratory investigations, such as duplex or Doppler ultrasound imaging. For any of these tests, use a single dose of CAVERJECT that induces a rigid erection. Use the dose regimen for ' Erectile Dysfunction of Vasculogenic, Psychogenic, or Mixed Etiology ' above.

### Sildenafil citrate [^114zWBsX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Efficacy Results from Controlled Clinical Studies

The effect on one of the major end points, maintenance of erections after penetration, is shown in Figure 6, for the pooled results of 5 fixed-dose, dose-response studies of greater than one month duration, showing response according to baseline function. Results with all doses have been pooled, but scores showed greater improvement at the 50 and 100 mg doses than at 25 mg. The pattern of responses was similar for the other principal question, the ability to achieve an erection sufficient for intercourse. The titration studies, in which most patients received 100 mg, showed similar results. Figure 6 shows that regardless of the baseline levels of function, subsequent function in patients treated with sildenafil was better than that seen in patients treated with placebo. At the same time, on-treatment function was better in treated patients who were less impaired at baseline.

Study selection

A total of 13,089 articles were identified after removing duplicates. After abstract screening, 75 articles were identified for full-text review. Twelve articles reporting outcomes for 12 RCTs with 14 comparisons met the inclusion criteria of the study (see Fig. 1). A search update did not reveal any new eligible studies for inclusion in the study. The interrater reliability of the total selection between the two researchers was excellent (Cohen's Kappa = 0.83). The study selection process and reasons for exclusion are displayed in Fig. 1.

PRISMA flowchart.

Characteristics of included studies

The characteristics of the 14 comparisons from 12 RCTs are described in Table 1 (references of included studies Supplementary References). The RCTs were conducted in Europe (k = 5, one from Sweden, two each from Germany and the Netherlands), Australia (k = 4), Canada (k = 1), Iran (k = 1), and the United States (k = 1). All studies were published between 2008 and 2021. One study received funding by a pharmaceutical company. The 12 RCTs included a total of 1152 participants. Eleven studies included target outcomes for the meta-analysis evaluating n = 952 participants at post-treatment, 488 in the intervention and 464 in the control groups. Sample sizes at post-treatment ranged from n = 28 to n = 200 (median = 68). In six studies, the individuals affected by a sexual dysfunction were male, and in the other six studies, the affected individuals were female. The treatments were mainly focused on the affected person, but active participation of a sexual partner via couple exercises was mandatory in eight studies. In the other four studies, participation of a sexual partner was optional. Eight interventions were addressed at heterosexual patients only. All IMIs for male sexual dysfunctions targeted erectile dysfunctions, and in one case, additionally premature ejaculation. Three IMIs for female sexual dysfunctions were aimed at multiple, simultaneous sexual dysfunctions, including problems with desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain, whereas two IMIs specifically treated Genito-Pelvic Pain-Penetration Disorder, and one IMI targeted sexual distress associated with sexual difficulties. Of the 12 RCTs, five studies included samples in which sexual dysfunctions were related to a history of a medical disorder (prostate, gynecological, and breast cancer, and spinal cord injury). The average of mean age reported in 10 of the 12 RCTs was 41.55 years (SD = 10.77).

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials. We imposed no restrictions concerning language or publication status.

Types of participants

We defined the eligible participants as adult men with erectile dysfunction, irrespective of the type and pathologic basis. We also included trials of men with erectile dysfunction and eligible comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disorders, spinal cord injury, prostate cancer and diabetes (Khera 2011).

We included trials in which only a subset of participants was eligible as long as data were available separately for the relevant subsets.

Types of interventions

We planned to evaluate the following comparisons of experimental intervention versus comparator intervention.

Experimental interventions

Ginseng regardless of species (e.g. P. ginseng, P. quinquefolius and P. notoginseng), processed status (e.g. white ginseng or red ginseng, tissue cultured), cultivated place (cultivated, wild planted in mountain), or dose (e.g. daily or weekly)
Ginseng plus conventional treatment

We included trials in which ginseng was the only treatment or ginseng was given with other conventional treatments, as long as the same conventional treatment was provided to both groups. Conventional treatment interventions included phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil), injection (e.g. intracavernosal alprostadil), vacuum devices or psychosexual counseling (EAU 2020; Khera 2011).

We excluded studies in which ginseng formed part of a complex herbal medicine or herbal or dietary supplements. We also excluded studies in which other parts of the ginseng root were used.

Comparator interventions

Placebo

### European Academy of Neurology (EAN) / European federation of autonomic societies (EFAS) / international neuro-urology society (INUS) guidelines for practising neurologists on the assessment and treatment of neurogenic urinary and sexual symptoms (NEUROGED guidelines) [^115aToxo]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urodynamics testing is useful for evaluating the cause of lower urinary tract dysfunction and should be performed selectively.

Recommendation: Invasive urodynamic testing is not recommended as part of the initial evaluation for individuals with neurological diseases and urinary symptoms. However, if individuals exhibit atypical urinary symptoms, are at a high risk of upper urinary tract damage, or have not experienced improvement with conservative treatment options, it is recommended that they be referred for urodynamic testing. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 91%).

Clinical Question 10. Should there be red flags that initiate a urological referral for individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms versus place a urological referral for all individuals versus not to refer to urology services?

Individuals at low risk for developing upper urinary tract damage can generally be managed by a neurologist. This would include those with a neurological lesion that is either suprapontine (e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease (PD) or infrasacral), who are able to spontaneously void with low PVR volumes and do not require a catheter to empty the bladder, have stable urinary symptoms, no history of recurrent UTIs, normal renal functions, and, if the individual has undergone tests, synergistic voiding in urodynamics testing and normal upper tract imaging. Following an acute neurological event, risk should be stratified only once the neurological condition has stabilized. The management of individuals with greater risk for developing upper urinary tract damage (such as spinal cord injury, elevated PVR volumes, requiring catheterisation) or urinary symptoms refractory to first‐line treatment should be shared between neurologists and urologists.

Recommendation: Individuals with neurological diseases reporting urinary symptoms should be referred to urologists if there is a risk of developing upper urinary tract damage, suspected urological pathology, or poor response or significant side effects to first‐line treatments. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 100%).

### Vardenafil improves urodynamic parameters in men with spinal cord injury: results from a single dose, pilot study [^114QK6WU]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We assessed urodynamic changes after vardenafil administration in spinal cord injured male patients on oxybutynin treatment.

Materials and Methods

We performed a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in 25 patients with spinal cord injury who had erectile dysfunction and micturition disorders. A baseline urodynamic test was performed as well as a second urodynamic test 1 to 3 hours after the administration of 20 mg vardenafil and placebo in 15 and 10 cases, respectively. In all patients standard oral oxybutynin administration was not discontinued. Statistical assessment included the 3 urodynamic parameters maximum detrusor pressure during voiding, maximum cystometric capacity and detrusor overactivity volume.

Results

Placebo administration did not affect urodynamic parameters. After vardenafil administration maximum detrusor pressure was significantly decreased (59.3 vs 52.1 cm H(2)O, p < 0.001) and maximum cystometric capacity considerably improved (233.5 vs 272 ml, p < 0.001). The most dramatic variations were observed for detrusor overactivity volume (174 vs 218 ml, p < 0.0001). In 7 patients with American Spinal Injury Association classification A and spinal cord injury above T6 we observed the most significant improvement in the evaluated urodynamic items, including maximum detrusor pressure 57 vs 52 cm H(2)O (p = 0.039), maximum cystometric capacity 253 vs 296 mL (p = 0.004) and detrusor overactivity volume 177 vs 229 mL (p = 0.003).

Conclusions

This trial demonstrates that in spinal cord injured patients a single 20 mg vardenafil administration achieved a significant decrease in maximum detrusor pressure, an improvement in maximum cystometric capacity and a remarkable increase in detrusor overactivity volume value.

### Sildenafil [^113XU9Dj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

One randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study included only patients with erectile dysfunction attributed to complications of diabetes mellitus (n = 268). As in the other titration studies, patients were started on 50 mg and allowed to adjust the dose up to 100 mg or down to 25 mg of sildenafil tablets; all patients, however, were receiving 50 mg or 100 mg at the end of the study. There were highly statistically significant improvements on the two principal IIEF questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) on sildenafil tablets compared to placebo. On a global improvement question, 57% of sildenafil tablets patients reported improved erections versus 10% on placebo. Diary data indicated that on sildenafil tablets, 48% of intercourse attempts were successful versus 12% on placebo.

One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, flexible-dose (up to 100 mg) study of patients with erectile dysfunction resulting from spinal cord injury (n = 178) was conducted. The changes from baseline in scoring on the two end point questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) were highly statistically significantly in favor of sildenafil tablets. On a global improvement question, 83% of patients reported improved erections on sildenafil tablets versus 12% on placebo. Diary data indicated that on sildenafil tablets, 59% of attempts at sexual intercourse were successful compared to 13% on placebo.

### Penile prosthetic surgery in neurologically impaired patients: long-term followup [^113PBkxV]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Penile prosthetics are a viable option for erectile dysfunction in neurologically impaired patients. Penile implants can also be used to facilitate the management of urinary drainage when penile retraction has made this difficult.

Materials and Methods

Between 1980 and 1996, 245 neurologically impaired patients with a mean age of 40.8 years (range 16 to 75), including 188 with paraplegia, 57 with quadriplegia and 197 with spinal cord injuries, were treated for erectile dysfunction and/or urinary incontinence with penile prosthesis implantation. The mean history of paralysis was 11.2 years (range 1 to 52). After neuro-urological evaluation all patients included in this study were considered candidates for penile prosthesis implantation. A followup program for treatment success, patient satisfaction, problems and complications was subsequently initiated.

Results

During 17 years a total of 293 surgical procedures in 245 patients were done with the implantation of 147 semirigid (Jonas), 113 self-contained inflatable (Dynaflex) and 33 inflatable 3-piece (AMS 700) prostheses. There were 3 patient groups based on the indication for penile prosthetic surgery, namely group 1–134 patients with urinary management only, group 2–60 with erectile dysfunction only, and group 3–51 with urinary management and erectile dysfunction. At a mean followup of 7.2 years (maximum 17) 195 patients were reevaluated in clinic. In 122 patients (90.3%) urinary management problems were resolved. Erectile dysfunction treatment was successful in 76 patients (82.6%). There were 43 revisions for technical reasons and infections. The infection rate was 5% (12 patients). The perforation rate was different for different implant devices, that is 18.1% (15 of 83 cases) for semirigid devices, 2.4% (2 of 84) for self-contained inflatable devices and 0% (0 of 28) for inflatable 3-piece devices.

Conclusions

The implantation of a penile prosthesis is a safe procedure for erectile dysfunction and/or urinary incontinence in neurologically impaired patients. Based on technical advances the complication rates significantly decreased during the years. The implantation of an inflatable 3-piece penile prosthesis in a neurologically impaired patient is a safe and viable procedure. Indications include the management of erectile dysfunction and problematic urinary collection.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^111ejDpg]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Study reporting

All studies provided background information on participants. Typically men had to have a history of erectile dysfunction of at least three to six months, and the average age of men was generally in the mid 50s or older. Some studies had an enriched enrolment in which previous unsuccessful treatment with a PDE-5 inhibitor was an exclusion criterion. This applied to five of eight tadalafil studies, and six of seven vardenafil studies [see Additional file 1], but none of the sildenafil studies. One vardenafil study included only men previously unresponsive to sildenafil.

Studies almost always documented that PDE-5 inhibitor was to be taken as needed to a maximum of one treatment a day, with the additional instruction for sildenafil and vardenafil that the dose be taken about an hour before intercourse. Some studies gave information on the number of doses actually taken. Many of the dose optimised studies reported the proportion of men on maximum dose at the end of the study, which was always over 50%, and typically 60–80%. Trial duration was typically four to 12 weeks, with 12 weeks the commonest duration.

A number of different conditions causing erectile dysfunction were studied (Table 1). All three PDE-5 inhibitors had a similar proportion of men with mixed aetiology (organic, psychogenic, or mixed) and diabetes. Erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy was studied for tadalafil and vardenafil, but not sildenafil; none of a number of studies of sildenafil after prostatectomy could be included, mainly because they were not randomised. With sildenafil, a variety of additional conditions were studied, including depression, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, coronary heart disease, radiotherapy for prostate cancer, renal failure and haemodialysis patients, rectal surgery and spina bifida.

Many studies were multicentre, often performed in different countries (Table 2). Europe, North America and Australia accounted for most of the men in the studies for tadalafil and vardenafil. Sildenafil studies in addition were reported from South America, Asia, and Africa.

Erectile dysfunction (ED): etiology, prevalence, and impact

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the persistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual intercourse for at least three months. The etiology of ED is multifactorial, encompassing vascular, neurological, hormonal, and psychological components. Additional contributors include general health status, obstructive sleep apnea, and mental health disorders.

Vascular factors are the leading cause of ED and are frequently associated with cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, low high‑density lipoprotein levels, obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus (DM), and insulin resistance. These conditions induce endothelial dysfunction and impair vasodilation, thereby reducing penile blood flow and compromising filling of the corpora cavernosa. Persistent inflammation and oxidative stress — particularly in the context of obesity and diabetes — further exacerbate vascular injury and diminish erectile function. Lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption significantly increase the risk of ED by promoting vascular dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, and the development of metabolic syndrome.

Neurogenic ED, which accounts for approximately 10–19% of cases, arises from disruption of central or peripheral neural pathways, as observed in spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and diabetic or other peripheral neuropathies.

Hormonal dysregulation — including hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disorders, and Cushing's syndrome — impairs erectile function through effects on libido, vascular tone, and smooth‑muscle responsiveness. Structural abnormalities of the penis, such as Peyronie's disease — which involves fibrous plaque formation within the tunica albuginea — can lead to painful, curved erections and hinder maintenance of a functional erection due to both mechanical distortion and associated pain. Traumatic injuries, for example penile fracture (rupture of the tunica albuginea with resultant hematoma and scarring), can damage erectile tissues by reducing blood flow and compromising cavernosal expansion and vascular integrity, often precipitating ED.

European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra) and sexual symptoms are commonly reported by individuals with neurological disorders. The relationship between neurological disease, urogenital dysfunction, and quality of life has been well researched, and urinary tract‐related complications are one of the commonest causes for unplanned hospital admissions in multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and spinal cord injury (SCI). Sexual health is a significant component of overall well‐being and quality of life, and neurogenic sexual dysfunction significantly impacts mental health and relationships. Urinary dysfunction and symptoms differ according to the topographic distribution of neurological lesions: suprapontine disorders such as stroke, PD, and traumatic brain injury present predominantly with urinary storage symptoms due to detrusor overactivity (DO) and normal voiding, whereas suprasacral spinal cord disorders such as transverse myelitis, SCI, and MS present with urinary storage and voiding symptoms due to DO and detrusor‐external sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). In contrast, lesions affecting the sacral spinal cord (conus medullaris) or more caudally such as the sacral nerve roots (cauda equina) or peripheral nerves, typically resulting from conditions such as disc prolapse, pelvic surgery, or peripheral neuropathy primarily present with urinary voiding symptoms due to detrusor underactivity, although storage symptoms can also occur. Co‐morbid urological and medical conditions such as benign prostate enlargement and pelvic organ prolapse can additionally contribute to urinary symptoms.

Subgroup analyses of responses to a global improvement question in patients with psychogenic etiology in two fixed-dose studies (total n = 179) and two titration studies (total n = 149) showed 84% of VIAGRA patients reported improvement in erections compared with 26% of placebo. The changes from baseline in scoring on the two end point questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) were highly statistically significantly in favor of VIAGRA. Diary data in two of the studies (n = 178) showed rates of successful intercourse per attempt of 70% for VIAGRA and 29% for placebo.

Efficacy Results in Subpopulations in Controlled Clinical Studies

A review of population subgroups demonstrated efficacy regardless of baseline severity, etiology, race and age. VIAGRA was effective in a broad range of ED patients, including those with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, other cardiac disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, depression, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), radical prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and spinal cord injury, and in patients taking antidepressants/antipsychotics and anti-hypertensives/diuretics.

3 Results

Two rounds of Delphi voting were conducted with 100% participation from the task force, and all the recommendation wordings and strengths ultimately achieved at least 80% consensus. Eleven clinical questions had sufficient evidence to make evidence‐based recommendations, and the strength of six met the criteria for being strong. Nineteen good practice statements and eight consensus‐based recommendations were made for the remaining clinical questions. Results of the literature search, data synthesis, and Delphi voting are provided as Supporting Information (Appendices). Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 summarise the evidence supporting recommendations for the assessment and treatment of urinary and sexual symptoms. Based on the recommendations, algorithms that illustrate the assessment and treatment of urinary and sexual symptoms were developed (Figures 1 and 2). Enlarged versions of these algorithms suitable for use in clinic are also available (Appendices S9 and S10). Table 5 presents a practical checklist of urogenital symptoms that should be covered during history taking.

### Epidural spinal cord stimulation facilitates immediate restoration of dormant motor and autonomic supraspinal pathways after chronic neurologically complete spinal cord injury [^113sWXmk]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Medium credibility.

After these initial reports, questions arose regarding the ability to generalize this therapy to the broader SCI population. A key first question is whether radiographically severe injuries would obviate meaningful restoration of function with eSCS. Numerous mechanisms underlying the observed motor recovery during eSCS have been proposed and include large diameter afferent activation leading to increased net excitability of caudal circuits, recruitment of spared descending fibers, and potentially segmental disinhibition. Based on these hypotheses, partial sparing of descending tracts through the injured spinal cord remains critical, but the most minimal amount of axonal preservation to achieve meaningful functional improvement with eSCS has not been determined.

A second key question is whether eSCS can improve function in participants with long-term chronic SCI, who are typically at more advanced ages. The average time from injury in the general population is close to 20 years; however, the maximum time since injury in the currently reported eSCS studies for SCI is four years with a maximum age of 32 years. A third key question is whether the pattern of recovery is consistent and predictable when comparing individuals. Given the complexity of the spinal cord and target muscles, systematic and quantitative assessment of patterns of recovery with useful summary measures may facilitate more generalizable results across trials with the goal of refining patient selection and expectations as well as designing optimal rehabilitation solutions.

A final key question, which remains of significant interest to individuals with SCI, is whether eSCS can restore autonomic control of cardiovascular, bowel, bladder, and sexual function. Most recently, studies involving men and women 35 years of age or younger have explored improvements in bowel, bladder, sexual, and cardiovascular function. Further exploration of these findings in a wider demographic in terms of age and years since injury will help determine the potential applicability of this intervention in the general SCI population.

We present the initial findings from the Epidural Stimulation After Neurologic Damage clinical trial (E-STAND, Trial Number: NCT03026816), designed to address these key questions. We designed the E-STAND trial to begin to answer some of these questions by enrolling a generalizable patient population, quantitatively assessing the effects of eSCS on the restoration of volitional muscle activity, and assessing autonomic effects including cardiovascular, bowel, bladder, and sexual function.

### DA-8159, a new PDE5 iihibitor, induces penile erection in conscious and acute spinal cord injured rabbits [^112hAgzu]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

DA-8159 is a pyrazolopyrimidinone derivative showing potent and selective phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibition. In the previous study, DA-8159 induced a dose-dependent increase in the intracavernous pressure (ICP) in anaesthetized dogs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of DA-8159 on penile erection in conscious and acute spinal cord injured (ASCI) rabbits.

Methods

DA-8159 was given orally (0.3 to 10mg/kg) to normal rabbits and ASCI rabbits with a surgical transection of the spinal cord at the L2-L4 lumbar vertebra or ischemic-reperfusion. The erection was evaluated in a time-course manner by measuring the length of the uncovered penile mucosa in the absence or presence of intravenous sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a nitric oxide (NO) donor.

Results

DA-8159 induced a dose-dependent penile erection in both the conscious and ASCI rabbits. The efficacy of DA-8159 was potentiated and the effective doses were significantly decreased by an intravenous injection of SNP. Potentiation of the effect by a nitric oxide donor implies that DA-8159 can enhance the erectile activity during sexual arousal.

Conclusion

These results demonstrate that DA-8159 may be a useful treatment option for erectile dysfunction in patients with or without a spinal cord injury, but further evaluation of the effects of DA-8159 on humans must be performed.

2.2	Recommended Dosage for Erectile Dysfunction

Erectile Dysfunction of Vasculogenic, Psychogenic, or Mixed Etiology.

Initiate dosing with 2.5 mcg of CAVERJECT IMPULSE intracavernousally as recommended [see Dosage and Administration 2.4].
If there is a partial response at 2.5 mcg, administer another dose of 2.5 mcg within 1 hour.
During titration, no more than 2 doses should be given within a 24-hour period.
If additional titration is required, administer doses in increments of 5 to 10 mcg at least 24 hours apart.
The optimal dose should produce an erection suitable for intercourse that does not exceed a duration of 1 hour.
The patient must stay in the health care provider's office until complete detumescence occurs.

Repeat the titration as necessary until the optimal dose is achieved. Doses greater than 60 mcg are not recommended.

Erectile Dysfunction of Pure Neurogenic Etiology (Spinal Cord Injury):

Initiate dosing with 1.25 mcg of alprostadil using CAVERJECT.
If there is a partial response, administer another dose of CAVERJECT of 1.25 mcg within 1 hour.
No more than 2 doses during initial titration should be given within a 24-hour period.
If additional titration is required, administer a dose of 5 mcg at least 24 hours later.
The optimal dose should produce an erection suitable for intercourse that does not exceed a duration of 1 hour.
The patient must stay in the health care provider's office until complete detumescence occurs.

Repeat the titration as necessary until the optimal dose is achieved. Doses greater than 60 mcg are not recommended.

Maintenance Dosage for Patient Home Use:

Once the dose of CAVERJECT IMPULSE has been determined in the health care provider's office, additional dose adjustment may be required after consultation with the health care provider. Adjust the dose in accordance with the titration guidelines described above.
The recommended frequency of injection is no more than 3 times weekly, with at least 24 hours between each dose.

Adjunct to the Diagnosis of Erectile Dysfunction

To diagnose erectile dysfunction (pharmacologic testing), inject CAVERJECT IMPULSE intracavernosally and monitor patients for the occurrence of an erection. Extensions of this testing are the use of CAVERJECT as an adjunct to laboratory investigations, such as duplex or Doppler imaging. For any of these tests, use a single dose of CAVERJECT IMPULSE that induces a rigid erection. Use the dose regimen for 'Erectile Dysfunction of Vasculogenic, Psychogenic, or Mixed Etiology' above.

Clinical Question 36. Should Prostaglandins Be Used for Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Problems vs. Placebo or no Treatment?

Intracavernous prostaglandin injections can be a treatment especially when oral PDE5 inhibitors fail or are not advisable due to severe cardiovascular conditions (like unstable angina, recent stroke or heart attack, or significant liver impairment), following high‐quality guidelines for individuals with neurological disease. This treatment should be offered by a trained professional.

Recommendation: Intracavernous injections of prostaglandin should be offered as a second‐line treatment to male individuals with neurological diseases who experience ED. The benefits and potential risks/burdens should be discussed. (Evidence‐based recommendation; Strength: weak; LoE: III; Consensus: 91% for recommendation wording, 82% for recommendation strength).

Clinical question 37. Should treatment of secondary causes (e.g. spasticity/fatigue/incontinence/pain/depression) and tertiary causes (e.g. loss of self‐esteem/poor body image) be offered to individuals with neurological disease reporting sexual problems vs no treatment?

Secondary and tertiary factors contributing to sexual dysfunction (listed in Table 5) should be addressed and managed.

Recommendation: Multidimensional factors interfering with sexual activity and intimacy (including secondary factors such as spasticity, fatigue, incontinence, cognitive co‐morbidities, medication side effects and tertiary factors such as changes in self or body image) should be addressed in individuals with neurological disorders experiencing sexual problems. Given their dynamic nature, these factors should be discussed on a regular basis. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 100%).

### Effects of neuronal and glial restricted precursor cells transplantation on erectile function after experimentally induced spinal cord injury [^114JjRZe]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erectile dysfunction is common among patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).

Aim

This study aims to investigate the recovery of penile erectile functions of the rats with spinal cord injury (SCI) following transplantation of endogenous neuronal precursors cell (neuronal restricted precursors [NRP]/glial restricted precursors [GRP]) into the injured area of spinal cord.

Methods

Twenty-two rats were experimented in three groups. Group 1 (N = 6): Sham; Group 2 (N = 10): SCI + NRP/GRP transplanted in day 9 after operation; Group 3 (N = 6): SCI + culture medium transplanted in day 9 after operation. Analysis of penile reflexes and cavernosal nerve stimulation studies were performed in day 28 after transplantation for each group. All rats in three groups were then sacrificed and the injured regions of spinal cords underwent histological investigation.

Main Outcome Measures

These results show improvements to some extent in locomotor and erectile functions although these improvements are far from full functional recovery.

Results

Cavernosal nerve stimulation resulted in significantly higher intracavernosal pressure in Group 3 (SCI) although there was no difference between Group 1 (sham) and Group 2 (SCI + NRP/GRP). Number of clusters was similar between groups. Number of erections was higher in Group 3 (SCI) than Groups 1 and 2, and number of cups was higher in Group 2 (SCI + NRP/GRP) than the other two groups. Number of flips was similar in Groups 1 and 2 but lower in Group 3. Number of long flips was highest in Group 1 and lowest in Group 3. The differences between groups were significant.

Conclusion

This study emphasized the healing potential of NRP/GRP transplantation following experimental SCI. However, further experimental and clinical studies are required to advance this treatment modality.

Clinical question 23. What is the clinical effectiveness of cholinergic drugs versus placebo or non‐pharmacological measures, or comparison with different pharmacological interventions or no treatment be offered for individuals with neurological disease and neurogenic urinary symptoms?

Cholinergic drugs are expected to improve voiding function in individuals with detrusor underactivity by activating muscarinic receptors. However, the evidence supporting their use is limited due to the low quality of studies.

Recommendation: There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of cholinergic drugs to promote bladder emptying in individuals with neurological diseases having urinary retention due to detrusor underactivity. (Consensus‐based recommendation; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical question 24. What is the clinical effectiveness of desmopressin versus placebo or non‐pharmacological measures, or comparison with different pharmacological interventions or no treatment for individuals with neurological disease and neurogenic urinary symptoms?

Desmopressin, a synthetic arginine‐vasopressin analogue, reduces urine volume by promoting water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts and the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Taken at bedtime, desmopressin has been shown to reduce nocturnal urine production and nocturia.

Recommendation: Desmopressin may be offered to selected individuals with neurological diseases who experience nocturia or nocturnal polyuria that affects their quality of life. The benefits and potential risks/burdens should be discussed. (Consensus‐based recommendation; Consensus: 91%).

Clinical question 25. What is the clinical effectiveness of α 1 ‐adrenoceptor blockers versus placebo or non‐pharmacological measures, or comparison with different pharmacological interventions or no treatment for individuals with neurological disease and neurogenic urinary symptoms?

α 1 ‐adrenoceptor blockers reduce bladder outlet resistance by decreasing urethral resistance and are recommended for use in individuals with neurological disease. They have been shown to improve urinary storage symptoms and emptying in individuals with SCI, PD, and MS.

Recommendation: α 1 ‐adrenoceptor blockers could be offered to select individuals with neurological diseases who experience voiding symptoms. The benefits and potential risks/burdens should be discussed. (Evidence‐based recommendation; Strength: weak; LoE III; Consensus: 100% recommendation for wording and 82% for recommendation strength in Delphi round 2).

### Minimally invasive infrapubic inflatable penile prosthesis implant for erectile dysfunction: evaluation of efficacy, satisfaction profile and complications [^112dwTKg]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2015). Low credibility.

To date, many non-surgical treatments have been developed with results that are controversial. When first-line pharmaceuticals such as phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors fail, intracavernous injection (ICI), vacuum devices or intraurethral alprostadil are options considered. Medical therapy can help in improving QoL and erectile function, but unfortunately the literature describes a drop-out rate of up to 80%. Surgical treatment, usually performed after the failure of medical therapy, has reached high levels of satisfaction albeit at the cost of undergoing surgery. Inflatable penile prostheses (IPP) implant, although invasive, is associated with better sexual function, perception and with patient and partner's high satisfaction. Penile prosthesis implantation can lead to complications that require prosthesis repair, explants or replacement. Fluid leak from the device, supersonic transport deformity, cylinder's aneurismal dilatation and extrusion are reported as the most common mechanical failures. On the other hand, infections remain the most common and serious surgical complications with the risk of further penile shortening, urethral injury with erosion and tissue loss. Patients affected by diabetes, immunosuppression or spinal cord injury are at increased risk of infectious complications. In the case of prosthesis failure, in order to avoid infectious risk, it has been suggested to perform a complete replacement of the equipment. Infectious mechanisms have been well studied, and are characterized by bacterial implantation on the surface of the device creating a biofilm that avoid the immune system and antibiotics to exert their effect. At this time cylinders, pump and tubing of the three-piece IPP are impregnated with antibiotics (rifampicin and minocycline), which have been associated with the reduction in postoperative infections.

The aim of the study is to report outcomes of prosthesis implant in patients suffering from ED not responding to conventional medical therapy or reporting side effects with such a therapy. We investigate intraoperative and postoperative complications with infrapubic inflatable prosthesis implantation. As a secondary outcome, patient satisfaction and erectile function are reported.

Clinical Question 31. Should Education Be Offered to Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Problems vs. Should Not Be Offered?

Healthcare professionals should discuss issues related to sexual function, sexual activity, and sexuality with their patients while respecting professional boundaries and considering the individual's interest.

Recommendation: Individuals with neurological diseases having sexual problems should be informed about factors that can impact sexual activity and intimacy. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 32. Should Lubricants Be Used for Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Problems vs. no Treatment?

When suggesting the use of lubricants, it is important to consider compatibility with condoms, individual sensitivity, and the presence of possible skin irritants. There are several available products on the market, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend using one product type over another.

Recommendation: Vaginal lubricants may be considered for female individuals with neurological diseases who experience dyspareunia or vaginal dryness. The benefits and potential risks/burdens should be discussed. (Consensus‐based recommendation; Consensus: 97%).

Clinical Question 33. Should Vibrators Be Used for Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Problems vs. no Treatment?

Evidence on the use of vibrators for individuals with neurological disease is limited, primarily based on expert opinion without randomised controlled trials. Individuals should consult trained healthcare professionals to select suitable vibrators and consider contraindications and risks.

### Erectile dysfunction: update on clinical management [^114x31jN]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common condition affecting patients' quality of life. Clinical management has changed over the past three decades, with new diagnostic and therapeutic options available. Our aim was to provide an overview of novel evidence regarding clinical management of ED.

Methods

A non-systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant studies on the diagnosis and treatment of erectile dysfunction. The review encompassed pharmacological, regenerative, and surgical approaches, summarising recent advances and highlighting persisting gaps in clinical practice.

Key Findings and Limitations

ED is a common reason for seeking medical consultation. The correlation between ageing and ED prevalence is rooted in neurovascular tissue impairment. Medical history, along with the use of validated questionnaires, still represents the mainstay of ED assessment because of the lack of reliable imaging tests. The most widely used and effective treatment is an oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, but this is lifelong therapy that is associated with high dropout rates. Among novel regenerative treatments, low-intensity shockwave therapy is supported by more evidence, although high-quality trials and long-term data are lacking. More conclusive evidence is needed for platelet-rich plasma injections and stem cell treatment. Botulinum neurotoxin and new emerging oral drugs are also under investigation.

Conclusions

Several treatment options are available for ED. Clinical tailoring of treatment for individual patients and rigorous research are crucial for further advances.

Patient Summary

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common medical problem. Various types of treatment can improve ED, but there is still no cure for this condition.

Patients and Methods

Patients included in the present study from October 2019 to September 2022 were from a prospective, single-center, all-comers, investigator-initiated registry based on data from patients with ED due to venous leak of one or more erection-related efferent veins and unsatisfactory response or adverse side effects to PDE5i medication or contraindications for their use. Data were collected and subsequently anonymized through a routine quality management information system.

Prior to vascular workup, all patients were investigated by a board-certified urologist. In addition, all patients underwent ample laboratory testing including renal function, cholesterol and testosterone levels. Venous leak was diagnosed and quantified by penile duplex ultrasound and contrast-enhanced computed tomography cavernosography. Key exclusion criteria for endovascular treatment according to site's standard of care were non-vascular causes of ED including penile anatomic defects, spinal cord injury, and primary psychogenic disorders.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^115mZ3yd]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Almost 300,000 people in the United States live with a spinal cord injury (SCI). The majority of patients (74%–80%) with SCI report urologic dysfunction. Common urinary symptoms associated with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) include urinary incontinence, frequency, urgency, and retention, in addition to increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). These symptoms can cause unexpected hospitalizations, social isolation, and significant economic burdens while also having a profound impact on quality of life (QoL). In fact, some individuals with SCI (both tetraplegic and paraplegic) both assign greater importance to improving bladder and bowel function than mobility.

One SCI‐related condition is autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a condition characterized by episodic, uncontrolled elevation of systolic blood pressure (SBP), with or without baroreflex‐mediated bradycardia. AD occurs with injuries above the T6 level, and the risk for developing AD increases with higher levels of SCI, with up to 90% of patients with cervical or thoracic spinal cord injury being at risk. AD symptoms can occur up to 40 times per day and include debilitating headaches, sweating, flushing of the skin, piloerection, stuffy nose, blurred vision, and anxiety. The severity of these episodes ranges from silent to life‐threatening and can result in myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, or death. Common triggers of AD are caused most frequently by bladder or rectal distension.

Most patients with SCI require both bladder and bowel management emptying strategies as they are often unable to void on their own. Management options for NLUTD include reflexive voiding, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), indwelling catheterization (IDC; urethral or suprapubic), or surgery, such as bladder augmentation (with or without a catheterizable channel), urinary diversion, or continent pouch. Of these management types, CIC has traditionally been the first‐line treatment given its association with fewer urologic complications. However, recent prospective data from the Neurogenic Bladder Research Group Spinal Cord Injury Registry (NBRG‐SCI) showed that those using IDC and surgery reported improved urinary‐specific QoL scores compared to CIC. This suggests that many factors may impact how a SCI person perceives urinary‐specific QoL.

### Predictive factors of male sexual dysfunction after traumatic spinal cord injury [^112ZEkwk]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Observational study (Ethics Committee Number 973.648).

Objective

Evaluating the social and clinical factors associated with sexual dysfunction in men with traumatic spinal cord injury, as well as predictive factors for sexual dysfunction.

Summary Of Background Data

Besides the motor and sensory loss, sexual function changes after spinal cord injury, ranging from decreased sexual desire to erectile disorders, orgasm, and ejaculation.

Methods

Performed with 45 men, with traumatic spinal cord injury and sexually active. Sexual function was assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function and the level and degree of injury were determined following guidelines of International Standards for Neurological and Functional Examination Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. Bi and multivariate analysis was applied, with a 0.05 significance level.

Results

Forty-five subjects with mean injury time of 7.5 years (CI 5.2–9.9) were evaluated. Having a fixed partner is a protective factor (OR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.07–0.92) of erectile dysfunction. Sexual desire is associated with the fixed partner (OR: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02–0.66), masturbation (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.02–0.62), and sexual intercourse in the last month (OR: 0.13; 95% IC: 0.01–0.92). Ejaculation (OR: 0.01; 95% CI: 0.00–0.15) and erectile dysfunction (OR: 15.7; 95% CI: 1.38–178.58) are associated with orgasm. Psychogenic erection (OR: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01–0.69), monthly frequency of sexual intercourse (OR: 11.3; 95% CI: 2.0–62.8), and orgasmic dysfunction (OR: 7.1; 95% CI: 1.1–44.8) are associated with satisfaction.

Conclusion

Fixed partner, ejaculation, masturbation are protective factors for sexual dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction, orgasmic, and infrequent sex dysfunction are predictors of sexual dysfunction.

### How to avoid and manage nerve injuries associated with aortic surgery: ischemic neuropathy, traction injuries, and sexual derangements [^116efT73]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Both open and endovascular surgery of the infrarenal aorta are attended by risks of neurologic complications. Injury to the periaortic autonomic plexi frequently results in ejaculatory and erectile dysfunction. Traction injuries to lumbosacral nerve roots can cause peripheral nerve injury, most commonly exhibited as a femoral nerve deficit. The least common but most feared neurologic complication that can occur with infrarenal aortic surgery is ischemic injury to the spinal cord, or conus medullaris. The risk of this complication is increased with emergent or complicated aortic reconstructions. The importance of internal iliac artery perfusion to the development of ischemic cord and nerve root injury has been recognized. Although some neurologic complications may be avoidable by technical modifications, there is a small and probably irreducible neurologic risk to aortic surgery that should be considered when weighing options for treatment of aortic pathology.

### Spina bifida health-care guidelines for men's health [^111Rez5D]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Spina bifida has traditionally been regarded as a pediatric health issue with little regard to adult consequences of the disorder. The congenital neurologic and urologic anomalies, as well as sequelae of bladder management, can have a profound impact on adult male sexual function. Abnormalities in testicular descent, development, and function; fertility; penile sensation; erectile function; ejaculatory function; and orgasmic function are common. Prostate cancer has been diagnosed in men with spina bifida, but little data are available to guide screening, diagnosis, and treatment efforts. The Spina Bifida Association has supported development of guidelines for health care providers to address male health issues in individuals with spina bifida throughout their lives.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^112qUU3o]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — guideline statements for erectile dysfunction (ED) state: Men presenting with symptoms of ED should undergo a thorough medical, sexual and psychosocial history, a physical examination, and selective laboratory testing (Clinical Principle). For the man with ED, validated questionnaires are recommended to assess the severity of ED, to measure treatment effectiveness, and to guide future management (Expert Opinion). Men should be counseled that ED is a risk marker for underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other health conditions that may warrant evaluation and treatment (Clinical Principle). In men with ED, morning serum total testosterone levels should be measured (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For some men with ED, specialized testing and evaluation may be necessary to guide treatment (Expert Opinion). For men being treated for ED, referral to a mental health professional should be considered to promote treatment adherence, reduce performance anxiety, and integrate treatments into a sexual relationship (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### European Academy of Neurology (EAN) / European federation of autonomic societies (EFAS) / international neuro-urology society (INUS) guidelines for practising neurologists on the assessment and treatment of neurogenic urinary and sexual symptoms (NEUROGED guidelines) [^115eGMxU]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: Neurologists should actively ask individuals with neurological diseases about sexual problems regularly and explore multidimensional contributing factors. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 97%).

Clinical Question 27. Should Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Problems Undergo a Focused Physical Assessment Versus no Physical Assessment?

Identifying the physical contributors to sexual dysfunction in individuals with neurological disorders is crucial for effective management and treatment planning. These individuals should undergo a targeted physical examination when necessary.

Recommendation: Neurologists should perform a targeted physical examination when appropriate in individuals with neurological diseases who experience sexual problems. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 85%).

Clinical Question 28. Should Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Dysfunction Undergo Further Laboratory Diagnostic Evaluations (Vascular Risk Factors) Versus no Diagnostic Evaluation?

Evidence suggests that men with erectile dysfunction (ED) should undergo vascular risk screening, including fasting glucose, HbA1c, and lipid profiles, based on guidelines not aimed at individuals with neurological disease. ED is now seen as a standalone risk for cardiovascular disease and a potential early sign of diabetes, necessitating baseline measurements of serum lipids and glucose. If no recent tests are available, a comprehensive lipid and glucose profile is recommended. Although not all tests will diagnose ED directly, they offer a chance to uncover important co‐morbidities. Serum testosterone should be measured in those showing signs of hypogonadism, with morning blood samples being preferred for accuracy. Screening for urogenital cancers and sexually transmitted infections (STI) may be required on an individualized basis.

Recommendation: Individuals with neurological diseases who have sexual problems should undergo screening laboratory testing for additional contributing factors in the appropriate clinical context. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 97% in Delphi round 2).

Clinical Question 29. Should Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Problems Undergo Further Instrumental Diagnostic Evaluations (Ex: Neurophysiology) Versus no Diagnostic Evaluation?

Routine instrumental diagnostic tests, such as pelvic neurophysiology and MRI, are not typically necessary for individuals with neurological diseases experiencing sexual dysfunction, as these tests often do not provide additional information beyond a thorough history and examination. These tests include the assessment of pelvic somatic sensory and motor functions, reflexes, and autonomic innervation, and may be useful in specific situations such as the assessment of unexplained urogenital dysfunction, evaluating incidental spinal MRI findings, cases of pelvic trauma, or for medico‐legal reasons. The tests should be reserved for specialist settings where they can be accurately performed and interpreted.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^1179QvVo]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Erectile dysfunction — investigational and experimental therapies (Recommendations 23–25): For men with ED, low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy should be considered investigational. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) For men with ED, intracavernosal stem cell therapy should be considered investigational. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) For men with ED, platelet-rich plasma therapy should be considered experimental. (Expert Opinion) Randomized sham-controlled trials do not clearly indicate that benefits reliably outweigh risks/burdens for shock wave therapy or ICI stem cell therapy and these treatments should only be considered investigational; platelet-rich plasma therapy should not be offered unless administered under an institutional review board approved experimental clinical research protocol, and at this time no full-text peer-reviewed publications are available to constitute an evidence base.
