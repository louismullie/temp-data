## Question

What are the causes of hypo albumin in infants

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of hypoalbuminemia in infants. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of albumin homeostasis and why infants are uniquely vulnerable. Then, I should categorize etiologies into major buckets: decreased synthesis, increased losses, redistribution/capillary leak, and accelerated catabolism. Next, I will enumerate infant-specific causes within each bucket, verify the strength of evidence, and note any exceptions or controversies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy of causes and highlight key clinical implications and thresholds relevant to neonatal care.

> Let me first confirm the core pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: albumin levels reflect the balance among hepatic synthesis, losses via urine or gut, distribution between intravascular and interstitial compartments, and catabolism. In infants, immature hepatic synthetic capacity, high growth demands, and developmental regulation of albumin synthesis all predispose to lower baseline levels and greater vulnerability to stressors, which I should keep in mind as I interpret causes and decide what is pathologic versus physiologic in this age group [^57746753] [^5bcc8923].

> I will now examine decreased synthesis as a cause. Wait, let me verify the common misconception: uncomplicated undernutrition alone rarely lowers albumin substantially; hypoalbuminemia emerges when undernutrition coexists with inflammation or organ dysfunction. In infants, liver immaturity and specific liver diseases reduce synthesis, and in critical illness, hepatic protein synthesis is reprioritized away from albumin toward acute-phase proteins, lowering serum albumin despite adequate or even increased fractional synthesis rates, so I need to be cautious not to attribute low albumin solely to poor intake without evidence of inflammation or organ failure [^e779e0f0] [^57746753] [^78a96d99].

> Next, I should review increased losses, because this is a major driver in infants. Protein-losing enteropathies, including food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome and food protein–induced enteropathy, can cause substantial albumin loss via the gut, and congenital nephrotic syndrome produces massive urinary protein loss with hypoalbuminemia and edema. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds: pediatric nephrotic syndrome is typically defined by nephrotic-range proteinuria with serum albumin ≤ 2.5–3.0 g/dL, and congenital cases present in the first 3 months of life, often due to podocyte gene mutations, so early-onset disease warrants genetic evaluation and specialist referral [^cfded648] [^8a6087a8] [^6e2b1c15] [^1e331c09].

> Let me consider redistribution and capillary leak next, because this is pivotal in sick infants. Inflammation increases vascular permeability and expands the interstitial albumin distribution volume, so plasma albumin drops even when total body albumin mass is not severely reduced. I should double-check that this mechanism is well supported: multiple reviews and pediatric critical care data confirm that capillary leak and altered albumin kinetics are central in sepsis, NEC, RDS, and postoperative states, explaining rapid declines in serum albumin within hours of illness onset [^a16cb475] [^1ea6721c] [^78a96d99].

> I need to check accelerated catabolism as a contributor. In inflammatory states, albumin turnover accelerates and the effective half-life shortens, and there is emerging evidence that albumin can be trafficked into cells and degraded to supply amino acids during proliferation and repair, which would further deplete circulating albumin. This helps explain why albumin levels can fall despite normal or increased fractional synthesis in stress states, reinforcing that low albumin is a marker of disease activity rather than malnutrition alone [^51771091] [^3d5dd563].

> Now, let me categorize infant-specific etiologies so I don't miss anything. Decreased synthesis includes prematurity and hepatic immaturity, congenital or acquired liver disease such as biliary atresia, tyrosinemia type I, and gestational alloimmune liver disease, and critical illness with reprioritized hepatic protein synthesis. Increased losses include congenital nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathies such as FPIES and FPE, intestinal lymphangiectasia, and postoperative protein losses. Redistribution and capillary leak occur in sepsis, NEC, RDS, and postoperative states. Accelerated catabolism accompanies severe inflammation and tissue repair, and I should also remember that normal developmental physiology lowers albumin in utero and early life, so age-specific norms are essential for interpretation [^8185b59d] [^88630905] [^cfded648] [^6e2b1c15] [^2c874236] [^78a96d99] [^ecc686ab].

> Hold on, I should verify a few nuances so I don't overgeneralize. First, nutrition alone rarely explains hypoalbuminemia unless severe protein–energy malnutrition coexists with inflammation or infection, so isolated low albumin should prompt evaluation for occult stressors. Second, in congenital nephrotic syndrome, management emphasizes preserving vascular access, limiting salt and fluid, and using albumin for hypovolemia rather than to normalize serum albumin, which I need to keep in mind when considering infusions. Third, in preterm infants, early amino acid provision can transiently stimulate albumin synthesis, but this does not override the dominant effects of inflammation or capillary leak in acute illness, so I should not interpret a modest rise as correction of the underlying process [^e779e0f0] [^55c98049] [^5caeb5ac].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy of causes in infants, while acknowledging overlap. Most commonly, hypoalbuminemia in hospitalized infants reflects inflammation with capillary leak and redistribution, often in the setting of sepsis, NEC, RDS, or postoperative stress. Second, increased losses from the kidney or gut are frequent and specific, including congenital nephrotic syndrome and protein-losing enteropathies. Third, decreased synthesis becomes clinically relevant in liver disease, extreme prematurity, or persistent critical illness. Fourth, accelerated catabolism contributes in severe inflammatory states. Finally, developmental physiology establishes lower normal ranges in early life, so I should always interpret values against age- and gestation-specific norms before labeling pathology [^78a96d99] [^6e2b1c15] [^cfded648] [^ecc686ab].

> I should confirm key clinical thresholds that change management. In neonatal jaundice, serum albumin less than 3.0 g/dL is a neurotoxicity risk factor that lowers phototherapy and exchange thresholds, and in pediatric nephrotic syndrome, albumin ≤ 2.5–3.0 g/dL supports the diagnosis and informs decisions about albumin infusion for hypovolemia. In critical illness, albumin below about 2.5–3.0 g/dL correlates with worse outcomes, though this is associative and should guide vigilance rather than reflexive infusion, which aligns with guideline cautions against routine albumin use in preterm infants without a clear hemodynamic indication [^c8b34850] [^1e331c09] [^4a8b1b8c] [^ede3db1c].

> In summary, I need to ensure my diagnostic approach treats hypoalbuminemia as a sentinel of underlying disease rather than a primary disorder. I should prioritize identifying inflammation, capillary leak, protein-losing states, and liver dysfunction, and I should avoid attributing low albumin to poor nutrition without corroborating evidence. By mapping causes to the pathophysiology of synthesis, losses, redistribution, and catabolism, and by integrating age-specific norms, I can target interventions to the root cause and reserve albumin for select hemodynamic or complication-driven scenarios rather than attempting to normalize serum levels alone [^e779e0f0] [^78a96d99] [^ecc686ab].

Hypoalbuminemia in infants is most often due to **inflammation-driven capillary leak** [^a16cb475] and **increased protein loss** from renal or gastrointestinal sources [^6e2b1c15] [^cfded648], rather than reduced synthesis alone [^57746753]. Key causes include sepsis, NEC, RDS, congenital nephrotic syndrome [^6e2b1c15], protein-losing enteropathy [^64b11b8a], and liver disease [^8185b59d]; prematurity and malnutrition exacerbate risk [^7737d067]. Management should target the underlying cause, with albumin infusion reserved for **symptomatic hypovolemia or edema** [^55c98049] [^8afdbfb2], as routine use does not improve outcomes [^baf2204c] [^bc18cae5].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Hypoalbuminemia arises from **four main mechanisms**:

- **Decreased synthesis**: Hepatic immaturity or liver disease reduces albumin production [^57746753].
- **Increased losses**: Renal or gastrointestinal protein loss lowers serum albumin [^3d5dd563].
- **Redistribution**: Inflammation increases capillary leak, shifting albumin to the interstitium [^a16cb475].
- **Increased catabolism**: Inflammation accelerates albumin breakdown [^3d5dd563].

## Clinical significance and complications

Hypoalbuminemia in infants is a **marker of disease severity** [^78a96d99] and is associated with:

- **Edema**: Reduced oncotic pressure causes fluid shifts [^a16cb475].
- **Respiratory distress**: Interstitial edema worsens lung compliance [^notfound].
- **Infection risk**: Loss of immunoglobulins and complement factors [^64b11b8a].
- **Coagulopathy**: Loss of clotting factors increases bleeding risk [^ff8ef876].
- **Poor growth**: Nutrient loss and inflammation impair growth [^e779e0f0].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured evaluation includes:

- **History**: Gestational age, nutrition, infections, surgeries, family history [^notfound].
- **Examination**: Edema, ascites, respiratory distress, jaundice, growth parameters [^notfound].
- **Laboratory tests**: Serum albumin, liver function, renal function, urinalysis, stool alpha-1 antitrypsin, CRP, CBC, coagulation profile [^64b11b8a].
- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound, echocardiography if indicated [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **treating the underlying cause**:

- **Treat underlying disease**: Antibiotics for sepsis, surgery for NEC, immunosuppression for nephrotic syndrome, dietary modification for protein-losing enteropathy [^55c98049] [^cfded648].
- **Nutritional support**: Adequate protein and calorie intake, parenteral nutrition if needed [^7737d067].
- **Albumin infusion**: Reserved for symptomatic hypovolemia or edema refractory to standard care, not routine use [^55c98049] [^8afdbfb2].
- **Monitor complications**: Watch for edema, infection, coagulopathy, and growth failure [^c0c0ca8a].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **cause, severity, and response**. Persistent hypoalbuminemia signals high morbidity and mortality, especially in critical illness or chronic disease [^78a96d99] [^0ec23fdf]. Early identification and targeted therapy improve outcomes [^notfound].

---

Hypoalbuminemia in infants reflects inflammation, protein loss, or impaired synthesis; **management should target the cause** and reserve albumin for select cases, as routine infusion does not improve outcomes [^baf2204c] [^bc18cae5].

Hypoalbuminemic States (see Figure 1)

The different inflammatory states described in the previous section are all associated with low serum albumin levels. 91 Although uncomplicated undernutrition (not combined with inflammation) does not lead to or only very modestly leads to low serum albumin, in areas with endemic malnutrition, undernutrition is usually associated with infectious or noninfectious inflammation. Hypoalbuminemia is more severe in children with kwashiorkor (edema, fatty liver, skin lesions, discolored hair) than with marasmus (less edema, child more active and attentive). 95 The difference in phenotype has been attributed to differences in the microbiome. 96 Chronic parasitic disease or other chronic infections cause hypoalbuminemia and lead to growth failure. Adult malnutrition in areas with endemic malnutrition has similar characteristics. 97 In clinical practice, all acutely ill or (surgically) traumatized patients have low serum albumin levels. 66, 67, 68, 69, 98, 99, 100 In the Western world, the severity of the inflammatory effects of comorbidity, obesity, lifestyle, organ failure, and aging lead to a proportional decrease in serum albumin levels. 23, 76, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106

The combined presence of undernutrition and inflammation in malnutrition has led some authors to consider the condition as being a nutrition state caused by a combination of undernutrition and inflammatory activity. Consensus is, however, lacking between countries and nutrition societies about whether inflammation should be part of the definition of malnutrition and part of nutrition assessment. 2, 3, 107 The frequent and simultaneous presence of undernutrition and inflammation also explains why in some studies a modest correlation has been found between undernutrition and hypoalbuminemia, despite the presence of subgroups, in which undernutrition is associated with normal plasma albumin levels or where low serum albumin levels exist in chronic disease states despite adequate nutrition intake. These observations confound the value of serum albumin as an indicator of adequate nutrition intake or uptake in a sizeable subgroup of individuals despite a significant correlation in the population as a whole. 108 Regardless of how malnutrition is defined, if the objective of the clinician is to identify patients who will benefit from nutrition support, it is essential to consider both undernutrition and inflammation. Only then can the indication for nutrition support be determined and its likely effect be predicted. 109

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^a16cb475]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being addressed repeatedly in the literature, there is still confusion regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and escape of serum albumin, leading to expansion of interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half-life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These 2 factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma. Hypoalbuminemia, therefore, results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy, and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels are adequate indicators, respectively, of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and as supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis. Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in the intensive care unit, which may imply that there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable to play scavenging and antioxidative roles. Management of hypoalbuminaemia should be based on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than infusion of albumin. After the age of 30 years, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity and associated with decreasing serum albumin levels. Nutrition support cannot fully prevent, but slows down, this chain of events, especially when combined with physical exercise.

Hypoalbuminemia and Albumin Kinetics

Low serum albumin levels in malnourished or stressed individuals have often been considered to be caused by diminished synthesis. However, in most disease states in which synthesis rates have been measured, fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in plasma has been reported to be normal or mildly increased (Table 1). 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 FSR is only decreased in liver failure where synthetic rate is related to liver function 72 and possibly in children with kwashiorkor for unknown reasons. 73 While increased fractional and absolute synthesis rates in plasma seem incongruous with decreased levels of serum albumin, they may not reflect an increase in synthesis at the whole‐body level. In addition, synthesis rate is just 1 of the factors determining total serum albumin mass in the body. Serum albumin mass is also influenced by the half‐life of serum albumin. This has been rarely measured, but turnover time has been found to be shortened in hypertension, acromegaly, nephrotic syndrome, and protein‐losing enteropathy. 65, 74, 75, 76

The Pathophysiology Underlying Hypoalbuminemia

Hypoalbuminemia is largely a function of increased vascular permeability and increased interstitial volume. In this section we will discuss the role of inflammation in mediating these responses, not only in pathologic states, but also in life events such as pregnancy, lactation, and cancer growth.

Inflammation, Increased Capillary Permeability, and Hypoalbuminemia

Increased vascular permeability for cells and plasma solutes is a universal reaction in trauma, critical illness, chronic disease, life events, multiple or isolated organ failure, and cancer. This response is evident in circumstances including edema in healing wounds and the necessity to maintain intravascular volume by "overhydrating" traumatized or postsurgery patients. Adequately resuscitated patients are maintained in a positive fluid balance of 5–10 liters after clean elective major surgery or other types of trauma. 4 Fluid resuscitation is necessary in these circumstances to avoid hypovolemia and the development of shock. The same happens in children after burns, where fluid balance is positive despite the effort to prevent overhydration. 5 The fact that fluid retention inevitably and visibly occurs in wounds as well as at the whole‐body level after trauma and burns could reflect that this response is beneficial to some extent, but may become harmful when the inflammatory stimulus cannot be adequately overcome or treated. 6, 7 In wounds, virtually every type of immune cell appears, producing cytokines and growth factors that support the healing process. Increased cytokine expression does not only happen after trauma or infection, but also in physiologic states including pregnancy and other situations where increased cell proliferation and matrix deposition are required. 8, 9, 10

The inflammation present in pregnancy is associated with modest hypoalbuminemia, which progresses from the first to the third trimester and is paralleled by increased water content of the maternal interstitium. 30, 110, 111 Serum albumin levels in healthy children have been found in population studies to be inversely associated with growth rate, although within a range considered normal. The highest serum albumin levels in men are only reached in adulthood after age 20 years, when growth and muscle accretion have stopped. In females, serum albumin levels increase until puberty to levels comparable with men, after which they decrease, although still within the normal range, to below levels in men, possibly related to pubertal growth and subsequent to their menstrual cycle with cyclic tissue synthesis and breakdown. 112

Conclusions

Hypoalbuminaemia is common in patients with ACHD and is a strong, independent predictor of mortality associated with an over threefold increased risk of death. Plasma albumin concentration should be a part of the routine assessment of patients with ACHD, and unexplained hypoalbuminaemia, even in clinically stable and oligosymptomatic patients, should trigger appropriate measures to identify underlying causes of serum albumin imbalance, but more importantly lead to closer monitoring and measures aimed at improving prognosis.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^4c7d6360]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence Summary

A Cochrane systematic review evaluated the use of albumin in preterm neonates (≤ 36 weeks' gestation at birth) with hypoalbuminemia (two RCTs enrolling 64 preterm neonates). Only one study reported mortality rates and no difference was found. No other important differences in outcomes were observed. A Cochrane systematic review of RCTs of early volume expansion compared normal saline, plasma, albumin, plasma substitutes, or blood with no treatment or another fluid treatment in preterm neonates (≤ 32 weeks or ≤ 1,500 g). Early volume expansion was defined as > 10 mL/kg of body weight in the first 3 days. The studies included variable indications for the administration of IV fluids. Eight studies were identified, with four studies evaluating albumin with a comparative arm (two vs normal saline, one vs plasma, and one vs no treatment). The two studies (N = 102 and N = 63) comparing 5% albumin with normal saline in hypotensive infants found no difference in mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.50–2.06) or any other patient-important outcomes. The one study (N = 25) comparing 20% albumin with no treatment in normotensive infants also found no difference in mortality (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.23–3.72). Finally, one trial (N = 20) in hypotensive infants compared plasma with albumin and found no difference in duration of ventilation (mortality not reported). Since the publication of these two Cochrane reviews, a single RCT (N = 33) was identified comparing 5% albumin with normal saline (both 10 mL/kg) for term infants with dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and diarrhea and found no differences in outcomes.

Rationale for Recommendations

Few RCTs have evaluated the impact of albumin compared with other alternative fluids in preterm or term neonates with either hypoalbuminemia or hypovolemia. Very little evidence is available in the literature to guide the use of albumin in term neonates. All trials in the two systematic reviews included small numbers of neonates, preventing any definitive conclusions. Indirect evidence from the adult and pediatric literature, the costs of albumin, and the lack of trials assessing the potential harms of albumin should be considered when including albumin in neonatal fluid protocols.

Table 1
Pathophysiology of Hypoalbuminemia in Disease and Life Events

Albumin can enter cells and cell organelles, but the kinetics of this process are not quantified. However, in pharmacology, albumin is studied as a potential carrier of drugs. To prolong drug effects, methods have been explored to prolong their binding to albumin and to increase the half‐life of albumin by binding to site‐specific mutants of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). In health, this receptor is bound to albumin and has been found to prolong the half‐life of albumin while there is substantial cycling of serum albumin into and out of the cell, 21 but in disease states, FcRn downregulation shortens the half‐life of albumin due to increased intracellular breakdown. This furnishes amino acids used as building blocks for increased cell proliferation. This occurs at a lower rate in health. 22

Trauma, disease, growth, etc. are inflammatory conditions that are associated with hypoalbuminemia. More severe inflammation is associated with progressively lower serum albumin levels, although the strength of the correlation has only sparsely been investigated. 23, 24 However, it is clinically evident that in severely septic patients, a persisting positive fluid balance and decreasing serum albumin levels after the start of sepsis spell doom. Changing to a negative fluid balance (polyuria), rising serum albumin levels signal recovery. There is a highly significant correlation between serum albumin level and mortality risk when stratified for age and gender. 25

In the literature, expansion of interstitial space is generally linked to increased transcapillary escape of plasma constituents into the interstitium, despite findings in experimental endotoxin‐treated animals that lymphatic backflow from the interstitium is also increased. 26 Fibrinogen yields fibrin after leaving the vascular space due to the simultaneous escape of clotting factors. It has been suggested that this increases viscosity/oncotic pressure, inducing retention of water and, thereby, expanding interstitial space. To our knowledge, in this regard, the role of cells has not been assessed.

### Albumin infusion for low serum albumin in preterm newborn infants [^baf2204c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous albumin infusion to treat hypoalbuminaemia is used in intensive care nurseries. Hypoalbuminaemia occurs in a number of clinical situations including prematurity, the acutely unwell infant, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), chronic lung disease (CLD), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), intracranial haemorrhage, hydrops fetalis and oedema. Fluid overload is a potential side effect of albumin administration. Albumin is a blood product and therefore carries the potential risk of infection and adverse reactions. Albumin is also a scarce and expensive resource.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess whether albumin infusions, in preterm neonates with low serum albumin, reduces mortality and morbidity. A secondary objective was to assess whether albumin infusion is associated with significant side effects.

Search Strategy

Searches were made of MEDLINE from 1966 to April 2004, CINAHL from 1982 to April 2004 and the current Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library issue 1, 2004). Previous reviews (including cross references) and abstracts were also searched.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials in which individual patients were allocated to albumin infusion versus control were included. Cross-over studies were excluded. Quasi randomised trials were excluded. Participants were preterm infants who had hypoalbuminaemia. Types of interventions included albumin infusion versus placebo (e.g. crystalloid) or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

The reviewers worked independently to search for trials for inclusion and to assess methodological quality. Studies were assessed using the following key criteria: blinding of randomisation, blinding of intervention, completeness of follow up and blinding of outcome measurement.

Main Results

Only two small studies were found for inclusion in this review and only one reported clinically relevant outcomes - it found no significant differences for our primary outcome measure of death (RR 1.5 [95% confidence interval 0.3–7.43]) or secondary outcome measures of intraventricular haemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotising enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of oxygen therapy.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is a lack of evidence from randomised trials to determine whether the routine use of albumin infusion, in preterm neonates with low serum albumin, reduces mortality or morbidity, and no evidence to assess whether albumin infusion is associated with significant side effects. There is a need for good quality, double-blind randomised controlled trials to assess the safety and efficacy of albumin infusions in preterm neonates with low serum albumin.

### Association between serum albumin levels at admission and clinical outcomes in pediatric intensive care units: a multi-center study [^ecc686ab]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Yet, while previous research on albumin levels in adult patient cohorts is rather extensive, there is scarcity of comparable research on critically ill pediatric patients. Among the few relevant studies, a preoperative-postoperative albumin study found that low albumin levels were associated with high rates of surgical infection and increased LOS. Similarly, there is some evidence indicating that, in pediatric renal transplant patients, pretransplant low albumin levels are associated with graft failure. In a recent PICU-based study, Leite et al. found a strong correlation between hypoalbuminemia and increased mortality, prolonged PICU stay, and the need for mechanical ventilation.

For a normal albumin level, the average plasma albumin value for the given age group needs to be known. In preterm infants, the normal range of albumin is 1.8–3.0 g/dl on the first day of life; in full-term infants, the corresponding values are 2.5–3.4 g/dl at 0–6 days and 1.9–4.9 g/dl at 0–12 months. After the first year, the normal range is 3.4–4.2 g/dl at 1–3 years and 3.5–5.6 g/dl at 3 years. At all ages, any albumin level below 3.3 g/dl is considered as hypoalbuminemia. In light of the aforementioned factors, we have established a threshold albumin level that serves to indicate mortality in order to ascertain the prevalence of low albumin levels within our patient cohort, than the mortality and outcome status of the patients were examined based on the determined cut-off albumin level was aimed to investigate.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^e45900ad]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypoalbuminemia is common in clinical practice, and serum albumin levels are often routinely measured in severely ill or malnourished patients. Although hypoalbuminemia may develop within hours in acute disease or after trauma and resuscitation in previously well‐nourished individuals and is also present in chronic inflammatory diseases despite adequate nutrition intake, it is often wrongly considered to be an indicator of inadequate nutrition intake that can be relieved by nutrition support alone. There is actually a poor correlation between the level of nutrition intake and the serum albumin level. For example, anorexia nervosa patients have normal or only slightly decreased serum albumin levels despite very low nutrition intake, unless infected or traumatized. Many anorexia nervosa patients have a body mass index < 18 kg/m 2 and have low muscle mass and strength, but they are otherwise functioning relatively well. 1 Further, patients with chronic diseases and hypoalbuminemia lose fat‐free mass, considered to be an essential indicator of the undernourished state, despite adequate food intake. 2, 3 Rather than reflecting undernutrition per se, hypoalbuminemia is more a reflection of the extent of physiologic stress resulting from disease or trauma‐related inflammation. These considerations do not exclude the likelihood that hypoalbuminemia often coincides with a negative nutrient balance for which nutrition support is indicated.

The objectives of this semicomprehensive review are to define the pathophysiology of hypoalbuminemia associated with increases in capillary permeability and altered kinetics of serum albumin in inflammatory states, including states of physiologic or pathologic growth. In addition, the potentially beneficial role of these changes will be highlighted as well as the significance of increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels as indicators of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. Finally, the significance of hypoalbuminemia as a risk indicator of negative outcome after medical treatment or of diminished longevity will be discussed.

In view of the many areas of pathophysiology addressed, we will limit the number of references to subjects that are not commonly accepted knowledge. In this area, very few randomized trials and meta‐analyses have been performed. Much of the material in this paper regards the pathophysiology of inflammation at the whole‐body level and recent, more in‐depth papers on cell biology and the beneficial intracellular and extracellular role of albumin.

### Congenital nephrotic syndrome [^6e2b1c15]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS), a challenging form of nephrotic syndrome, is characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Extensive leakage of plasma proteins is the main feature of CNS. Patients can be diagnosed in utero or during the first few weeks of life, usually before three months. The etiology of CNS can be related to either genetic or nongenetic etiologies. Pathogenic variants in NPHS1, NPHS2, LAMB2, WT1, and PLCE1 genes have been implicated in this disease. The clinical course is complicated by significant edema, infections, thrombosis, hypothyroidism, failure to thrive, and others. Obtaining vascular access, frequent intravenous albumin infusions, diuretic use, infection prevention, and nutritional support are the mainstay management during their first month of life. The best therapy for these patients is kidney transplantation. CNS diagnosis and treatment continue to be a challenge for clinicians. This review increases the awareness about the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of CNS patients.

Inflammation and Tissue Growth

The inflammatory response and increased capillary permeability that are necessary for tissue healing after trauma or infection also occur in physiologic and pathologic growth. Thus, there is a mild and sustained inflammatory response in pregnancy. 10 The synthesis of cytokines and growth factors is mildly increased while exhibiting Th1 helper cell dominance, but is further upregulated and changed to Th2 helper cell dominance during fetal distress, and decreases when resulting in premature birth. 10, 27, 28 A similar pattern is observed for VEGF, stimulating angiogenesis and promoting capillary permeability, 29 leading to expansion of the interstitium. 30, 31

Cytokine and growth factor production is also increased when preparing for lactation, stimulating the development of the terminal end buds for lactation. 32 Similar factors are produced in mammary cancer growth to promote tumor invasiveness. Cancer tissue is riddled with immune cells which support tumor growth, while inflammation is also evident at the whole‐body level. 33, 34 Altogether, the inflammatory response is a general mechanism promoting accelerated cell proliferation and matrix deposition in all conditions in which this is required. An essential element consists of growth factor–induced (eg, VEGF) increases in vascular permeability. VEGF expression and increased vascular permeability occur in infection, 14, 35 trauma, 15, 16, 36 during fetal and postnatal growth, 29, 37, 38, 39 preparing for lactation, 39, 40 cancer, 41, 42 protein‐losing enteropathy, 43 and nephrotic syndrome 44, 45 (Table 1). The positive role of VEGF and its effect on angiogenesis and vascular permeability is supported by the evidence that treatment with anti‐VEGF in renal cancer aggravates renal failure. 45, 46

The inference that acute inflammation usually has positive effects is strongly supported by the finding that inhibiting the inflammatory response by nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs worsens wound and bone healing, 47, 48, 49, 50 increases the risk of anastomotic failure or sepsis after surgery, 51, 52 aggravates heart and renal failure, 53, 54 interferes with an adequate immune response to antigen presentation in the intestine (leading to ulceration and bleeding), 55, 56, 57, 58 and causes premature birth and cryptorchism in neonates. 58, 59, 60, 61, 62

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^bc18cae5]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of pooled human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation (with or without improvement of baseline hypoalbuminaemia) in critically unwell adults with sepsis of any severity.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials, with trial sequential analysis, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses.

Data Sources

PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science (includes Medline, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Data Citation Index, Chinese Science Citation Database, CAB abstracts, Derwent Innovations Index), OvidSP (includes Embase, Ovid Medline, HMIC, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care, Transport Database), Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, controlled-trials.com, online material, relevant conference proceedings, hand searching of reference lists, and contact with authors as necessary.

Eligibility Criteria

Prospective randomised clinical trials of adults with sepsis of any severity (with or without baseline hypoalbuminaemia) in critical or intensive care who received pooled human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation (with or without improvement of hypoalbuminaemia) compared with those who received control fluids (crystalloid or colloid), were included if all-cause mortality outcome data were available. No restriction of language, date, publication status, or primary study endpoint was applied.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion, extracted data to assess risk of bias, trial methods, patients, interventions, comparisons, and outcome. The relative risk of all-cause mortality was calculated using a random effects model accounting for clinical heterogeneity.

Primary Outcome Measure

All-cause mortality at final follow-up.

Results

Eighteen articles reporting on 16 primary clinical trials that included 4190 adults in critical or intensive care with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. A median of 70.0 g daily of pooled human albumin was received over a median of 3 days by adults with a median age of 60.8 years as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation, with or without correction of hypoalbuminaemia. The relative risk of death was similar between albumin groups (that received a median of 175 g in total) and control fluid groups (relative risk 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.01; P = 0.11; I(2) = 0%). Trial sequential analysis corrected the 95% confidence interval for random error (0.85 to 1.02; D(2) = 0%). Eighty eight per cent of the required information size (meta-analysis sample size) of 4894 patients was achieved, and the cumulative effect size measure (z score) entered the futility area, supporting the notion of no relative benefit of albumin (GRADE quality of evidence was moderate). Evidence of no difference was also found when albumin was compared with crystalloid fluid (relative risk 0.93; 0.86 to 1.01; P = 0.07; I(2) = 0%) in 3878 patents (GRADE quality of evidence was high; 79.9% of required information size) or colloid fluids in 299 patients (relative risk 1.04; 0.79 to 1.38; P = 0.76; I(2) = 0%) (GRADE quality of evidence was very low; 5.8% of required information size). When studies at high risk of bias were excluded in a predefined subgroup analysis, the finding of no mortality benefit remained, and the cumulative z score was just outside the boundary of futility. Overall, the meta-analysis was robust to sensitivity, subgroup, meta-regression, and trial sequential analyses.

Conclusions

In this analysis, human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation for critically unwell adults with sepsis of any severity (with or without baseline hypoalbuminaemia) were not robustly effective at reducing all-cause mortality. Albumin seems to be safe in this setting, as a signal towards harm was not detected, but this analysis does not support a recommendation for use.

### Fluid resuscitation in neonatal and pediatric hypovolemic shock: a Dutch pediatric society evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^cae0b08e]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a clinical practice guideline that provides recommendations for the fluid, i.e. colloid or crystalloid, used for resuscitation in critically ill neonates and children up to the age of 18 years with hypovolemia.

Methods

The guideline was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the pediatric literature. Recommendations were formulated by a national multidisciplinary committee involving all stakeholders in neonatal and pediatric intensive care and were based on research evidence from the literature and, in areas where the evidence was insufficient or lacking, on consensus after discussions in the committee.

Results

Because of the lack of evidence in neonates and children, trials conducted in adults were considered. We found several recent meta-analyses that show excess mortality in albumin-treated groups, compared with crystalloid-treated groups, and one recent large randomized controlled trial that found evidence of no mortality difference. We found no evidence that synthetic colloids are superior to crystalloid solutions.

Conclusions

Given the state of the evidence and taking all other considerations into account, the guideline-developing group and the multidisciplinary committee recommend that in neonates and children with hypovolemia the first-choice fluid for resuscitation should be isotonic saline.

### Hypoalbuminemia following abdominal surgery leads to high serum unbound bilirubin concentrations in newborns soon after birth [^b4997f6b]. Neonatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The serum concentration of unbound bilirubin (UB), which is bilirubin not bound to albumin (Alb), is a better index than total bilirubin concentration (TB) for identifying infants at risk for developing bilirubin neurotoxicity. The degree to which the hypoalbuminemia following abdominal surgery in jaundiced newborns affects bilirubin binding is unknown.

Objective

To determine whether lower Alb occurring in newborns undergoing abdominal surgery shortly after birth results in significantly higher UB in serum versus nonsurgical patients at comparable serum TB.

Methods

A matched case-control study was conducted with term and late-preterm newborns. The surgery group included 15 newborns who underwent abdominal operation within 3 days after birth. Clinical and laboratory data (serum UB, TB, and Alb concentrations, UB/TB ratio, and binding constant) in the surgery group were collected and compared with those of 30 control newborns who did not undergo abdominal surgery (control group).

Results

Serum UB and the UB/TB ratio in the surgery group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.02, p < 0.001, respectively), whereas there were no significant differences in serum TB and binding constant between the groups. Serum Alb concentrations in the surgery group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.001). When pre- and postoperative serum Alb concentrations were compared, there was a significant decrease from 3.4 to 2.7 g/dl (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our study suggests that hypoalbuminemia following abdominal surgery causes a higher serum UB at comparable serum TB in newborns.

### Prevalence of hypoalbuminemia and elevated bilirubin / albumin ratios in a large cohort of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit [^58b36b26]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide descriptive data on serum albumin levels and the bilirubin to albumin (B/A) ratio in neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, assess the effect of gestational and chronological age on serum albumin and the B/A ratio, and evaluate the association between extreme values and mortality.

Study Design

Using a retrospective cohort design, we queried the Pediatrix clinical data warehouse for all infants born between 23 and 41 weeks of gestation from 1997 to 2014 who had a report of both a serum albumin and total serum bilirubin (TSB) level on the same day between birth and 14 days of life.

Results

There were 382190 paired albumin and bilirubin levels across 164401 neonates (15% of the 1072682 infants in the clinical data warehouse). Both gestational age and postnatal age were independent factors that influenced the values for serum albumin, TSB, and B/A ratio (ANOVA; P < .0001). TSB and B/A ratios values above birth weight-specific thresholds for exchange transfusions were uncommon (< 6% of infants). Hypoalbuminemia (< 2.5mg/dL) was common (29% of infants). Neonates with serum albumin levels < 2.5g/dL or with B/A ratio levels exceeding exchange thresholds were at higher risk of death compared with infants who did not exceed these levels. This association was independent of other risk factors (estimated gestational age, birth weight, sex, and the presence of a major anomaly).

Conclusion

Both gestational age and postnatal age influence TSB, albumin, and B/A ratios; hypoalbuminemia and extreme B/A ratios are associated with an increased risk of death.

### Hypoalbuminemia in acute illness: is there a rationale for intervention? A meta-analysis of cohort studies and controlled trials [^0ec23fdf]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in the acutely ill, and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients.

Summary Background Data

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and, separately, of nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia.

Results

Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcome. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay respectively by 28% and 71%, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

Conclusions

Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients. In the interim, there is no compelling basis to withhold albumin therapy if it is judged clinically appropriate.

### Serum albumin is an independent predictor of clinical outcomes in critically ill children [^bf39fd22]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Serum albumin is a strong biomarker of disease severity and prognosis in adult patients. In contrast, its value as predictor of outcome in critically ill children has not been established. We aimed to determine whether admission hypoalbuminemia is associated with outcome in a general pediatric population of critically ill patients, taking into account the inflammatory response, disease severity, and nutritional status of the patient.

Design

Analysis of prospectively collected database.

Setting

PICU of a teaching hospital.

Patients

Two hundred seventy-one patients consecutively admitted. Neonates, patients with chronic liver or kidney disease, inborn errors of metabolism, those who received prior administration of albumin solution, and readmissions were excluded.

Measurements and Main Results

Outcome variables were 60-day mortality, probability of ICU discharge at 60 days, and ventilator-free days. Potential exposure variables for the outcome were sex, age, nutritional status, albumin, C-reactive protein and serum lactate at admission, and Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 score. Admission hypoalbuminemia was present in 64.2% of patients. After adjustment for confounding factors, only serum lactate, Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 score, and serum albumin were associated with higher mortality: the increase of 1.0 g/dL in serum albumin at admission resulted in a 73% reduction in the hazard of death (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14–0.51; p < 0.001). The increase of 1 g/dL in serum albumin was also independently associated with a 33% rise in the probability of ICU discharge (subhazard ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.07–1.64; p = 0.008) and increased ventilator-free-days (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 0.56–3.16; p = 0.005).

Conclusions

Hypoalbuminemia at admission to a PICU is associated with higher 60-day mortality, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and lower probability of ICU discharge. These associations are independent of the magnitude of inflammatory response, clinical severity, and nutritional status.

### Electrolytes in sick neonates-which sodium is the right answer? [^b8c6d1b1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypoproteinaemia leads to spuriously high-sodium values when measured by indirect ion-selective electrodes (ISE) as used in main laboratory analysers compared with direct ISE employed in point-of-care analysers (POCT). The authors, therefore, investigated the occurrence of hypoalbuminaemia and its effect on measured sodium from POCT and the main laboratory analyser of neonatal intensive-care samples.

Method

Sodium, in paired retrospective samples, measured by the main laboratory and neonatal unit blood-gas (POCT) analysers were compared.

Results

Hypoalbuminaemia (< 30 g/l) was present in 1400/2420 paired results. Sodium was higher when measured by laboratory analyser, the difference increased with decreasing albumin; sodium (laboratory - POCT) = 7.6 (± 1.1)-0.22 (± 0.04)×albumin. A difference > 3 mmol/l was present in 31% and consequently underestimated (9.4%) hyponatraemia and overestimated (3.8%) hypernatraemia.

Conclusion

Hypoalbuminaemia is common in sick neonates and monitoring electrolytes using POCT and laboratory analysers frequently yield significantly different results with consequent misclassification. In these patients, measurement of electrolytes by direct ISE (blood-gas analyser) may be more accurate.

### Association of serum albumin with apnea in infants with bronchiolitis: a secondary analysis of data from the MARC-35 study [^56426a75]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Although using albumin as a variable of apnea or as a component of an apnea prediction tool is promising, the distribution of albumin levels among infants with or without inpatient apnea shows many false-positives (94% of infants with low albumin levels did not have inpatient apnea) and a few false-negatives (0.5% of infants with normal albumin level had inpatient apnea). Until further research is completed, we do not recommend clinicians check albumin levels in infants with bronchiolitis unless otherwise clinically indicated. Replication of this finding in a larger cohort of infants is warranted.

Nonetheless, serum albumin levels may eventually play a role in identifying apnea in infants with severe bronchiolitis. Low serum levels of albumin, a multifunctional protein, have been associated with mortality in children and adults with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory illnesses. The present results extend this association with mortality to apnea, a life-threatening complication of bronchiolitis. The mechanism of low albumin levels in bronchiolitis is uncertain. One possibility is decreased synthesis of albumin. Although poor nutrition is commonly considered the main origin of hypoalbuminemia, not all malnourished individuals have low albumin levels. The present results show that the association between albumin and apnea is independent of weight-for-age z score. Furthermore, because the half-life of albumin is approximately 3 weeks, infants younger than 1 month with low albumin levels would be malnourished from birth. The multivariable models, however, suggest that the association between albumin and apnea is independent of low birth weight. Thus, although decreased synthesis of albumin from poor nutrition may be part of the mechanism of low serum albumin levels in bronchiolitis, it is not the only factor. Another possible mechanism of low serum albumin would be increased losses in the urine or stool, or increased breakdown of albumin. In the present cohort, we did not measure urine or stool albumin levels and have not conducted serum amino acid analysis to suggest increased albumin breakdown.

### Serum albumin and mortality in very low birth weight infants [^6dbd1ca4]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2008). Low credibility.

Serum albumin is a predictor of outcome in adults but its role in paediatric patients is unclear. Earliest albumin was not associated with mortality or morbidity in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. However, the lowest serum albumin had a statistically significant inverse correlation with mortality and potentially plays a prognostic role in VLBW neonates.

### Treatment-related problems in neonates receiving parenteral nutrition: risk factors and implications for practice [^cd52c8df]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

What is new?

Inadequate monitoring, suboptimal doses, and nutritional imbalances are very common TRPs in this population.
The frequency of TRPs is proportionally associated with the duration of hospitalization, number of medications, as well as renal and liver dysfunction.
Individualized therapy based on neonatal nutritional needs, underlying conditions, and response to therapy, is crucial and yet a novel investigational area.

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^a5d7f827]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia

In adults, intravenous infusion of 50 to 75 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used. Hypoalbuminemia is usually accompanied by a hidden extravascular albumin deficiency of equal magnitude. This total body albumin deficit must be considered when determining the amount of albumin necessary to reverse the hypoalbuminemia.

In burns, therapy usually starts with the administration of large volumes of crystalloid injection to maintain plasma volume. After 24 hours, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be added at an initial dose of 25 g with the dose adjusted thereafter to maintain a plasma protein concentration of 2.5 g per 100 mL or a serum protein concentration of 5.2 g/100 mL.

Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites

In adults, intravenous infusion of 8 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be given for every 1,000 mL of ascitic fluid removed.

Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome

In adults, as a guideline, doses of 50–100 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% should be infused over 4 hours and repeated at 4- to 12-hour intervals as necessary, when infusion of normal saline fails to achieve or maintain hemodynamic stability and urine output. [7]

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

In adults, a dose of 25 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% can be infused over 30 minutes and repeated at 8 hour intervals for 3 days, if necessary. [5]

Induction of Diuresis in Patients with Acute Nephrosis

In adults, a dose of 25 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% can be infused, administered with an appropriate diuretic once a day for 7 to 10 days.

Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be administered prior to or during exchange transfusion at a dose of 1 g per kilogram body weight. [6]

### Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in an 8-week-old infant [^cf8b0fac]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

We describe an 8-week-old infant with severe gastrointestinal symptoms, significant hypoalbuminemia, and mild carditis following asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The infant's symptoms, including their temporal appearance, were consistent with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). A unique finding on colonic histology which may shed light on the pathogenesis of MIS-C was identified. The patient improved significantly following several anti-inflammatory treatments. The lag between the presentation of MIS-C and initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure, which may often be asymptomatic, together with the young age of our patient, makes this a challenging diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of this entity, even in the neonatal and infantile age groups, to facilitate timely identification and treatment.

### Management of congenital nephrotic syndrome: consensus recommendations of the ERKNet-ESPN working group [^df27b36e]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on nephrotic syndrome in children:

- **Definition**: Nephrotic syndrome is the most common glomerular disease in childhood, characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The majority of pediatric cases are idiopathic and steroid-sensitive, falling under the umbrella of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis involves increased glomerular permeability due to podocyte dysfunction, resulting in severe protein loss, hypoalbuminemia, and compensatory hepatic lipid production. Most children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, if biopsied, are found to have minimal change disease, which may show podocyte foot process effacement or mild mesangial proliferation with IgM deposition. Less frequently, FSGS may be present, particularly in steroid-resistant cases. Congenital and infantile-onset nephrotic syndrome, presenting within the first 3 months of life, is typically caused by genetic mutations affecting podocyte proteins and is often steroid-resistant. These forms are associated with poor response to immunosuppressive therapy and a high risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease.
- **Epidemiology**: Nephrotic syndrome has an incidence ranging from 1.15 to 16.9 per 100,000 children, with variability across ethnic and geographic populations. It primarily affects children between the ages of 2 and 6 years and is more common in males.
- **Risk factors**: A family history of nephrotic syndrome or other glomerular diseases may increase susceptibility. Environmental triggers such as recent viral infections, particularly upper respiratory tract infections, are frequently reported at disease onset. Genetic mutations affecting podocyte structure and function are more often associated with steroid-resistant forms but may occasionally be present in steroid-sensitive cases.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome typically begins with edema, often periorbital, and may follow an upper respiratory infection. As the disease progresses, generalized edema may develop, including ascites, pleural effusions, and scrotal or labial swelling. Edema may be accompanied by fatigue, decreased urine output, and nonspecific abdominal discomfort. Around 85% of children achieve remission with standard glucocorticoid therapy within 4–6 weeks. However, 70–80% experience at least one relapse, and up to 50% develop frequent relapses or steroid dependence. Kidney function is preserved in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome when appropriately managed, but prolonged glucocorticoid exposure and second-line therapies can contribute to treatment-related morbidity.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: While the disease often resolves spontaneously after puberty, 10–30% of children may have persistent relapses into adulthood, and a small subset (< 5%) may develop secondary steroid resistance with increased risk of progression to kidney failure and post-transplant recurrence.

### Clarifying the role of serum albumin in hyperbilirubinemia management… [^ccaa32e6]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Their protocol included the measurement of serum albumin concentrations along with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency screening and other tests for hemolysis in all neonates who had TSB measured as part of that examination. The authors sought to determine the prevalence of serum albumin levels less than 3 g/dL and how often these levels affected management decisions. Of the 935 newborns who had both TSB and albumin levels measured, they found that 250 had a serum albumin concentration of less than 3. 0 g/dL. However, they reported that these low albumin levels seldom affected phototherapy decisions because most neonates with low albumin levels either had other neurotoxicity risk factors or had TSB levels that did not reach the phototherapy threshold for those with neurotoxicity risk factors. 10 was initiated at levels below the recommended thresholds.

It is likely that low albumin levels and resulting lower treatment thresholds contributed to at least some of these newborns receiving subthreshold phototherapy. Second, the incidence of other neurotoxicity risk factors in their study population was high. They reported sepsis in 9. 9%, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in
9. 9%, and clinical instability in 9. 8% of their study population. We know that newborns can be at higher risk for kernicterus based on having serum albumin levels much lower than 3 g/dL. Significant hypoalbuminemia can be caused by albumin loss or leakage from the intravascular space in newborns with significant illness.

4, 11 Fortunately, neonates with these conditions are often readily identified or there are other signs pointing to the need to measure the serum albumin concentration. These neonates are almost always hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit and may have significant clinical instability, which is listed in the guideline as a neurotoxicity risk factor. Clinicians should, therefore, measure the serum albumin concentration based on clinical judgment, regardless of the TSB.

### Patient survival after human albumin administration. A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^47e96470]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To test the hypothesis that albumin administration is not associated with excess mortality.

Data Sources

Computer searches of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, the Cochrane Library, and Internet documents; hand searching of medical journals; inquiries to investigators and medical directors; and review of reference lists.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials comparing albumin therapy with crystalloid therapy, no albumin, or lower doses of albumin.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently extracted data. The primary end point was relative risk for death. Criteria used to assess methodologic quality were blinding, method of allocation concealment, presence of mortality as a study end point, and crossover. Small-trial bias was also investigated.

Data Synthesis

Fifty-five trials involving surgery or trauma, burns, hypoalbuminemia, high-risk neonates, ascites, and other indications were included. Albumin administration did not significantly affect mortality in any category of indications. For all trials, the relative risk for death was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.28). Relative risk was lower among trials with blinding (0.73 [CI, 0.48 to 1.12]; n = 7), mortality as an end point (1.00 [CI, 0.84 to 1.18]; n = 17), no crossover (1.04 [CI, 0.89 to 1.22]; n = 35), and 100 or more patients (0.94 [CI, 0.77 to 1.14]; n = 10). In trials with two or more such attributes, relative risk was further reduced.

Conclusions

Overall, no effect of albumin on mortality was detected; any such effect may therefore be small. This finding supports the safety of albumin. The influence of methodologic quality on relative risk for death suggests the need for further well-designed clinical trials.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^a392675f]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Guidelines Focus

These recommendations apply to patients receiving albumin in critical care settings with hypovolemia, sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, thermal injuries, and ARDS; cirrhosis; intradialytic hypotension; and cardiovascular surgery. These settings were included based on common uses of albumin, the systematic review of the published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and with input from the panel. We included studies that compared the use of albumin with that of other resuscitation fluids, other pharmaceutical treatments, or standard of care.

Target Population

These guidelines provide actionable recommendations for the most common indications for the use of albumin. The use of albumin for therapeutic apheresis was excluded because recent guidelines were published.

This guideline development process was funded by the Ontario Regional Blood Coordinating Network (Ontario, Canada) and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG; funded by Canadian Blood Services). Neither entity had any input on recommendations or guidelines content. An international panel of neonatal, pediatric, and adult specialists with expertise in the use of albumin developed the recommendations. This panel included 20 members with expertise in intensive care, hepatology, gastroenterology, nephrology, hematology, pathology, neonatology, transfusion medicine, cardiothoracic anesthesiology, internal medicine, and methodology and a patient representative. A framework and related clinical questions were developed according to the United States Preventative Services Task Force Criteria. Disclosures were ascertained yearly from all members.

### Severe nutritional deficiencies in toddlers resulting from health food milk alternatives [^a63d9866]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

It is widely appreciated that health food beverages are not appropriate for infants. Because of continued growth, children beyond infancy remain susceptible to nutritional disorders. We report on 2 cases of severe nutritional deficiency caused by consumption of health food beverages. In both cases, the parents were well-educated, appeared conscientious, and their children received regular medical care. Diagnoses were delayed by a low index of suspicion. In addition, nutritional deficiencies are uncommon in the United States and as a result, US physicians may be unfamiliar with their clinical features. Case 1, a 22-month-old male child, was admitted with severe kwashiorkor. He was breastfed until 13 months of age. Because of a history of chronic eczema and perceived milk intolerance, he was started on a rice beverage after weaning. On average, he consumed 1.5 L of this drink daily. Intake of solid foods was very poor. As this rice beverage, which was fallaciously referred to as rice milk, is extremely low in protein content, the resulting daily protein intake of 0.3 g/kg/day was only 25% of the recommended dietary allowance. In contrast, caloric intake was 72% of the recommended energy intake, so the dietary protein to energy ratio was very low. A photograph of the patient after admission illustrates the typical features of kwashiorkor: generalized edema, hyperpigmented and hypopigmented skin lesions, abdominal distention, irritability, and thin, sparse hair. Because of fluid retention, the weight was on the 10th percentile and he had a rotund sugar baby appearance. Laboratory evaluation was remarkable for a serum albumin of 1.0 g/dL (10 g/L), urea nitrogen < 0.5 mg/dL (< 0.2 mmol/L), and a normocytic anemia with marked anisocytosis. Evaluation for other causes of hypoalbuminemia was negative. Therapy for kwashiorkor was instituted, including gradual refeeding, initially via a nasogastric tube because of severe anorexia. Supplements of potassium, phosphorus, multivitamins, zinc, and folic acid were provided. The patient responded dramatically to refeeding with a rising serum albumin and total resolution of the edema within 3 weeks. At follow-up 1 year later he continued to do well on a regular diet supplemented with a milk-based pediatric nutritional supplement. The mortality of kwashiorkor remains high, because of complications such as infection (kwashiorkor impairs cellular immune defenses) and electrolyte imbalances with ongoing diarrhea. Children in industrialized countries have developed kwashiorkor resulting from the use of a nondairy creamer as a milk alternative, but we were unable to find previous reports of kwashiorkor caused by a health food milk alternative. We suspect that cases have been overlooked. Case 2, a 17-month-old black male, was diagnosed with rickets. He was full-term at birth and was breastfed until 10 months of age, when he was weaned to a soy health food beverage, which was not fortified with vitamin D or calcium. Intake of solid foods was good, but included no animal products. Total daily caloric intake was 114% of the recommended dietary allowance. Dietary vitamin D intake was essentially absent because of the lack of vitamin D-fortified milk. The patient lived in a sunny, warm climate, but because of parental career demands, he had limited sun exposure. His dark complexion further reduced ultraviolet light-induced endogenous skin synthesis of vitamin D. The patient grew and developed normally until after his 9-month check-up, when he had an almost complete growth arrest of both height and weight. The parents reported regression in gross motor milestones. On admission the patient was unable to crawl or roll over. He could maintain a sitting position precariously when so placed. Conversely, his language, fine motor-adaptive, and personal-social skills were well-preserved. Generalized hypotonia, weakness, and decreased muscle bulk were present. Clinical features of rickets present on examination included: frontal bossing, an obvious rachitic rosary (photographed), genu varus, flaring of the wrists, and lumbar kyphoscoliosis. The serum alkaline phosphatase was markedly elevated (1879 U/L), phosphorus was low (1.7 mg/dL), and calcium was low normal (8.9 mg/dL). The 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level was low (7.7 pg/mL) and the parathyroid hormone level was markedly elevated (114 pg/mL). The published radiographs are diagnostic of advanced rickets, showing diffuse osteopenia, frayed metaphyses, widened epiphyseal plates, and a pathologic fracture of the ulna. The patient was treated with ergocalciferol and calcium supplements. The published growth chart demonstrates the dramatic response to therapy. Gross motor milestones were fully regained within 6 months. The prominent neuromuscular manifestations shown by this patient serve as a reminder that rickets should be considered in the differential diagnosis of motor delay. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

### Postoperative hypoalbuminemia and outcomes of pediatric liver transplantation [^3882735a]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study highlights the association between postoperative hypoalbuminemia and AKI in pediatric LT recipients. We recommend closer monitoring of serum albumin levels postoperatively and consideration of albumin infusion to maintain intravascular fluid balance which potentially reduce the risk of AKI. Further research is needed to determine the optimal timing and dosage of albumin infusion. These findings suggest actionable steps for clinical practice to improve outcomes in this population.

### Risk factor analysis and nomogram prediction model construction for NEC complicated by intestinal perforation [^ff8ef876]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia, defined as a serum albumin concentration of less than 30 g/L, is usually due to increased bleeding or intestinal loss in patients with NEC. It is also because infants are susceptible to compromise albumin levels in disease states due to their poor ability to synthesize albumin. Our study has showed that hypoalbuminemia was an independent risk factor for the development of intestinal perforation in NEC, and combined hypoalbuminemia increased the nomogram model score by 100 points. At the same time, there are studies that have showed that hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor prognosis in NEC, including increased complications and reduced patient survival. A previous study demonstrated that hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor prognosis in NEC, with every 10 g/L decreases in serum albumin concentration associated with a 137% increase in mortality, 89% increase in morbidity, and 28% and 71% increases in intensive care unit and hospitalization time, respectively, and that complication rates may be reduced when serum albumin levels are raised above 30 g/L. It has also been noted that an increase or decrease in serum albumin levels is a valuable indicator of disease recovery or deterioration. Therefore, the occurrence of hypoalbuminemia in neonates with NEC in clinical practice needs to be alerted to the development of intestinal perforation, and timely treatment of the primary diseases, albumin infusion, and other interventions for hypoalbuminemia may improve the prognosis of the neonates with NEC.

Patients with NEC commonly exhibit abnormal coagulation. It has been demonstrated that the expression of genes related to coagulation and anticoagulation is significantly altered in patients with NEC, and that these abnormalities lead to a procoagulant state, which causes altered intestinal vascular permeability and impaired microcirculation, resulting in progressive deterioration of intestinal lesions, including mesenteric thrombosis, intestinal ischemia, and intestinal perforation as complications. Our results revealed that APTT ≥ 50 s is an independent risk factor for intestinal perforation in NEC and could increase the nomogram model score by about 66 points. An increased APTT is associated with a high incidence of surgery and a poor prognosis for neonates with NEC. Consequently, early dynamic monitoring of blood coagulation status and correct the coagulation function in time may help reduce complications in neonates with NEC.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^3d5dd563]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Synthesis rates in plasma have been shown to increase after nutrition support in healthy individuals. Whether this is also true in critically ill (septic) patients is uncertain. In postsurgical or septic children and adolescents, FSRs were high, but did not increase after nutrition support. 77 In intestinal fistula patients with intra‐abdominal abscesses, serum albumin synthesis rate was found to be decreased. 78 This does not exclude the possibility that in individuals with mild disease activity, nutrition support, especially including protein/amino acids, increases serum albumin synthesis.

A change in the amount of serum albumin also is a function of its rate of breakdown. The breakdown of serum albumin is complicated by the fact that after oxidation, glycation, or binding of pro‐oxidative substances, serum albumin loses its antioxidant capacity and is more rapidly degraded than reduced unbound serum albumin. 79, 80, 81, 82, 83 The degradation of serum albumin is influenced by changes in charge and hydrophobicity. In the review of Iwao et al, 82 it was suggested that this probably is affected by endocytosis in the liver, but a receptor has not yet been identified. However, there is evidence in rapidly proliferating cells in cancer that serum albumin can be transported into cells and cell organelles, where it can be degraded to its component amino acids acting as building blocks. 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 Finally, in nephrotic syndrome and protein‐losing enteropathy, serum albumin is lost via urine or stools, respectively. Taken together, these findings support the possibility that in stressed conditions, the half‐life of albumin becomes shorter, in part due to accelerated breakdown. A short half‐life of albumin (if present) and increased losses in urine or stools lead to a decrease in total body albumin mass unless compensated by increased synthesis. A comparable mechanism occurs in muscle in stressed states, where protein synthesis increases but degradation increases even more, leading to net muscle efflux of amino acids that serve as building blocks for synthesis of protein and other nitrogen‐containing products in wound healing and in the liver and other parts of the immune system. Simultaneously, muscle cells benefit from this response despite net catabolism of muscle mass. 89, 90 Total serum albumin mass and the distribution volume of serum albumin determine albumin concentrations in serum, the interstitial space, and in cells. In hypoalbuminemia, the ratio between plasma and interstitial serum albumin mass may be normal at 2:3 or slightly increased. 91 If true, this would imply that a decrease in plasma albumin mass signifies that total serum albumin mass is also decreased. Unfortunately, such a calculation cannot be made because intracellular serum albumin concentrations and transmembrane transport are unknown. In view of the large size of the cellular compartment (> 150% of interstitial volume), even low intracellular concentrations may cause large calculation errors. Further study of cell composition and function in the inflammatory state is necessary.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure [^8185b59d]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) — neonatal ALF mechanism and features: GALD results from an intrauterine alloimmune liver injury and is suspected to be the single most common cause of neonatal acute liver failure; characteristic clinical features include an ALF presentation usually at birth and almost always in the first days of life, with the majority (70–90%) of affected infants born premature, and laboratory findings often include refractory hypoglycemia, severe coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated serum ferritin (> 1000 µg/L), while serum aminotransferase levels are normal or near normal and should alert the clinician to the possibility of GALD.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^9940ff62]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The evidence-base guiding the use of intravenous albumin was largely instigated by the Cochrane Injuries Group Albumin systematic review in 1998, which raised the concern for harm from albumin. Subsequent to this publication, RCTs comparing albumin with other fluid treatments in multiple patient populations were completed. These trials failed to confirm the concerns for higher mortality rates in albumin-treated patients. The ICTMG undertook these evidence-based albumin guidelines because no comprehensive evidence-based guidelines had been published yet. The goal of the guidelines is to provide clinicians with recommendations and evidence summaries for common indications for albumin, information on ongoing clinical trials, and areas in need of additional research. The ICTMG guidelines group suggested that albumin should not be used routinely for neonatal, pediatric, and adult patients in critical care; for patients experiencing intradialytic hypotension; for patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery; for admitted patients with cirrhosis for treatment (or correction) of hypoalbuminemia or extraperitoneal infections; or for outpatients with ascites. The ICTMG guidelines conditionally recommended the use of albumin for patients with cirrhosis undergoing large-volume paracentesis or with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. One of 14 recommendations was a strong recommendation based on more definitive clinical trial evidence, but most of the recommendations were conditional based on low- or very low-quality evidence because of the paucity or conflicting RCT evidence, highlighting the need for ongoing research. The implementation of the guidelines will help to reduce the unnecessary transfusion of albumin and the variability between hospitals.

### Hypoalbuminaemia predicts outcome in adult patients with congenital heart disease [^f2368302]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

The association between hypoalbuminaemia and outcome

Hypoalbuminaemia likely relates to mortality in the ACHD population through various mechanisms. Preoperative hypoalbuminaemia is a recognised risk factor for perioperative mortality, infection, ventilator dependency and long-term mortality, both for cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. Many patients with ACHD require one or more surgeries during their lifetime, and hypoalbuminaemia contributes to perioperative morbidity and mortality. It has been proposed that this effect may be, at least in part, related to the high antioxidative properties of albumin. Moreover, hypoalbuminaemia is directly related to lower serum osmotic pressureand can promote peripheral and pulmonary congestion, which can be potentially lethal. However, it is more likely that hypoalbuminaemia is an indicator of multiorgan derangement, including cardiac, renal and liver disease, which are associated with a higher likelihood of adverse outcome. Moreover, low albumin levels may reflect generalised endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and possibly neurohormonal activation, which again adversely affect survival. Hypoalbuminaemia was a predictor of mortality independent of creatinine levels and sodium concentration, suggesting that it carries prognostic information beyond renal dysfunction or neurohormonal activation (an established driver for hyponatraemia in heart failure).

Clinical implications

ACHD physicians have in the past focused their attention on hypoalbuminaemia mainly in the setting of protein losing enteropathy in patients with a failing Fontan circulation. In the light of the present study, screening for hypoalbuminaemia should be included in the routine blood test panel of all patients with ACHD, not only those with more complex defects or significant symptoms. Patients with hypoalbuminaemia should be deemed at increased risk of death, and potential causes of hypoalbuminaemia should be examined. Hypoalbuminaemia in this setting is a robust, unifying parameter with sound pathophysiological background and should be an integral part of the decision making in this complex group of patients.

### Hypoalbuminaemia predicts outcome in adult patients with congenital heart disease [^339a7d37]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The number of adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD) is increasing. Despite ongoing research and continuous improvement in care in what is increasingly recognised as a condition with multiorgan involvement, mortality remains considerable. Risk stratification is an essential component of the management of patients with ACHD, and identification of parameters, both cardiac and non-cardiac, strongly related to outcome is crucial.

Hypoalbuminaemia is a marker of liver and renal dysfunction, but also advanced cardiovascular disease, subclinical systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma and the main determinant of plasma oncotic pressure. It counterbalances hydrostatic pressure and controls fluid distribution in body compartments. Moreover, albumin affects the pharmacokinetics of many drugs, thus, modulating response to treatment. Hence, hypoalbuminaemia may result or contribute to pulmonary or peripheral congestion, influence pharmacological therapy and, ultimately, mortality in ACHD. Hypoalbuminaemia has been reported in selected subgroups of patients with ACHD, but the prevalence of hypoalbuminaemia and its relation to outcome across the spectrum of patients with ACHD remains unknown.

We sought to examine the prevalence and prognostic significance of hypoalbuminaemia in a large single-centre cohort of patients with ACHD.

### Evidence and unknowns for the relevancy of applying current parenteral nutrition support recommendations among infants born less than 750 g or younger than 25 weeks' gestation: a narrative review [^ac7a2fd7]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Several significant knowledge gaps exist regarding mineral and trace element requirements in nanopreterm infants. The interpretation of serum calcium levels is complicated by the rapid elevation of parathyroid hormone in response to hypocalcemia, potentially masking true calcium status, whereas hypoalbuminemia can lead to apparent eucalcemia despite reduced available calcium. The optimal timing and dosing of mineral supplementation during different clinical phases remain unclear, particularly during periods of metabolic stress or rapid growth. Furthermore, the impact of various clinical factors on mineral requirements and utilization, such as concurrent medication use, inflammation, and oxidative stress, requires further investigation in this specific population.

The appropriateness of current recommendations for nanopreterm infants faces several limitations. The complex interplay between protein provision and mineral utilization requires careful consideration, particularly as high protein intake without adequate phosphorus can lead to mineral disturbances. Maximum allowable concentrations are constrained by solubility limits within PN admixtures, and the most appropriate provisions specifically for nanopreterm infants remain unknown. Current guidelines do not account for the unique metabolic capabilities and mineral requirements of these extremely immature infants, particularly during different phases of illness and recovery. Additionally, the long‐term implications of current mineral and trace element provision practices on bone mineralization, growth, and neurodevelopment remain undefined. These limitations underscore the need for nanopreterm‐specific research to establish appropriate supplementation strategies that account for their unique physiological characteristics and developmental needs.

A summation of the many unique physiological characteristics and proposed recommendations for PN management of nanopreterm infants is listed in Figure 2 as a reference for care providers of this population.

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^0bb721a9]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

1.1 Hypovolemia

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% is indicated in the emergency treatment of hypovolemia with or without shock. Its effectiveness in reversing hypovolemia depends largely upon its ability to draw interstitial fluid into the circulation. It is most effective in patients who are well hydrated. When blood volume deficit is the result of hemorrhage, compatible red blood cells or whole blood should be administered as quickly as possible. [1, 2]

When hypovolemia is long standing and hypoalbuminemia exists accompanied by adequate hydration or edema, 20% - 25% albumin solutions should be used. [1]

1.2 Hypoalbuminemia

For subjects with hypoalbuminemia who are critically ill and/or are bleeding actively, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% infusions may be indicated. [3] When albumin deficit is the result of excessive protein loss, the effect of administration of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% will be temporary unless the underlying disorder is reversed.

1.3 Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used to maintain cardiovascular function following the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites. [2]

1.4 Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used as a plasma expander in fluid management relating to severe forms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). [7, 8]

1.5 Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% infusions may be indicated in conjunction with diuretics to correct the fluid volume overload associated with ARDS. [5]

1.6 Acute Nephrosis (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used to treat edema in patients with acute nephrosis who are refractory to cyclophosphamide and corticosteroid therapy. [1]

1.7 Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% is indicated in the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. It may be used prior to or during an exchange procedure in an attempt to bind free bilirubin and to enhance its removal. [6]

### Postoperative hypoalbuminemia and outcomes of pediatric liver transplantation [^c70e8245]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoalbuminemia after liver transplantation (LT) is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and poor outcomes in adult LT recipients. This study was performed to examine the association between the postoperative serum albumin level and early postoperative outcomes of LT in children.

Methods

This single-center retrospective review involved pediatric LT recipients (0–18 years old) treated from January 2013 to June 2020. All patients were admitted to PICU and received standard post-LT care protocol. We divided patients into low (< 30 g/L) and normal (> 30 g/L) groups based on postoperative albumin day 1 to 3.

Results

Among 108 LT recipients, most had biliary atresia. The median age at the time of LT was 1.8 years [interquartile range (IQR), 1.5–5.7]. There were 18 patients in low albumin group [median albumin level, 27.9 g/L (IQR, 25.8–29.6) and 90 patients in normal albumin group [median albumin level, 34.5 g/L (IQR, 32.4–36.9). The low albumin group had significantly higher incidence of AKI, occurring in 20% of patients with a median onset of 2.5 days following LT (IQR, 1–5). Postoperative hypoalbuminemia (OR, 4.94; 95% CI, 1.32–18.47; p = 0.01) and a longer operative time (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01–1.47; p = 0.02) were independent risk factors for AKI by multivariable analysis. No significant differences between the two groups were found in other early postoperative outcomes.

Conclusion

Postoperative hypoalbuminemia was associated with early postoperative AKI following LT in children but not with other worsening outcomes.

### Hypoalbuminaemia predicts outcome in adult patients with congenital heart disease [^2a094e31]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

This is a retrospective study performed in a single, large, tertiary adult congenital heart centre. The prevalence of hypoalbuminaemia in our study reflects the case-mix of patients with ACHD seen in a tertiary centre such as ours, with a high proportion of patients with moderate or severe lesions. Moreover, prevalence estimates are likely to be influenced by a referral bias, as not all patients with ACHD over the study period underwent blood sampling.

In fact, patients in whom albumin had not been assessed during the study period were less likely to present with hypoalbuminaemia, but also had lower mortality. This suggests that even though referral bias may have affected our estimates of the prevalence of hypoalbuminaemia, especially in patients with simple forms of ACHD, it is unlikely to have affected the strong prognostic value of hypoalbuminaemia reported in our study.

Neither ALT nor AST are optimal markers of liver dysfunction and liver imaging, or in selected cases biopsy, provide better insight into hepatic function.

Future, larger prospective studies are clearly warranted to further investigate the mechanisms linking hypoalbuminaemia to outcome in ACHD and its place in a holistic risk assessment algorithm in this unique and challenging group of patients.

### Standardised neonatal parenteral nutrition formulations-australasian neonatal parenteral nutrition consensus update 2017 [^7bf183ad]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Biochemical monitoring on PN

PN administration requires careful clinical and laboratory monitoring. High blood urea nitrogen, hyperglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, hypertriglyceridemia and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are frequently encountered biochemical abnormalities on PN. In addition to routine observations, periodic measurements of the following biochemical parameters are suggested during PN therapy. Suggested monitoring by the group is shown in Additional file 1: Table S3.

No data are available to determine the effect of higher versus lower amino acid and lipid intake in PN in 'sick' infants (e.g. infants with moderate-severe respiratory distress, receiving cardiovascular support, possible sepsis, acidosis); and 'surgical' or postoperative infants or infants post-cardiopulmonary bypass.

Blood Urea Nitrogen [Conversion blood urea nitrogen = blood urea divided by 2.14]: In the Cochrane review comparing higher versus lower amino acid intake in parenteral nutrition, six studies reported BUN levels. The criteria for abnormal blood urea nitrogen differed between the studies and varied from > 10 mmol/L to 21.4 mmol/L. There was a significant increase in abnormal blood urea nitrogen level from higher amino acid intake in all these studies although a threshold level was not clear. Given the data supporting the importance of early amino-acid administration in premature infants, limiting amino acid intake based on serum BUN alone is not warranted. BUN levels up to 14.3 mmol/L may be considered acceptable in VLBW infants on PN provided there are no other parameters to suggest protein intolerance (eg hyperammonaemia > 122 μmol/L).

Hyperglycaemia

Hyperglycaemia (> 8.3 mmol/L) is not uncommon in ELBW infants. If blood glucose > 10 mmol/L (moderate hyperglycaemia), further management to control hyperglycaemia should be considered including reducing the glucose infusion rate (e.g. changing over to 7.5% Dextrose PN).

Hypoglycaemia (BGL < 2.6 mmol/L) can occur particularly with a sudden cessation of PN or undetected extravasation of solutions.

Cholestasis

Defined as serum level of direct bilirubin > 20% of total serum bilirubin or serum level of direct bilirubin > 34 mmol/L [mg/dL × 17.10].

Hypoalbuminemia

Defined as serum albumin, preterm < 18 g/L in preterm and < 25 g/L in term neonates.

### New WHO guideline on the prevention and management of acute malnutrition in infants and young children: remaining challenges [^c2750a74]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

The updated WHO guidelines have the potential to dramatically curb the incidence of acute malnutrition and provide comprehensive community-based nutrition care. However, it is essential that the implementation of these guidelines is done thoughtfully and intentionally with full financial and administrative support from local Ministries of Health and implementing partners. These general guidelines not cause clinicians to lose sight of the necessity to individualise care to each child and family, which is essential for the management and prevention of acute malnutrition and which includes a need to act quickly on risk factors and early onset of growth faltering long prior to the diagnosis of MAM and SAM.

### Management of congenital nephrotic syndrome: consensus recommendations of the ERKNet-ESPN working group [^55c98049]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Box 3 Recommendations for fluid and albumin administration

We recommend rapid referral of children with CNS to a specialized paediatric nephrology unit due to the complexity of the disease and fluid management.
We recommend avoiding intravenous fluids and saline. Oral fluid intake should be concentrated if necessary to avoid marked oedema.
We recommend using albumin infusions based on clinical indicators of hypovolaemia (including oliguria, acute kidney injury, prolonged capillary refill time, tachycardia, hypotension and abdominal discomfort) or upon failure to thrive. We do not recommend administering albumin infusions in children with CNS based on serum albumin levels.
When possible, we recommend avoiding central venous lines in children with CNS owing to the high risk of thrombosis. If central venous access is required for repeated albumin infusions, we recommend administering prophylactic anticoagulation for as long as the line is in place (Box 7).

General approach

We recommend rapid referral of children with CNS to a specialized paediatric nephrology unit. These children are often born prematurely and amniotic fluid may be stained with meconium but ventilator therapy is rarely needed. Pregnancy is usually uneventful. Given the wide variation in clinical findings in infants with CNS, individualized therapy is needed, with a number of key objectives: preserve all central and peripheral arteries and veins for potential dialysis access; avoid peripherally inserted catheters and unnecessary venepunctures; optimize fluid, protein and caloric intake; minimize administration of salt-containing fluids; prevent thrombosis, particularly in patients with a CVL or hypovolaemia; and treat infection when clinically suspected by starting empiric antibiotics before culture results are available. C-reactive protein and leukocyte levels are not reliable indicators of septicaemia in patients with CNS.

Fluid management

As no studies have investigated specific treatments for oedema in CNS, treatment should focus on assessment of volume status (that is, overfill versus underfill) and salt restriction, as recommended for adult patients. Fluid restriction is advocated for hyponatraemia and in the most severe cases of oedema.

Fluid prescription in patients with CNS should primarily be used to provide adequate nutrition. Intake of fluid should be limited, when feasible, by using concentrated high-calorie formulas to meet age-related energy needs, guided by the advice of expert renal dieticians. Intravenous albumin is the treatment of choice for acute symptomatic hypovolaemia (see below).

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^64b11b8a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) with secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) — evaluation and management: SHG, lymphopenia, and increased risk for frequent infections may occur in PLE, and SHG due to PLE should be suspected in edematous patients with low albumin when other causes of protein loss, suboptimal synthesis, or malnutrition have been excluded; increased clearance of alpha-1 antitrypsin is consistent with a diagnosis of PLE, and reduced serum concentrations of albumin, fibrinogen, cholesterol, transferrin, ceruloplasmin, and fat-soluble vitamins are variably observed. Genetic testing for monogenic causes of very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) should be considered in pediatric enteropathy with hypogammaglobulinemia, as well as loss-of-function mutations in SLCO2A1. For treatment evidence, in a report of 2 pediatric patients with severe SHG due to PLE, an infusion of 200 mg/kg IVIG increased serum IgG to approximately 700 mg/dL, but levels were slightly above 350 mg/dL by 7 days post-infusion; it has been suggested that IgG-RT be considered if prophylactic antibiotics are inadequate at preventing infections. SCIG may possibly be preferable for patients with protein-losing conditions, and in a case series of 3 patients with PLE, SCIG led to decreased infections and more stable IgG levels than IVIG; however, SCIG use for non-PI protein-losing conditions would be considered off-label because it is not FDA-approved. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of IgG-RT in PLE, and vaccination per CDC guidelines is recommended.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^55aeb3dd]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Small-volume resuscitation can rapidly correct hypovolemia. Hyperoncotic albumin solutions, long in clinical use, are suitable for small-volume resuscitation; however, their clinical benefits remain uncertain.

Methods

Randomized clinical trials comparing hyperoncotic albumin with a control regimen for volume expansion were sought by multiple methods, including computer searches of bibliographic databases, perusal of reference lists, and manual searching. Major findings were qualitatively summarized. In addition, a quantitative meta-analysis was performed on available survival data.

Results

In all, 25 randomized clinical trials with a total of 1,485 patients were included. In surgery, hyperoncotic albumin preserved renal function and reduced intestinal edema compared with control fluids. In trauma and sepsis, cardiac index and oxygenation were higher after administration of hydroxyethyl starch than hyperoncotic albumin. Improved treatment response and renal function, shorter hospital stay and lower costs of care were reported in patients with liver disease receiving hyperoncotic albumin. Edema and morbidity were decreased in high-risk neonates after hyperoncotic albumin administration. Disability was reduced by therapy with hyperoncotic albumin in brain injury. There was no evidence of deleterious effects attributable to hyperoncotic albumin. Survival was unaffected by hyperoncotic albumin (pooled relative risk, 0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.17).

Conclusion

In some clinical indications, randomized trial evidence has suggested certain benefits of hyperoncotic albumin such as reductions in morbidity, renal impairment and edema. However, further clinical trials are needed, particularly in surgery, trauma and sepsis.

### Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergy [^cfded648]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food-induced allergic disorders (non-IgE-GI-FAs) account for an unknown proportion of food allergies and include food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), and food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE). Non-IgE-GI-FAs are separate clinical entities but have many overlapping clinical and histologic features among themselves and with eosinophilic gastroenteropathies. Over the past decade, FPIES has emerged as the most actively studied non-IgE-GI-FA, potentially because of acute and distinct clinical features. FPIAP remains among the common causes of rectal bleeding in infants, while classic infantile FPE is rarely diagnosed. The overall most common allergens are cow's milk and soy; in patients with FPIES, rice and oat are also common. The most prominent clinical features of FPIES are repetitive emesis, pallor, and lethargy; chronic FPIES can lead to failure to thrive. FPIAP manifests with bloody stools in well-appearing young breast-fed or formula-fed infants. Features of FPE are nonbloody diarrhea, malabsorption, protein-losing enteropathy, hypoalbuminemia, and failure to thrive. Non-IgE-GI-FAs have a favorable prognosis; the majority resolve by 1 year in patients with FPIAP, 1 to 3 years in patients with FPE, and 1 to 5 years in patients with FPIES, with significant differences regarding specific foods. There is an urgent need to better define the natural history of FPIES and the pathophysiology of non-IgE-GI-FAs to develop biomarkers and novel therapies.

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^6d462033]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

2.1 Dosage

General Recommendations

The concentration of the albumin preparation, dosage and the infusion rate should be adjusted to the patient's individual requirements.

The dose required depends on the body weight of the patient, the severity of trauma or illness and on continuing fluid and protein losses. Measures of adequacy of circulating volume and not plasma albumin levels should be used to determine the dose required.

The daily dose should not exceed 2 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% per kg of body weight.

Hypovolemia

In adults, an intravenous infusion of 25 g should be given. If adequate response (stabilization of circulation) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes, an additional dose may be given.

In spite of limited information about the efficacy in pediatric subjects, an intravenous infusion of 2.5 to 12.5 g or 0.5 to 1 g/kg body weight may be given. If adequate response (stabilization of circulation) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes, an additional dose may be given.

Hemodilution may follow administration of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25%. If hemorrhage has occurred, this may result in relative anemia. This condition should be controlled by the supplemental administration of compatible red blood cells or compatible whole blood.

### Neonatal nephrotic syndrome: all is not gloomy [^48d2a92b]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is a rare clinical syndrome with a constellation of proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and oedema, presenting within 3months of birth. We present a rare case of neonatal nephrotic syndrome with a probable sepsis induced aetiology. The neonate was referred at day of life 15 with Klebsiella pneumonia sepsis and anasarca. On investigation, the patient had nephrotic range proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia, generalised anasarca and ascites. The neonate was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and furosemide. Genetic and other secondary causes of CNS were ruled out. With supportive management and resolution of sepsis, the neonate improved. This case highlights the rare cause of sepsis-induced nephrotic syndrome (NS), which required only supportive treatment without the need for aggressive management of CNS.

### Management of congenital nephrotic syndrome: consensus recommendations of the ERKNet-ESPN working group [^57e0be4b]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and oedema, which manifest in utero or during the first 3 months of life. The main cause of CNS is genetic defects in podocytes; however, it can also be caused, in rare cases, by congenital infections or maternal allo-immune disease. Management of CNS is very challenging because patients are prone to severe complications, such as haemodynamic compromise, infections, thromboses, impaired growth and kidney failure. In this consensus statement, experts from the European Reference Network for Kidney Diseases (ERKNet) and the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN) summarize the current evidence and present recommendations for the management of CNS, including the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, diuretics, anticoagulation and infection prophylaxis. Therapeutic management should be adapted to the clinical severity of the condition with the aim of maintaining intravascular euvolaemia and adequate nutrition, while preventing complications and preserving central and peripheral vessels. We do not recommend performing routine early nephrectomies but suggest that they are considered in patients with severe complications despite optimal conservative treatment, and before transplantation in patients with persisting nephrotic syndrome and/or a WT1-dominant pathogenic variant.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^1e331c09]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children — urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin thresholds: The substitution of spot UPCR for the 24-hour urine collection has been established as the standard of care for children, with nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as first morning UPCR of ≥ 2 g/g. Whereas the 2012 KDIGO guideline maintained albumin ≤ 2.5 g/dL, the current guideline suggests serum albumin ≤ 3 g/dl; however, we suggest continuing to use the definition of nephrotic syndrome for children in the absence of evidence to support a change to a higher cutoff. It is unknown whether children with nephrotic-range proteinuria and less severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 2.6–2.9 g/dL) have similar pathology or treatment responses, and this has not been studied in prospective clinical trials. Practice Point 4.1.1 states that the definitions relating to nephrotic syndrome in children are based on the clinical characteristics outlined in Figure 39.

### Abstracts of ESPR 2013, the European society of paediatric radiology 50th annual meeting and 36th postgraduate course. June 3–7 2013. budapest, Hungary [^7d3b09c5]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction: A nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a disease consisting of massive leakage of proteins in urine, potentially lifethreatening due to hypovolemia, hypercoagulability and infections. It is defined by the association of edema, urinary protein > 20 g/L and serum albumin level < 10 g/L. The annual incidence of NS in the USA and Europe is estimated at about 1–7/100.000 births. Most NS result from a dysfunction of the podocytes at the level of glomerular filtration barrier. Treatment ought to be installed as early as possible in order to reduce hypoproteinemia and its secondary effects. Several NS are corticoid-sensitive but many are corticoid-resistant especially among congenital NS.

There are three types of NS, idiopathic (the most common), secondary and congenital. Congenital NS (CNS) is a NS diagnosed in utero or during the first 3 months after birth. Infantile NS cases are discovered later during the first year and childhood NS after the first year. This clinical classification is however arbitrary, since the majority of early onset NS have a genetic origin and have a widespread age of diagnosis (from fetal life to several years). Among CNS, some occur as an isolated finding but some are part of more complex syndromes. Their diagnosis has been greatly facilitated thanks to genetic progresses. On the contrary, surprisingly enough, the role of US in the diagnosis of CNS has been rarely highlighted.

### Postoperative hypoalbuminemia and outcomes of pediatric liver transplantation [^45b43df9]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that early postoperative hypoalbuminemia was associated with AKI in pediatric LT recipients. No other short-term clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality, were associated with the postoperative serum albumin level. The incidence of AKI in the early period post-LT was 20%, and independent risk factors included postoperative hypoalbuminemia and a longer operative time.

A meta-analysis of adult LT recipients showed that a serum albumin level of less than 30–35 g/L was associated with AKI after LT. However, a randomized controlled trial revealed no benefit of maintaining the serum albumin level above 30 g/L following LT. Notably, most studies assessed the pre-transplant serum albumin level and mainly involved adults. Only one large retrospective study showed that an early postoperative serum albumin level of less than 30 g/L was an independent risk factor for AKI in adult LT recipients (similar to our study) and was associated with a higher mortality rate and longer hospitalization. Hypoalbuminemia is common before LT because of the impaired synthetic function of the cirrhotic liver. The albumin level may be altered intraoperatively and postoperatively secondary to capillary leakage, blood loss, exogenous albumin infusion, and fluid balance. Net leakage of albumin from plasma progresses from the end of the surgery and persists until POD 3. Thus, we classified the patients' albumin levels within 3 days of surgery and compared their early post-LT outcomes. Interestingly, the results of this study showed that pediatric LT recipients with a low postoperative serum albumin level were more likely to develop AKI in the early postoperative period. Moreover, when analyzing patients with and without AKI, this finding was confirmed by multivariable analysis.

### Serum albumin assessment in neonatal jaundice: impact on phototherapy decision-making… [^c8b34850]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of serum albumin assessment on early neonatal jaundice treatment decisions. Out of 935 infants evaluated for hyperbilirubinemia, 250 infants had serum albumin levels less than 3. 0 g/dL. Among 121 infants who received phototherapy at TSB levels meeting the guideline threshold, 49 infants had serum albumin less than 3. 0 g/dL as one of the neurotoxicity risk factors. 1 The most concerning consequence of hyperbilirubinemia is neurological dysfunction, bilirubin encephalopathy, or kernicterus, which may cause disability or death. 2 To prevent complications, it is crucial to regularly monitor newborns for clinical jaundice, promptly assess the total serum bilirubin level, and offer treatment with phototherapy or exchange transfusion when clinically indicated. 5 The AAP guidelines define low serum albumin levels as one of the risk factors for bilirubin neurotoxicity, along with isoimmune hemolytic disease; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; or other hemolytic conditions, sepsis, and significant clinical instability in the previous 24 hours. 12 These findings indicate that as many as 50% of newborns born after 35 weeks' gestation may have serum albumin levels less than or equal to 3. 0 g/dL, which contributes to the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity. Our study found that 26. 7% of all newborns over 35 weeks' gestation assessed for early neonatal jaundice had serum albumin levels less than
3. 0 g/dL. 14 Yang et al retrospectively assessed 435 term newborns with hyperbilirubinemia over 4 years in southeast China. They found that 9. 7% had G6PD deficiency,
3. 5% had ABO isoimmunization, and 16. 1% had infection as causes of early neonatal jaundice.

The low yield of serum albumin to affect any treatment decisions is mostly due to the fact that nearly one-half of infants with serum albumin less than 3. 0 g/dL already had 1 or more bilirubin neurotoxicity risk factors, especially clinical instability or sepsis. Prior research has shown a correlation between reduced levels of serum albumin and neonatal morbidity, including respiratory distress syndrome.

### Nephrotic syndrome [^c0c0ca8a]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by edema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. Minimal change disease, the most common cause in childhood, generally responds to corticosteroids, although most patients experience disease relapses. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is usually resistant to corticosteroids and carries a significant risk of kidney failure, necessitating renal transplantation. Nephrotic syndrome may also be secondary to gene mutations and systemic diseases such as lupus. Clinical evaluation involves distinguishing primary and secondary causes and monitoring for disease complications, including blood clots and serious infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Immunosuppressive medications are used to prevent relapses and treat corticosteroid-resistant disease.

### High protein intake on later outcomes in preterm children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5caeb5ac]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In children born preterm, refeeding syndrome and related electrolyte disturbances are precipitated by the sudden supply of intravenous amino acids and glucose following a period of low nutrition. We found that infants in the high protein group had a higher risk of developing refeeding syndrome and its biochemical components, hypophosphatemia and hypercalcemia. Refeeding syndrome in neonates is associated with mortality and morbidity, including metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, hypovolemia, ischaemia, respiratory alkalosis, sepsis and chronic lung disease. This suggests possible reasons why high protein intake contributed to the worse developmental outcomes we found in this study. Most of the studies reviewed were conducted in an era when electrolytes such as phosphate were withheld or restricted for the first few days after birth, likely exacerbating the effects of a higher protein intake to precipitate hypophosphatemia, though it is unknown if appropriate monitoring and treatment of electrolyte disturbances to prevent and treat refeeding syndrome may ameliorate these effects.

We found that children in the high protein group might have slightly higher serum albumin concentrations (mean difference 0.25 g/dl) than those in the LP group. Exogenous administration of amino acids stimulates organ-specific protein synthesis, and the introduction of amino acids immediately after birth stimulates albumin synthesis in preterm infants. Plasma albumin can temporarily store amino acids, preventing excess amino acid oxidation. We also found that HP intake group had a higher risk of having high blood urea concentration (> 5 mmol/L) than their counterparts, likely reflecting oxidation of at least some of the additional amino acids. However, urea is considered as non-toxic at lower concentrations and, although the concentration at which serum urea can cause harm is yet to be determined, it has been recommended that lowering of protein intake should be considered if urea concentrations are above 5.7 mmol/L. Overall, these small biochemical changes related to the metabolism of protein are very unlikely to be of any clinical significance.

### Diagnosis and treatment of tyrosinemia type I: a US and Canadian consensus group review and recommendations [^88630905]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical findings in HT-1

Hepatic disease

Infants with HT-1 demonstrate acute liver failure as early as a few weeks of age. Historically, a continuum of disease severity was observed, ranging from hepatic dysfunction and failure within the first months of life to a chronic illness with hepatic cirrhosis. Coagulopathy is an early sign, manifesting even without other clinical signs of hepatic dysfunction. Hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, direct hyperbilirubinemia, elevated transaminases, and hypoalbuminemia may not be present during initial follow-up of positive NBS. Neonatal hypoglycemia without other signs of hepatic dysfunction may be observed, but may resolve quickly. As presymptomatic infants with HT-1 are identified by NBS, physicians should obtain baseline hepatic studies for ongoing comparisons with increasing age (Tables 1 and 3). Hyperbilirubinemia, in the absence of other abnormal hepatic studies, is NOT helpful in the initial diagnosis of HT-1. Its presence may imply another type of liver problem. Blood AFP is an important marker, which is almost always elevated in early infancy. However, physicians should be careful in the interpretation of elevated AFP levels in young infants since this is commonly a normal finding in healthy neonates, as a remnant of the AFP which constitutes the major circulating protein in fetal blood. AFP rapidly declines after birth and the values observed in HT-1 are often 10-fold those observed in normal neonates (< 1 month old). Ongoing AFP measurements are mandatory for following HT-1 patients, as they are a useful indicator of developing HCC. However, elevated AFP levels are not diagnostic for HT-1. In contrast, elevated blood or urine SA levels are diagnostic for HT-1. SA should return to undetectable (or normal per reference laboratory) levels with NTBC therapy and throughout life as evidence of compliance with drug therapy. There is one report of a child with "silent" HT-1, without elevated tyrosine or SA, that was identified by liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, requiring FAH gene sequence for diagnosis.

### Cytomegalovirus infection can mimic genetic nephrotic syndrome: a case report [^7d9ed9ea]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In the first year of life, 66% of the patients suffering from hypoalbuminemia and severe proteinuria are diagnosed with genetic nephrotic syndrome (GNS). Many mutations can be responsible for GNS. NPHS1, encoding nephrin, is involved in the Finnish type of GNS; 2 main variants are characterized, Fin-major (p.L41fsX91) which represents 78% of the described NPHS1 mutations in Finland, and Fin-minor (p.R1109X). Podocin, a protein which is encoded by the NPHS2 gene, has also been reported in GNS cases. Noteworthy, immunosuppressive treatments are often inefficient; the prognosis of the disease is poor, and renal transplantation is often necessary, usually with no relapse.

However, non-genetic congenital or infantile nephrotic syndromes have been identified. They have to be diagnosed early, since some of them can be treated in a specific manner, and cured.

### Factors influencing necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^98f84558]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a multifactorial gastrointestinal disease with high morbidity and mortality among premature infants. However, studies with large samples on the factors of NEC in China have not been reported. This meta-analysis aims to systematically review the literature to explore the influencing factors of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants in China and provide a reference for the prevention of NEC.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Wanfang and VIP databases were systematically searched from inception to February 2023. We used Stata14.0 software to perform the systematic review and meta-analysis. We used fixed or random effects models with combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and quality was evaluated using the Newcastle‒Ottawa Scale (NOS).

Results

The total sample was 8616 cases, including 2456 cases in the intervention group and 6160 cases in the control group. It was found that 16 risk factors and 3 protective factors were related to necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. Septicemia (OR = 3.91), blood transfusion (OR = 2.41), neonatal asphyxia (OR = 2.46), pneumonia (OR = 6.17), infection (OR = 5.99), congenital heart disease (OR = 4.80), intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) (OR = 2.71), mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.44), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (OR = 3.08), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (OR = 3.28), hypoalbuminemia (OR = 2.80), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (OR = 3.10), respiratory failure (OR = 7.51), severe anemia (OR = 2.86), history of antibiotic use (OR = 2.12), and meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) (OR = 3.14) were risk factors for NEC in preterm infants in China. Breastfeeding (OR = 0.31), oral probiotics (OR = 0.36), and prenatal use of glucocorticoids (OR = 0.38) were protective factors for NEC in preterm infants.

Conclusions

Septicemia, blood transfusion, neonatal asphyxia, pneumonia, infection, congenital heart disease, ICP, GDM, RDS, hypoproteinemia, PDA, respiratory failure, severe anemia, history of antibiotic use and MSAF will increase the risk of NEC in premature infants, whereas breastfeeding, oral probiotics and prenatal use of glucocorticoids reduce the risk. Due to the quantity and quality of the included literature, the above findings need to be further validated by more high-quality studies.

### Rice nightmare: kwashiorkor in 2 Philadelphia-area infants fed rice dream beverage [^24199997]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

A 14-month-old girl and a 7-month-old boy each presented with a diffuse dermatitis, whole body edema, and hypoalbuminemia. The diets of both infants consisted almost entirely of Rice Dream, a rice-based, protein-poor beverage. Both infants were diagnosed with kwashiorkor, which resolved with protein supplementation. Clues from the physical examination, a diet history, appropriate laboratory examinations, and an index of suspicion are crucial in promptly diagnosing and treating infants with kwashiorkor. Manufacturers of rice beverages should appropriately warn parents about the dangers of using their products as infant nourishment.

### Use of albumin: an update [^aec77693]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Human albumin (HA) is widely used for volume replacement or correction of hypoalbuminaemia. The value of HA in the clinical setting continues to be controversial, and it is unclear whether in today's climate of cost consciousness, there is still a place for such a highly priced substance. It is therefore appropriate to update our knowledge of the value of HA. With the exception of women in early pregnancy, there appears to be few indications for the use of HA to correct hypovolaemia. Some studies of traumatic brain injury and intensive care patients suggest negative effects on outcome and organ function of (hyperoncotic) HA. Modern synthetic colloids appear to be a cheaper alternative for maintaining colloid oncotic pressure. The value of using HA to correct hypoalbuminaemia has not been clearly justified. Theoretical and pharmacological benefits of HA, such as oxygen radical scavenging or binding of toxic substances, have not as yet been shown to have beneficial clinical consequences. Experimental data from cell lines or animals do not appear to mimic the clinical setting. Convincing data justifying the use of HA either for treating hypovolaemia or for correcting hypoalbuminaemia are still lacking. A restricted use of HA is recommended.

### Hypoalbuminaemia predicts outcome in adult patients with congenital heart disease [^c1fa8521]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study demonstrates for the first time that hypoalbuminaemia is common across the spectrum of ACHD and is a strong independent predictor of mortality. Increased awareness of this simple, often neglected risk factor may help to improve risk assessment in this expanding population of patients. Hypoalbuminaemia appeared to be a stronger predictor of outcome in patients with moderate to complex ACHD, who are at risk of adverse events and, thus, are more likely to benefit from accurate risk stratification algorithms.

The pathogenesis of hypoalbuminaemia in patients with ACHD

The aetiology of hypoalbuminaemia in ACHD is likely to be multifactorial. Hypoalbuminaemia has previously been reported in patients with both acute and chronic heart failure due to systolic or diastolic LV dysfunction, in the setting of acquired heart disease. Venous congestion is known to contribute to an increased transcapillary escape rate of albumin (TER), that is, the fraction of intravascular mass of albumin that passes to the extravascular space per unit of time. TER is significantly increased in patients with congestive heart failure and a raised central venous pressure, and the same is likely to be true in patients with ACHD. In fact, evidence of raised central venous pressure has been reported in various ACHD cohorts, including patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, Fontan circulation and tetralogy of Fallot. Surprisingly in our cohort, patients with a Fontan-type circulation, in whom central venous hypertension is the norm, had a relatively low prevalence of hypoalbuminaemia, suggesting that other mechanisms, beyond a high central venous pressure, are promoting hypoalbuminaemia.

### Hypoalbuminemia in critically ill children… [^78a96d99]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Typically, hypoalbuminemia is ascribed to diminished synthesis or increased losses. Diversion of synthetic capacity to other proteins is another cause of hypoalbuminemia. Inflammatory disorders can accelerate the catabolism of albumin while simultaneously decreasing its manufacture. During critical illness, capillary permeability increases dramatically and alters albumin exchange between intravascular and extravascular compartments. An analysis of covariance indicated that children in the hypoalbuminemia group had a higher mean number of organ failures compared with those in the normal albumin level group. In the only other comparable study, Durward et al4 found a hypoalbuminemia incidence of 56. 7%.

Whatever the cause of low albumin levels, the decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure compromises the intravascular volume, placing the child at risk for inadequate blood flow to vital organs. This is especially true of capillary leak, in which the albumin escapes to the interstitial space, pulling fluid along. Thus, it would be expected that a low serum albumin level would be associated with poor outcome. The adult literature has documented hypoalbuminemia as a marker for disease severity, prolonged ventilatory support, and extended length of intensive care unit stay. In their meta-analysis, Vincent and colleagues3 found hypoalbuminemia to be a dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcome. Each 1. 0-g/dL decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, and prolonged ICU and hospital stay by 28% and 71%, respectively, and increased resource utilization by 66%.

In summary, we found that hypoalbuminemia was a significant marker of morbidity and mortality in critically ill children. Additional pediatric studies are needed to confirm this, although the adult literature is in agreement. Replacement is very likely to be beneficial in some circumstance 18 and not of value or detrimental in others. 14 The physician, as always, needs to tailor the treatment on the basis of the disease process and the serum albumin concentration.

### Phenytoin (phenytoin infatabs) [^e399b86e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Data

Human Data

Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies.

Animal Data

Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

8.6	Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia

The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity.

Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients.

### Optimizing nutritional management in children with chronic liver disease [^1cc87e30]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Malnutrition is common in infants and children with chronic liver disease (CLD) and may easily be underestimated by clinical appearance alone. The cause of malnutrition in CLD is multifactorial, although insufficient dietary intake is probably the most important factor and is correctable. Fat malabsorption occurs in cholestatic disorders, and one must also consider any accompanying fat-soluble vitamin and essential fatty acid deficiencies. The clinician should proactively evaluate, treat, and re-evaluate response to treatment of nutritional deficiencies. Because a better nutritional state is associated with better survival before and after liver transplantation, aggressive nutritional management is an important part of the care of these children.

### Management of congenital nephrotic syndrome: consensus recommendations of the ERKNet-ESPN working group [^085e5c0a]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Treatment with diuretics, RAAS inhibitors and NSAIDs should be stopped in patients with or at risk of hypovolaemia (for example owing to gastrointestinal symptoms or worsening of hypoalbuminaemia) because they increase the risk of AKI and thrombosis in these patients. Parents must be informed of the need to stop diuretics, RAAS inhibitors and NSAIDs if their child has vomiting or diarrhoea.

Box 5 Recommendations for antiproteinuric therapy

We recommend administering RAAS-blocking therapy such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs in children with CNS aged > 4 weeks.
ACE inhibition should be started with the short-acting ACE inhibitor captopril, escalating the dosage from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/kg per dose in children younger than 3 months (maximum dosage of 2 mg/kg/day). Older infants should receive 0.15–3 mg/kg per dose (maximum dosage of 6 mg/kg/day).
We do not recommend combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs owing to the potentially increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).
In the case of poor responsiveness to RAAS blockade, we suggest considering the use of prostaglandin inhibitors as an add-on treatment (indomethacin dosed incrementally from 0.5 to 3 mg/kg/day).
We recommend stopping prostaglandin inhibitors if no clinical benefit (that is, increase in serum albumin levels and/or reduction in oedema) is apparent after 2–4 weeks.
In the case of non-kidney volume losses such as vomiting and diarrhoea, routine treatment with RAAS inhibitors, prostaglandin inhibitors and diuretics must be discontinued owing to the high risk of intravascular volume depletion and AKI.

### Viral hepatitis in pregnancy [^4a9e19cc]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

1.2.3 Effects ofon pregnancy

Although HAV infection is one of the most common causes of acute viral hepatitis, it is rarely reported in pregnant women. Hence, there are limited data on the incidence and outcome of HAV infection during pregnancy. The transmission of HAV from the mother to the foetus is uncommon, although there are numerous case reports of vertical transmission, with 2 cases associated with meconium peritonitis and perforation of the distal ileum requiring surgery. Nosocomial spread is also possible from pregnant women and neonates to other infants, adults or healthcare workers.

In general, no serious outcomes have been reported to be associated with HAV infection during pregnancy. However, there are some data that supports the relationship between HAV infection and preterm labour, especially if HAV infection occurs in the second or third trimester.

There is some evidence that acute HAV infection during the third trimester of pregnancy may be associated with some gestational complications and premature labour. The gestational complications associated with HAV infection include increased premature uterine contractions, placental abruption and premature rupture of membranes. Fever and hypoalbuminemia are suggested as markers for a more aggressive course of disease, leading to complications during pregnancy. The direct correlation between the gestational age at diagnosis of HAV infection and the week of delivery suggests that HAV is responsible for the early labour.

Most infants born to mothers with HAV infection were not affected and had normal antibody and transaminase levels. However, in the rare cases in which mother‐to‐child HAV infection occurs, it can be associated with foetal ascites, meconium peritonitis, neonatal icteric HAV infection and distal ileum perforation. Overall, no mortality was documented among mothers and infants exposed to HAV infection, with full resolution of the infection.

Regarding medical management for nephrotic syndrome in children, more specifically with respect to management of hypovolemia, IPNA 2023 guidelines recommend to administer 20% or 25% albumin infusions in patients with signs of hypovolemia, including oliguria, AKI, prolonged capillary refill time, tachycardia, and abdominal discomfort. Add furosemide (1–2 mg/kg given IV) in the middle and/or at the end of the infusion if volume has been restored and urine output is insufficient.

### Fosphenytoin sodium (fosphenytoin) [^c2cde660]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.13 Renal or Hepatic Disease or Hypoalbuminemia

Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin (the active metabolite of fosphenytoin sodium injection) is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. After IV administration to patients with renal and/or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, fosphenytoin clearance to phenytoin may be increased without a similar increase in phenytoin clearance. This has the potential to increase the frequency and severity of adverse events.

5.14 Exacerbation of Porphyria

In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin (the active metabolite of fosphenytoin sodium injection) with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using fosphenytoin sodium injection in patients suffering from this disease.

5.15 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn

Fosphenytoin sodium injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin (the active metabolite of fosphenytoin sodium injection) may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma.

A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth.

5.16 Hyperglycemia

Hyperglycemia, resulting from the inhibitory effect of phenytoin (the active metabolite of fosphenytoin sodium injection) on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose concentrations in diabetic patients.

### Does ibuprofen increase neonatal hyperbilirubinemia? [^8da9b6f5]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate whether ibuprofen exposure was associated with increased hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants.

Methods

Since 2000, ibuprofen has been administered to all infants at < 30 weeks of gestation who are admitted to our unit, to prevent patent ductus arteriosus. We retrospectively compared data for 418 infants subjected to ibuprofen prophylaxis (2000–2007) and 288 infants not exposed to ibuprofen (1993–1999).

Results

The ibuprofen group had a significantly higher peak total serum bilirubin level (9.0 ± 2.5 mg/dL vs 7.3 ± 3.3 mg/dL), more need for phototherapy (398 infants [95%] vs 254 infants [87.6%]), and a longer phototherapy duration (94.3 ± 43.6 hours vs 87.2 ± 38.6 hours). Groups did not differ with respect to gestational age, birth weight, gender ratio, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency incidence, or hypoalbuminemia (< 2.5 g/dL) incidence. Hemolytic isoimmunization was diagnosed with similar incidences (no-ibuprofen group: 7 of 288 infants; ibuprofen group: 8 of 418 infants). The rates of exchange-transfusion also were similar between the groups (no-ibuprofen group: 14 infants [4.8%]; ibuprofen group: 19 infants [4.5%]).

Conclusions

Ibuprofen administration was associated with higher peak total serum bilirubin levels, and the more-pronounced hyperbilirubinemia led to longer phototherapy. The potential role of competition between ibuprofen and bilirubin in the hepatic glucuronidation pathway is discussed.

### A case of Ménétrier disease in a child [^d140f893]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Ménétrier disease is a protein-losing gastroenteropathy often misdiagnosed in the pediatric population. The disease is characterized by hypoalbuminemia secondary to protein loss through the gastrointestinal mucosa and resultant peripheral edema. It is important for emergency department practitioners to consider this diagnosis in the differential diagnosis for edema and low albumin levels in pediatric patients. We present a case report of Ménétrier disease in an edematous child and a brief review.

### Morbidity in hospitalized patients receiving human albumin: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^04ea67e2]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of albumin administration on morbidity in acutely ill hospitalized patients.

Data Source

Computer searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library; hand searches of journals and Index Medicus; inquiries with investigators and fluid product suppliers; and examination of reference lists. No language or time period restrictions were adopted.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials comparing the administration of albumin with that of crystalloid, no albumin, or lower-dose albumin.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently extracted data. The primary endpoint for the meta-analysis was morbidity, defined as the incidence of complications, including death. Trial quality was evaluated by blinding, allocation concealment, presence of morbidity as a study endpoint, and individual patient crossover.

Data Synthesis

Seventy-one trials were included in the categories of surgery or trauma, burns, hypoalbuminemia, high-risk neonates, ascites, and other indications. The 3,782 randomized patients in the included trials experienced a total of 3,287 complications, including 515 deaths and 2,772 cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, infectious, renal, respiratory, and other complications. Albumin significantly reduced overall morbidity, with a risk ratio of 0.92 (confidence interval [CI] 0.86–0.98). Control group albumin dose significantly affected the incidence of complications (p = .002). In 32 trials with no albumin administered to the control group, the risk ratio was 0.77 (CI, 0.67–0.88) compared with 0.89 (CI, 0.80–1.00) in 20 trials with control patients receiving low-dose albumin and 1.07 (CI, 0.96–1.20) in 19 trials with moderate-dose control group albumin.

Conclusions

Albumin reduces morbidity in acutely ill hospitalized patients. Concomitant administration of albumin in the control group can obscure the effects of albumin on clinical outcome in randomized trials.

### Clinical and genetic characterisation of infantile liver failure syndrome type 1, due to recessive mutations in LARS [^11e91154]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Recessive LARS mutations were recently reported to cause a novel syndrome, infantile liver failure syndrome type 1 (ILFS1), in six Irish Travellers. We have since identified four additional patients, including one of Ashkenazi origin, representing the largest ILFS1 cohort to date. Our study aims to define the ILFS1 clinical phenotype to help guide diagnosis and patient management.

Methods

We clinically evaluated and reviewed the medical records of ten ILFS1 patients. Clinical features, histopathology and natural histories were compared and patient management strategies reviewed.

Results

Early failure to thrive, recurrent liver dysfunction, anemia, hypoalbuminemia and seizures were present in all patients. Most patients (90%) had developmental delay. Encephalopathic episodes triggered by febrile illness have occurred in 80% and were fatal in two children. Two patients are currently > 28 years old and clinically well. Leucine supplementation had no appreciable impact on patient well-being. However, we suggest that the traditional management of reducing/stopping protein intake in patients with metabolic hepatopathies may not be appropriate for ILFS1. We currently recommend ensuring sufficient natural protein intake when unwell.

Conclusions

We report the first non-Irish ILFS1 patient, suggesting ILFS1 may be more extensive than anticipated. Low birth weight, early failure to thrive, anemia and hypoalbuminemia are amongst the first presenting features, with liver dysfunction before age 1. Episodic hepatic dysfunction is typically triggered by febrile illness, and becomes less severe with increasing age. While difficult to anticipate, two patients are currently > 28 years old, suggesting that survival beyond childhood may be associated with a favourable long-term prognosis.

### Emergency release uncross-matched packed red blood cells for immediate double volume exchange transfusion in neonates with intermediate to advanced acute bilirubin encephalopathy: timely but insufficient? [^4e63768a]. Journal of Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Given the urgency of double volume exchange transfusion (ExT) in an infant with intermediate to advanced stages of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE), it has been suggested that emergency release uncross-matched packed red blood cells (ER-PRBC) be used. The efficacy of an ExT in removing bilirubin from the brain, however, is a direct function of the mass of albumin exchanged. The very low albumin content of ER-PRBC may fail to be neuroprotective. Predicted changes in total serum bilirubin (TSB), serum albumin, the bilirubin/albumin (B/A) ratio, plasma volume (PV), and bilirubin equilibration from the extravascular space during ER-PRBC ExT are described. ExT using ER-PRBC is efficacious in lowering the TSB. However, this result is falsely reassuring as significant concurrent serum albumin loss, resultant hypoalbuminemia, contraction of PV, limited bilirubin clearance from the extravascular space, and sustained B/A ratio elevations above recommended ExT treatment thresholds suggest that bilirubin neurotoxicity will continue.

5.13 Renal or Hepatic Disease or Hypoalbuminemia

Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin (the active metabolite of fosphenytoin sodium) is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. After intravenous administration to patients with renal and/or hepatic disease or in those with hypoalbuminemia, fosphenytoin clearance to phenytoin may be increased without a similar increase in phenytoin clearance. This has the potential to increase the frequency and severity of adverse events.

5.14 Exacerbation of Porphyria

In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin (the active metabolite of fosphenytoin sodium) with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using fosphenytoin sodium in patients suffering from this disease.

5.15 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn

Fosphenytoin sodium may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin (the active metabolite of fosphenytoin sodium) may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### A case of protein-losing enteropathy caused by intestinal lymphangiectasia in a preterm infant [^2c874236]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Intestinal lymphangiectasia is characterized by obstruction of lymph drainage from the small intestine and lacteal dilation that distorts the villus architecture. Lymphatic vessel obstruction and elevated intestinal lymphatic pressure in turn cause lymphatic leakage into the intestinal lumen, thus resulting in malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy. Intestinal lymphangiectasia can be congenital or secondary to a disease that blocks intestinal lymph drainage. We describe the first case of intestinal lymphangiectasia in a premature infant. The infant presented with peripheral edema and low serum albumin; high fecal concentration of alpha(1)-antitrypsin documented intestinal protein loss. Endoscopy showed white opaque spots on the duodenal mucosa, which indicates dilated lacteal vessels. Histology confirmed dilated lacteals and also showed villus blunting. A formula containing a high concentration of medium chain triglycerides resulted in a rapid clinical improvement and normalization of biochemical variables. These features should alert neonatologists to the possibility of intestinal lymphangiectasia in newborns with hypoalbuminemia and peripheral edema. The intestinal tract should be examined for enteric protein losses if other causes (ie, malnutrition and protein loss from other sites) are excluded. The diagnosis rests on jejunal biopsy demonstrating dilated lymphatic lacteal vessels.

### Association of serum albumin with apnea in infants with bronchiolitis: a secondary analysis of data from the MARC-35 study [^06803bfc]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is serum albumin level associated with the risk of apnea in infants with bronchiolitis?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a cohort of 1016 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, low serum albumin was statistically significantly associated with a higher risk of apnea during the hospitalization. This association was independent of known apnea risk factors (younger age, premature birth, and weight-for-age z score).

Meaning

Albumin levels may have a role in identifying apnea in bronchiolitis.

Data

Human Data

Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies.

Animal Data

Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for DILANTIN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from DILANTIN or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

8.6	Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia

The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity.

Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients.

### ABM clinical protocol # 24: allergic proctocolitis in the exclusively breastfed infant [^8fdd7c28]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergic proctocolitis in exclusively breastfed infants — clinical presentation indicates that the most common symptoms associated with food-induced allergic disorders are cutaneous reactions (eczema) and gastrointestinal symptoms, with the most common gastrointestinal symptom being the development of bloody stools. Onset usually occurs between 2 and 6 weeks of age, although some have reported symptoms beginning as early as the first day of life. Severe manifestations of food allergy are extremely rare. Dietary proteins excreted in the mother's milk are responsible for the majority of cases and induce an inflammatory response of the rectum and distal sigmoid colon referred to as allergic proctocolitis, and affected breastfed infants are generally well appearing aside from blood in the stool. Blood loss is typically modest but can occasionally produce anemia and/or hypoalbuminemia, very rare cases may lead to failure to thrive, and systemic manifestations such as emesis, dramatic diarrhea, or abdominal distention are rare and may suggest other allergic gastrointestinal disorders. Additional laboratory studies may be considered but are often unnecessary.

Native nephrectomy for pediatric candidates — indications and rationale are described as follows: High urine output is relatively common among children with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and these high native-kidney urine volumes may persist following transplantation making fluid management challenging. Infants and very young children may have difficulty maintaining adequate perfusion of an adult donor kidney, and polyuria increases the risk of volume depletion, so some have advocated unilateral or bilateral native nephrectomy prior to or at the time of transplant to maintain adequate volume status and improve graft perfusion. Heavy proteinuria has also been proposed as an indication due to increased risk of graft thrombosis from urinary loss of anti-thrombotic factors, and in nephrotic syndrome with persistent hypoalbuminemia, pre-transplant nephrectomy may allow recovery of normal levels of anticoagulation factors before transplant.

In spite of limited information about the efficacy in pediatric subjects, an intravenous infusion of 2. 5 to. this may result in relative anemia. This condition should be controlled by the supplemental administration of compatible red blood cells or compatible whole blood. Hypoalbuminemia In adults, intravenous infusion of 50 to 75 g of ALBUMIN 5% may be used. Hypoalbuminemia is usually accompanied by a hidden extravascular albumin deficiency of equal. In the U. S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

### Nutrient deficiencies in the premature infant [^ff61bf8e]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Premature infants are a population prone to nutrient deficiencies. Because the early diet of these infants is entirely amenable to intervention, understanding the pathophysiology behind these deficiencies is important for both the neonatologists who care for them acutely and for pediatricians who are responsible for their care through childhood. This article reviews the normal accretion of nutrients in the fetus, discusses specific nutrient deficiencies that are exacerbated in the postnatal period, and identifies key areas for future research.

Data

Human Data

Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies.

Animal Data

Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for DILANTIN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from DILANTIN or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia

The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity.

Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients.-
