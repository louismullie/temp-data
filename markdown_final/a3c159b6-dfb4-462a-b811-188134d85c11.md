## Question

do you need to decrease dose of beta blockers in heart failure exacerbation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether beta-blocker therapy should be reduced or discontinued during a heart failure exacerbation, and if so, under what circumstances and how to manage it safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of decompensation. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about continuation versus interruption of beta-blockers in acute decompensated heart failure. Next, I will review the evidence on outcomes with dose reduction or withdrawal. After that, I need to check the risks of abrupt discontinuation and the hemodynamic rationale for temporary changes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and confirm how to reinitiate therapy once stabilized, anchoring this to high-quality guidelines and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. A heart failure exacerbation spans a spectrum from mild congestion with preserved perfusion to cardiogenic shock requiring inotropes, and the management of beta-blockers differs accordingly. I need to ensure I'm not conflating initiation with continuation, because guidelines advise against starting a beta-blocker in decompensated patients, but they do not recommend routine withdrawal of chronic beta-blocker therapy solely due to decompensation [^113roJAv] [^1127K96k].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some older teaching suggested stopping beta-blockers in any acute decompensation, but current ACC/AHA/HFSA guidance recommends continuing evidence-based beta-blockers during hospitalization for HFrEF unless there is hemodynamic instability or the need for inotropes, and to avoid abrupt withdrawal. The ESC similarly supports continuation in stable inpatients and emphasizes careful reassessment rather than routine dose reduction [^113roJAv].

> I will now examine the evidence on dose changes and outcomes. In COMET, patients who had their beta-blocker dose reduced or withdrawn after a heart failure hospitalization had significantly higher 1- and 2-year mortality than those maintained on the same dose, even after adjustment, suggesting harm from dose reduction or discontinuation. Similarly, observational data from ESCAPE show that discontinuation or major dose reduction during hospitalization was associated with worse outcomes, whereas consistent beta-blocker use was linked to lower 6-month rehospitalization or death, reinforcing the risk of withdrawing therapy during decompensation [^115UZBFh] [^115vZ4cx].

> But wait, what about randomized data specifically in acute decompensation? The B-CONVINCED trial compared continuation versus interruption of beta-blockers during acute decompensated heart failure and found noninferior short-term clinical improvement with continuation, and importantly, a higher rate of chronic beta-blocker prescription at 3 months in the continuation arm, which portends better long-term outcomes. This supports avoiding routine interruption when feasible [^113SFknR].

> I need to check the hemodynamic rationale and the risks of abrupt withdrawal. Abrupt cessation of chronic beta-blockade can precipitate rebound sympathetic activation, worsening ischemia, tachyarrhythmias, and clinical deterioration; FDA labeling for multiple beta-blockers warns against abrupt discontinuation, particularly in patients with coronary disease, and heart failure guidelines echo this caution, advising that if any dose change is necessary, it should be temporary and reinstated promptly after stabilization [^11411nzv] [^1112zCFB] [^113roJAv].

> Now, let me consider when temporary dose reduction or holding is appropriate. If the patient is in cardiogenic shock, requires intravenous inotropes, or has evidence of hypoperfusion, then it is reasonable to hold or reduce the beta-blocker dose temporarily while stabilizing hemodynamics; phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone may be preferred over beta-agonists like dobutamine in the setting of concurrent beta-blockade because their mechanism is downstream of beta-receptors, and once stabilized, the beta-blocker should be reintroduced to prior or maximally tolerated doses to restore long-term benefit [^111dZCmj] [^112gjPAe].

> Hold on, I should verify how to manage less severe exacerbations without shock or inotrope dependence. In patients with pulmonary edema or significant congestion but preserved perfusion, the preferred approach is to intensify diuretics, treat precipitating factors, and continue the beta-blocker at the same dose rather than reduce it; early worsening during up-titration is typically responsive to diuretic intensification, and labels for carvedilol and metoprolol explicitly advise increasing diuretics and delaying dose advancement rather than automatically lowering the beta-blocker dose [^116LCVT2] [^1162S18P] [^114KeRfL].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, assess hemodynamics and perfusion. If there is shock or inotrope requirement, temporarily hold or reduce the beta-blocker and stabilize with guideline-directed acute therapy, planning reinitiation as soon as feasible. Second, if there is congestion without shock, continue the beta-blocker, escalate diuretics, and address triggers. Third, avoid abrupt withdrawal in all cases; if a dose change is necessary, taper gradually and plan early reinstitution. Finally, after stabilization, resume or up-titrate to target or maximally tolerated doses using the "start low, go slow" strategy with close monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, weight, and symptoms, ideally every 1–2 weeks as tolerated [^113roJAv] [^116UWrdx] [^115ASFdQ].

> I should double-check the long-term implications of dose trajectory. Observational analyses show that dose de-escalation of beta-blockers is associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and more heart failure hospitalizations compared with maintaining target dosing, underscoring the importance of returning to effective doses after stabilization; this aligns with the principle that chronic beta-blockade reduces mortality and hospitalizations in HFrEF and that subtherapeutic dosing forfeits benefit [^111p1KSv] [^113roJAv].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: do not routinely reduce or discontinue beta-blockers during a heart failure exacerbation unless there is hemodynamic instability or a need for inotropes. When such instability is present, temporary dose reduction or holding is acceptable, but abrupt withdrawal should be avoided, and therapy should be resumed and up-titrated promptly after stabilization to capture the proven mortality and hospitalization benefits of guideline-directed beta-blocker therapy [^113roJAv] [^115UZBFh] [^113SFknR].

In heart failure exacerbation, **do not routinely reduce beta-blocker dose** unless there is cardiogenic shock, severe bradycardia, or high-grade AV block [^1127K96k] [^111dZCmj] [^11411nzv] [^1145GESD]. Continue the beta-blocker and treat the exacerbation with diuretics and vasodilators; **only consider temporary dose reduction or holding** if there is persistent hypotension, worsening renal function, or significant bradycardia despite optimal therapy [^1127K96k] [^113rg2vf] [^1152RZQW] [^114KeRfL]. Avoid abrupt withdrawal because of rebound sympathetic activation and increased risk of death or hospitalization [^115UZBFh] [^1157xMnw]. Once stabilized, promptly resume and titrate to the prior or maximally tolerated dose to preserve long-term benefits [^111dZCmj] [^114p8N7W].

## Clinical evidence supporting continuation of beta-blockers

Multiple studies and guidelines support **continuing beta-blockers during HF exacerbations**:

- **COMET trial**: In patients hospitalized for HF, maintaining beta-blocker therapy was associated with significantly lower mortality compared to dose reduction or withdrawal (19.1% vs 37.4% at one year) [^115UZBFh].

- **B-CONVINCED trial**: Continuation of beta-blockers during acute decompensation did not delay clinical improvement and was associated with higher rates of chronic beta-blocker prescription at three months, indicating better long-term adherence and outcomes [^113SFknR].

- **ESC guidelines**: Recommend initiating beta-blockers in stable HFrEF patients and continuing them during exacerbations unless contraindicated, as they reduce hospitalizations and mortality [^115Emj6D].

---

## Risks associated with dose reduction or withdrawal

Reducing or withdrawing beta-blockers during exacerbations can lead to **rebound sympathetic activation**, worsening HF symptoms, and increased risk of hospitalization and mortality [^115vZ4cx]. Abrupt withdrawal can precipitate **angina, myocardial infarction, or life-threatening arrhythmias**, especially in patients with coronary artery disease [^11411nzv].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting dose adjustment

While continuation is generally recommended, **certain scenarios may necessitate temporary dose adjustment**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| Cardiogenic shock or severe hypotension (SBP < 85 mmHg) | Temporarily hold or reduce dose |
| Severe bradycardia (HR < 50 bpm) or high-grade AV block | Temporarily hold or reduce dose |
| Persistent worsening renal function despite optimal therapy | Consider temporary dose reduction |
| Significant fluid overload or pulmonary edema | Temporarily hold or reduce dose |

---

Once stabilized, promptly resume and titrate to the prior or maximally tolerated dose to preserve long-term benefits [^1162C7KQ].

---

## Clinical scenarios where dose reduction is not recommended

Routine dose reduction is **not recommended** in the following scenarios:

- **Mild to moderate exacerbations**: Continue beta-blockers and treat exacerbation with diuretics and vasodilators [^1127K96k].

- **Stable chronic HF with minor symptoms**: Continue beta-blockers to prevent disease progression and reduce mortality [^113roJAv].

- **Patients with coronary artery disease**: Abrupt withdrawal increases risk of ischemic events; continuation is preferred unless contraindicated [^1112zCFB].

---

## Practical clinical approach

A practical approach is to **continue beta-blockers during exacerbations** unless contraindicated. Treat the exacerbation with diuretics and vasodilators, and monitor closely for hypotension, bradycardia, or worsening renal function. Temporarily hold or reduce the dose only if there is persistent hypotension, severe bradycardia, or worsening renal function despite optimal therapy. Promptly resume and titrate to the prior or maximally tolerated dose once stabilized [^1162C7KQ].

---

## Conclusion

Beta-blockers should **generally be continued during heart failure exacerbations** unless there is a compelling contraindication. Temporary dose adjustment may be necessary in specific scenarios, but abrupt withdrawal should be avoided. Once stabilized, promptly resume and titrate to the prior or maximally tolerated dose to maintain long-term benefits [^113roJAv].

The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Medium credibility.

Heart failure — β-blockers provide substantial benefits, with the magnitude of this effect greater than that found in ACEI (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) trials, with a 34% to 35% reduction in mortality, a 33% to 35% reduction in the heart failure hospitalization rate, and an 18% to 20% reduction in all-cause hospitalizations. These beneficial effects have been observed in patients with more advanced heart failure and become evident relatively early, 1 to 2 months after initiation of therapy, as soon as minimal effective doses of the β-blockers are reached. Therefore, it is mandatory that β-blocker therapy be attempted even in patients with more advanced heart failure, and treatment should always be initiated at the lowest possible dose, with very slow and careful dose increases. Only the agents shown to be clearly beneficial for survival in placebo-controlled trials should be administered — these include bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and, in the elderly, nebivolol. β-blocker therapy may worsen the symptoms and signs of congestion in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF); therefore, starting β-blocker therapy in these patients is contraindicated. However, if acute decompensation develops in patients already on long-term β-blocker treatment, the permanent reduction or withdrawal of β-blocker therapy may be an independent predictor of poor outcome, and the β-blocker dose should, therefore, be reduced or withdrawn only temporarily, if ever, with treatment restarted at the previous maintenance doses as soon as the patient's condition stabilizes.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit and agent selection is summarized as follows: Three beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic heart failure (HF): bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol (succinate), and carvedilol; positive findings with these 3 agents should not be considered a class effect, and patients who have Stage C HF should be treated with 1 of these 3 beta-blockers. In one head-to-head trial, carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) versus immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg twice daily) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality, and there have been no trials to explore whether the survival benefits of carvedilol are greater than those of sustained-release metoprolol when both are used at the target doses.

### Tolerability of β-blocker initiation and titration in the metoprolol CR / XL randomized intervention trial in congestive heart failure (MERIT-HF) [^1143iKBD]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

beta-Blockade improves survival when administered over a long period of time to patients with heart failure. However, the time course of any possible deterioration during the titration phase has not been reported.

Methods and Results

We looked at evidence of clinical deterioration in the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) by analyzing events and symptoms during the first 90 days. During titration, the Kaplan-Meier curves for the combined end point of all-cause mortality/all-cause hospitalization were similar in all patients randomized, with no significant difference in favor of placebo at any visit or in any of the analyzed subgroups (New York Heart Association class II, III/IV, or III/IV with ejection fraction < 0.25, heart rate less-than-or-equal 76 bpm, and systolic blood pressure less-than-or-equal 120 mm Hg). The curves started to diverge in favor of beta-blockade after 60 days. Low heart rate was the main factor that limited titration. In New York Heart Association class III/IV, 5.9% of the patients receiving placebo discontinued study medicine during the first 90 days compared with 8.1% of those receiving metoprolol CR/XL (P = 0.037 unadjusted, P = NS adjusted); corresponding figures in those with New York Heart Association class III/IV and ejection fraction < 0.25 were 7.1% and 8.0% (P = NS). From day 90 until the end of the study, more patients in the placebo group discontinued study medicine in all subgroups. There was no change in diuretic or ACE inhibitor dosing with beta-blocker titration. Most patients reported no change in symptoms of breathlessness or fatigue during the titration phase.

Conclusions

When carefully titrated, metoprolol CR/XL can be given safely to the overwhelming majority of patients with stable mild to moderate heart failure, with minimal side effects or deterioration.

### Optimizing the use of β-blockers in the effective treatment and management of heart failure: a case study approach [^111fzRR2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Today, heart failure is an increasing concern in the United States. Its prognoses are poor and its treatment is a complicated endeavor, because heart failure is not a single disease state. Rather, it is a syndrome with a cyclic pathophysiology composed of multiple mechanisms. Effective case management of heart failure must address each of the many changes involved in this syndrome, and therapy must be individualized, especially because patients with heart failure often require regimens of five or more drugs. In special populations, such as the elderly and/or patients with concomitant diseases requiring added medication, polypharmacy becomes an important issue. Maintaining consistent compliance with the treatment regimen and patient education regarding symptoms of fluid retention can be critical. Currently, beta-blockers, in addition to standard therapy, are recommended as first-line treatment in mild-to-moderate heart failure. The three cases presented in this article illustrate some common scenarios encountered and clinical decisions made when beta-blockers are used in the management of heart failure.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic reduction of LVEF but no symptoms — pharmacologic prevention: Long-term treatment with an ACEI has been shown to delay the onset of HF symptoms and decrease the risk of death and hospitalization for HF in asymptomatic patients with reduced LVEF, whether due to a remote ischemic injury or to a nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Although there are no studies that specifically addressed use of ARBs in asymptomatic patients with reduced LVEF, ARBs may be an appropriate alternative, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate an ACEI. Furthermore, although controlled clinical trials are lacking, the use of beta-blockers in patients with a low EF and no symptoms (especially those with coronary artery disease) is also recommended, and the same beta-blockers should be used that were employed in the large HF trials.

### Achieving a maximally tolerated β-blocker dose in heart failure patients: is there room for Improvement? [^113K7KqK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although initially thought to be harmful in HF, beta-adrenergic blockers (β-blockers) have consistently been shown to reduce mortality and HF hospitalization in chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction. Proposed mechanisms include neurohormonal blockade and heart rate reduction. A new therapeutic agent now exists to target further heart rate lowering in patients who have been stable on a "maximally tolerated β-blocker dose", but this definition and how to achieve it are incompletely understood. In this review, the authors summarize published reports on the mechanisms by which β-blockers improve clinical outcomes. The authors describe differences in doses achieved in landmark clinical trials and those observed in routine clinical practice. They further discuss reasons for intolerance and the evidence behind using β-blocker dose and heart rate as therapeutic targets. Finally, the authors offer recommendations for clinicians actively initiating and up-titrating β-blockers that may aid in achieving maximally tolerated doses.

### Β-blockers… [^111B9aPo]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Thus, even effective standard "triple" therapy does not safeguard the patient against further catastrophic deterioration of cardiac performance. Clinical trials have shown that the use of β-blockers in addition to standard therapy improves left ventricular function, reduces hospitalizations, and — in the cases of bisoprolol, long-acting metoprolol, and carvedilol — improves survival in patients with chronic heart failure. In addition, carvedilol has been found to significantly slow disease progression even in mildly symptomatic patients. Though achieving β-blockade in patients with heart failure requires extra effort by the clinician, the cost is small compared with the consequence of postponing adrenergic intervention.

the pathophysiological characteristics of heart failure), and thereby both improve symptoms and significantly reduce mortality. 29 Unfortunately, rates of hospitalization and death remain high among patients with heart failure treated with an ACE inhibitor in addition to diuretics and digoxin, 30 indicating that even the most robust form of standard therapy does not offer optimal protection against progressive cardiac dysfunction. The following section reviews clinical evidence supporting the notion that inhibiting chronic adrenergic activation via β-blockade attenuates disease progression and reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. During an average treatment period of 6. 5 months, addition of carvedilol to the standard regimen resulted in a 48% reduction in clinical progression, defined as death due to heart failure, hospitalization for heart failure, or the need for a sustained increase in heart failure medications. Based on these results, CIBIS-II was designed to further evaluate this evidence; CIBIS-II data indicate that bisoprolol both reduces morbidity and significantly improves survival when added to standard therapy. 2 Among 2647 patients with moderate to severe symptoms of heart failure, bisoprolol produced a 34. The Beta-blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial protocol of moderate to severe heart failure was recently completed, and preliminary results indicate an approximate 10% reduction in all-cause mortality with bucindolol.

### Adverse effects of β-blocker therapy for patients with heart failure… [^113Raxrx]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

The overall all-cause withdrawal rate was 16. 0% in the β-blocker group and
18. 0% in the placebo group. β-Blocker therapy was associated with a significant 11% relative reduction in all-cause withdrawal of study medication, and the associated annual absolute risk reduction for withdrawal was 14 per 1000 patients. For worsening HF, β-blocker therapy was also associated with a significant 17% RR reduction and an absolute risk reduction of 52 per 1000 patients per year, equivalent to 19 patients treated for 1 year to avoid 1 additional case of worsening HF. Withdrawal of therapy owing to HF deterioration was assessed in 5 trials1, 2, 9, 16, 17 including 6309 patients. In those trials, 3. 3% in the β-blocker group and
4. 9% in the placebo group were withdrawn from therapy due to HF deterioration. β-Blocker therapy was associated with a significant RR reduction and a nonsignificant absolute annual risk reduction of withdrawal owing to HF deterioration. The principal finding of our quantitative overview is that despite concerns about adverse effects, fewer patients with HF assigned to receive β-blockers were withdrawn from therapy than were those assigned to receive placebo. This difference was primarily owing to a reduction of worsening HF associated with β-blocker therapy. β-Blockers were associated with increased risks of hypotension, dizziness, and bradycardia, although most patients did not experience these adverse effects. In conclusion, β-blocker therapy in patients with HF was well tolerated and associated with fewer overall withdrawals and less HF deterioration than placebo. β-Blocker therapy was associated with small absolute increased risks of hypotension, dizziness, and bradycardia but not of fatigue.

Our findings should alleviate concerns of physicians who are reluctant to prescribe β-blockers because of their cardiovascular adverse effects and support the implementation of this lifesaving therapy to appropriate candidates with HF.

### Dose of metoprolol CR / XL and clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure: analysis of the experience in metoprolol CR / XL randomized intervention trial in chronic heart failure (MERIT-HF) [^116za918]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

We performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis in the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Chronic Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) with the aim of reporting on the heart rate (HR) response during the titration phase and clinical outcomes from the three-month follow-up visit to end of study in two dosage subgroups: one that had reached more than 100 mg of metoprolol CR/XL once daily (high-dose group; n = 1,202; mean 192 mg) and one that had reached 100 mg or less (low-dose group; n = 412; mean 76 mg).

Background

Clinicians have questioned whether patients need to reach the target beta-blocker dose to receive benefit. METHODS; Outcome (Cox-adjusted) was compared with all placebo patients with dose available at the three-month visit (n = 1,845).

Results

Data indicated somewhat higher risk in the low-dose group compared with the high-dose group. Heart rate was reduced to a similar degree in the two dose groups, indicating higher sensitivity for beta-blockade in the low-dose group. The reduction in total mortality with metoprolol CR/XL compared with placebo was similar: 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 55) in high-dose group (p = 0.0022) and also 38% (95% CI, 11 to 57) in the low-dose group (p = 0.010).

Conclusions

Risk reduction was similar in the high- and low-dose subgroups, which, at least partly, may be the result of similar beta-blockade as judged from the HR response. The results support the idea of an individualized dose-titration regimen, which is guided by patient tolerability and the HR response. Further research is needed to shed light on why some patients respond with a marked HR reduction and reduced mortality risk on a relatively small dose of a beta-blocker.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^117KSyAz]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Unlike renin–angiotensin system blockers and MRAs, the early benefit of beta‐blockers is less clear. After initiation, beta‐blockers may cause worsening of heart failure. Indeed, careful scrutiny of the Kaplan–Meier curves in the placebo‐controlled trials and comparison of the first 6 months of treatment with either enalapril or bisoprolol in CIBIS III demonstrates an early excess of heart failure hospitalizations following initiation of a beta‐blocker, although there is no indication of an increase in risk of death. Indeed, it is clear that the risk of death is reduced relatively early after starting treatment with a beta‐blocker, for example in combined analysis of the trials in the US carvedilol programme.

Understanding the importance of dose with sacubitril/valsartan is more difficult because of the design of the PARADIGM‐HF trial, as mentioned above. In this trial, outcomes were compared in patients having either their dose of either sacubitril/valsartan (42% of randomized participants) or enalapril (43%) reduced compared to those who remained on the starting (target) doses or each treatment. The treatment benefit of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril following a dose reduction was similar (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70–0.93, p < 0.001) to that seen in patients who did not have any dose reduction (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71–0.88, p < 0.001) and consistent whether the reduction was to 50%–100% of target or to < 50% of target dose.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) initiation strategy and phenotype considerations indicate that a combination of 4 classes can be started at the same time at low doses with more than one titration at a time, while sequencing may be necessary in other cases; the Writing Committee affirms directly initiating ARNI whenever possible to avoid delays; initiation and titration may require considering patient phenotype, with ARNI often better tolerated when the patient is still congested ("wet") and beta-blockers better tolerated when the patient is less congested ("dry") with an adequate resting heart rate; beta-blockers should not be newly initiated in decompensated signs or symptoms but can be continued in decompensated HF, and only evidence-based beta-blockers should be used in HFrEF.

### Propranolol hydrochloride (inderal XL) [^115J1yZt]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiac Ischemia after Abrupt Discontinuation

Following abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers, exacerbations of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction have occurred.

When discontinuing chronically administered INDERAL XL, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dose over a period of 1–2 weeks and monitor the patients. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, promptly resume therapy, at least temporarily and take other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without physician's advice.

Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abrupt discontinuation of INDERAL XL therapy even in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2 Cardiac Failure

Beta-blockers, like INDERAL XL, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. If signs or symptoms of heart failure develop, treat the patient according to recommended guidelines. It may be necessary to lower the dose of INDERAL XL or to discontinue it.

5.3 Maintain During Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy, including INDERAL XL, should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

5.4 Hypoglycemia

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

5.5 Thyrotoxicosis

INDERAL XL may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade, which may precipitate a thyroid storm.

5.6 Bradycardia

Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of INDERAL XL. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders (including Wolff-Parkinson-White) may be at increased risk. The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil and diltiazem), digoxin or clonidine increases the risk of significant bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving INDERAL XL. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop INDERAL XL.

### Nadolol and bendroflumethiazide [^115sG6uK]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in patients with congestive heart failure, and its inhibition by beta-blockade may precipitate more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, they can be used with caution in patients with a history of failure who are well compensated, usually with digitalis and diuretics. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents do not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle.

IN PATIENTS WITHOUT A HISTORY OF HEART FAILURE, continued use of beta-blockers can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. Therefore, at the first sign or symptom of heart failure, the patient should be digitalized and/ or treated with diuretics, and the response observed closely, or nadolol should be discontinued (gradually, if possible).

Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal

Hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered nadolol, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of one to two weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, nadolol administration should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue nadolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension.

Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema)

PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD IN GENERAL NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Nadolol should be administered with caution since it may block bronchodilation produced by endogenous or exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2receptors.

Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

### Heart failure drug treatment [^1113JZUw]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure is the most common cardiovascular reason for hospital admission for people older than 60 years of age. Few areas in medicine have progressed as remarkably as heart failure treatment over the past three decades. However, progress has been consistent only for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In acutely decompensated heart failure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, none of the treatments tested to date have been definitively proven to improve survival. Delaying or preventing heart failure has become increasingly important in patients who are prone to heart failure. The prevention of worsening chronic heart failure and hospitalisations for acute decompensation is also of great importance. The objective of this Series paper is to provide a concise and practical summary of the available drug treatments for heart failure. We support the implementation of the international guidelines. We offer views on the basis of our personal experience in research areas that have insufficient evidence. The best possible evidence-based drug treatment (including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and β blockers) is useful only when optimally implemented. However, implementation might be challenging. We believe that disease management programmes can be helpful in providing a multidisciplinary, holistic approach to the delivery of optimal medical care.

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^115hsB3b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy — recommendations and risk factors: Preoperative beta-blocker therapy should be considered in the context of a full evaluation of each patient's clinical and surgical risk, including identification of active cardiac conditions that require intensive management and may result in delay or cancellation of surgery unless the surgery is emergent. Clinical risk factors used in current recommendations are unchanged from the prior document and include history of ischemic heart disease, history of compensated or prior heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal insufficiency defined as a preoperative serum creatinine of more than 2 mg/dL. The surgery-specific cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery remains relevant, but limited data are available to guide beta-blocker use with newer techniques (e.g., percutaneous or endovascular vascular procedures) that may be associated with lower short-term risk. The prior document outlined conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of beta blockers in reducing perioperative cardiac events, and the best approach to medically reduce cardiovascular complications during noncardiac surgery was still unknown. The authors advocated for randomized controlled trials because there may be some harm associated with beta-blocker therapy in low-risk patients, and they noted key literature gaps: most trials were inadequately powered; few randomized trials of medical therapy to prevent perioperative major adverse cardiac events had been performed; few trials examined perioperative beta-blocker therapy, particularly in high-risk patients; studies to determine the role of beta blockers in intermediate- and low-risk populations and the optimal type, dose, timing, duration, and titration were lacking; and no studies addressed care-delivery mechanisms for how, when, and by whom therapy should be prescribed and monitored.

### Is bisoprolol underutilized in U.S. Heart Failure patients? [^112c81EF]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, two randomized clinical trials have provided intriguing data regarding the effects of metoprolol and bisoprolol in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who did not have heart failure. BLOCK-COPD (Beta-Blockers for the Prevention of Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)randomized 532 patients without class I indications for β-blockers to either placebo or metoprolol succinate. BICS (Bisoprolol in COPD Study) randomized 519 patients to placebo or bisoprolol. The two trials share many similarities: they included patients with at least moderate airflow limitation and at least 1 (2 in the case of BICS) COPD exacerbation in the year preceding enrollment. The treatment drugs also were titrated up to equivalent maximal doses. BICS aimed for a maximum of 5 mg bisoprolol (half of the 10 mg maximum dose in the CIBIS-II [Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II] trial that proved a mortality benefit in patients with HFrEF). Similarly, BLOCK-COPD set a goal of 100 mg of metoprolol (again, half the 200 mg used in MERIT-HF [Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure]). Both trials were undertaken with the hope that a β-blocker would decrease the number of COPD exacerbations, based on associations reported in observational studies. Compared with placebo, metoprolol was actually associated with a significantly increased rate of COPD exacerbations that led to hospitalization, or hospitalization plus intubation (rate ratio: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.10–2.42). In BICS, bisoprolol was not associated with any such increase. Both trials reported a significant increase in patient's subjective feelings of dyspnea in the treatment group.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114o8xWv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

### Effects on outcomes of heart rate reduction by ivabradine in patients with congestive heart failure: is there an influence of β-blocker dose? findings from the SHIFT (systolic heart failure treatment with the I_f inhibitor ivabradine trial) study [^114BNLfr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study used the SHIFT (Systolic Heart failure treatment with the I(f) inhibitor ivabradine Trial) database to assess the impact of background beta-blocker dose on response to ivabradine.

Background

In systolic heart failure, reduction in relatively high heart rates improves clinical outcomes when achieved with beta-blockers and even more so when the sinus node inhibitor ivabradine also is added.

Methods

Among patients with systolic heart failure, sinus rhythm, and heart rate ≥ 70 beats/min on recommended background therapy, maximally tolerated beta-blocker doses were subgrouped as no beta-blocker, < 25%, 25% to < 50%, 50% to < 100%, and 100% of European Society of Cardiology–suggested target doses. The impact of ivabradine on cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (primary endpoint) was analyzed in each subgroup as time-to-first event using Cox models adjusted for heart rate. The statistical models assessed heterogeneity and trend of the treatment effect across subgroups, and an additional analysis was made adjusting for the interaction of randomized treatment with baseline heart rate.

Results

The primary endpoint and heart failure hospitalizations were significantly reduced by ivabradine in all subgroups with < 50% of target beta-blocker dose, including no beta-blocker (p = 0.012). Despite an apparent trend to reduction in treatment-effect magnitude with increasing beta-blocker dose, no variation in treatment effect was seen in general heterogeneity interaction tests (p = 0.35). Across beta-blocker subgroups, treatment effect was borderline nonsignificant only for the primary endpoint (p = 0.056), and significance was further lost after adjusting for interaction between baseline heart rate and ivabradine effect (p = 0.14).

Conclusions

The magnitude of heart rate reduction by beta-blocker plus ivabradine, rather than background beta-blocker dose, primarily determines subsequent effect on outcomes.

Focus on heart failure after first appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy — In patients with heart failure who have not previously had a life-threatening arrhythmia, the first event identifies them as being at higher risk than before for both sudden death and death due to heart failure, with the majority of patients surviving less than 2 years, and they should trigger reevaluation of treatable causes of heart failure and of the medical regimen. Particular care should be paid to the titration of beta-adrenergic blockers, because up titration can lead to heart failure exacerbation and must be attempted in small dose increments, many patients with symptomatic heart failure cannot tolerate "target doses" of beta-adrenergic blockers, and it is crucial that the management team evaluate the heart failure profile, review the medical regimen, and plan for ongoing care.

### Acebutolol hydrochloride [^113JYp7c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by β-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. Although β-blockers should be avoided in overt cardiac failure, acebutolol can be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure who are controlled with digitalis and/or diuretics. Both digitalis and acebutolol impair AV conduction. If cardiac failure persists, therapy with acebutolol should be withdrawn.

In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure

In patients with aortic or mitral valve disease or compromised left ventricular function, continued depression of the myocardium with β-blocking agents over a period of time may lead to cardiac failure. At the first signs of failure, patients should be digitalized and/or be given a diuretic and the response observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate digitalization and/or diuretic, acebutolol therapy should be withdrawn.

Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain β-blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease, exacerbation of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction and death have been reported. Therefore, such patients should be cautioned against interruption of therapy without a physician's advice. Even in the absence of overt ischemic heart disease, when discontinuation of acebutolol is planned, the patient should be carefully observed, and should be advised to limit physical activity to a minimum while acebutolol is gradually withdrawn over a period of about two weeks. (If therapy with an alternative β-blocker is desired, the patient may be transferred directly to comparable doses of another agent without interruption of β-blocking therapy.) If an exacerbation of angina pectoris occurs, antianginal therapy should be restarted immediately in full doses and the patient hospitalized until his condition stabilizes.

Figure 7B — titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) outlines trajectory-based inpatient actions: Patients with decompensated HFrEF "should be diuresed and started on SGLT inhibitor unless contraindicated or cost prohibitive", while those "with an improving trajectory… should have optimization of GDMT". For a new diagnosis, "initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT should be attempted", and for chronic HF on partial therapy, care "should have personalized therapy to fill in gaps, considering a switch from an ACE inhibitor/ARB to ARNI if appropriate". In chronic Class IV HF with decompensation, "caution is required…; these patients may not tolerate even low doses of beta blockers and RAS, although an attempt at titration may be made". If the short-term course is "stalled or worsening", patients "should have re-evaluation of comorbidities and consideration of other diagnoses". Long-term course "should be reevaluated, with consideration of goals of care, candidacy for advanced therapies, and experimental treatments". The "ideal goal is initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT… in the hospital on a baseline of diuretic therapy", with "a plan for ongoing addition and titration of GDMT after discharge", including a "Loop diuretic plan on discharge". The figure lists the GDMT pillars as "SGLT inhibitors ARNI or ACEI/ARB beta-blockers MRA".

### Metoprolol tartrate (metoprolol tartrate) [^11411nzv]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Heart Failure

Beta blockers, like metoprolol tartrate, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. If signs or symptoms of heart failure develop, treat the patient according to recommended guidelines. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol tartrate or to discontinue it.

Ischemic Heart Disease

Do not abruptly discontinue metoprolol tartrate therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. Severe exacerbation of angina, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol tartrate, particularly in patients with coronary artery disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of 1–2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, metoprolol tartrate administration should be reinstated promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue metoprolol tartrate therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension.

Use During Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

Bradycardia

Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of metoprolol tartrate. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving metoprolol tartrate. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop metoprolol tartrate.

Diuretics in heart failure — key clinical considerations note that diuretics produce symptomatic benefits more rapidly than any other drug for HF and can relieve pulmonary and peripheral edema within hours or days, whereas effects of digitalis, ACEIs, or beta-blockers may require weeks or months; diuretics are the only drugs used for the treatment of HF that can adequately control the fluid retention of HF, and attempts to substitute ACEIs for diuretics can lead to pulmonary and peripheral congestion; diuretics should not be used alone in the treatment of Stage C HF, with risk of decompensation reduced when combined with an ACEI and a beta-blocker; appropriate use is key because inappropriately low doses result in fluid retention, whereas inappropriately high doses cause volume contraction and increase the risk of hypotension with ACEIs and vasodilators and the risk of renal insufficiency with ACEIs and ARBs, and optimal use is the cornerstone of successful HF treatment.

Practical use of beta-blockers — risks of treatment: fluid retention and worsening HF indicates initiation of treatment has produced 4 types of adverse reactions, and initiation of therapy with a beta-blocker can cause fluid retention that is usually asymptomatic and is detected primarily by an increase in body weight but may become sufficiently marked to cause worsening symptoms of HF; physicians should ensure that patients are not volume overloaded before a beta-blocker is initiated, should monitor patients closely for increases in weight and for worsening signs and symptoms of HF, and should augment the dose of diuretic if weight increases whether or not other signs or symptoms of worsening HF are present; the occurrence of fluid retention or worsening HF is not generally a reason for the permanent withdrawal of treatment, as such patients generally respond favorably to intensification of conventional therapy and once treated remain excellent candidates for long-term treatment with a beta-blocker.

Third, physicians may be unaware of the directions that were provided to investigators in clinical trials regarding the uptitration of neurohormonal antagonists. In these trials, physicians were required to increase the dose of the study medication to the specified target dose in a standardized manner, and to make an ongoing and concerted effort to achieve and maintain the target dose, even if patients experienced unwanted changes in blood pressure, renal function, or electrolytes. Reaching values for systolic blood pressure or heart rate in the 'normal range' was not considered a valid reason for interruption of the forced‐titration strategy. For example, many physicians mistakenly believe that systolic blood pressures of 100–120 mmHg are sufficiently low to prevent further dose uptitration. 41 However, in the landmark clinical trials, physicians were typically advised to continue uptitration as long as the systolic blood pressure was > 85–90 mmHg, if patients were not experiencing recurrent symptoms related to hypotension. Similarly, in trials of beta‐blockers, investigators were required to uptitrate to target doses even if the heart rate on a subtarget dose declined to 65 bpm. These strategies are contrary to commonly‐held beliefs that patients with chronic heart failure require certain levels of perfusion pressure or that they need a heart rate of 70–80 bpm to maintain cardiac output.

### Do β-blockers prolong survival in heart failure only by inhibiting the beta1-receptor? A perspective on the results of the COMET trial [^114G5J9E]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Experimental and clinical studies indicate that carvedilol exerts multiple antiadrenergic effects in addition to β₁-receptor blockade, but the prognostic importance of these actions has long been debated. This controversy has now been substantially advanced by the results of the recently completed Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), which showed that carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) reduced mortality by 17% when compared with metoprolol (50 mg twice daily), P = 0.0017 — a result that was consistent with the differences seen across earlier controlled trials with beta-blockers in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction and in patients with chronic heart failure. Questions have been raised about the interpretation of these findings in view of the fact that the trial did not use the dose or formulation of metoprolol that was shown to prolong life in a placebo-controlled trial (ie, Metoprolol CR/XL [Controlled Release] Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, however, indicate that the dosing regimen of metoprolol selected for use in the COMET trial produces a magnitude and time course of β₁-blockade during a 24-hour period that is similar to the dose of carvedilol targeted for use in the trial. These analyses suggest that the observed difference in the mortality effects of metoprolol and carvedilol is not related to a difference in the magnitude or time course of their β₁-blocking effects but instead reflect antiadrenergic effects of carvedilol in addition to β₁-blockade.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115f2DtN]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Definitions of evaluation criteria for drug-related heart failure (HF) categorize magnitude as follows: major effects are life-threatening or lead to hospitalization or emergency room visit; moderate effects can lead to an additional clinic visit, change in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, change in cardiac function, or worsening cardiovascular disease and can warrant a permanent change in the long-term medication regimen; minor effects lead to increased assessment/surveillance or symptoms that warrant a transient medication change. Levels of evidence are defined as Level A (multiple populations evaluated; data from multiple randomized, controlled trials or meta-analyses), Level B (limited populations evaluated; data from a single randomized, controlled trial or nonrandomized studies), and Level C (very limited populations evaluated; case reports, case studies, expert opinion, and consensus opinion). Onset of effect is defined as immediate when demonstrated within 1 wk of drug administration, intermediate when demonstrated within weeks to months, and delayed when demonstrated within ≥ 1 y of drug administration.

### Betaxolol [^111i5n7E]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe heart failure. In hypertensive patients who have congestive heart failure controlled by digitalis and diuretics, beta-blockers should be administered cautiously. Both digitalis and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents slow AV conduction.

In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure

Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. Therefore at the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, discontinuation of betaxolol should be considered. In some cases beta-blocker therapy can be continued while cardiac failure is treated with cardiac glycosides, diuretics, and other agents, as appropriate.

Exacerbation of Angina Pectoris Upon Withdrawal

Abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease has been followed by exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction has been reported. Therefore, such patients should be warned against interruption of therapy without the physician's advice. Even in the absence of overt angina pectoris, when discontinuation of betaxolol is planned, the patient should be carefully observed and therapy should be reinstituted, at least temporarily, if withdrawal symptoms occur.

Bronchospastic diseases

PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE SHOULD NOT IN GENERAL RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Because of its relative β -selectivity (cardioselectivity), low doses of betaxolol may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to or cannot tolerate alternative treatment. Since β -selectivity is not absolute and is inversely related to dose, the lowest possible dose of betaxolol should be used (5 to 10 mg once daily) and a bronchodilator should be made available. If dosage must be increased, divided dosage should be considered to avoid the higher peak blood levels associated with once-daily dosing.

Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery, however the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures (see Precautions, Drug Interactions). Titrate betaxolol dose to maintain effective heart rate control while avoiding frank hypotension and bradycardia.

Practical use of beta-blockers — management of clinical deterioration on long-term therapy explains that in patients who have been taking a beta-blocker for long periods of time (more than 3 months), discontinuation after an episode of worsening HF will not diminish and may in fact increase the subsequent risk of clinical decompensation; if deterioration is characterized by hypoperfusion or requires the use of intravenous positive inotropic drugs, it may be prudent to halt or significantly reduce treatment with beta-blockers temporarily until the status of the patient stabilizes, positive inotropic agents whose effects are mediated independently of the beta-receptor (e.g., a phosphodiesterase inhibitor such as milrinone) may be preferred, and once stabilized, the beta-blocker should be reintroduced to reduce the subsequent risk of clinical deterioration.

Rationale and recommendations for dosing of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction emphasize outcome benefits and titration to target or maximally tolerated doses. The rationale states that use of guideline-recommended beta blockers "has been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF, and studies have supported a dose-response relationship of beta blockers with improved outcomes", and that "treating at less than the target dose may result in worse clinical outcomes" with "the percentage of patients achieving these doses is low and remains low over time". It adds, "Treatment with a beta blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual incremental increases in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated. Clinicians should make every effort to achieve the target doses of the beta blockers shown to be effective in major clinical trials". The 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline specifies, "Use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (eg, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality" with "(Class I, Level of Evidence: A)". The 2017 ACC decision pathway adds, "After a diagnosis of heart failure is made, GDMT should be initiated and therapies should be adjusted no more frequently than every 2 weeks to target doses (or maximally tolerated doses)" and "To achieve the maximal benefits of GDMT in patients with chronic HFrEF, therapies must be initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses".

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — selection of patients and initiation: Beta-blockers should be prescribed to all patients with stable HF due to reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or are unable to tolerate them, and treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated as soon as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is diagnosed. Therapy should not be delayed until symptoms return or disease progression is documented, and even patients with little disability should receive treatment with a beta-blocker to reduce the risk of disease progression, future clinical deterioration, and sudden death. Patients need not be taking high doses of ACEIs prior to starting a beta-blocker, and in those taking a low dose of an ACEI, adding a beta-blocker produces a greater improvement in symptoms and reduction in risk of death than increasing the ACEI dose to trial targets. In patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention, beta-blockers should not be prescribed without diuretics.

### Can medications be safely withdrawn in patients with stable chronic heart failure? systematic review and meta-analysis [^114oW21R]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) therapy involves use of multiple medications. There is little guidance on the safety and impact on clinical outcomes of stopping HF medications.

Methods and Results

A comprehensive systematic search for studies of drug therapy withdrawal in HF was performed. Meta-analysis of the risk ratio (RR) was performed with the use of the Mantel-Haenszel random effects model for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies on withdrawal of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and beta-blockers in HF are scarce and small, yet show relatively convincingly that such withdrawals have untoward effects on cardiac structure, symptoms, and major outcomes. Meta-analysis of 7 studies of digoxin withdrawal (2,987 participants) without background beta-blocker showed increased HF hospitalizations (RR 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–1.46; P < .0001), but no impact on all-cause mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90–1.12; p = 0.06) nor reduction in all-cause hospitalization (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98–1.09; p = 0.27). Diuretic withdrawal trials demonstrated an ongoing need for these agents in chronic HF. Studies in peripartum cardiomyopathy showed that medications could be successfully withdrawn after recovery.

Conclusion

Current evidence discourages any attempt to discontinue RAAS inhibitors or beta-blockers in patients with stable HF, regardless of clinical and/or echocardiographic status. Formal withdrawal trials of other classes are needed.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular events — acute MI and history of MI with normal LVEF: In patients with an acute MI, the infusion of a fibrinolytic agent or the use of percutaneous coronary intervention can decrease the risk of developing HF, and patients also benefit from both a beta-blocker and either an ACEI or ARB, which can decrease the risk of reinfarction or death when initiated within days after the ischemic event; combined neurohormonal blockade produces additive benefits. In patients with a history of MI but normal LVEF, both hypertension and hyperlipidemia should be treated vigorously, patients with a recent MI should also receive ACEIs and beta-blockers to reduce death risk, and evidence from 2 large-scale studies indicates that prolonged ACEI therapy can reduce major cardiovascular events even when started months or years after MI.

### Effect of oral β-blocker on short and long-term mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure: results from the BASEL-II-ICU study [^111CfUDK]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

More importantly, we could demonstrate that discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy during hospitalization is associated with higher mortality rates, suggesting a protective effect of beta-blocker therapy in our acute respiratory failure patients. Discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy is indeed associated with a "withdrawal syndrome", a transient sympathetic hyper-response caused by hypersensitivity of cardiac β-receptors. Patients in whom beta-blockers were discontinued complained of transient palpitations, tremor, sweating, headache and general malaise. A significant increase in blood pressure and heart rate could also be demonstrated 24 h after beta-blocker withdrawal. A survival benefit of continuation of beta-blocker therapy in patients with ADHF was demonstrated by Butler et al. and recently confirmed by Fonarow et al. Jondeau et al. and Orso et al. There is, furthermore, evidence that patients admitted with AECOPD may also benefit from continuation of beta-blocker therapy. The observed positive association of beta-blocker continuation with lower mortality may be explained by the prevention of malignant ventricular arrhythmias, protection against myocardial infarction or acute negative mechanical remodeling, which may initiate the development of fatal pump failure.

In our study, treatment with beta-blockers at discharge was associated with lower one-year mortality. There is solid evidence showing that oral treatment with beta-blockers improves long-term survival in various cardiovascular diseases including CHF, CAD or arterial hypertension. A recently published, large observational cohort study demonstrated that treatment with beta-blockers also reduce risk of exacerbations and improve survival in patients with COPD. Interestingly, this effect was shown to be independent of cardiovascular co-morbidities. Beta-blockers are known to temper the sympathetic nervous system, including the reduction of heart rate. Therefore, negative systemic effects in the disease progression of cardiovascular disease including CAD, CHF or arterial hypertension, as well as COPD could be diminished. Heart rate reduction itself may be an important mechanism of the benefit of beta-blockers. Large epidemiological studies have shown that resting heart rate was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in individuals with and without cardiovascular disease.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1135PND4]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — cardio-selective beta-blockers: In patients with COPD, we suggest starting or continuing cardio-selective beta-blockers only in those who have a cardiovascular indication for beta-blockers (e.g., heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or recent myocardial infarction) (Weak for | Reviewed, Amended). In COPD with cardiovascular indications, observational data suggests that these agents are safe, improve mortality rates, and decrease COPD exacerbations; metoprolol was the only beta-blocker examined by the studies included in the systematic evidence review. In a randomized controlled trial evaluating 100 patients with cardiovascular indications, metoprolol reduced COPD exacerbations and mortality versus placebo without increasing adverse events, although the intended population had cor pulmonale with an N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 1,800 picograms/milliliter (pg/mL) and exclusions for reduced ejection fraction or cardiomyopathy were not clearly verified. A systematic review of 18 observational studies reported reduced COPD exacerbations and mortality with beta-blocker use in COPD patients with cardiovascular indications, whereas the β-Blockers (BLOCK) COPD randomized clinical trial of metoprolol in 532 patients without cardiovascular indications was stopped early due to a higher risk of exacerbations and hospitalization associated with beta-blocker use.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to beta-blockers, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate one of the three β-blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) to reduce mortality and hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF with current or previous symptoms.

### Acebutolol hydrochloride (Sectral) [^111iTr9q]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of
	the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial
	contractility, and its inhibition by β-adrenergic
	receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. Although
	β-blockers should be avoided in overt cardiac failure,
	Sectral can be used with caution in patients with a history of
	heart failure who are controlled with digitalis and/or
	diuretics. Both digitalis and Sectral impair AV conduction. If
	cardiac failure persists, therapy with Sectral should be
	withdrawn.

In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure

In patients with aortic or mitral valve disease or
	compromised left ventricular function, continued depression of
	the myocardium with β-blocking agents over a period of
	time may lead to cardiac failure. At the first signs of failure,
	patients should be digitalized and/or be given a diuretic and
	the response observed closely. If cardiac failure continues
	despite adequate digitalization and/or diuretic, Sectral therapy
	should be withdrawn.

Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt
	Withdrawal

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain
	β-blocking agents in patients with coronary artery
	disease, exacerbation of angina pectoris and, in some cases,
	myocardial infarction and death have been reported. Therefore,
	such patients should be cautioned against interruption of
	therapy without a physician's advice. Even in the absence of
	overt ischemic heart disease, when discontinuation of Sectral is
	planned, the patient should be carefully observed, and should be
	advised to limit physical activity to a minimum while Sectral is
	gradually withdrawn over a period of about two weeks. (If
	therapy with an alternative β-blocker is desired, the
	patient may be transferred directly to comparable doses of
	another agent without interruption of β-blocking
	therapy.) If an exacerbation of angina pectoris occurs,
	antianginal therapy should be restarted immediately in full
	doses and the patient hospitalized until his condition
	stabilizes.

Peripheral Vascular Disease

Treatment with β-antagonists reduces cardiac
	output and can precipitate or aggravate the symptoms of arterial
	insufficiency in patients with peripheral or mesenteric vascular
	disease. Caution should be exercised with such patients, and
	they should be observed closely for evidence of progression of
	arterial obstruction.

TABLE 3
Comparison of adverse events associated with ACEi/ARB or beta‐blockers among patients not reaching target doses for unspecified reason, those not reaching target doses due to symptoms/side effects, and those reaching target doses

For beta‐blockers, bradycardia and hypotension occurred in 1.5% and 3.8% of patients, respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders, bradycardia and hypotension occurred at similar rates among the three groups of patients (all adjusted p values > 0.10). Table 3. In patients with an age ≥ 75 years, a BMI ≤ 25 kg/m 2, a heart rate ≤ 70 bpm, NYHA of III/IV and impaired quality of life assessed by KCCQ score, there was no between‐group difference in the studied adverse effects (adjusted p values > .05 for all subgroups) (Supplementary Table 3).

During the following stabilization period for ACEi/ARB, 7.2% (N = 76) and 0.9% (N = 5) of patients in group (a) and (b) were successfully up‐titrated, respectively, whereas 9.8% (N = 46) of patients in group (c) did not maintain their target doses until 9 months. A sensitivity analysis excluding these patients showed similar incidence of adverse events among three groups (Supplementary Table 4). Similarly, for beta‐blockers, we excluded 5.6% (N = 78), 1.2% (N = 5) and 16.0% (N = 41) of patients in group (a), (b) and (c), and observed similar rates of adverse events among three groups (Supplementary Table 4).

### Nurse-led titration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, β-adrenergic blocking agents, and angiotensin receptor blockers for people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1175YU8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure is associated with high mortality and hospital readmissions. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can improve survival and reduce hospital readmissions and are recommended as first-line therapy in the treatment of heart failure. Evidence has also shown that there is a dose-dependent relationship of these medications with patient outcomes. Despite this evidence, primary care physicians are reluctant to up-titrate these medications. New strategies aimed at facilitating this up-titration are warranted. Nurse-led titration (NLT) is one such strategy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NLT of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in terms of safety and patient outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL Issue 11 of 12, 19/12/2014), MEDLINE OVID (1946 to November week 3 2014), and EMBASE Classic and EMBASE OVID (1947 to 2014 week 50). We also searched reference lists of relevant primary studies, systematic reviews, clinical trial registries, and unpublished theses sources. We used no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NLT of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and/or ARBs comparing the optimisation of these medications by a nurse to optimisation by another health professional in patients with HFrEF.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (AD & JC) independently assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias. We contacted primary authors if we required additional information. We examined quality of evidence using the GRADE rating tool for RCTs. We analysed extracted data by risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous data to measure effect sizes of intervention group compared with usual-care group. Meta-analyses used the fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel method. We assessed heterogeneity between studies by χ² and I².

Main Results

We included seven studies (1684 participants) in the review. One study enrolled participants from a residential care facility, and the other six studies from primary care and outpatient clinics. All-cause hospital admission data was available in four studies (556 participants). Participants in the NLT group experienced a lower rate of all-cause hospital admissions (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.88, high-quality evidence) and fewer hospital admissions related to heart failure (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.72, moderate-quality evidence) compared to the usual-care group. Six studies (902 participants) examined all-cause mortality. All-cause mortality was also lower in the NLT group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92, moderate-quality evidence) compared to usual care. Approximately 27 deaths could be avoided for every 1000 people receiving NLT of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs. Only three studies (370 participants) reported outcomes on all-cause and heart failure-related event-free survival. Participants in the NLT group were more likely to remain event free compared to participants in the usual-care group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.77, moderate-quality evidence). Five studies (966 participants) reported on the number of participants reaching target dose of beta-adrenergic blocking agents. This was also higher in the NLT group compared to usual care (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.47, low-quality evidence). However, there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity in this pooled analysis. We rated the risk of bias in these studies as high mainly due to a lack of clarity regarding incomplete outcome data, lack of reporting on adverse events associated with the intervention, and the inability to blind participants and personnel. Participants in the NLT group reached maximal dose of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in half the time compared with participants in usual care. Two studies reported on adverse events; one of these studies stated there were no adverse events, and the other study found one adverse event but did not specify the type or severity of the adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

Participants in the NLT group experienced fewer hospital admissions for any cause and an increase in survival and number of participants reaching target dose within a shorter time period. However, the quality of evidence regarding the proportion of participants reaching target dose was low and should be interpreted with caution. We found high-quality evidence supporting NLT as one strategy that may improve the optimisation of beta-adrenergic blocking agents resulting in a reduction in hospital admissions. Despite evidence of a dose-dependent relationship of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs with improving outcomes in patients with HFrEF, the translation of this evidence into clinical practice is poor. NLT is one strategy that facilitates the implementation of this evidence into practice.

### Carvedilol (Coreg) [^116R2oLj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4	Heart Failure/Fluid Retention

Worsening heart failure or fluid retention may occur during up-titration of carvedilol. If such symptoms occur, diuretics should be increased and the carvedilol dose should not be advanced until clinical stability resumes [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Occasionally it is necessary to lower the carvedilol dose or temporarily discontinue it.

Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol. In a placebo-controlled trial of subjects with severe heart failure, worsening heart failure during the first 3 months was reported to a similar degree with carvedilol and with placebo. When treatment was maintained beyond 3 months, worsening heart failure was reported less frequently in subjects treated with carvedilol than with placebo. Worsening heart failure observed during long-term therapy is more likely to be related to the patients' underlying disease than to treatment with carvedilol.

5.5	 Non-allergic Bronchospasm

Patients with bronchospastic disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) should, in general, not receive β-blockers. COREG may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive agents. It is prudent, if COREG is used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous β-agonists is minimized.

In clinical trials of subjects with heart failure, subjects with bronchospastic disease were enrolled if they did not require oral or inhaled medication to treat their bronchospastic disease. In such patients, it is recommended that carvedilol be used with caution. The dosing recommendations should be followed closely and the dose should be lowered if any evidence of bronchospasm is observed during up-titration.

### Nadolol [^1164B5t4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in patients with congestive heart failure, and its inhibition by beta-blockade may precipitate more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, they can be used with caution in patients with a history of failure who are well-compensated, usually with digitalis and diuretics. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents do not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle.

IN PATIENTS WITHOUT A HISTORY OF HEART FAILURE, continued use of beta-blockers can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. Therefore, at the first sign or symptom of heart failure, the patient should be digitalized and/or treated with diuretics, and the response observed closely, or nadolol should be discontinued (gradually, if possible).

Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal -

Hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered nadolol, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of one to two weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, nadolol administration should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue nadolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension.

Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema)

PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD IN GENERAL NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Nadolol should be administered with caution since it may block bronchodilation produced by endogenous or exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2receptors.

Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

### Beta-blocker dosing in community-based treatment of heart failure [^113P4d3w]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Community patients with heart failure (HF) are older, less often treated by HF specialists, and have more comorbidity than those in randomized clinical trials. These differences might affect beta-blocker prescribing in HF.

Methods

To explore patterns of beta-blocker prescribing for HF in the community and their association with outcomes, we determined carvedilol doses at end titration in 4113 patients from a community-based beta-blocker HF registry according to physician and patient characteristics, HF severity, and rates of hospitalization and death.

Results

Female sex, age ≥ 65 years, and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 35% were associated with lower beta-blocker doses. Average daily dose of beta-blocker was lower with worse baseline New York Heart Association class. More patients of cardiologists achieved carvedilol doses ≥ 25 mg twice daily, whereas in those of noncardiologists lower doses were more common. Relative risk of HF hospitalizations or all-cause death was significantly lower with higher doses of beta-blocker.

Conclusions

Beta-blocker dosing in community HF appears lower than in randomized clinical trials, especially when prescribed by noncardiologists. At all doses, patients taking the beta-blocker carvedilol have a lower incidence of death and HF hospitalization than those discontinuing it, regardless of physician type in the community setting.

### Management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1139ezCt]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Pillar 3: Antagonism of the sympathetic system with selected beta-blockers

Sympathetic overactivity is a hallmark of HFrEF. Increased peripheral vasoconstriction and elevated heart rates attempt to maintain cardiac output and vital organ perfusion but are ultimately maladaptive. It may worsen myocardial ischaemia, and high catecholamine levels may increase myocyte automaticity, increasing the risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmia. The use of selected βB is, therefore, recommended for HFrEF (table 5) and results in a relative mortality reduction of 35% when compared with placebo.

Table 5
Beta-blockers indicated in HFrEF

The use of βB may worsen acute heart failure and so clinical assessment is required to ensure that the patient with HFrEF is not decompensated at the time of βB initiation. Patients may often feel less well for 48–72 hours following initiation of βB or dose escalation and they should be warned of this to improve compliance with life-saving therapy. Where patients with HFrEF have decompensated on stable doses of βB, they should be continued at the same dose, while managing the decompensation. Dose titration should be to the maximum tolerated (starting at low dose) with a target resting heart rate of 60–70 bpm in sinus rhythm. Use of βB in patients with HFrEF with AF is recommended, although prognostic benefits are less well proven and aggressive rate control does not appear to provide any significant benefits when compared with more modest rate control. Some patients may not tolerate βB at higher doses and where the heart rate remains above 70 bpm then the I_f channel blocker, Ivabradine, may be used to slow the sinus rate and improve symptoms and mortality.

### Beta-blocker therapy for chronic heart failure… [^111cxbbT]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Beta blockers have become standard therapy in patients with chronic heart failure resulting from systolic dysfunction. Kukin reviewed clinical efficacy and mortality trials of beta blockers, as well as factors to consider when prescribing these drugs. Treatment with beta blockers should be initiated in patients who are stable and euvolemic and do not have a contraindication to their use. These drugs should be titrated slowly to the target dosage or the maximum tolerated dosage. If patients cannot tolerate titration, low-dose beta-blocker therapy should be continued because clinical benefits occur even with smaller amounts. Adverse effects of beta blockers include hypotension, fluid retention, bradycardia, and heart block. Hypotension typically is short-lived; one solution to this problem is short-term dosage reduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients who also use those medications. Fluid retention may require an increased dosage of diuretic.

Most patients with bradycardia or heart block are asymptomatic; however, dosage reduction or discontinuation of beta blockers is required if second- or third-degree heart block develops. Tapering the dosage is important because abrupt discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy may elicit coronary insufficiency. The recommended starting dosage of carvedilol is 3. 125 mg twice daily. The mortality benefits of metoprolol have been proved only for the extended-release form. The theoretic benefits of nonselective agents such as carvedilol have not translated into a mortality benefit over beta 1-selective agents in currently available trials. A number of major trials have evaluated the mortality benefits of beta blockers in patients with chronic heart failure. While there may be individual benefits with either drug, to date, no large-scale studies have directly compared mortality with the use of extended-release metoprolol succinate versus carvedilol.

The author concluded that no data support the choice of one agent over the other. editor's note: The mortality benefit of beta-blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure is clear. Studies continue to show less than ideal use of these medications in patients with chronic heart failure. Current expert guidelines recommend the use of beta blockers in all stable patients who have evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, unless there is a contraindication to their use. A European trial comparing metoprolol and carvedilol is nearing completion, but it does not compare the extended-release form of metoprolol with carvedilol. — c. c.

### Beta-blocker use and outcomes among hospitalized heart failure patients [^115vZ4cx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of beta-blocker therapy on outcomes of hospitalized heart failure (HF) patients enrolled in the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization (ESCAPE).

Background

The effect of beta-blocker therapy on outcomes among hospitalized HF patients is not well documented.

Methods

We studied the association between beta-blocker therapy and outcomes among 432 hospitalized HF patients in the ESCAPE trial.

Results

A total of 268 patients (62%) were on beta-blockers before admission. These patients had a shorter length of stay (7.9 ± 6.3 days vs. 9.4 ± 6.7 days; p < 0.01) and a lower six-month mortality rate (16% vs. 24%; p = 0.03) compared with those who were not on beta-blockers. Of the patients who were on admission beta-blockers and were discharged alive (n = 263), beta-blockers were discontinued in 54 and significantly modified (> 50% dose reduction or changed to alternative beta-blocker) in 28 patients during hospitalization. Factors associated with discontinuation of beta-blockers during hospitalization included respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min (30.8% vs. 16.9%; p = 0.03), heart rate > 100 beats/min (19.2% vs. 7.3%; p = 0.01), lower ejection fraction (17.9 ± 5.4% vs. 20.2 ± 7.1%; p = 0.04), diabetes (21.2% vs. 37.1%; p = 0.03), and systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg during hospitalization (70.3% vs. 54.1%; p = 0.03). After adjusting for factors associated with beta-blocker use and those with outcomes, consistent beta-blocker use during hospitalization was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of rehospitalization or death within six months after discharge (odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.71; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Beta-blocker therapy before and during hospitalization for HF is associated with improved outcomes.

### Lower in-hospital mortality with beta-blocker use at admission in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^111UPWM5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In‐Hospital Outcomes

Patients receiving beta‐blockers at admission had a significantly lower incidence of in‐hospital death than those not receiving beta‐blockers at admission (4.4% versus 7.6%, P < 0.001) (Table 4). Even after adjusting for confounders, the excess risk of patients receiving beta‐blockers at admission relative to those not receiving beta‐blockers at admission remained significant for in‐hospital death (adjusted OR, 0.41, 95% CI, 0.27–0.60 in model 1, adjusted OR, 0.42, 95% CI, 0.28–0.61 in model 2). Patients receiving beta‐blockers at admission had a significantly lower incidence of both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular deaths (3.4% versus 5.4%, P = 0.003, and 1.1% versus 2.2%, P = 0.008, respectively) and a numerically lower incidence of sudden cardiac death (0.2% versus 0.43%, P = 0.21) than those not receiving beta‐blockers at admission. After adjusting for confounders, the lower risks of patients receiving beta‐blockers at admission relative to those not receiving beta‐blockers at admission were significant for cardiovascular death (adjusted OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26–0.66 in model 1; adjusted OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26–0.65 in model 2) and noncardiovascular death (adjusted OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21–0.86 in model 1; adjusted OR, 0.49; 95% CI 0.24–0.94 in model 2) (Table 4). Details of causes of noncardiovascular death were shown in Table S4.

### B-CONVINCED: beta-blocker CONtinuation vs. INterruption in patients with congestive heart failure hospitalizED for a decompensation episode [^113SFknR]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Whether or not beta-blocker therapy should be stopped during acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is unsure.

Methods and Results

In a randomized, controlled, open labelled, non-inferiority trial, we compared beta-blockade continuation vs. discontinuation during ADHF in patients with LVEF below 40% previously receiving stable beta-blocker therapy. 169 patients were included, among which 147 were evaluable. Mean age was 72 ± 12 years, 65% were males. After 3 days, 92.8% of patients pursuing beta-blockade improved for both dyspnoea and general well-being according to a physician blinded for therapy vs. 92.3% of patients stopping beta-blocker. This was the main endpoint and the upper limit for unilateral 95% CI (6.6%) is lower that of the predefined upper limit (12.5%), indicating non-inferiority. Similar findings were obtained at 8 days and when evaluation was made by the patient. Plasma BNP at Day 3, length of hospital stay, re-hospitalization rate, and death rate after 3 months were also similar. Beta-blocker therapy at 3 months was given to 90% of patients vs. 76% (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In conclusion, during ADHF, continuation of beta-blocker therapy is not associated with delayed or lesser improvement, but with a higher rate of chronic prescription of beta-blocker therapy after 3 months, the benefit of which is well established.

### Tolerability to β-blocker therapy among heart failure patients in clinical practice [^114deuoL]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although beta-blockers were well-tolerated by heart failure (HF) patients in clinical trials, tolerability of these drugs in a general population of HF patients is not well-described.

Methods

We studied a total of 308 encounters with beta-blockers therapy in 268 ambulatory HF patients. Side effects and frequency and predictors of discontinuation of therapy were studied. Independent predictors of discontinuation were assessed.

Results

Weight gain (59%), fatigue (56%), dizziness (41%), and dyspnea (29%) were the most common side effects. Fifty-one patients (19%) were discontinued on therapy with any 1 particular beta-blocker. Fatigue (30%) and hypotension (28%) were the most common reasons for discontinuation. Forty (78%) of these were given a trial with a different beta-blocker. Of these, 22 (55%) attempts with a different beta-blocker were tolerated. Thus the overall absolute discontinuation rate was only 7% for patients who were given a trial with different beta-blockers or 11% for the entire study population. Independent predictors of discontinuation of therapy included advanced symptoms, nonischemic etiology, history of pulmonary disease, and higher diuretic doses.

Conclusion

Side effects with beta-blockers in a general population of HF patients are common; however, with changes in medical management, most patients can tolerate them eventually. In case of intolerance to one kind, a trial with a different beta-blocker is indicated.

### Should β-blocker therapy be reduced or withdrawn after an episode of decompensated heart failure? Results from COMET [^115UZBFh]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether beta-blocker therapy should be reduced or withdrawn in patients who develop acute decompensated heart failure (HF). We studied the relationship between changes in beta-blocker dose and outcome in patients surviving a HF hospitalisation in COMET.

Methods

Patients hospitalised for HF were subdivided on the basis of the beta-blocker dose administered at the visit following hospitalisation, compared to that administered before.

Results

In COMET, 752/3029 patients (25%, 361 carvedilol and 391 metoprolol) had a non-fatal HF hospitalisation while on study treatment. Of these, 61 patients (8%) had beta-blocker treatment withdrawn, 162 (22%) had a dose reduction and 529 (70%) were maintained on the same dose. One-and two-year cumulative mortality rates were 28.7% and 44.6% for patients withdrawn from study medication, 37.4% and 51.4% for those with a reduced dosage (n.s.) and 19.1% and 32.5% for those maintained on the same dose (HR,1.59; 95%CI, 1.28–1.98; p < 0.001, compared to the others). The result remained significant in a multivariable model: (HR, 1.30; 95%CI, 1.02–1.66; p = 0.0318). No interaction with the beneficial effects of carvedilol, compared to metoprolol, on outcome was observed (p = 0.8436).

Conclusions

HF hospitalisations are associated with a high subsequent mortality. The risk of death is higher in patients who discontinue beta-blocker therapy or have their dose reduced. The increase in mortality is only partially explained by the worse prognostic profile of these patients.

Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3.2 Treatment intervention and visits

Following screening (visit 0) and randomization (visit 1) visits, the procedures across treatment arms are:

‐A‐arm: Patients allocated to this arm are instructed to reduce by half the dose of beta‐blocker (Figure 1). The patients will be advised for potential adverse effects and instructed to contact with outpatient's clinics of HF if any adverse effect occurs. Patients will be checked in 3 days (visit 2) by a cardiologist. If clinically stable, the patients are instructed to withdraw the beta‐blocker and repeat all the procedures of the study at 15 days (visit 3). After visit 3, the patients initiate the previous half dose of beta‐blockers. Patients are visited at 18 days (visit 4). If clinically stable, the patient will increase to the previous dose of the beta‐blocker and repeat all the examination tests at 30 days (visit 5).

‐B‐arm: Patients allocated to this arm will continue with the same treatment and revisited 3 days after (visit 2) (Figure 1). All of the study procedures repeated at 15 days (visit 3), and, after them, the patients are instructed to reduce by the half dose of beta‐blocker. Likewise, the patients are advised for potential adverse effects and instructed to contact outpatient HF‐clinics of HF if any adverse effect occurs. Patients are revisited in 3 days (at 18 days, visit 4), and if clinically stable, the patient withdraws the beta‐blocker and repeats all the examination tests at 30 days (visit 5).

At visit 5, the responsible cardiologist will assess all the examination test and individually decide the convenience of beta‐blockers reintroduction or withdrawal in both arms. A cardiologist of the HF‐unit will clinically evaluate all patients at 60‐day after randomization (visit 6). Additional visits will be permitted according to the patient's clinical status and will be registered.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116exo7L]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary agents — β2-agonists and heart failure (HF) risk — show dose-related and arrhythmic hospitalization signals. A retrospective case-control study demonstrated a 3-fold increase in cardiomyopathy risk with systemic or inhaled β2-agonist use, and a dose-related increase in risk for hospital admission with deteriorating HF in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) using inhaled β2-agonists was reported (1–2 canisters per month: adjusted OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.0; ≥ 3 canisters per month: adjusted OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2–3.8). Another study found an increased risk of hospitalization for ventricular arrhythmia in patients receiving β2-agonists (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.0–15.1), higher with systemic than inhaled formulations, and regular exposure could theoretically lead to HF deterioration via decreased receptor responsiveness.

### Inotropes and β-blockers: is there a need for new guidelines? [^112gjPAe]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are standard treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. When patients receiving beta-blockers decompensate they often need treatment with a positive inotropic agent. The beta-agonist dobutamine may not produce much increase in cardiac output during full-dose beta-blocker treatment and may increase systemic vascular resistance via alpha-adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) such as milrinone or enoximone retain full hemodynamic effects during complete beta-blockade because the site of action of PDEIs is beyond the beta-adrenergic receptor and because beta-blockade reverses some of the desensitization phenomena that account for the attenuation of PDEI response in heart failure related to upregulation in G(alphai). Inotrope-requiring subjects with decompensated heart failure who are undergoing long-term therapy with beta-blocking agents should be treated with a type III-specific PDEI, not a beta-agonist such as dobutamine.

### Titration to target dose of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure: the CIBIS-ELD trial [^111FpTt4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic heart failure is a growing epidemic associated with high mortality, morbidity, and quality of life (QoL) impairment and is a substantial burden on health systems. Three key trials have randomized nearly 9000 patients with systolic heart failure to beta-blocker (bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol succinate controlled release) or placebo and demonstrated a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations. – Nevertheless, recent large international surveys have shown that only 20–40% of heart failure patients are taking beta-blockers and the mean dose is half the recommended target.

The underuse and underdosing of beta-blockers may reflect a reluctance to change practice stemming from their long-standing contraindication in heart failure. Conversely, it may reflect a true lack of tolerability of beta-blockers in patients who are typically relatively old, have co-morbidities, and are taking a range of other drugs. It is noteworthy that many previous beta-blocker trials included heart failure patients who were younger (mean age 61–64) than those encountered in routine practice (mean age 71–75). –,

Class effects may not be uniform and tolerability may differ between the commonly used beta-blockers, reflecting their distinct pharmacological profiles such as selectivity for the β 1 -adrenoceptor subtype (bisoprolol) or vasodilatory activity (carvedilol). However, differences in tolerability have not been systematically studied. If one proven beta-blocker were better tolerated than another it could be of considerable public health importance. Results of the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), suggested that overall tolerability of carvedilol vs. metoprolol tartrate does not differ, but it has been suggested that this interpretation is problematic because doses were not equivalent. The second Carvedilol Open-Label Assessment found good tolerability for carvedilol in older heart failure patients, but no previous double-blind randomized trial had tolerability as the primary endpoint.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for beta-blocker toxicity, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, AACT/AAPCC/ACMT 2005 guidelines recommend to elicit history to determine the precise ingested dose of a β-blocker, the presence of coingestants and comorbidities in patients without evidence of self-harm.

Clinical Question

Does nurse-led titration of β-adrenergic blocking agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction improve outcomes?

Bottom Line

Participants whose treatment included nurse-led titration experienced fewer hospital admissions for any cause and an increase in survival, with more participants reaching target dose within a shorter period.

### The new heart failure guidelines: strategies for implementation [^115b6ubi]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Several life-prolonging therapies are available for the treatment of heart failure, yet they are underutilized in many patients. A treatment gap exists between patients who are eligible for a therapy and the number of patients who actually receive them. Suboptimal prescribing rates for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have been reported. Strategies are needed to increase the proportion of patients who are receiving evidence-based therapies. Predischarge initiation of evidence-based therapies has effectively increased utilization in the acute coronary syndrome population. Predischarge initiation of beta-blockade in patients hospitalized for heart failure has also been shown to be safe and effective for improving beta-blocker use at 60 days. Larger registry initiatives have demonstrated improved use of evidence-based therapies associated with implementation of a performance improvement process system. The mortality and morbidity associated with heart failure is strikingly high, and it is critical that proven therapies are prescribed to all eligible patients so that clinical outcomes can be improved. Systematic processes are effective approaches to ensuring appropriate evidence-based therapies are prescribed in most patients.

Second, physicians may recognize the inadequacy of low starting doses but may nonetheless believe that medium‐range doses provide most of the benefits of target doses. Theoretically, this premise would be true if medium‐range and high target doses were on the upper flat portion of the dose–response curve. Yet, in a clinical trials, higher doses have provided greater benefits than lower doses, 19, 20, 35, 36 and there is little evidence that medium‐range subtarget doses reduce the risk of death. Interestingly, the final step in the dose‐titration process to target doses may provide unexpectedly large survival benefits. In the COMET trial, 37 carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) was compared with metoprolol tartrate (50 mg twice daily) in a large double‐blind trial of > 3000 patients who were followed for nearly 5 years. At these doses, the heart rate reduction in the metoprolol group was within 1–2 bpm of that achieved in the carvedilol group, suggesting that metoprolol tartrate provided > 75% of the beta‐1 receptor blockade produced by carvedilol. 38 Yet, when compared with metoprolol, carvedilol was accompanied by a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death. Since beta‐blockers reduce mortality by ≈30–35% when compared with placebo, 39 these observations suggest that more than half of the mortality reduction produced by target doses of beta‐blockers may be provided by the final step in the dose titration protocol. 40

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Beta-blocker–related hypotension — timing and management state that beta-blockers, especially those that also block alpha-1-receptors, can produce hypotension, and for beta-blockers that also block alpha-receptors, such as carvedilol, these vasodilatory side effects are generally seen within 24 to 48 hours of the first dose or the first increase in dose and usually subside with repeated dosing without any change in dose. Physicians may minimize the risk of hypotension by administering the beta-blocker and ACEI at different times during the day, and if this is ineffective, the occurrence of hypotension may require a temporary reduction in the dose of the ACEI. Hypotensive symptoms may also resolve after a decrease in the dose of diuretics in patients who are volume depleted, and if hypotension is accompanied by other clinical evidence of hypoperfusion, beta-blocker therapy should be decreased or discontinued pending further patient evaluation.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure — practical use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) emphasizes that treatment with an ACEI should be initiated at low doses, and renal function and serum potassium should be assessed within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter; because fluid retention can blunt benefits and fluid depletion can potentiate adverse effects, healthcare providers should ensure that patients are being given appropriate doses of diuretics before and during treatment. Clinicians should attempt to use doses that have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials; if these target doses of an ACEI cannot be used or are poorly tolerated, intermediate doses should be used, and clinicians should not delay the institution of beta-blockers in patients because of a failure to reach target ACEI doses. Once titrated, patients can generally be maintained on long-term therapy with an ACEI with little difficulty; although symptoms may improve within the first 48 hours, the clinical responses are generally delayed and may require several weeks, months, or more to become apparent, and even if symptoms do not improve, long-term treatment with an ACEI should be maintained to reduce the risk of death or hospitalization. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment with an ACEI should be avoided in the absence of life-threatening complications; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided; the use of an ACEI can also minimize or eliminate the need for long-term potassium supplementation; and in hemodynamically or clinically unstable patients it may be prudent to interrupt treatment with the ACEI temporarily until the clinical status of the patient stabilizes.

### Lower in-hospital mortality with beta-blocker use at admission in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^111iNf6y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Flow diagram of study patients.

High‐dose BBs were defined as carvedilol equivalent doses ≥ 10 mg, while low‐dose BBs were defined as carvedilol equivalent doses < 10 mg. The carvedilol‐equivalent dose was 5 times the dose of bisoprolol, one‐fifth of the dose of metoprolol tartrate, and one‐third of atenolol dose. ACS indicates acute coronary syndrome; and BB, beta‐blocker.

Details of Beta‐Blockers Used

Among the 1512 patients receiving beta‐blockers at admission, 58.7% were receiving carvedilol (median daily total dose: 5 mg [IQR: 2.5–10 mg]) and 33.5% were receiving bisoprolol (median daily total dose: 2.5 mg [IQR: 1.25–5 mg]) (Table 2). Thus, more than 90% of beta‐blockers were evidence‐based beta‐blockers. As maximum approved dose of carvedilol is 20 mg and that of bisoprolol is 5 mg in Japan, daily total dose was much lower than doses used in other studies conducted outside Japan. After excluding 58 patients with missing a beta‐blocker dose or beta‐blockers unconvertible to carvedilol equivalent doses, 774 patients received low‐dose beta‐blockers, and 680 patients received high dose beta‐blockers (Figure 2 and Table S2). We had no data regarding beta‐blocker withdrawal during hospitalization. However, among 1445 patients receiving beta‐blockers at admission and were discharged alive, 1289 patients (89.2%) received beta‐blockers at discharge (Table S3). Among the 2130 patients not receiving beta‐blockers at admission and were discharged alive, 1057 patients (49.6%) received beta‐blockers at discharge. Beta‐blockers were started on the fifth hospital day as median (IQR 2–10 days).

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113roJAv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Beta blockers for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and beta-blocker therapy provides high economic value. Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Beta blockers should be initiated at low doses with efforts to achieve target doses as tolerated, and they can be safely started before hospital discharge when patients are clinically stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic therapy for HF. Even if symptoms or LVEF improve, long-term treatment with target doses should be maintained to reduce risk of progression, and abrupt withdrawal should be avoided unless indicated.

Fourth, many physicians are unfamiliar with the strategies that were used in large‐scale trials to manage and mitigate adverse effects of drug treatments, thereby, allowing uptitration to target doses. If clinically important hypotension occurs, it often does not recur with rechallenge at the same dose, and recurrences can be further minimized by downtitration of diuretics or the elimination of other drugs that can decrease blood pressure. Similarly, most increases in blood urea nitrogen should not prevent uptitration of neurohormonal antagonists, and azotaemia can be minimized by decreases in the dose of diuretics or discontinuation of other drugs that can worsen renal function. Increases in serum potassium were not considered actionable until the value exceeded 5.5 mmol/L, and the risk of hyperkalaemia can be mitigated by potassium‐binding agents. 42 Decreases in heart rate produced by beta‐blockers were not regarded as worrisome unless the heart rate declined to < 60 bpm. These strategies were essential to the treatment plan used to achieve target doses in the landmark clinical trials with neurohormonal antagonists. When these strategies are deployed, the highest tolerated subtarget dose yields survival benefits that approximate those produced by target doses. 28 Unfortunately, in clinical practice, asymptomatic hypotension and worsening renal function are important causes of underutilization of evidence‐based treatment. 43

Fifth, many physicians are reluctant to uptitrate drug treatments because they harbour personal fears that patients will not be able to tolerate the next increment in dose. Many physicians believe that medium and target doses are particularly likely to produce intolerable decreases in systolic blood pressure, worsening of renal function, or electrolyte disturbances. However, the most dramatic decreases in blood pressure with inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system and carvedilol are seen with the low starting dose, and subsequent changes in blood pressure with each dosing increment are comparatively modest. Furthermore, most occurrences of worsening of renal function are reflective of changes in intrarenal haemodynamics and not renal injury; and can be mitigated without a change in dosing. 44 Nevertheless, if drugs are not uptitrated because of physician fears, it is not possible to know whether the higher dose would have been well‐tolerated if the patient was not given the opportunity to receive it.

### Meta-analysis: β-blocker dose, heart rate reduction, and death in patients with heart failure [^1137Qd3k]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure receive beta-blockers in doses used in the trials that have proven their efficacy. Although the adverse effects of beta-blockade are dose-related, it is unclear whether the benefits are.

Purpose

To determine whether the survival benefits of beta-blockade in heart failure are associated with the magnitude of heart rate reduction or the beta-blocker dose.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SIGLE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, supplemented by hand-searches of bibliographies.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled heart failure trials that reported all-cause mortality.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, beta-blocker dosing and heart rate reduction, and death.

Data Synthesis

The mean left ventricular ejection fraction in the 23 beta-blocker trials ranged from 0.17 to 0.36, and more than 95% of the 19 209 patients had systolic dysfunction. The overall risk ratio for death was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.84); however, heterogeneity testing revealed moderate heterogeneity among trials (I² = 30%), which was associated with the magnitude of heart rate reduction achieved within each trial (P for meta-regression = 0.006). For every heart rate reduction of 5 beats/min with beta-blocker treatment, a commensurate 18% reduction (CI, 6% to 29%) in the risk for death occurred. No significant relationship between all-cause mortality and beta-blocker dosing was observed (risk ratio for death, 0.74 [CI, 0.64 to 0.86]) in high-dose beta-blocker trials vs. 0.78 [CI, 0.63 to 0.96] in low-dose beta-blocker trials; P for meta-regression = 0.69).

Limitations

The analysis is based on aggregate data and resting heart rates. Few patients in these trials had bradycardia or diastolic dysfunction at baseline.

Conclusion

The magnitude of heart rate reduction is statistically significantly associated with the survival benefit of beta-blockers in heart failure, whereas the dose of beta-blocker is not.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) dosing and titration: To achieve maximal benefits, therapies must be rapidly initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses, and doses higher than those studied in randomized clinical trials are generally not recommended; rapid achievement of target or maximally tolerated doses is the goal, and more than 1 drug may be started and, in certain circumstances, all 4 classes may be started at once. Beta‑blocker doses should be adjusted every 1 to 2 weeks in a patient with no evidence of decompensated HF or contraindications, and for those taking an ARNI, doses can be increased every week with monitoring of kidney function, potassium, and blood pressure; for optimal ARNI titration, lower loop diuretic doses and restriction of supplemental and/or dietary potassium may be necessary.

HFrEF hospitalization — sequencing and dosing during GDMT initiation emphasize practical starting choices and available evidence. For patients with less robust blood pressure, "the first step may be a low dose of an ARB, with a potential switch to sacubitril/valsartan before discharge, once a low dose of beta-blocker has been tolerated (usually starting with metoprolol 6.25 mg twice per day or carvedilol 3.125 mg twice per day)". Evidence on sequence is limited; the historical CIBIS III "demonstrated no difference in overall outcomes… during the first 6 months", whereas "a small trial showed a higher achieved beta-blocker dose, lower heart rate, and greater increase in LVEF at 12 months when beta-blockers were started first". The document notes "The usual strategy aims for addition of all neurohormonal modulatory classes before any up-titration". In the European TRANSITION trial, "similar majorities of patients were on 49/51 mg to 97/103 mg twice-daily doses of sacubitril/valsartan at 10 weeks", regardless of timing relative to discharge, with higher doses in de novo HF, hypertension, and higher starting doses. It also states that U.S. experience shows discharge prescriptions increase maintenance and that "4-pillar GDMT has been shown to decrease recurrent HF events, reverse ventricular remodeling, and extend meaningful survival".

### Why do patients fail to receive β-blockers for chronic heart failure over time? A "real-world" single-center, 2-year follow-up experience of β-blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure [^113x1YBd]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The longitudinal pattern of beta-blocker use in a heart-failure practice setting has not been explored. Previous studies have not specifically addressed the use of beta-blockers over time to determine the rate of use and reasons for discontinuation. The long-term compliance rate for beta-blocker drugs outside the context of a clinical trial has not been established.

Methods

We prospectively followed a cohort of 500 consecutive patients between March and May 2001, with a clinical diagnosis of chronic heart failure seen in a specialized heart failure clinic and determined the longitudinal pattern of beta-blocker use and clinical outcomes over a 2-year period.

Results

The final cohort consists of 340 patients with a complete 2-year follow-up data (mean age 61 ± 14 years, 69% men, 53% with ischemic etiology, mean ejection fraction 27.6 ± 15%). At 6, 12, and 24 months, beta-blocker utilization rates were maintained in 69%, 70%, and 74% of patients, respectively. Of the 120 confirmed initial non-beta-blocker users, 28 (23%) were subsequently started on beta-blocker, despite suspected relative contraindications in 53% of patients. Over a period of 2 years, the discontinuation rate was 10%, with failure to restart a beta-blocker after hospitalization as the most common reason for beta-blocker discontinuation.

Conclusion

Utilization rates of beta-blockers in our heart failure clinic have remained constant at approximately 70% throughout a 2-year follow-up. Of those who discontinued beta-blockers (10%), the most common documented cause was failure to restart beta-blockers after hospitalization.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — initiation and maintenance in chronic heart failure (HF) states that treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual increments in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated, and patients should be monitored closely for changes in vital signs and symptoms during this uptitration period; physicians should ask patients to weigh themselves daily and to manage any increase in weight by immediately increasing the dose of concomitantly administered diuretic until weight is restored to pretreatment levels, and planned increments in the dose of a beta-blocker should be delayed until any side effects observed with lower doses have disappeared; most patients (approximately 85%) enrolled in clinical trials were able to tolerate short- and long-term treatment and achieve the maximum planned trial dose, beta-blockers can be safely started before discharge in patients hospitalized for HF provided they do not require intravenous therapy for HF, clinical responses are generally delayed and may require 2 to 3 months to become apparent, and abrupt withdrawal can lead to clinical deterioration and should be avoided.

Digoxin in acute decompensation and conduction disease — contraindications and cautions specify that digoxin is not indicated as primary therapy for the stabilization of patients with an acute exacerbation of HF symptoms, including fluid retention or hypotension, and such patients should first receive appropriate treatment for HF (usually with intravenous medications); therapy with digoxin may be initiated after stabilization as part of an effort to establish a long-term treatment strategy. Patients should not be given digoxin if they have significant sinus or atrioventricular block, unless the block has been addressed with a permanent pacemaker, and the drug should be used cautiously in patients taking other drugs that can depress sinus or atrioventricular nodal function or affect digoxin levels (e.g., amiodarone or a beta-blocker).

### Β-blocker therapy in heart failure… [^1161D2Bs]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

As the neurohormonal hypothesis emerged, so too did a new understanding of the potential role of β-blockers in heart failure.

Although nominally significant for the outcome of all-cause mortality, P = 0.03 does not meet the higher level of significance established when the primary end point was changed from all-cause mortality to a combined end point of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations. In practical terms, however, the observed 23% reduction in mortality represents a clinically important outcome.

With the emergence of strong new evidence demonstrating that β-blockers decrease morbidity and mortality in a broad range of patients with heart failure, guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, 12 the European Society of Cardiology, 11 and the Heart Failure Society of America10 all strongly support the use of β-blockers in. The science supporting β-blockers must be translated into practice safely and rationally if the agents are to achieve their full potential.

5.1 Cardiac Ischemia after Abrupt Discontinuation

Following abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers, exacerbations of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction have occurred.

When discontinuing chronically administered INNOPRAN XL, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dose over a period of 1–2 weeks and monitor the patients. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, promptly resume therapy, at least temporarily and take other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without physician's advice.

Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abrupt discontinuation of INNOPRAN XL therapy even in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2 Cardiac Failure

Beta-blockers, like INNOPRAN XL, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. If signs or symptoms of heart failure develop, treat the patient according to recommended guidelines. It may be necessary to lower the dose of INNOPRAN XL or to discontinue it.

5.3 Maintain During Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy, including INNOPRAN XL, should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

5.4 Hypoglycemia

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

5.5 Thyrotoxicosis

INNOPRAN XL may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade, which may precipitate a thyroid storm.

5.6 Bradycardia

Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of INNOPRAN XL. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders (including Wolff-Parkinson-White) may be at increased risk. The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil and diltiazem), digoxin or clonidine increases the risk of significant bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving INNOPRAN XL. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop INNOPRAN XL.

### Exchange of β-blockers in heart failure patients. experiences from the poststudy phase of COMET (the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial) [^116dE1gQ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) reported a significant survival benefit for carvedilol, a beta1-, beta2- and alpha1-blocker, vs. metoprolol tartrate, a beta1-selective blocker, in patients with mild-to-severe chronic heart failure (CHF). Patients on treatment with metoprolol might benefit from switching to carvedilol.

Aim

To investigate the safety and tolerability of switching beta-blockers in CHF.

Methods

At the end of COMET, the Steering Committee recommended that study medication was stopped without unblinding, and patients were commenced on open-label beta-blockade at a dose equivalent to half the dose of blinded therapy, with subsequent titration to target or maximum tolerated dose. Patients were followed for 30 days.

Results

1321 out of 1440 patients were transitioned to open-label treatment (76.8% to carvedilol). Serious adverse and CHF-related events were respectively 9.4% and 4.7% in those switching from carvedilol to metoprolol and 3.1% and 1.5% in patients switching from metoprolol to carvedilol. Patients who switched from carvedilol to metoprolol showed the highest mortality or hospitalisation rate (12.3%) in comparison with those who switched from metoprolol to carvedilol (3.1%, p < 0.001) or who stayed on the same drug (carvedilol: 2.5%, p < 0.001; metoprolol: 4.2%, p = 0.04). Reducing the initial dose of the second beta-blocker maximised the safety of this strategy. Event rate was higher in patients with more severe heart failure and in those withdrawing from beta-blockade.

Conclusion

Our data show that switching beta-blockers is a practical, safe and well-tolerated strategy to optimise treatment of CHF. Patients who switched to carvedilol showed the lowest rate of adverse events. A closer clinical monitoring is recommended during transition in high-risk patients.

Ophthalmological agents — topical β-blockers and cholinergic agonists in patients with heart failure (HF) — have reported cardiovascular effects. Several case series and reports with topical β-blockers, primarily timolol, describe clinically significant issues in HF including arrhythmias; in 2 HF patients, topical timolol administration led to an exacerbation of HF symptoms, and discontinuation or dose reduction led to rapid resolution of cardiac side effects. Cholinergic agonists, including cholinesterase inhibitors, have been associated with changes in heart rate including atrioventricular block, but this appears uncommon and this class appears to be the least studied.

### Dosing of β-blocker therapy before, during, and after hospitalization for heart failure (from organized program to initiate lifesaving treatment in hospitalized patients with heart failure) [^1119ia2u]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) guidelines recommend that beta blockers be titrated to achieve the target doses shown to be effective in major clinical trials, if tolerated. Little is known, however, regarding the doses of beta blockers used in patients with HF in routine clinical practice before, during, and after hospitalization for HF. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) enrolled 5,791 patients admitted with HF in a registry with prespecified 60- to 90-day follow-up at 91 academic and community hospitals throughout the United States. Among 2,373 patients with systolic HF eligible for beta blockers at discharge, 1,350 (56.9%) were receiving beta-blocker therapy before admission and continued on therapy, and 632 (26.6%) were newly started. The mean total daily dose for beta blockers before hospital admission was < 1/2 the recommended target dose (carvedilol 21.5 ± 17.8 mg and metoprolol succinate 69.2 ± 51.9 mg), with infrequent up- or down-titration during the HF hospitalization. More than 2/3 of patients had no change in their beta-blocker doses in the first 60 to 90 days after hospital discharge. At 60- to 90-day postdischarge follow-up, only 17.5% and 7.9% of patients were being treated with recommended target doses of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate, respectively. In conclusion, these data reveal that the doses of beta blockers applied in clinical practice are substantially less that the doses achieved in randomized clinical trials in HF and recommended in national guidelines. In the first 60 to 90 days after hospital discharge, little up-titration in beta-blocker dosing occurs. Further efforts are needed to help understand and overcome this beta-blocker titration gap.

### Titration of medical therapy and clinical outcomes among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from the HF-ACTION trial [^111p1KSv]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines recommend titration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and beta-blockers among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to maximally tolerated doses. Patient characteristics associated with dose titration and clinical outcomes subsequent to dose titration remain poorly characterized.

Methods

Among 1999 ambulatory patients with chronic HFrEF in the HF-ACTION trial, use and dosing of ACEi and evidence-based beta-blockers were examined at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with dose escalation (medication initation or dosing increase) or dose de-escalation (medication discontinuation or dosing decrease). Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine associations between dose trajectory group (stable target, stable sub-target, dose escalation, and dose de-escalation) and subsequent mortality and hospitalization outcomes.

Results

For both ACEi and beta-blockers, hospitalization for heart failure in the 6 months prior to enrollment (odds ratio [OR] 2.32 [95% confidence interval 1.58–3.42]) for ACEi; 1.42 [1.05–1.9] for beta-blockers) and higher systolic blood pressure (OR 1.01 [1.00–1.03] per 1 mmHg increase for ACEi; 1.01 [1.00–1.02] for beta-blockers) were associated with dose escalation. Hospitalization 6 months prior to enrollment for any cause (including HF or non-HF causes) was associated with dose de-escalation (OR 1.60 [1.14–2.25] for ACEi; 1.67 [1.20–2.33] for beta-blockers). After adjustment for patient characteristics, compared with stable target dosing, dose de-escalation of either medication was associated with greater all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.64 [1.11–2.42] for ACEi; 1.62 [1.04–2.53] for beta-blockers). Compared with stable target dosing, both dose de-escalation (aHR 1.98 [1.36–2.87]) and stable sub-target dosing (aHR 1.49 [1.18–1.87]) of beta-blockers were associated with greater cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for heart failure.

Conclusions

Among outpatients with chronic HFrEF, patient characteristics including recent hospitalization status and blood pressure were associated with odds of subsequent escalation and de-escalation of ACEi and beta-blocker therapy. Compared with patients receiving guildeline-recommended target doses, dose de-escalation of either medication and sub-target dosing of beta-blockers were associated with greater morbidity and mortality over long-term follow-up.

### Carvedilol [^1162S18P]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Heart Failure/Fluid Retention

Worsening heart failure or fluid retention may occur during up-titration of carvedilol. If such symptoms occur, diuretics should be increased and the carvedilol dose should not be advanced until clinical stability resumes [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Occasionally it is necessary to lower the carvedilol dose or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol. In a placebo-controlled trial of subjects with severe heart failure, worsening heart failure during the first 3 months was reported to a similar degree with carvedilol and with placebo. When treatment was maintained beyond 3 months, worsening heart failure was reported less frequently in subjects treated with carvedilol than with placebo. Worsening heart failure observed during long-term therapy is more likely to be related to the patients' underlying disease than to treatment with carvedilol.

5.5 Non-allergic Bronchospasm

Patients with bronchospastic disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) should, in general, not receive β-blockers. Carvedilol tablets may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive agents. It is prudent, if carvedilol tablets are used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous β-agonists is minimized.

In clinical trials of subjects with heart failure, subjects with bronchospastic disease were enrolled if they did not require oral or inhaled medication to treat their bronchospastic disease. In such patients, it is recommended that carvedilol be used with caution. The dosing recommendations should be followed closely and the dose should be lowered if any evidence of bronchospasm is observed during up-titration.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide (Lopressor HCT) [^114KeRfL]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta adrenergic blockers, exacerbations of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction may occur. When discontinuing chronically administered LOPRESSOR HCT, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly resume therapy and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol tartrate in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2 Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of beta-blockers. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol tartrate or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of metoprolol tartrate.

5.3 Bronchospastic Disease

Beta adrenergic blockers can cause bronchospasm. Patients with bronchospastic diseases should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Because of its relative beta1cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol tartrate may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol tartrate and have bronchodilators (e.g., beta2-agonists) readily available or administered concomitantly.

5.000000000000000e+00 4 Bradycardia

Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of LOPRESSOR HCT. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, conduction disorders (including Wolff-Parkinson-White) or on concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)] that cause bradycardia may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving LOPRESSOR HCT. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop LOPRESSOR HCT.

### Titration to target dose of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure: the CIBIS-ELD trial [^113WZs2m]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Pharmacological differences and pulmonary function

Beta-blockers are frequently not up-titrated or even withheld for fear of bronchoconstriction.

In this trial carvedilol was associated with more pulmonary adverse events than bisoprolol and with a reduction of FEV₁, which is in line with its pharmacodynamic properties. Incidence of pulmonary adverse events was nonetheless moderate in both groups. In contrast to pre-existing opinions, neither these adverse events nor the reduction in FEV 1 with carvedilol were a significant limitation for up-titration. Furthermore, the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which was the most powerful independent predictor of beta-blocker underutilization in the EuroHeart Failure Survey, was not predictive of less ability to titrate dose upwards in our trial. In a study that looked specifically at heart failure patients with COPD receiving bisoprolol or placebo, bisoprolol was associated with a 5% reduction in FEV₁. However, this did not cause pulmonary symptoms or impair QoL.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^115Wmqtv]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Each of the criteria proposed in the table deserves thought and deliberation, particularly with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. Since not all beta‐blockers reduce mortality, the only members of the drug class that warrant inclusion in stratum I are those that have been specifically shown to reduce mortality in large‐scale trials. Furthermore, analyses of these trials have raised important questions about the ability of beta‐blockers to prolong survival in patients with atrial fibrillation, 48 potentially because the target doses used in the pivotal trials may have caused excessive slowing of the ventricular response, which predisposed to fatal bradyarrhythmic events. 49 Consequently, patients with atrial fibrillation who are treated with a beta‐blocker are assigned to stratum I with no designated target heart rate, since heart rates of 80–90 bpm may be appropriate targets for the use of beta‐blockers if patients have atrial fibrillation. 50

### Effects of initiating carvedilol in patients with severe chronic heart failure: results from the COPERNICUS study [^111PWB3u]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Beta-blockers remain underused despite their established utility for improving outcome in heart failure. Concerns that initiation of treatment produces few immediate benefits and may have important risks may be deterring widespread use.

Objective

To evaluate the early effects of the beta-blocker carvedilol in patients with severe heart failure.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from October 28, 1997, to March 20, 2000, at 334 hospital centers in 21 countries among 2289 patients with symptoms of heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion who were clinically euvolemic and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 25%.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive carvedilol, with start dosage of at 3.125 mg twice daily with uptitration to a target dosage of 25 mg twice daily (n = 1156), or placebo (n = 1133), in addition to their usual medications for heart failure.

Main Outcome Measures

Death, hospitalization, or permanent withdrawal from study drug, as well as adverse events during the first 8 weeks of treatment.

Results

The carvedilol group experienced no increase in cardiovascular risk but instead had fewer patients who died (19 vs 25; hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41–1.35); who died or were hospitalized (134 vs 153; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.67–1.07); or who died, were hospitalized, or were permanently withdrawn from treatment (162 vs 188; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68–1.03). These effects were similar in direction and magnitude to those observed during the entire study, and were apparent particularly in the 624 patients with recent or recurrent decompensation or a very depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Differences in favor of carvedilol became apparent as early as 14 to 21 days following initiation of treatment. Worsening heart failure was the only serious adverse event with a frequency greater than 2% and was reported with similar frequency in the placebo and carvedilol groups (6.4% vs 5.1%).

Conclusions

These data suggest that, in clinically euvolemic patients, the relation of benefit to risk during initiation of treatment with carvedilol is similar to that seen during long-term therapy with the drug. Our findings should provide the reassurance needed to encourage the high levels of use that are warranted by the results of long-term clinical trials.

### Benefits of inpatient initiation of β-blockers [^111omfeZ]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that beta-blockers effectively reduce mortality in patients after a myocardial infarction (MI) and in patients with chronic heart failure. Treatment guidelines recommend that all patients after MI without a contraindication receive early beta-blocker treatment. Initiation of beta-blockers also should be considered for stable patients who are hospitalized with heart failure. Despite well-documented benefits, however, beta-blockers are still underused. Barriers that cause reluctance by physicians to initiate therapy include the traditional belief that beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, complexity of management, perceived risk of adverse events, and potential for short-term clinical deterioration. Intervention programs promoting beta-blockers for inpatients have increased their use at discharge and after long-term follow-up. Because of pharmacologic differences, agent selection is also critical. Agents must have proven clinical efficacy, an established dose-titration regimen, and desirable pharmacokinetic properties. Increasing the use of these life-saving agents has the potential for substantial clinical impact.

### How to handle polypharmacy in heart failure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^1157xMnw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

In this scientific statement document, we propose a deprescribing protocol including five steps (Figure 1):
To review and reconcile all drugs the patient is currently taking, the underlying indications and whether there is current or past history of non‐adherence.
To consider the risk of drug‐induced harm in individual patients: medication‐related factors to consider include known ADRs, drug–drug or drug–disease interactions, and polypharmacy.
To assess each drug regarding its current or future expected benefit or harm, or the likelihood of being particularly burdensome (i.e. for instance big tablets difficult to swallow, treatments needing repetitive monitoring, etc.).
To prioritize for discontinuation drugs that have the lowest benefit–harm ratio, the lowest likelihood of adverse withdrawal reactions or disease rebound syndromes, and are easy to withdraw. Attention should be paid to patient preferences.
To implement a discontinuation regimen and closely monitor patients to early identify the results of the intervention. Slow tapering over time may be required for some agents associated with increased risk for an adverse drug withdrawal event. These events may include a relapse of symptoms as a result of the withdrawal, or a physiological withdrawal such as rebound tachycardia after discontinuation of beta‐blockers or an increase in blood pressure after discontinuation of anti‐hypertensive agents. Practical application of these recommendations can be apparently difficult and not immediate in routine care.

Responsibility of therapy revision should not belong to one specific healthcare provider. Multidisciplinary discussion and mutual support in the decision‐making and in the process of deprescribing are priorities. Together with the HF physician in charge, specialized HF nurses and pharmacists are of value in the management of every step of this process.

Figure 1
Multidomain approach for managing polypharmacy in heart failure (HF). Reconciliation of treatments and periodical assessment of therapeutic appropriateness follow multistep and multidisciplinary processes, which should consider patient and drug characteristics. Periodical review of these aspects is pivotal. When the possibility and need of deprescribing is ascertained, the deprescribing protocol represents a point‐by‐point guide that can support physicians' decisions. Alternatives to definitive deprescribing (i.e. represcribing/replacement, variation in the way of administration) should be always evaluated. CV, cardiovascular.

4.2 up‐titration

Only about 10% of patients reached target doses of beta‐blockers. Regardless of reason for not up‐titrating, and consistently with previous findings, patients who had lower heart rate and those with more severe congestion were less likely to be up‐titrated to target doses. 8, 22, 41 As for ACEi/ARBs, this finding may be explained by clinicians' prior concern about the safety of beta‐blockers in patients with lower heart rate and congestion. As for ACEi/ARBs, in the present analysis, we observed low rates of adverse events (e.g. bradycardia and hypotension) associated with the prospective up‐titration of beta‐blockers. 4, 5 In the Carvedilol produces Dose‐related Improvements in Left Ventricular Function and Survival in subjects with chronic Heart Failure (MOCHA) trial comparing high‐, medium‐, and low‐dose carvedilol in 345 patients with chronic HF, higher doses of carvedilol were associated with higher incidence of bradycardia, but without compromising the benefit of high‐dose carvedilol. 4 It should be noted, however, that in MOCHA, the majority of patients (> 90%) received digitalis, which may increase dose‐dependent incidence rate of bradycardia in combination with beta‐blockers. 42 A more recent report showed no association between beta‐blocker dose and bradycardia, which is in line with our findings. 5 Also, data from large‐scale registries showed that older age, lower heart rate, decreased quality of life and/or female sex were associated with increased risk of adverse events. 8, 22 However, in our report, there was no significant difference in rate of adverse events in each high‐risk subgroup, irrespective of the reason of not up‐titrating to target doses. These findings suggest again that physicians may be concerned about the likelihood of drug intolerance in high‐risk HF patients, consequently triggering therapeutic inertia.

Finally, they should be counseled to not stop taking a β-blocker abruptly without discussing the change with their clinician. should be instructed about the most common adverse effects, which can arise in virtually any patient if the dosage of β-blocker is too high or escalated too rapidly.

Patients should be provided with an educational handout that they can review at home and advised to contact the clinician immediately if symptoms develop.

Practical use of beta-blockers — risks of treatment: fatigue states that treatment with a beta-blocker can be accompanied by feelings of general fatigue or weakness, the sense of lassitude resolves spontaneously within several weeks without treatment in many cases but in some patients may be severe enough to limit increments in dose or require the withdrawal of treatment; complaints of fatigue can generally be managed by a reduction in the dose of the beta-blocker (or the accompanying diuretic), but treatment should be discontinued if the syndrome of weakness is accompanied by evidence of peripheral hypoperfusion, and reinitiation at a later time or with a different effective beta-blocker may be successful.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^116YkoAe]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Does the safety of each drug depend on background therapy?

In contrast to the lack of an interaction with respect to measures of efficacy, there is considerable evidence that background therapy can influence the safety and tolerability of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction.

The use of diuretics exerts a significant effect on the safety of neurohormonal antagonists. Treatment with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers is frequently accompanied by early hypotension as well as meaningful worsening of renal function. These effects are related to inhibition of the systemic and intrarenal effects of angiotensin II, and are particularly notable in patients receiving high doses or longer‐acting agents. Yet, the severity of both reactions can be ameliorated by a decrease in the dose of concomitantly administered diuretics. A reduction in the dose of diuretics may also ameliorate the hypotensive response to angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibition. Conversely, initiation of treatment with a beta‐blocker is often accompanied by fluid retention, which can lead to worsening heart failure during 1–2 weeks, particularly in patients with advanced symptoms. Intensification of concomitantly administered diuretics — either prior to initiation of treatment or expeditiously in response to increases in body weight — can mitigate the early increase in heart failure events. Accordingly, even though the COPERNICUS trial enrolled patients with severe heart failure, a protocol directive to intensify diuretics to ensure clinical euvolaemia prevented the early increased risk of worsening heart failure, an adverse event that was seen in the large‐scale beta‐blocker trials that did not mandate a pre‐emptive diuretic intensification strategy.,

Initiation of treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a neprilysin inhibitor and carvedilol can produce meaningful decreases in systolic blood pressure, which can be symptomatic in some patients. This reaction typically dissipates with repeated exposure to the same dose, even in the absence of changes in concomitant therapy, presumably as a result of circulatory adaptions. For these reasons, treatment with these drugs is typically initiated in low doses, and doses are increased when the tolerability of prescribed doses has been established in individual patients. Although it can be hypothesized that sacubitril/valsartan might produce greater decreases in blood pressure in patients treated with carvedilol, there is little clinical experience to support this concern in patients whose blood pressure has been stable while receiving long‐term treatment with carvedilol.
