## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an overview of concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens in head and neck cancers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the strength of evidence supporting concurrent chemoradiation. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care regimen and its dosing and fractionation. Next, I will examine validated alternatives for cisplatin-ineligible patients, followed by a careful review of induction chemotherapy and its role. After that, I need to check fractionation strategies and their interaction with concurrent chemotherapy. I will then consider special populations and toxicity mitigation, including HPV-positive disease and older adults. Finally, I should review emerging data on immunotherapy integration, summarize the evidence hierarchy, and close with practical implementation pearls and a concise synthesis of options by patient fitness and subsite, making sure I anchor each point to high-quality guidelines and pivotal trials throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the strength of evidence for concurrent chemoradiation. Concurrent chemoradiation is the standard nonsurgical curative approach for most patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, with randomized trials and meta-analyses demonstrating improvements in overall survival, disease-free survival, and locoregional control versus radiotherapy alone, and this benefit is largely driven by enhanced locoregional control rather than systemic eradication of micrometastases, which remains a limitation of this strategy [^111CSRpc] [^113cNttk] [^111LqRmw].

> I need to verify the standard regimen details. The most studied and preferred platform is conventional fractionation radiotherapy to 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks with concurrent high-dose cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 21 days for 2–3 cycles, typically on days 1, 22, and 43, delivered by an experienced multidisciplinary team with robust supportive care. This is a category 1 recommendation in NCCN and is supported by multiple randomized trials and long-term follow-up data [^116RT2BZ] [^111477Ce] [^111CSRpc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cisplatin dosing schedules. I initially thought weekly cisplatin might be broadly interchangeable, but I should double-check the evidence. Weekly cisplatin at 40 mg/m2 is an accepted alternative, particularly when toxicity mitigation is needed, yet level I evidence and guideline consensus still favor high-dose every-3-week cisplatin; randomized and pooled analyses suggest noninferiority of weekly regimens in some contexts, but bolus cisplatin remains the reference standard in definitive and postoperative settings, with meta-analytic data indicating that cumulative cisplatin exposure around 200 mg/m2 is a pragmatic minimum for optimal oncologic effect [^111477Ce] [^117J7FJ2] [^115Yumvs].

> Next, I should review options for patients who cannot receive cisplatin. Carboplatin-based regimens, often paired with paclitaxel or 5-FU, are reasonable alternatives. Observational and comparative data suggest carboplatin chemoradiation yields outcomes comparable to cisplatin in some cohorts and superior to cetuximab-based chemoradiation in cisplatin-ineligible patients, though prospective head-to-head randomized data are limited and cetuximab with radiotherapy is generally inferior to cisplatin-based chemoradiation in contemporary phase III trials [^115SWnUN] [^1128RdzP] [^115r721k].

> Let me consider induction chemotherapy carefully, because I need to ensure I do not overstate its role. Induction with TPF improves response rates and may reduce distant metastases, and it has a validated role in larynx-preservation strategies, but randomized trials have not consistently demonstrated an overall survival advantage when added before concurrent chemoradiation, so induction remains a category 3 option in many sites and should be reserved for selected patients and experienced centers. If used, TPF is preferred, and after induction, weekly carboplatin or low-dose weekly cisplatin are reasonable concurrent partners to mitigate cumulative toxicity [^117VCNUD] [^116afzSh] [^112o4Bvg].

> I will now examine fractionation strategies and their interaction with concurrent chemotherapy. Accelerated or altered fractionation improves locoregional control and, in some analyses, survival compared with conventional fractionation when used without chemotherapy, but when combined with concurrent cisplatin, randomized data such as RTOG 0129 and GORTEC 99–02 show no superiority of accelerated over conventional fractionation, and accelerated regimens increase acute mucosal toxicity; therefore, conventional fractionation with cisplatin remains the reference, with altered fractionation reserved for select scenarios or trials [^116FmDYP] [^1111owRe] [^1177qK9G].

> But wait, what about HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer and deintensification. I should confirm that cisplatin-based chemoradiation remains preferred even in HPV-positive disease, as randomized trials demonstrate superior survival with cisplatin plus radiotherapy compared with cetuximab plus radiotherapy, and ongoing efforts to deintensify therapy must preserve efficacy while reducing toxicity; in older adults, observational data suggest that adding concurrent chemotherapy, particularly platinum-based, improves survival, whereas adding cetuximab does not, reinforcing the primacy of platinum radiosensitization when tolerated [^115r721k] [^116uax4F] [^1166tB5W].

> I need to check toxicity mitigation and practical implementation. High-dose cisplatin increases acute mucositis, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity, and more than a quarter of patients may not complete the third cycle; strategies include proactive antiemetics, hydration, audiometry, and consideration of weekly cisplatin or carboplatin-based alternatives in borderline patients, with supportive care pathways and experienced teams essential to maintain dose intensity and safety [^116RT2BZ] [^115Yumvs] [^112LXymh].

> Next, I should review emerging data on immunotherapy integration, and I must be cautious not to overinterpret early signals. Concurrent PD-1/L1 blockade with chemoradiation has not improved outcomes in large randomized studies to date, and in some trials has numerically worsened survival, whereas sequential strategies starting immunotherapy shortly after chemoradiation are under active investigation; thus, outside trials, immunotherapy should not replace platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation in fit patients [^111FQT4W] [^111m2m9a].

> Let me synthesize the evidence hierarchy to ensure internal consistency. Category 1 standards include high-dose cisplatin every 3 weeks with conventional fractionation radiotherapy for definitive and postoperative high-risk settings, with carboplatin/5-FU as an alternative category 1 option in select contexts; weekly cisplatin and carboplatin/paclitaxel are category 2B alternatives; induction chemotherapy is category 3 outside larynx-preservation settings; and altered fractionation with concurrent chemotherapy is reasonable but not clearly superior to conventional fractionation with cisplatin in randomized trials [^117QLoFz] [^116Kwg54] [^113dVA58].

> I should confirm practical pearls that change outcomes. Treatment should start within 6 weeks after surgery when adjuvant chemoradiation is indicated, target volumes should be planned with IMRT or proton when constraints are limiting, and PET-CT response assessment 12–16 weeks after chemoradiation guides the need for neck dissection. Reirradiation with concurrent platinum is an option in carefully selected patients using advanced techniques, and enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged for deintensification, intensification, and novel radiosensitizer strategies [^116Eu5S9] [^116RT2BZ] [^115MmeWP] [^111U9b5U].

> Finally, let me reconsider the regimen selection by patient fitness and tumor factors to ensure completeness. For fit patients with PS 0–1, high-dose cisplatin every 3 weeks with conventional fractionation is preferred. For cisplatin-ineligible patients, carboplatin-based regimens or weekly cisplatin are reasonable, with cetuximab reserved for select circumstances given inferior outcomes versus cisplatin. For HPV-positive disease, cisplatin remains preferred over cetuximab. For older adults, age alone is not a contraindication, and platinum-based concurrent therapy improves survival compared with radiotherapy alone. For nasopharyngeal carcinoma, concurrent cisplatin with or without induction and adjuvant chemotherapy is standard, with gemcitabine/cisplatin or TPF favored for induction in EBV-associated disease [^117QLoFz] [^115r721k] [^1166tB5W] [^112bEiEw].

Concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) is the **standard of care** for locally advanced head and neck cancers, with **high-dose cisplatin every 3 weeks** (100 mg/m², 2–3 cycles) plus conventional fractionation (70 Gy in 35 fractions) as the preferred regimen [^111CSRpc] [^116RT2BZ]. This approach improves locoregional control and overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone, but increases acute toxicity; therefore, careful patient selection and supportive care are essential [^113cNttk] [^116Ng5fH]. For cisplatin-ineligible patients, **carboplatin/paclitaxel or cetuximab with radiotherapy** are alternatives, though cisplatin remains superior when feasible [^116uax4F] [^117QLoFz]. Weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m²) is a reasonable option when standard dosing is not tolerated, but evidence is less robust [^117J7FJ2] [^115Yumvs]. CRT is not recommended for poor performance status or significant comorbidities due to toxicity [^117QLoFz] [^116Ng5fH].

## Standard concurrent chemoradiation regimens

Key characteristics of standard concurrent cisplatin regimens:

| **Aspect** | **High-dose cisplatin every 3 weeks** | **Weekly cisplatin** |
|-|-|-|
| Regimen | Cisplatin 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks (days 1, 22, 43) with conventional fractionation radiotherapy (70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks) [^111CSRpc] [^116RT2BZ] | Cisplatin 40 mg/m² weekly with conventional fractionation radiotherapy [^117QLoFz] |
| Evidence | Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show improved locoregional control and overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone [^113cNttk] [^111CSRpc] | Non-inferior to high-dose cisplatin in some studies; better tolerated in patients with comorbidities or older age [^115Yumvs] |
| Toxicity or limitations | Higher rates of acute mucositis, hematologic toxicity, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity; requires aggressive supportive care [^116Ng5fH] | Less robust evidence; may be less effective in high-risk patients (e.g. extracapsular extension) [^117J7FJ2] |

## Alternative concurrent chemoradiation regimens

### Carboplatin-based regimens

Carboplatin plus paclitaxel is used for patients who cannot tolerate cisplatin, with **evidence** from retrospective and prospective studies showing comparable efficacy to cisplatin in selected patients [^notfound]. Carboplatin plus 5-FU is another option, particularly in the **postoperative setting**, with evidence from randomized trials demonstrating improved locoregional control and disease-free survival compared with radiotherapy alone [^notfound].

---

### Cetuximab-based regimens

Cetuximab plus radiotherapy is indicated for patients who cannot receive platinum-based chemotherapy, with randomized trials demonstrating improved locoregional control and overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone. However, it is **inferior to cisplatin-based regimens** in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers [^116uax4F] [^115r721k].

---

## Toxicity and supportive care

CRT increases acute toxicity — especially mucositis, dysphagia, hematologic toxicity, and fatigue — compared with radiotherapy alone [^116Ng5fH]. Supportive care, including **aggressive hydration, antiemetics, growth factors, and nutritional support**, is essential to maintain treatment intensity and patient compliance [^116RT2BZ].

---

## Patient selection criteria

CRT is recommended for patients with **good performance status (ECOG 0–1)** and without significant comorbidities. It is not recommended for patients with poor performance status, significant renal impairment, or cardiovascular disease due to increased toxicity and limited benefit [^117QLoFz].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

- **Immunotherapy**: Trials exploring concurrent or sequential immune checkpoint inhibitors with CRT are ongoing, but current evidence does not support routine use of immunotherapy with CRT in locally advanced HNSCC [^111m2m9a] [^1132MWsS].
- **Personalized medicine**: Biomarker-driven approaches, including HPV status and genetic profiling, are being investigated to tailor CRT regimens and minimize toxicity [^115xTXwE].
- **Deintensification**: In HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers, efforts to reduce treatment intensity while maintaining efficacy are being explored, but definitive guidelines are still evolving [^116FmDYP].

---

Concurrent chemoradiation is the **standard of care** for locally advanced head and neck cancers, with high-dose cisplatin every 3 weeks plus conventional fractionation radiotherapy as the preferred regimen. Alternative regimens, such as weekly cisplatin, carboplatin-based combinations, or cetuximab with radiotherapy, are considered for patients unable to tolerate standard cisplatin-based therapy. CRT improves locoregional control and overall survival but increases acute toxicity, necessitating careful patient selection and supportive care.

Extracapsular extension with concurrent chemoradiation — cisplatin regimen choice is informed by a phase II randomized comparison of bolus cisplatin versus weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m2 in which the vast majority were postoperative (93%) with an oral cavity tumor (91%), and more than 90% had extracapsular extension; bolus cisplatin was associated with more high-grade toxicity but produced a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in locoregional control (15%), and therefore bolus cisplatin remains the evidence-driven choice for concurrent chemotherapy in patients with extracapsular extension and platinum eligibility; nevertheless, the panel notes guidance that "concurrent weekly cisplatin may be delivered with postoperative radiotherapy to patients who are considered inappropriate for standard high-dose intermittent cisplatin after a careful discussion of patient preferences and the limited evidence supporting this treatment schedule", that several trials are using weekly cisplatin-based regimens (RTOG 1216 and NRG HN-003), and that it "strongly endorses enrollment in clinical trials" for novel nonplatinum-based regimens when comorbidity leads to cisplatin contraindication.

### Current treatments and promising investigations in a multidisciplinary setting [^112d8gp8]. Annals of Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

The care of the patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) requires a multidisciplinary approach. For many years, radiotherapy following surgery was considered the standard approach to the treatment of locally advanced resectable disease. Data from randomized trials have confirmed the benefits of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy) in this setting and this is now the gold standard for treatment. Chemoradiotherapy is also the recommended approach for unresectable disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been useful in resectable disease where organ preservation is desirable, but a concomitant approach is superior. Although survival benefits have not been consistently demonstrated, the theoretical potential of this approach has lead to continued investigations using newer agents, such as the taxanes. Novel targeted agents, such as antagonists of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are showing promise in the treatment of patients with both locally advanced and recurrent/metastatic SCCHN. Treatment issues that require immediate attention include identifying optimal chemoradiotherapy regimens, clarifying the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, defining the optimal integration of targeted therapies into combined modality approaches and identifying useful prognostic and predictive factors.

### ARTSCAN III: a randomized phase III study comparing chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin versus cetuximab in patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer [^116CUuF3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with advanced stage T3-T4 primary tumors have a worse prognosis compared with lower T stages, and accelerated RT, resulting in a higher biologically effective dose, has been shown to be more beneficial in the treatment of more advanced tumors. The efficacy of dose escalation to 73.1 Gy to the primary tumor was a secondary objective of this study. The prematurely stopped inclusion in the trial prevents this analysis.

Regarding treatment intensity, 44% of the patients in the current study received reduced doses of cisplatin because of toxicity, whereas the corresponding figure in the cetuximab group was 32%. Many previous studies have reported that cisplatin, when administered at 100 mg/m 2 every third week, causes hematologic, renal, and hearing toxicity and that dose reductions have been common. Consequently, lower weekly doses have been presented as an alternativeand were used in our study. A cumulative cisplatin dose of 200 mg/m 2 has often been regarded to be needed to obtain effect of the concurrent treatment. This dose was only achieved in 48% of our patients. In spite of this, there was a clear benefit in recurrence-free survival for concurrent cisplatin.

In early reports, cetuximab toxicity was reported to be lower compared with cisplatin. This finding has not been confirmed in later studies. The toxicity profiles differ between the study drugs, which makes the comparisons of their impact more delicate. However, by estimation with the TAME method, the toxicity burden of concurrent cetuximab appears to be similar to that of concurrent cisplatin in our study.

In summary, this randomized phase III study comparing concurrent cisplatin with concurrent cetuximab in patients with locally advanced HNSCC showed a significantly better locoregional control with concurrent cisplatin, which should remain the standard treatment for patients with p16-positive or p16-negative HNSCC.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 — Head and Neck Cancers — induction chemotherapy efficacy: In squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), three-drug induction with taxane plus cisplatin and 5‑FU (docetaxel/cisplatin/5‑FU [TPF]) showed significantly improved outcomes versus cisplatin/5‑FU, and a meta-analysis of five RCTs (N = 1772) found reduced risk of death (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.63–0.83; P < .001), progression (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.69–0.87; P < .001), locoregional failure (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66–0.94; p = 0.007), and distant failure (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45–0.89; p = 0.009), with a randomized phase III trial also showing superior larynx preservation with induction TPF; however, whether adding induction chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiation results in a clear overall survival advantage is unclear, and the DeCIDE and PARADIGM phase III trials did not show a survival advantage, although a randomized phase II study reported a higher radiologic complete response rate with induction TPF and follow-up suggests a survival advantage.

### Phase II study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [^112G3Mee]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Oral mucositis and myelosuppression are the most serious complications of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for SCCHN, resulting in a reduced compliance to treatment or sometimes mortality. In the present study, mucositis was the most common adverse effect observed, with a grade 3 or 4 intensity in 67.6% of the patients. In a randomised study by, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis in concurrent chemoradiotherapy with 5-FU and cisplatin was 71%, which was higher than with radiotherapy only (39%). The incidence of mucositis was not so different between chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine/cisplatin and 5-FU/cisplatin. Meanwhile, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred only in two patients (5.4%), plus grade 3 febrile neutropenia was observed in patient (2.7%) in the current study. These incidences of haematologic toxicities were significantly different from previous studies using 5-FU-containing regimens, where the incidence of grade 3 or 4 leukopenia was 29–81%. Recently, taxanes, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, which exhibit activity against SCCHN, are being increasingly used for concurrent chemoradiotherapy to improve the treatment outcome.reported that concomitant infusional paclitaxel and fluorouracil, oral hydroxyurea, and radiation therapy achieved a clinical CR rate of 69%, 3-year locoregional control rate of 86%, and 3-year overall survival rate of 60% in patients with locally advanced SCCHN. Thus, when considering the high percentage of patients with a T4 and N2/3 disease in this study, the locoregional control rate and overall survival seemed to be promising. However, 34% of the patients experienced grade 3 or 4 leukopenia, and two patients (3%) died of treatment-related toxicities. Therefore, taxane-based regimens should be tested in a randomised trial and compared with a less intensive concurrent regimen.

In conclusion, concurrent chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine and cisplatin was found to be well tolerated and effective in patients with locally advanced SCCHN. Accordingly, this regimen can be regarded as an important chemoradiotherapy option for advanced HNSCC, although long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the late treatment failure and complications.

### Chemotherapy in the management of squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck [^113uuZyt]. The Lancet: Oncology (2001). Medium credibility.

Previously reserved for palliation, chemotherapy is now also a central component of several curative approaches to the management of patients with advanced-stage head and neck cancer. Here we review the results of both induction chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy trials in patients with curable disease, and chemotherapy trials in patients with recurrent and metastatic disease, and we highlight current areas of investigation. Compared with traditional treatment modalities, chemotherapy given on induction schedules to patients with advanced laryngeal cancer allows greater organ preservation without compromise to survival; when given concomitantly with radiotherapy to patients with resectable or unresectable advanced disease, chemotherapy again improves survival.

### Weekly versus 3-weekly cisplatin along with radiotherapy for locoregionally advanced non-nasopharyngeal head and neck cancers: is the equipoise in literature addressed yet? [^117CjzTY]. Head & Neck (2023). Medium credibility.

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with 3-weekly cisplatin 100mg/m 2 has been the standard of care for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer (LA-HNC) with level I evidence. While the outcomes in terms of efficacy have been well established, the toxicity profile, compliance, and real-world applicability has been an area of ongoing concern for this regimen, leading the oncologists to explore weekly cisplatin chemoradiotherapy regimen to potentially address the issue. A review of literature was conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, and Medline to compare and evaluate the present role of weekly cisplatin chemotherapy along with radiotherapy versus 3-weekly cisplatin chemotherapy along with radiotherapy in both adjuvant and definitive settings for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancers. Nasopharyngeal subsites were excluded from the literature review and 50 relevant articles were included in the analysis. Recently published evidences of noninferiority of weekly over 3-weekly cisplatin chemoradiotherapy regimen in definitive as well as adjuvant settings in locoregionally advanced head and neck cancers is highlighted and interpreted. Results supporting and against the above in different publications is elaborated in this article. Trials designed to demonstrate noninferiority of the weekly cisplatin chemoradiotherapy regimen over 3-weekly regimen, especially in definitive setting may conclude the debate in future. A lacunae in the existing literature is noted in the form of lack of superiority trials on the above topic, which may impact future conclusions.

### Intensive concurrent chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer with 5-fluorouracil-and hydroxyurea-based regimens: reversing a pattern of failure [^116rp1Ki]. The Oncologist (2003). Low credibility.

Combined modality programs that were developed over the past two decades demonstrated that the nonsurgical therapy of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer is feasible and produces survival outcomes that are at least comparable with surgery. The systemic therapy of head and neck cancer has gained momentum in recent years. Several randomized studies have shown that the concurrent administration of chemotherapy and radiation therapy is superior to radiation therapy alone. In consecutive clinical studies since 1986, we have developed multiagent chemoradiotherapy regimens based on initial observations with the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), hydroxyurea, and concomitant radiotherapy combination. Three consecutive multicenter phase II trials reported that the combination of 5-FU and hydroxyurea with either cisplatin or paclitaxel along with twice daily radiation therapy administered every other week is a highly effective regimen with local control rates that approach 90% and 3-year survival rates of approximately 60% in patients with stage IV disease. The vast majority of patients in these studies achieved anatomical organ preservation. A reversal of the historical pattern of failure was evident, with distant sites becoming the predominant site of failure in each trial. The paclitaxel-containing regimen was better tolerated than the cisplatin-containing regimen and was advanced to further clinical testing. The incorporation of induction chemotherapy may improve the results of treatment by targeting systemic micrometastatic disease.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary, more specifically with respect to primary radiotherapy, ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend to administer primary radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with carcinoma of unknown primary, targeting gross nodal disease, neck regions at risk for microscopic disease, and anatomic mucosal regions at risk for harboring the occult primary. Tailor specific treatment volumes based on the clinicopathologic presentation after a complete workup.

### Alteration of radiotherapy fractionation and concurrent chemotherapy: a new frontier in head and neck oncology? [^113Gq37q]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Despite recent advances in multimodality management of patients with stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the prognosis in these patients remains disappointing. In an attempt to improve treatment outcome, several teams recently investigated the role of altered fractionation radiotherapy in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy. The controlled trials that investigated this combined approach indicate that, although the magnitude of its effect was less marked for survival indices than for local-regional control, the addition of chemotherapy to altered fractionation regimens results in a clear improvement for these endpoints compared with hyperfractionated or accelerated regimens alone. The key challenge now is to optimize the synergism of these regimens in order to increase their therapeutic ratio in terms of both local-regional and systemic outcomes. This review is a critical appraisal of the real opportunities offered by the application of treatments aimed at increasing the dose intensity of radiotherapy delivered concurrently with cytotoxic drugs.

### Non-cisplatin concurrent agents plus definitive radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer: a network meta-analysis of randomized studies [^113ivnKq]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) poses a significant clinical challenge, particularly in its locally advanced stages. Cisplatin-based, definitive, chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is recognized as the preferred treatment strategy, providing substantial survival benefits and currently achieving the best locoregional control (LRC). However, the toxicity profile of cisplatin, which includes nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity, restricts its application in patients with comorbidities or those of advanced age. Emerging alternatives such as carboplatin, taxanes, cetuximab, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are gaining attention. This study undertakes a network meta-analysis (NMA) to assess the effectiveness and safety of these agents in conjunction with definitive RT.

Methods

The inclusion criteria targeted definitive RT in conjunction with non-cisplatin systemic therapies, compared to RT with or without cisplatin in adult HNSCC patients. The outcomes evaluated included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and locoregional control (LRC). Statistical methodologies, including the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA), were employed to rank the treatment protocols.

Results

The analysis incorporated 29 randomized controlled trials assessing 18 treatment modalities. Three cisplatin-based regimens combined with RT consistently demonstrated superior efficacy in OS, ranking as the 3 most effective option for OS, followed by weekly docetaxel combined with RT. Non-cisplatin alternatives such as mitomycin C-based regimens + RT, and methotrexate + RT, demonstrated promising efficacy. For PFS, they ranked first and second, with SUCRA scores of 83% and 79%, respectively. Regarding LRC, mitomycin C-based regimens + RT and weekly docetaxel + RT emerged as the top two options, achieving SUCRA scores of 97% and 93%, respectively. Cetuximab and ICIs combined with RT ranked lowest across all assessed outcomes.

Conclusion

While cisplatin remains the standard of care, carboplatin, mitomycin C-based, and weekly docetaxel + RT regimens present viable alternatives as concurrent agents during RT for patients with stage III-IV HNSCC who are not eligible for cisplatin. It is imperative to develop tailored treatment strategies to enhance clinical outcomes.

### Weekly cisplatin cycles and outcomes for chemoradiation in head and neck cancer [^115Yumvs]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline recommends high-dose cisplatin delivered every 3 weeks as a category 1, preferred concurrent chemotherapy option for definitive chemoradiation among patients with head and neck cancer. However, more than one-quarter of patients could not receive the third cycle in a recent meta-analysis, as well as in the RTOG 0129 trial. Given that there were no statistically significant differences in outcomes between receiving 2 vs 3 cycles total, 200 mg/m 2 was suggested as a minimum cumulative dose to be effective for optimal oncologic outcomes.

As an alternative regimen, weekly cisplatin was also recommended for consideration by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline. Although both cisplatin schedules have been shown to have comparable locoregional control and survival outcomes in a recent meta-analysis, the rate of cisplatin interruptions has been shown to be similar regardless of cisplatin schedules. However, there is a paucity of literature regarding the impact of different levels of adherence to weekly cisplatin on outcomes stratified by p16 human papillomavirus status. For instance, the majority of patients included in several recent phase 3 trials of weekly cisplatin had either oral cavity cancer or p16-negative oropharyngeal cancer. To address this knowledge gap, we performed an observational cohort study of patients with head and neck cancer who underwent definitive chemoradiation with weekly cisplatin, evaluating the association between the number of cisplatin cycles and outcomes stratified by p16 status.

### Diagnosis and management of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary in the head and neck: ASCO guideline [^116Syb3q]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — Recommendation 4.18 on definitive radiotherapy with cisplatin for EBER-positive carcinoma of unknown primary specifies that concurrent administration of cisplatin with definitive radiotherapy should be offered to patients without contraindications to cisplatin chemotherapy and with an EBER-positive stage I-IVA (AJCC 8th) carcinoma of unknown primary (Type of recommendation: evidence based, benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). The literature review cites that the Intergroup 0099 study established cisplatin plus radiotherapy as the accepted treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer given superior survival endpoints over radiotherapy alone, and that this survival benefit was confirmed by subsequent randomized studies, again favoring platinum-based chemoradiation therapy over radiotherapy alone.

NCCN Cancer of the Oropharynx — concurrent systemic therapy/RT details include PTV dosing of high risk typically 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) and low to intermediate risk 44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 54–63 Gy (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction); intensity‑modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is recommended to minimize dose to critical structures, and proton therapy may be considered when photon‑based therapy cannot meet normal tissue constraints or compromises standard dosing; commonly used concurrent regimens employ conventional fractionation at 2.0 Gy per fraction to a typical dose of 70 Gy in 7 weeks with single‑agent cisplatin every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m2 with 2–3 cycles, and when concomitant boost with 5‑FU is used the recommended regimen is standard fractionation plus 3 cycles of chemotherapy; systemic therapy/RT should be performed by an experienced team and should include substantial support care.

### Phase I trial of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) [^111uFT5U]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Multiple studies have demonstrated chemotherapy and radiation therapy to be highly effective in increasing the survival of patients with unresectable disease. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy and induction chemotherapy have been established as an appropriate standard of care for many patients with locally advanced SCCHN.

The present study was designed to establish the MTD, safety and efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, including docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-FU in patients with locally advanced SCCHN. The MTD was identified as docetaxel 60 mg m −2, cisplatin 60 mg m −2 and 5-FU 600 mg m −2 day −1. The regimen was generally well tolerated and resulted in a high overall response rate of 100% and CR rate of 84%.

Many studies have explored the PF chemotherapy followed by radiation in SCCHN. The most comparable phase III trial of PF chemotherapy followed by radiation was the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Hypopharynx Trial. In the EORTC trial, patients were treated with chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin 100 mg m −2 on day 1 and 5-FU 1000 mg m −2 day −1 on days 1–5 every 4 weeks for three cycles, and afterwards they were treated with irradiation (70 Gy). In this trial, 51% showed a clinical CR, and they showed that PF chemotherapy followed by radiation was effective in increasing the overall survival in unresectable disease, compared with radiotherapy alone. Using PF, compared concurrent chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by radiation for toxicity and efficacy in patients with SCCHN. This was a randomised trial between cisplatin 60 mg m −2 on day 1 plus 5-FU 800 mg m −2 on days 1–5 plus radiation 2 Gy on days 1–5, repeated every other week for seven cycles, vs cisplatin 100 mg m −2 on day 1 plus 5-FU 1.0 g m −2 on days 1–5, repeated every 3 weeks for three cycles, followed by 70 Gy of radiation for 7–8 weeks. After all treatments, CR did not differ between the two groups (52% in concurrent chemoradiotherapy and 50% in chemotherapy followed by radiation). However, in terms of the overall response rates, the concurrent chemoradiotherapy was better than the chemotherapy followed by radiation (P = 0.003) (93% in concurrent chemoradiotherapy and 78% in chemotherapy followed by radiation), and fewer patients with no change or progression after concurrent treatment. Severe and worse toxic events were similar between the treatment programmes. The concurrent chemoradiotherapy with PF achieved improved disease control, predominantly of regional disease, compared with chemotherapy followed by radiation.

### Randomized phase III trial to test accelerated versus standard fractionation in combination with concurrent cisplatin for head and neck carcinomas in the radiation therapy oncology group 0129 trial: long-term report of efficacy and toxicity [^116FmDYP]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

We tested the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin plus accelerated fractionation with a concomitant boost (AFX-C) versus standard fractionation (SFX) in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma (LA-HNC).

Patients and Methods

Patients had stage III to IV carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. Radiation therapy schedules were 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks (SFX) or 72 Gy in 42 fractions over 6 weeks (AFX-C). Cisplatin doses were 100 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks for two (AFX-C) or three (SFX) cycles. Toxicities were scored by using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 2.0 and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared by using the one-sided log-rank test. Locoregional failure (LRF) and distant metastasis (DM) rates were estimated by using the cumulative incidence method and Gray's test.

Results

In all, 721 of 743 patients were analyzable (361, SFX; 360, AFX-C). At a median follow-up of 7.9 years (range, 0.3 to 10.1 years) for 355 surviving patients, no differences were observed in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.18; p = 0.37; 8-year survival, 48% v 48%), PFS (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.24; p = 0.52; 8-year estimate, 42% v 41%), LRF (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.38; p = 0.78; 8-year estimate, 37% v 39%), or DM (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.24; p = 0.16; 8-year estimate, 15% v 13%). For oropharyngeal cancer, p16-positive patients had better OS than p16-negative patients (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.42; P < .001; 8-year survival, 70.9% v 30.2%). There were no statistically significant differences in the grade 3 to 5 acute or late toxicities between the two arms and p-16 status.

Conclusion

When combined with cisplatin, AFX-C neither improved outcome nor increased late toxicity in patients with LA-HNC. Long-term high survival rates in p16-positive patients with oropharyngeal cancer support the ongoing efforts to explore deintensification.

### The chemoradiation paradigm in head and neck cancer [^111jpkSQ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2007). Medium credibility.

In this article, we use the example of head and neck cancer to show how concurrent chemoradiotherapy is used to treat a cancer where locoregional control is central for treatment success. The advent of concurrent chemoradiation has significantly contributed to the curability of head and neck cancer, including locoregionally advanced disease. Preserving organ function and reducing toxic effects are increasingly the focus of clinical trials. We review the available chemoradiotherapy platforms used for head and neck cancer, with initial discussions focused on single-agent cytotoxic-based regimens. We then assess the literature on multiagent-based regimens and include a discussion of the integration of novel agents, such as EGFR inhibitors, and antiangiogenic drugs into treatment platforms. Although single-agent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy is still widely used as a standard therapy, we propose that evidence increasingly shows that multiagent-based chemoradiotherapy, and EGFR-inhibitor-based treatments, offer distinct advantages. We provide guidance for clinicians based on current clinical trial evidence on how to choose appropriate treatment platforms for their patients.

Improvement in outcomes for patients with high-risk, LA HNSCC is a major unmet need. To date, combination strategies with anti–PD-1/L1 mAbs given with definitive CRT have not improved outcomes in this population. Our study suggests that starting immunotherapy 2 weeks after definitive CRT may be the better therapeutic approach, to avoid potential negative impact on the TME. Continued study of the best timing of immunotherapy and CRT is needed.

Radiation therapy plays a central and continuously evolving role in the treatment of head and neck cancer. In this review, some basic principles of radiation oncology are explained and common clinical scenarios are addressed in which radiation therapy forms part of the treatment course, with a focus on issues most pertinent to the interaction of radiation oncology with surgical treatment. These issues include refinement of the indications guiding the choice of adjuvant radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy, sequencing and timing of therapies before or after definitive surgical management, and scientific and technical advances with the potential to reduce radiation-related toxicity.

### Chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer: 10-year follow-up of the UK head and neck (UKHAN1) trial [^116LVt1e]. The Lancet: Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

The MACH-NC meta-analysis showed that concurrent chemoradiation should now be the routine treatment of choice for all patients with non-surgically treated advanced head and neck cancer. The UKHAN1 study confirms this, but it also shows that a long-term benefit in terms of recurrence and deaths could be achieved with non-platinum agents that are inexpensive, relatively easy to deliver, and have lower toxicity than platinum therapies. Very few randomised head and neck cancer trials have reported such long-term effects of chemo-radiotherapy, and we are not aware of any that have also investigated concurrent platinum treatment.

Cisplatin used concurrently with radical radiotherapy has been shown to be better than radiotherapy alone: in an EORTC trial (334 post-surgical patients with locally advanced disease), the risk of death was reduced by 30% (p = 0.02).EFS was improved with cisplatin in a RTOG trial (459 high-risk patients who had complete resection), with a decrease in risk (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61–0.99; p = 0.04). However, acute toxicity rates were much higher in those receiving chemotherapy (77% RTOG and 41% EORTC), compared with that in our own trial using VBMF or methotrexate (28%). Although cisplatin-based regimens are often used in the US, the MACH-NC meta-analysis did not find a survival difference according to type of chemotherapy (p = 0.42). In trials of poly-chemotherapy, the HR for death was 0.75 (95% CI 0.67–0.84; using both fluorouracil and platinum), 0.83 (0.74–0.94; using either fluorouracil or platinum), and 0.73 (0.52–1.01; using chemotherapy other than fluorouracil or platinum); the UKHAN1 estimate was 0.82.

### Chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer: 10-year follow-up of the UK head and neck (UKHAN1) trial [^116fnJkY]. The Lancet: Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Head and neck cancers are relatively common (about 7500 new cases in the UK and 45 000 in the US each year), and are increasing in incidence in some countries such as the UK, mainly because of smoking and excessive alcohol intake. Standard treatment until 1990 was surgical resection or radical radiotherapy, sometimes both. The role of chemotherapy has been investigated for over 20 years, but with varying reports of effectiveness. Toxicity is especially important since patients are typically unfit, often with coexistent illness.

Over the past decade the role of chemotherapy has become clearer. A meta-analysis published in 2000and updated in 2009indicated that concomitant chemotherapy reduced the risk of dying by 19% compared with radiotherapy alone. The number of agents found to be active in squamous-cell carcinoma has increased, and the best ways of combining them continue to be investigated.

The UK Head and Neck (UKHAN) cancer group was established in 1990 to investigate the effectiveness of chemotherapy used in conjunction with radiotherapy and surgery. At the time, it was believed that chemotherapy given at the same time as radical radiotherapy (ie, concurrent) and afterwards (ie, maintenance) could be effective. The UKHAN1 trial was designed to determine whether adding chemotherapy to standard radical treatment — radiotherapy with or without primary surgery — would improve survival and loco-regional control. Other objectives were to assess the effect of timing and duration of chemotherapy — ie, whether two courses should be given simultaneously with (SIM alone) or subsequent to (SUB alone) the radiotherapy course, or both simultaneously and following radiotherapy (four courses, SIM+SUB). Earlier results were presented and reported in 2001. Here we report the results after 10 years of follow-up.

### Induction docetaxel, cisplatin, and cetuximab followed by concurrent radiotherapy, cisplatin, and cetuximab and maintenance cetuximab in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer… [^114j9HBf]. ASCO (2010). Low credibility.

1More than 90% of HNCs are histologically squamous cell carcinoma and can be linked to tobacco, alcohol, and/or human papillomavirus. At diagnosis, HNC is often locally advanced requiring combined modality treatment. 2Meta-analyses have documented a survival benefit of approximately 6% for chemoradiotherapy over radiotherapy alone. 3Nonetheless, more than 50% of patients recur and die from their disease. Moreover, acute and late toxicities can be considerable and long-term functional outcomes are often unsatisfactory. We designed a phase II trial combining three approaches: induction therapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and cetuximab followed by definitive therapy with radiotherapy, cisplatin, and cetuximab, and maintenance cetuximab. We included evaluation of quality of life and biomarkers in archival baseline tumor tissue.

After three cycles of induction, patients received standard radiotherapy, total dose 70 Gy, in 35 fractions over 7 weeks with concurrent weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m. A boost to a total of 74 Gy was given at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. Intensity modulated radiotherapy was used in all patients. Patients could receive up to 8 doses of weekly concurrent cisplatin. Cetuximab was continued weekly as maintenance therapy for up to 6 months from radiotherapy completion. 19We demonstrated that subsequent chemoradiotherapy with standard fractionation radiotherapy to 70 Gy, weekly cisplatin at 30 mg/m 2and cetuximab followed by maintenance cetuximab was feasible and produced acceptable rates of cumulative cisplatin toxicities, such as neuropathy and nephrotoxicity in contrast to reports of high-dose, every-3-week cisplatin administered after TPF induction.
20.

The addition of cetuximab to TPF was also investigated in a phase II trial in patients with unresectable stage IV HNC, with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis. 22After induction, patients received weekly cetuximab plus accelerated radiation therapy with a concomitant boost. The RR after four cycles of induction was 78%, whereas the CR rate improved from 14% after two cycles to 24% after four cycles. The rate of neutropenic fever was 26% and there were two treatment-related deaths. 22.

### Sequential induction chemotherapy followed by radical chemo-radiation in the treatment of locoregionally advanced head-and-neck cancer [^112dL6UA]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Surgery and radiotherapy are the mainstays of treatment for head-and-neck cancer patients. However, in recent years, systemic chemotherapy has been increasingly incorporated into the treatment plan in patients with stages III and IV disease. As part of the primary treatment, systemic chemotherapy can be administered before (induction chemotherapy), or during radiotherapy (concomitant chemotherapy). Meta-analysis showed that concurrent chemotherapy confers an absolute survival benefit of 8%. Concurrent chemo-radiation is the current standard of care as the first line treatment for stages III and IV disease. Two recent trials have also reported on the benefit of concomitant chemo-radiotherapy in the post-operative setting for high-risk patients. In contrast, the role of induction chemotherapy is not yet clear. Although not the standard of care, induction chemotherapy is used in clinical practice and is thought to be beneficial for reducing the rate of distant metastases, increasing organ preservation and survival rates. Combining induction and concomitant chemotherapy with radiation, that is, in a sequential treatment approach, has the potential for improving disease outcomes.

### Survival after definitive chemoradiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin or carboplatin for head and neck cancer [^115SWnUN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

For definitive chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), cisplatin is the preferred concurrent agent, with superiority over cetuximab for HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma recently shown in 2 randomized trials (RTOG 1016 and De-ESCALaTE). Patients who are not candidates for cisplatin may be treated with carboplatin instead, but its comparative efficacy is unclear. We analyzed nationwide patterns of care and cancer-specific outcomes after cisplatin- versus carboplatin-based chemoRT.

Patients and Methods

Patients with locoregionally advanced (stages III-IVB according to the 6th and 7th editions of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual) squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx who received definitive radiotherapy (RT) were identified in the linked SEER-Medicare database. The concurrent chemotherapy regimen was determined through corresponding Medicare claims. Death caused by HNSCC (cancer-specific mortality [CSM]) was analyzed with competing risks. Propensity score analysis and multivariable Fine-Gray regression were used to adjust for baseline differences, including age and comorbidity.

Results

We identified 807 patients who received cisplatin-based chemoRT and 342 who received carboplatin-based chemoRT. Most carboplatin recipients (68%) had combination chemotherapy, predominantly with paclitaxel. Carboplatin- and cisplatin-based chemoRT had similar incidences of death attributable to HNSCC (3-year CSM, 29% vs 26%; p = 0.19), which persisted in propensity score-matched analysis. In addition, no significant difference in overall survival was seen in the matched cohorts. ChemoRT with either cisplatin or carboplatin was superior to RT alone and RT with concurrent cetuximab. In the multivariable model, the adjusted hazard ratio of CSM for carboplatin relative to cisplatin was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.79–1.28; p = 0.94).

Conclusions

Definitive carboplatin-based chemoRT was equivalent to cisplatin-based therapy and superior to RT alone and RT with concurrent cetuximab. In light of recent results of the RTOG 1016 and De-ESCALaTE trials, our findings suggest that carboplatin-based regimens warrant prospective investigation as an alternative to cisplatin for patients who are not cisplatin candidates.

### The evolution of multidisciplinary head and neck cancer treatment [^111m2m9a]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy can be employed as an induction agent, concurrently with radiotherapy, or in the recurrent/palliative setting. In the curative‐intent setting, the standard of care has remained cisplatin administered concurrently with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy despite substantial adverse effects. While induction chemotherapy has been extensively investigated in patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC, no clinical trials to date have demonstrated a significant survival benefit, with its use only substantiated in the context of larynx preservation.

Research has continued to evaluate the integration of immunotherapy into the curative management of HNSCC. Despite the known responses to this therapy in the metastatic setting, the addition of anti‐PD1 or anti‐PDL1 into the definitive setting has not yet demonstrated a benefit in large, randomized trials. Indeed, in at least one trial comparing chemoradiation with avelumab versus chemoradiation alone, concurrent immunotherapy led to a numeric reduction in survival. There have been a number of postulated reasons for these findings, varying from treatments in unselected populations to irradiation of the lymph nodes negatively affecting tumor response. It is worth noting that at least one randomized study comparing pembrolizumab given concurrently versus sequentially (i.e. after radiation) found significantly better locoregional control in the sequential, post‐radiation arm.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^111U9b5U]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Head and neck cancers — reirradiation may be offered for locally and/or regionally recurrent or persistent disease using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), proton beam therapy (PBT), or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). A randomized phase III multicenter trial in France (N = 130) showed that reirradiation combined with systemic therapy after a resected recurrence improves disease-free survival compared with surgery alone (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.13–2.50; p = 0.01), with considerable toxicity including grade 3 or 4 acute mucositis/pharyngitis in 28% of patients. When concurrent systemic therapy is given with conventionally fractionated reirradiation, cisplatin with concurrent RT is the preferred option for individuals with unresectable recurrent or persistent disease who received prior RT, and the Panel also recommends carboplatin, cetuximab, or docetaxel with concurrent RT as useful in certain circumstances as a reirradiation and concurrent systemic therapy option (all category 2B). Advanced RT techniques should be used for reirradiation.

Table 2 — concurrent chemoradiation with immunotherapy in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) describes feasibility and recruitment status across trials. In cisplatin-ineligible patients receiving pembrolizumab with concurrent radiotherapy (RT), all patients completed 70Gy radiation and demonstrated low levels of toxicity. With pembrolizumab plus weekly cisplatin-based chemoradiation (CRT), 78% of enrolled pts. completed all planned pembrolizumab doses; all pts. completed the full 70 Gy radiation dose and 85% received the target dose of cisplatin (≥ 200 mg/m2). A phase 2/3 comparison of standard intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) plus durvalumab versus cetuximab in cisplatin-ineligible stage III–IV HNSCC has recruitment currently suspended. A phase 3 trial of avelumab + standard-of-care (SOC) CRT versus SOC CRT is currently recruiting, as is a phase 3 trial of pembrolizumab or placebo + CRT in locally advanced HNSCC.

### Induction chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancer: the future? [^114EdqJL]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

There is increasing interest in the use of induction chemotherapy before concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer. A modest but significant improvement in survival has been observed with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) induction before radiotherapy over that seen with radiotherapy alone. The addition of docetaxel to the PF regimen (TPF) appears to provide further survival benefits. The phase II part of a phase II/III trial compared three cycles of TPF induction chemotherapy before concomitant PF chemoradiotherapy with PF chemoradiotherapy alone in 101 patients with locally advanced stage III-IV head and neck cancer. The incidences of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities during concurrent chemoradiotherapy were not higher in the TPF plus chemoradiotherapy group, and the feasibility of chemoradiotherapy was not compromised. Radiologically evaluated complete response rates at 6–8 weeks from the end of chemoradiotherapy (the primary endpoint) were 21% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11%-36%) with chemoradiotherapy alone and 50% (95% CI, 35%-65%; p = .004) with TPF plus chemoradiotherapy. A median overall survival time of 33.3 months and a 1-year survival rate of 78% were observed with chemoradiotherapy alone, whereas the median survival time was 39.6 months in the TPF plus chemoradiotherapy group, with a 1-year survival rate of 86%. To conclude, increasing evidence suggests that TPF induction chemotherapy improves clinical response and does not compromise subsequent chemoradiotherapy. The results of the ongoing phase III part of the phase II/III study should provide further information about the efficacy and safety of this approach for patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.

### ERCC1 is a prognostic biomarker in locally advanced head and neck cancer: results from a randomised, phase II trial [^115ksRNi]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Head and neck cancer is the sixth leading cancer worldwide, with 600 000 cases anticipated in 2012. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) accounts for more than 90% of incident cases. Despite advances in surgical and radiotherapy techniques, as well as integration of chemotherapy into multimodality treatment paradigms for HNSCC, 5-year overall survival (OS) is 40–60% and has increased only incrementally since 1990. The current standard of care for primary nonsurgical management of locally advanced HNSCC is concurrent cisplatin-radiotherapy, which significantly improved OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and locoregional control (LRC) compared with radiotherapy alone in the sentinel clinical trial, Intergroup 0126. Similarly, concurrent cisplatin is indicated in the high-risk adjuvant setting. Although local control and overall survival (OS) are improved with concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, disappointing local and distant failure rates of 50% and 15%, respectively, coupled with an absolute survival benefit of only 6.5% compared with radiotherapy alone suggest that only a subgroup benefits. Given the considerable toxicities of cisplatin including nausea, hearing loss, nephrotoxicity, myelosuppression, and exacerbation of radiation effects such as mucositis and dysphagia, the capacity to pre-select patients who would benefit is paramount.

Definitive/concomitant CRT and organ preservation

During the past decade, an attractive alternative to initial surgery has evolved. Originally pioneered for inoperable patients, upfront concomitant CRT has emerged as a definitive treatment option comparable to upfront surgical management in resectable patients. Given its advantage with regards to organ preservation and excellent reported local control and survival rates, CRT is increasingly used and has become the dominant treatment modality in many centres. The decision between upfront surgery followed by chemoradiation vs upfront chemoradiation with the option of salvage surgery remains controversial and depends on many factors, including local expertise, goals for organ preservation, operability, resectability, and patient preference. No adequate randomised trial has examined this question and, given inherent biases in patient selection and ability to stage patients in a comparable fashion, it is unlikely that we will have a definitive answer in the near future. Both approaches work well, can coexist, and allow matching of treatments to a patient's disease and preferences.

Concomitant CRT

Concomitant CRT attempts to capitalise on radiosensitising properties while delivering systemically active agents. Sensitising effects though are not selective for tumour cells, and adjacent normal tissue within the field is also subject to more effective and more toxic radiation. Consistently, CRT trials report an increased incidence of grade 3 and 4 acute toxicities with mucositis and dermatitis being the most prominent. On the other hand, severe long-term side effects are not increased in comparison to radiation alone, and virtually all patients recover from the intense treatment. As mentioned, treatment should preferentially be done at experienced centres that have an appropriate support infrastructure.

Multiple phase II trials using intensive CRT regimens have shown long-term survival rates of 60–70%, without surgery, for locally advanced HNSCC. Phase II trials need to be interpreted with caution due to their inherent biases, but the consistency of the results and the large number of patients treated with this approach is reassuring. Meta-analysis of early randomised, but mostly underpowered, trials suggested an absolute survival benefit of approximately 8% at 5 years for CRT over radiation also (NNT = 13; 13 patients need to be treated to save one life). More recent trials furthermore suggest even more robust survival benefits with an absolute risk reduction of death at 3 years of 14–25% (NNT = 4–7; between 4 and 7 patients need to be treated to save one life).

### Phase II study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [^1124Mxth]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Many studies have demonstrated chemotherapy and radiotherapy to be highly effective in increasing the survival of patients with an unresectable disease. Moreover, concurrent chemoradiotherapy and induction chemotherapy have been established as an appropriate standard of care for patients with locally advanced SCCHN. However, no standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen has been defined.

Therefore, the present phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of capecitabine instead of 5-FU, a commonly used agent, in combination with cisplatin for concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced SCCHN. In the current study, the clinical CR rate (78.4%), locoregional control rate (72.6% at 2-year), and progression-free survival rate (57.9% at 2 years) following treatment with the present regimen, which can be administered on an outpatient basis, were comparable with previous results reported for 5-FU and platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy, although the follow-up period was relatively short to compare the survival rate directly. For example, concurrent chemotherapy with infusion of 5-FU and cisplatin arm achieved a CR rate of 49.4% and 3-year overall survival rate of 27% in a randomised study compared with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with radiation therapy alone.

Since the efficacy and favourable safety profile of capecitabine have been clearly demonstrated in recent large phase III studies comparing capecitabine with intravenous 5-FU plus leucovorin for metastatic colorectal cancer, capecitabine has been widely used in the treatment of breast cancer, stomach cancer, and other solid tumours. Capecitabine also offers a number of potential advantages as a chemoradiosensitiser in concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Daily administration mimicking the continuous infusion of 5-FU can act as a radiosensitiser for every fraction of radiotherapy. Furthermore, its mode of activation by TP and radiotherapy concentrates it within tumour cells, raising the prospect of better tumour control. Given these advantages, several studies have demonstrated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy using capecitabine, with a dose ranging from 800 to 825 mg m −2 b.i.d, in combination with cisplatin or oxaliplatin is effective and has a low toxicity profile in the neoadjuvant setting of rectal cancer or locally advanced oesophageal cancer.

### Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin for locally advanced head and neck cancer: long-term follow-up of a Brown university oncology group phase II study (HN-53) [^116HgAPY]. Head & Neck (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A phase II study was conducted using concurrent paclitaxel, carboplatin, and external beam radiotherapy (RT) in patients with advanced head and neck cancer.

Methods

Forty-three patients (stage III, n = 12; stage IV, n = 31) were treated with 8 cycles of weekly paclitaxel (60 mg/m²), carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] = 1), and RT (1.8 Gy daily; total dose, 66–72 Gy). Patients with initially palpable lymph nodes underwent neck dissection.

Results

The overall clinical response rate was 91% (65% complete, 26% partial). Severe mucositis occurred in 37 (90%) patients, necessitating hospitalization in 13 (31%) patients. With a median follow-up of 49 months, the locoregional and distant failure rates were 26% and 21%, respectively.

Conclusions

Concurrent paclitaxel, carboplatin, and RT for advanced head and neck cancer results in high complete response rates. Long-term follow-up has revealed the curative potential of this regimen, though the doses used resulted in unacceptable toxicity.

### Cetuximab-based vs carboplatin-based chemoradiotherapy for patients with head and neck cancer… [^1128RdzP]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study results suggest that for cisplatin-ineligible patients undergoing treatment with chemoradiation, carboplatin-based systemic therapy may provide superior outcomes compared with cetuximab. Importance Cetuximab-based and carboplatin-based chemoradiotherapy are often used for patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer who are ineligible for cisplatin. There are no prospective head-to-head data comparing cetuximab-based and carboplatin-based regimens for radiosensitization. Compared with cisplatin-treated patients, patients treated with carboplatin and cetuximab were older with worse performance status scores and higher comorbidity burden. Median overall survival was 74. 4 months in patients treated with cisplatin radiotherapy,
43. 4 months in patients treated with carboplatin RT, and 31. 1 months in patients treated with cetuximab RT.

For patients ineligible to receive treatment with cisplatin, alternate systemic radiosensitizing agents include cetuximab and carboplatin-based chemotherapy. Cetuximab and carboplatin-fluorouracil with radiotherapy have been associated with improved survival compared with RT alone in randomized clinical trials. 1–3. Of an initial 9711 patients identified, we excluded 1421 because they received more than 1 type of systemic therapy during the defined follow-up period; characteristics and survival for these excluded patients are presented in eTable 2 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement. Patients excluded because of receipt of more than 1 type of systemic therapy, many of whom first received treatment with cisplatin and then were transitioned to use of carboplatin-based or cetuximab-based therapy, displayed intermediate survival.

Although we reported survival estimates for patients receiving cisplatin and noncisplatin CRT for HNSCC, the analytic focus of this study was a comparison of survival with carboplatin-based and cetuximab-based CRT. Overall, these data support the use of carboplatin-based systemic therapy for CRT in patients who are ineligible for treatment with cisplatin.

### Phase I trial of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) [^116czKLq]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

In the majority of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the disease is locally advanced at presentation, and the 3- to 5-year survival rates remain below 30%. During the past 10 years, combined-modality approaches have been developed in an effort to enhance locoreginal disease control, reduce distant metastatic spread and improve survival in patients with locally advanced or inoperable SCCHN. Randomised trials have shown that chemoradiotherapy and induction chemotherapy are effective in preserving organ function in a subset of patients by reducing the need for surgery of the primary tumour site in patients with resectable disease, and improving survival in patients with unresectable disease. The standard induction regimen consists of cisplatin and continuous-infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (PF) and has been associated with a complete response (CR) rate of about 30% in randomised trials. The survival of patients with stage III and IV disease remains poor despite these improvements.

Docetaxel is a new agent that has demonstrated significant activity against SCCHN. A number of studies have explored the combination of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-FU (TPF) in SCCHN, with promising results. The overall response rate with the three drugs in previously untreated, advanced SCCHN was approximately 64–93%. Different investigators also examined the feasibility of combination of docetaxel and radiotherapy.tested in a phase I setting the combination of docetaxel, irinotecan and conventional radiotherapy. With combination of weekly docetaxel 20 mg m −2 and irinotecan 25 mg m −2, the overall response rate in 12 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer was 100%, with 75% CRs.

Here, we report the results of aggressive concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TPF in patients with locally advanced SCCHN. The main end points of this study were the toxicity of this concurrent chemoradiotherapy and preliminary assessment of the efficacy of this regimen in patients with advanced and untreated SCCHN.

Fractionation in concurrent chemoradiation — panel perspective and comparative trials: Panel members generally agree on conventionally fractionated radiation in combination with most concurrent systemic therapies in the definitive setting, with most studies using conventional fractionation at 2.0 Gy/fraction to a typical dose of 70 Gy in 7 weeks with single-agent high-dose cisplatin given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m2; other schedules such as 1.8 Gy/fraction and weekly cisplatin have also been evaluated. Numerous trials have shown that altered fractionation plus concurrent chemotherapy are more efficacious than altered fractionation alone, yet GORTEC 99–02 reported no improvement of altered fractionation versus conventional fractionation when both were given with concurrent chemotherapy, and RTOG 0129 found no significant difference in OS between accelerated fractionation with two cycles of cisplatin and standard fractionation with three cycles.

### Evolving strategies for combined-modality therapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer [^115d2EKm]. The Oncologist (2007). Low credibility.

Despite continual advances in the treatment of head and neck cancer, disease-free survival, functional outcome, toxicity of therapy, and overall survival remain less than optimal. While traditional treatment has focused on surgical resection with or without radiation and chemoradiotherapy, newer combined-modality regimens may offer patients a better prognosis, organ preservation, and less morbidity. In this paper, single agents and doublet therapy are reviewed, as are emerging data on the utility of induction therapy, chemoradiotherapy, and surgery as a sequential treatment regimen. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.

### Induction chemotherapy: to use or not to use? That is the question [^111LqRmw]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

The intensification of radiation, induction chemotherapy, and concomitant chemoradiotherapy has been extensively investigated over the past 2 decades for the nonsurgical management of locally advanced, nonmetastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer (HNC). Concurrent chemoradiation has emerged as the standard of care, with the majority of its benefit resulting from improvements in locoregional disease control. Distant failure has become a more prominent problem in conjunction with these improvements. Concurrent chemotherapy provides suboptimal adjuvant treatment for distant disease. Multiagent induction chemotherapy holds more promise especially with the use of taxane-based regimens. Induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation (sequential chemoradiation) is now under investigation. The rationale and evidence supporting the choice to use or not to use a sequential program are discussed.

### Controversies in the locoregional management of head and neck cancer [^111eA4Zv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a heterogeneous combination of various sites and types of disease. This manuscript elaborates on 3 important and current issues: the emerging role of human papilloma virus (HPV) in oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), current considerations in systemic therapy for advanced disease, and evolving treatment of the neck. Exogenous carcinogens, most notably tobacco, have classically been implicated in the development of HNC. A large increase in the incidence of OPC has occurred in the past few decades, predominantly in nontobacco users, and is caused by HPV. This disease is unique in many respects and presents an opportunity for novel therapeutic approaches. Because the prognosis for HPV-related HNC is better, regardless of whether surgery or radiation is used as the primary therapy, the reduction of treatment-related morbidity has assumed increasing importance and provides unique opportunities and challenges for de-escalation of therapies. Radiotherapy (RT) and concurrent cisplatin is the most commonly used nonsurgical platform for locally advanced disease. New data suggest that viable alternatives exist to the typical 3 cycles of bolus high-dose cisplatin. The role of RT and concurrent taxanes remains less understood. Similarly, the value of integrating epidermal growth factor inhibition and concurrent chemoradiation is under continuing investigation. The use of PET scanning is changing the traditional use of adjuvant neck dissection after RT or chemoradiation. Recent data support the use of surgery in the presence of a positive posttreatment PET, and observation in the setting of a negative posttreatment scan.

### Clinical practice guidance for radiotherapy planning after induction chemotherapy in locoregionally advanced head-and-neck cancer [^115BNx5D]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The use of induction chemotherapy (IC) for locoregionally advanced head-and-neck cancer is increasing. The response to IC often causes significant alterations in tumor volume and location and shifts in normal anatomy. Proper determination of the radiotherapy (RT) targets after IC becomes challenging, especially with the use of conformal and precision RT techniques. Therefore, a consensus conference was convened to discuss issues related to RT planning and coordination of care for patients receiving IC.

Methods and Materials

Ten participants with special expertise in the various aspects of integration of IC and RT for the treatment of locoregionally advanced head-and-neck cancer, including radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, and a medical physicist, participated. The individual members were assigned topics for focused, didactic presentations. Discussion was encouraged after each presentation, and recommendations were formulated.

Results

Recommendations and guidelines emerged that emphasize up-front evaluation by all members of the head-and-neck management team, high-quality baseline and postinduction planning scans with the patient in the treatment position, the use of preinduction target volumes, and the use of full-dose RT, even in the face of a complete response.

Conclusion

A multidisciplinary approach is strongly encouraged. Although these recommendations were provided primarily for patients treated with IC, many of these same principles apply to concurrent chemoradiotherapy without IC. A rapid response during RT is quite common, requiring the development of two or more plans in a sizeable fraction of patients, and suggesting the need for similar guidance in the rapidly evolving area of adaptive RT.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma chemoradiation versus radiotherapy (RT) alone — survival outcomes are described: Subsequent phase 3 randomized trials in Asia confirmed that concurrent chemoradiation without adjuvant cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) increased survival compared with RT alone, and in one trial 5-year OS was 70% for the chemoradiation group versus 59% for the RT group. The addition of chemotherapy also decreased local, regional, and distant recurrence rates. A study from Singapore modeled after Intergroup 0099 confirmed the benefit of adding concurrent platinum to RT with adjuvant PF using a multiday infusion regimen. One of the largest phase 3 randomized trials showed that adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve survival following chemoradiation (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.49–1.10; p = 0.13).

Head and neck cancers — effects of altered fractionation without concurrent chemotherapy: An EORTC protocol (22851) compared accelerated fractionation (1.6 Gy 3 times daily, or 72 Gy over 5 weeks) with conventional fractionation (1.8–2.0 Gy once daily, or 70 Gy over 7–8 weeks), with accelerated fractionation showing significantly better locoregional control at 5 years (P = 0.02) and a disease-specific survival trend (P = 0.06), but increased acute and late toxicity. In RTOG 90–03, after 2 years of follow-up, concomitant boost accelerated fractionation and hyperfractionation improved locoregional control and disease-free survival versus standard fractionation, with increased acute toxicity and no significant difference in grade 3 or worse late effects at 6 to 24 months; long-term follow-up confirmed improved locoregional control and overall survival with hyperfractionation. The MARCH meta-analysis of 15 randomized trials reported an absolute survival benefit for altered fractionation of 3.4% at 5 years (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86–0.97; p = 0.003) limited to patients < 60 years, with hyperfractionation associated with an 8% benefit at 5 years; an update including 33 trials showed continued survival benefit of hyperfractionation versus standard fractionation (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.92; P < .001) in locally advanced SCCHN. Consensus on the optimal use of concomitant boost or hyperfractionation for stage III or IV oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, and hypopharyngeal cancers has not yet emerged among NCCN Member Institutions, and use with most concurrent systemic agents remains controversial.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^115xTXwE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Non-nasopharyngeal head and neck cancers — systemic therapy principles emphasize individualized selection based on patient characteristics, with next-generation sequencing (NGS) genomic profiling that may include CPS, MSI, dMMR, TMB, HER2, and FGFR to guide options including clinical trials. The preferred chemoradiotherapy approach for fit patients with locally advanced disease remains concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy. Cisplatin-based induction chemotherapy can be used followed by radiation-based locoregional treatment (sequential chemoRT), but an improvement in overall survival compared with proceeding directly to state-of-the-art concurrent chemoRT (cisplatin preferred, category 1) has not been established in randomized studies. Cisplatin-based induction chemotherapy followed by high-dose, every-3-week cisplatin chemoradiotherapy is associated with toxicity concerns. After induction chemotherapy, multiple options can be used for the radiation-based portion of therapy, including radiotherapy alone, particularly for patients with CR after induction chemotherapy.

### Concurrent radiation chemotherapy for locally advanced head and neck carcinoma: are we addressing burning subjects? [^112LXymh]. ASCO (2004). Low credibility.

1, 4Although several altered fractionation regimens consistently induce more severe acute mucositis than standard 7-week radiotherapy, the general consensus is that late toxicities are not appreciably increased. Scores of clinical trials testing combined-modality therapy have also been published. Meta-analyses of studies completed before 1995 reveal that cytotoxic agents given before or after surgery or radiation do not significantly improve the therapeutic outcome over LR treatment alone. In contrast, chemotherapy given concurrently with radiation improves 2- and 5-year overall survival rates by 8%. 6–10All four trials showed that the combined regimen was superior to radiation therapy alone in LR control or organ preservation; two trials also showed improvement in overall survival.

7, 10A common finding, however, is that 100 mg/m 2of cisplatin given every 3 weeks during the course of radiotherapy substantially increases the severity of mucositis, apparently more so than altered fractionation regimens without chemotherapy. In addition, cisplatin induces systemic toxicity requiring intensive premedication and supportive care. Unfortunately, recording and reporting of the late morbidity of combined radiation-chemotherapy have not been sufficiently consistent and systematic. 11A thorough report of the long-term results of a French cooperative group trial revealed that the late complication rate of the combination of radiation with concurrent carboplatin and fluorouracil was significantly higher than that of radiation alone.

Although the collective data are strong in establishing the superiority of the combination of radiation with concurrent chemotherapy relative to standard radiation fractionation alone in the management of locally advanced HNC, there is variability of clinical trials in patient selection and regimens, leading to continuing debate as to which combined regimen should be considered standard. This finding is consistent with the data of a phase III trial in nasopharyngeal carcinoma from the National Cancer Center of Singapore, reported by Wee et al 14at the 2004 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in which each cycle of concurrent cisplatin was 25 mg/m 2/d given on 4 consecutive days.

21–24The results of a recently completed international trial reported at the 2004 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting validated the latter notion by showing that adding an anti-EGFR antibody to radiation yielded improved LR tumor control and overall survival without increasing mucositis and dysphagia, as compared with radiation alone.

### Controversies and challenges regarding the impact of radiation therapy on survival [^114xGU2A]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Novel irradiation techniques and radiosensitizing strategies revealed their interest for improving the antitumor efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) and thus for reducing locoregional failures. We analyzed the relevance of these strategies with regard to their impact on survival. The examples of the targeted molecular agent cetuximab and dose intensification in head and neck and lung cancer show that this benefit in local control is associated with a survival benefit. Large meta-analyses comparing sequential versus concurrent chemoradiation have also highlighted that improvement in local control is a major contributor to the survival benefit observed in chemoradiation trials. This close link between local control and survival encourages us to pursue our efforts to further improve the efficacy of RT. In some cases, the survival benefit afforded by radiotherapy is however marginal. The better understanding of the impact of local control on overall survival might allow optimization of clinical trials designs.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^116EZacs]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Induction chemotherapy and concurrent RT in head and neck cancer — key evidence and panel guidance: Randomized data showed no differences in PFS, overall response rates, or adverse event rates between cisplatin and cetuximab given with RT after induction TPF, and late toxicities tended to be higher with cetuximab (96.1% vs. 86.2% respectively; p = 0.10). In GORTEC 2007–02 (370 patients), there were no significant differences between carboplatin/5-FU with RT versus TPF followed by cetuximab/RT for survival outcomes and local control, with a trend toward fewer distant metastases for TPF (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30–0.99; p = 0.05). The Panel recommends cetuximab administered concurrent with RT following induction chemotherapy only in select circumstances such as in patients who are cisplatin-ineligible; low-dose weekly cisplatin with RT following induction chemotherapy is a category 2B option; because of toxicity concerns, high-dose cisplatin (100 mg/m2 every 21 days × 3 doses) is not recommended with RT after induction cisplatin-based chemotherapy. When induction chemotherapy is used, adding a taxane to cisplatin/5-FU is more efficacious; therefore, docetaxel with cisplatin/5-FU is a category 1 preferred recommendation, while paclitaxel/cisplatin/5-FU and carboplatin/paclitaxel with or without cetuximab are options, with the latter option category 2B based on less Panel consensus. Outside of a clinical trial, concurrent systemic therapy/RT — with high-dose cisplatin preferred — is considered the gold standard by many NCCN Panel Members.

### Chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer: 10-year follow-up of the UK head and neck (UKHAN1) trial [^113cNttk]. The Lancet: Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

There is variation in how patients with head and neck cancer are treated, with no established and agreed policy on chemoradiation, including for patients judged unfit for platinum therapy. After the first MACH-NC meta-analysis of chemotherapy in head and neck cancer, the benefit from routine chemotherapy remained unclear. However, in the recent update, based on 9615 patients and including older data from UKHAN1, concomitant chemotherapy led to statistically significant reductions in deaths and recurrences, with point estimates similar to those from UKHAN1: HR for overall survival 0.81 in MACH-NC versus 0.82 (99% CI 0.60–1.11) in UKHAN1, and HR for EFS 0.79 in MACH-NC versus 0.72 (99% CI 0.53–0.96) in UKHAN1 (MACH-NC used recurrence-free survival instead of EFS). MACH-NC also confirmed that adjuvant chemotherapy is ineffective (overall survival HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89–1.10, in 2567 patients). The review was based on adding chemotherapy to any loco-regional treatment (ie, a mixture of surgery, no surgery, radiotherapy using standard or hyperfractionated regimens, or pre-operative radiotherapy). UKHAN1 clearly separates patients according to whether they had surgery or not, showing that concurrent non-platinum chemotherapy used in the trial was more effective than radiotherapy alone in the non-surgical group, but not in the group that had undergone previous surgery. Additionally, our results are based on patients with a median follow-up of 10 years, compared with 5.6 years in the meta-analysis. Finally, our study provides direct randomised evidence on the timing of chemotherapy (ie, comparing concurrent with maintenance chemotherapy).

### The role of chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [^115hKqb2]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The role of chemotherapy in multimodality treatment for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, although firmly established, presents several unresolved issues. Concomitant platinum-based chemoradiation (CRT) is a standard treatment for unresectable, resectable but nonsurgically treated, and postoperative high-risk patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, no clear conclusion can be drawn regarding the optimal platinum compound or combinations to use, the type of schedule, and number of cycles (ie, platinum total dose) to be delivered. Cetuximab administered concomitantly with radiotherapy has not been directly compared with CRT but offers a potential different approach using a noncytotoxic systemic agent. In the organ preservation setting, CRT, although yielding a superior 5-year larynx preservation rate, showed similar outcomes to induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by radiation in terms of 5-year laryngectomy-free survival and overall survival, with a higher incidence of grade 3–4 mucositis. The role of IC in nonorgan preservation programs has not yet been established. Phase III trials comparing concomitant CRT versus IC followed by CRT are ongoing with results anticipated in the near future.

HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer — across additional phase III trials, cisplatin plus RT outperformed cetuximab plus RT: in the randomized phase III De-ESCALaTE HPV trial in 334 patients, cisplatin and RT had significantly better 2-year OS (97.5% vs. 89.4%; HR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.7–14.7; p = 0.001) and a lower recurrence rate (6.0% vs. 16.1%; HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.6–7.2; P < .001), and in the multicenter TROG 12.01 trial of 189 patients, 3-year failure-free survival was 93% with RT/cisplatin versus 80% with RT/cetuximab (P = 0.015); these three phase III trials demonstrated that cetuximab and RT was inferior to cisplatin and RT, and when concurrent systemic therapy/RT is recommended the Panel asserts that high-dose cisplatin is the preferred systemic agent, although low-dose weekly cisplatin is also an option.

Cancer of the glottic larynx — concurrent systemic therapy/RT typical dosing states that for high-risk PTV the dose is typically 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction). Concurrent systemic therapy/RT most commonly uses conventional fractionation at 2.0 Gy per fraction to a typical dose of 70 Gy in 7 weeks with single-agent cisplatin given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m2; 2–3 cycles of chemotherapy are used depending on the radiation fractionation scheme. When carboplatin & 5FU is used, the recommended regimen is standard fractionation plus 3 cycles of chemotherapy. In general, the use of concurrent systemic therapy/RT carries a high toxicity burden; systemic therapy/RT should be performed by an experienced team and should include substantial supportive care.

### Evaluation of concomitant systemic treatment in older adults with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma undergoing definitive radiotherapy [^1166tB5W]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the addition of concomitant systemic treatment to definitive radiotherapy associated with longer survival in older patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1044 older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, overall survival and progression-free survival were longer in the chemoradiation than in the radiotherapy group, even after adjusting for potential confounders. In contrast, the addition of cetuximab was not associated with improved survival or locoregional control.

Meaning

The results of this analysis suggest that older patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma may benefit from the addition of chemotherapy, but not cetuximab.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) systemic therapy options and sequencing: When induction chemotherapy is used, gemcitabine/cisplatin and docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU are both preferred options for EBV-related NPC, whereas the use of induction for non–EBV-related NPC remains undefined and, if used, may reasonably follow regimens from other non–EBV-related SCCHN sites such as TPF. The Panel recommends concurrent systemic therapy/RT (cisplatin) with either induction or adjuvant chemotherapy for locoregionally advanced NPC, favoring induction over adjuvant, and concurrent cisplatin with RT is recommended for all patients who do not have a contraindication. If using adjuvant chemotherapy, the preferred option remains cisplatin/5-FU. Use of metronomic capecitabine as an adjuvant option for stage III–IVa disease (excluding T3–4, N0 and T3, N1) is supported by two randomized phase 3 trials. Substitution of carboplatin or other platinum substitutes for cisplatin in induction, concurrent, and adjuvant regimens should be limited to patients who are cisplatin-ineligible.

Head and neck cancers — squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary treatment guidance notes evidence limitations and options. Due to the infrequency of this disease, high-level prospective evidence to guide clinical management is lacking, and significant variation exists among NCCN Member Institutions. The Panel members believe such patients should be treated with a neck dissection. RT is also an option for patients with N1 disease, as a retrospective single-institution study showed that IMRT in patients with cervical lymph node metastasis from an unknown primary was associated with good local control and survival outcomes. Among N2–3 squamous cell carcinomas with occult primary that are not managed surgically, recommendations are based on less Panel consensus: concurrent systemic therapy/RT (category 2B) or induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation or RT (category 3).

### Randomized phase III trial of concurrent accelerated radiation plus cisplatin with or without cetuximab for stage III to IV head and neck carcinoma: RTOG 0522 [^113idPpx]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Combining cisplatin or cetuximab with radiation improves overall survival (OS) of patients with stage III or IV head and neck carcinoma (HNC). Cetuximab plus platinum regimens also increase OS in metastatic HNC. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group launched a phase III trial to test the hypothesis that adding cetuximab to the radiation-cisplatin platform improves progression-free survival (PFS).

Patients and Methods

Eligible patients with stage III or IV HNC were randomly assigned to receive radiation and cisplatin without (arm A) or with (arm B) cetuximab. Acute and late reactions were scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3). Outcomes were correlated with patient and tumor features and markers.

Results

Of 891 analyzed patients, 630 were alive at analysis (median follow-up, 3.8 years). Cetuximab plus cisplatin-radiation, versus cisplatin-radiation alone, resulted in more frequent interruptions in radiation therapy (26.9% v. 15.1%, respectively); similar cisplatin delivery (mean, 185.7 mg/m² v. 191.1 mg/m², respectively); and more grade 3 to 4 radiation mucositis (43.2% v. 33.3%, respectively), rash, fatigue, anorexia, and hypokalemia, but not more late toxicity. No differences were found between arms A and B in 30-day mortality (1.8% v. 2.0%, respectively; p = 0.81), 3-year PFS (61.2% v. 58.9%, respectively; p = 0.76), 3-year OS (72.9% v. 75.8%, respectively; p = 0.32), locoregional failure (19.9% v. 25.9%, respectively; p = 0.97), or distant metastasis (13.0% v. 9.7%, respectively; p = 0.08). Patients with p16-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC), compared with patients with p16-negative OPC, had better 3-year probability of PFS (72.8% v. 49.2%, respectively; P < .001) and OS (85.6% v. 60.1%, respectively; P < .001), but tumor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression did not distinguish outcome.

Conclusion

Adding cetuximab to radiation-cisplatin did not improve outcome and hence should not be prescribed routinely. PFS and OS were higher in patients with p16-positive OPC, but outcomes did not differ by EGFR expression.

### Concomitant chemoradiotherapy versus acceleration of radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma (GORTEC 99–02): an open-label phase 3 randomised trial [^1111owRe]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Concomitant chemoradiotherapy and accelerated radiotherapy independently improve outcomes for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a combination of these approaches.

Methods

In our open-label phase 3 randomised trial, we enrolled patients with locally advanced, stage III and IV (non-metastatic) HNSCC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2. We randomly allocated patients centrally with a computer program (with centre, T stage, N stage, and localisation as minimisation factors) in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive conventional chemoradiotherapy (70 Gy in 7 weeks plus three cycles of 4 days' concomitant carboplatin-fluorouracil), accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy (70 Gy in 6 weeks plus two cycles of 5 days' concomitant carboplatin-fluorouracil), or very accelerated radiotherapy alone (64.8 Gy [1.8 Gy twice daily] in 3.5 weeks). The primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), was assessed in all enrolled patients. This trial is completed. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00828386.

Findings

Between Feb 29, 2000, and May 9, 2007, we randomly allocated 279 patients to receive conventional chemoradiotherapy, 280 to accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy, and 281 to very accelerated radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 5.2 years (IQR 4.9–6.2); rates of chemotherapy and radiotherapy compliance were good in all groups. Accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy offered no PFS benefit compared with conventional chemoradiotherapy (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84–1.23; p = 0.88) or very accelerated radiotherapy (0.83, 0.69–1.01; p = 0.060); conventional chemoradiotherapy improved PFS compared with very accelerated radiotherapy (0.82, 0.67–0.99; p = 0.041). 3-year PFS was 37.6% (95% CI 32.1–43.4) after conventional chemoradiotherapy, 34.1% (28.7–39.8) after accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy, and 32.2% (27.0–37.9) after very accelerated radiotherapy. More patients in the very accelerated radiotherapy group had RTOG grade 3–4 acute mucosal toxicity (226 [84%] of 268 patients) compared with accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy (205 [76%] of 271 patients) or conventional chemoradiotherapy (180 [69%] of 262; p = 0.0001). 158 (60%) of 265 patients in the conventional chemoradiotherapy group, 176 (64%) of 276 patients in the accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy group, and 190 (70%) of 272 patients in the very accelerated radiotherapy group were intubated with feeding tubes during treatment (p = 0.045).

Interpretation

Chemotherapy has a substantial treatment effect given concomitantly with radiotherapy and acceleration of radiotherapy cannot compensate for the absence of chemotherapy. We noted the most favourable outcomes for conventional chemoradiotherapy, suggesting that acceleration of radiotherapy is probably not beneficial in concomitant chemoradiotherapy schedules.

### Current state-of-the-art for concurrent chemoradiation [^112LbqYL]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Throughout the last 2 decades, great strides have been made in managing patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In many clinical settings, they translated to significant advances in treatment efficacy and improvements in disease prognosis. To achieve this, most strategies, ranging from induction to postoperative treatments, are essentially based on multidisciplinary approaches. Nowadays, the indication and sequencing of surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic treatments are carefully weighted in the function of risk levels, efficacy results, and quality of life. Along this track, the coadministration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy was shown, as definitive or adjuvant treatment, to improve the results of conventional radiotherapy alone. However, recent prospective trials showed that the compliance of patients to aggressive approaches is more of a concern for poor tolerability and reduced compliance inevitably impact on treatment dose intensity, leading to the delivery of suboptimal regimens. Therefore, further efforts to tailor novel, multidisciplinary approaches based on drug-radiation interactions have been put forth to optimize treatment outcomes in terms of both disease control and quality of life. Because therapy is becoming more intense, a careful recording and reporting of treatment-related morbidity is also a crucial element in estimating the therapeutic gain from competing strategies.

### Conventional radiotherapy versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus accelerated radiotherapy in locoregionally advanced carcinoma of head and neck: results of a prospective randomized trial [^114iPeBN]. Head & Neck (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to report the results of a phase III, 3-arm, randomized trial comparing conventional radiotherapy (RT) to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and accelerated RT in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

Methods

One hundred eighty-six of 750 planned patients were randomized to receive one of the following treatment plans: RT (66–70 Gy/2 Gy fraction/5 fractions weekly; CRT of weekly cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)) with the same RT dose; or accelerated RT alone of 66 to 70 Gy/2 Gy fraction/6 fractions weekly were available for analysis. The primary endpoint was locoregional control at 5 years.

Results

The mean follow-up was 54 months. Among the 3 arms, CRT showed superior locoregional control (49%; p = .049). RT had lower grade ≥ 3 mucositis and late toxicity.

Conclusion

CRT is associated with significantly better locoregional control as compared to RT and accelerated RT with higher but acceptable acute and late toxicities.

Abstract Purpose Patients and Methods 2once per week or CTX 400 mg/m 2as loading dose followed by CTX 250 mg/m 2once per week concomitant to radical RT. For primary end points, compliance to treatment was defined as number of days of treatment discontinuation and drug dosage reduction. The acute toxicity rate was defined according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. Efficacy end points were local recurrence-free survival, metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival. 3, 4To reduce toxicity without affecting effectiveness, alternative CDDP schedules have been proposed. A feasible alternative regimen is represented by CDDP 40 mg/m 2once per week concurrent with radiotherapy, 5which is routinely used outside of randomized clinical trials. 6published preliminary results of a randomized trial in which they compared RT alone with RT plus cetuximab for LASCCHN.

They reported a 13% absolute improvement in locoregional control and a 10% absolute improvement in 3-year survival, with minimal increase in toxicity.

Medical treatment. 7described in their study at a loading dose of 400 mg/m 2given intravenously a week before the start of RT and then once per week for the duration of RT at a dose of 250 mg/m 2IV. CDDP was started simultaneously with RT at an dose of 40 mg/m 2IV once per week for the duration of RT. 5CDDP and CTX dosage modifications and discontinuations were defined in the study protocol on the basis of hematologic, renal, cutaneous, and mucosal toxicities.

In fact, patients in the CTX arms were more likely older and had poorer performance status, because CTX was often used in patients who were ineligible for standard concurrent chemotherapy.

### Combining systemic therapy with radiation: head and neck cancer treatments in an era of targeted agents and immunotherapy [^113diThY]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). Medium credibility.

The addition of chemotherapy to radiation therapy (RT) has been established for decades to improve outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Concurrent chemoradiation increases both local control and overall survival but at the cost of significant toxicity, motivating extensive investigations to optimize the balance of clinical efficacy and adverse effects. This review discusses the rationale and seminal studies underlying the concurrent chemoradiation treatment paradigm in HNC, and describes attempts to better tailor systemic therapy beyond standard-of-care cisplatin, such as the use of alternate cytotoxic agents and nonstandard dosing regimens. Modern efforts to incorporate targeted therapies and immunotherapy are then summarized, particularly for patients unable to receive standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Finally, mechanisms through which RT and systemic therapy cooperate to improve the therapeutic ratio are discussed, with a focus on the interaction between immunotherapy and RT, a rapidly emerging treatment paradigm. With increasing application of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, determining the optimal concurrent systemic program to maximize RT efficacy will continue to evolve. Identification of patient- and tumor-specific factors will offer a unique opportunity to implement personalized oncologic care.

Hypopharyngeal cancer — treatment for resectable disease is stage- and surgery-directed: Patients with resectable disease are divided into two groups based on the indicated surgical options, including those with early-stage cancer amenable to larynx-preserving surgery (most T1, N0; selected T2, N0) and those with advanced resectable cancer requiring pharyngectomy with total or partial laryngectomy (T1–4a, any N). Patients with T1–3, any N disease for whom the indicated surgical option is partial or total laryngopharyngectomy may be managed with three approaches — induction chemotherapy followed by additional treatment depending on the response; surgery with neck dissection(s) with postoperative RT or chemoradiation as dictated by pathologic risk features; or concurrent systemic therapy/RT. When using concurrent systemic therapy/RT, the preferred systemic agent is high-dose cisplatin (category 1), and given the overall poor prognosis for advanced hypopharyngeal cancer, participation in clinical trials is encouraged.

### Multi-agent concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer in the elderly [^111X943U]. Head & Neck (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The reported decreasing benefit with increasing age from concurrent chemoradiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients prompted this retrospective review.

Methods

Two courses of cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy were given to fit patients ≥ 70 years with locoregionally advanced cancers. Clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes were compared with those for an identically treated cohort < 70 years.

Results

There were 44 patients ≥ 70 and 137 patients < 70 years. Clinical characteristics, treatment and toxicities were similar except that the elderly were less likely to receive both chemotherapy courses, experienced more myelosuppression, required more unplanned hospitalization, and were feeding-tube dependent longer. Projected 5-year disease-specific survival (71% vs 74%) and freedom from recurrence (69% v. 71%) were nearly identical.

Conclusions

Although these selected elderly patients experienced greater myelosuppression and supportive care requirements, outcomes were the same as in younger patients. Age alone should not be considered a contraindication to aggressive chemoradiotherapy for this disease.

### Surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy vs concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III / IV nonmetastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer: a randomised comparison [^1174gEqE]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

We compared concurrent combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with stage III/IV nonmetastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer. Patients with non-nasopharyngeal and nonsalivary resectable squamous cell head and neck cancer were randomised to receive either surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (60 Gy over 30 fractions) or concurrent combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy (66 Gy in 33 fractions). Combination chemotherapy comprised two cycles of i.v. cisplatin 20 mg m − 2 day − 1 and i.v. 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg m − 2 day − 1, both to run over 96 h given on days 1 and 28 of the radiotherapy. A total of 119 patients were randomised. At a median follow-up of 6 years, there was no significant difference in the 3-year disease-free survival rate between the surgery and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (50 vs 40% respectively). The overall organ preservation rate or avoidance of surgery to primary site was 45%. Those with laryngeal/hypopharyngeal disease subsite had a higher organ-preservation rate than the rest (68 vs 30%). Combination chemotherapy and concurrent irradiation with salvage surgery was not superior to conventional surgery and postoperative radiotherapy for resectable advanced squamous cell head and neck cancer. However, this form of treatment schedule with a view to organ-preservation can be attempted especially for those with laryngeal/hypopharyngeal and possibly oropharyngeal disease subsites.

Concurrent systemic therapy/RT — regimen and fractionation practice notes (preferred for patients eligible for chemotherapy) indicate that conventional fractionation at 2.0 Gy per fraction to a typical dose of 70 Gy in 7 weeks with single-agent cisplatin given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m2 is common, with 2–3 cycles used depending on the radiobiologic fractionation scheme; when carboplatin and 5-FU are used, the recommended regimen is standard fractionation plus 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Other fraction sizes (eg, 1.8 Gy), multiagent chemotherapy, other dosing schedules of cisplatin, or altered fractionation with chemotherapy are reported as efficacious with no consensus on the optimal approach, and data indicate that accelerated fractionation does not offer improved efficacy over conventional fractionation; the text cautions that concurrent systemic therapy/RT carries a high toxicity burden, that multiagent chemotherapy will likely further increase the toxicity burden, and advises that close attention should be paid to published reports and that systemic therapy/RT should be performed by an experienced team and should include substantial supportive care.

### Low-dose weekly platinum-based chemoradiation for advanced head and neck cancer [^1133kK32]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The optimal concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen for definitive treatment of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer remains to be determined. The present investigation reports toxicities, disease control, patterns of failure, and survival outcomes in a large mature cohort of patients treated with low-dose weekly platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

Study Design

Retrospective single-institution series.

Methods

Toxicity and outcome data for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer patients treated with low-dose weekly platinum-based chemotherapy concurrent with standard fractionation radiotherapy were retrospectively collected and analyzed from a clinical database. Survival analysis methods, including Kaplan-Meier estimation and competing risks analysis, were used to assess locoregional disease control, freedom from failure, and overall survival.

Results

Ninety-six patients were eligible for the present analysis. Nearly all patients had American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical stage III to IVB disease (99%). Severe acute toxicities included grade 3 mucositis (61%), grade 3/4 nausea (27%/1%), and grade 3 neutropenia (8%). Thirty-seven patients (38%) required hospitalization for a median of 7 days (range, 1–121). Ninety-two percent of patients completed the fully prescribed course of radiotherapy, and 87% completed ≥ 6 cycles of chemotherapy. At a median survivor follow-up of 40 months (range, 8–68), 47% of patients were without evidence of disease recurrence. The estimated 4-year freedom from failure and overall survival were 48% and 58%, respectively. Initial site(s) of disease failure were locoregional for 22 patients, locoregional and distant (five patients), and distant only (14 patients).

Conclusions

Weekly low-dose platinum-based chemotherapy with full-dose daily radiotherapy is a tolerable alternative regimen for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancers, with comparable efficacy and patterns of failure to alternative regimens.

### Surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy vs concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III / IV nonmetastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer: a randomised comparison [^116t6FsU]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Randomisation and treatment

Patients recruited were randomised to either of the two treatment arms: the standard arm (S) consisted of radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and the experimental arm (C) consisted of combination chemotherapy (CDDP/5FU) administered concurrently with radical radiotherapy. Stratified randomisation was carried out using the minimisation method based on the following factors: primary site (oral cavity/oropharynx vs larynx/hypopharynx vs others) and nodal status (node negative vs node positive).

Surgery included a wide resection of the tumour with comprehensive neck dissection for unilateral or bilateral disease as needed. Comprehensive neck dissection for node-positive disease involved the removal of levels I–V lymph nodes. Prophylactic neck dissection was carried out for selected N0 disease. Frozen section controlled-margin was used to ensure clear margins during the surgical procedure. Adjuvant radiotherapy was given to the primary tumour and upper neck at 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days a week to a total of 60 Gy in 30 fractions in 6 weeks. Treatment would commence as soon as adequate healing has been established and not later than 6 weeks after surgery. Fields were reduced to exclude the spinal cord at 40 Gy and a posterior electron-matching field was applied. The dose to clinically uninvolved nodal region was 50 Gy. In patients with disease extending low down the neck, an anterior based AP/PA field was treated to a dose of 50 Gy, to be followed by lateral fields to another 10 Gy, which did not include the spinal cord in the treatment volume. In patients with positive surgical margins, the dose to the area at risk was brought up to 70 Gy using reduced volumes. The lower neck was treated if there was nodal disease present in the upper neck. This lower anterior neck was treated at 2 Gy per fraction to a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions in 5 weeks.

Patients randomised to arm C would receive two cycles of chemotherapy comprising CDDP at 20 mg m − 2 day − 1 and 5FU at 1000 mg m − 2 day − 1, both given as a continuous intravenous infusion for 96 h on days 1 and 28 of the radiotherapy course. Radiotherapy in this arm was identical to arm S with the following exceptions: the total dose to the primary tumour and upper neck was 66 Gy in 33 fractions given in six and a half weeks and involved nodes received at least 60 Gy. Patients with positive nodal disease at the outset would undergo elective neck dissection 4–6 weeks postchemoradiotherapy regardless of response.

### Concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced, nonmetastatic, squamous carcinoma of the head and neck: consensus, controversy, and conundrum… [^114CMgb5]. ASCO (2006). Low credibility.

Abstract Radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone for the treatment of locally advanced, nonmetastatic squamous carcinoma of the head and neck. Three issues affect the use of CRT as primary treatment for advanced HNC. The first issue is the definition of advanced stage and the initial therapeutic choice of surgery or CRT and the role of post-CRT neck dissection. Function preservation considerations should guide the choice between surgery and CRT for patients with resectable disease. Fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography scanning may identify patients who require adjuvant neck dissection. The second issue is optimization of radiotherapy and chemotherapy schedules. Ideally, concurrent chemotherapy should be incorporated into radiotherapy regimens that would constitute optimal therapy were RT to be administered as single-modality treatment.

Introduction Most randomized clinical trials show that combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy is superior to RT alone for the treatment of locally advanced, nonmetastatic squamous carcinoma of the head and neck. A meta-analysis of individual patient data from more than 10, 000 participants in 63 trials conducted before 1993 demonstrated that adding CT to RT in both definitive and adjuvant postoperative settings resulted in a 12% reduction in the risk of death from HNC, corresponding to an absolute improvement of 4% in 5-year survival. 1An update that included an additional 24 trials revealed that the majority of this benefit, a 19% reduction in the risk of death and an overall 8% improvement in 5-year survival compared with treatment with RT alone, resulted from the use of concurrent CT. 2The 2% survival improvement attributable to induction chemotherapy was not statistically significant.

Radiotherapy is the primary component of CRT. Chemotherapy improves efficacy by sensitizing local and regional disease to the effects of RT and provides adjuvant systemic therapy against distant micrometastatic disease. Therefore, a fundamental principle is that concurrent chemotherapy should be integrated into an RT regimen that would constitute optimal therapy were RT to be administered as single-modality treatment. A fundamental corollary is that a CRT regimen proven superior only to a suboptimal RT-alone regimen does not represent optimal therapy. It is possible that the given CRT regimen may be no more efficacious than optimal single-modality RT. CRT is more toxic than RT alone.

### Sequential and concurrent chemoradiation: state of the art [^114qB8wq]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer have locally advanced disease. Sequential and concurrent chemoradiation are standard, nonsurgical, curative-intent treatment options. Controversy remains regarding the superiority of one approach to another. Definitive management strategies are evolving with increasing efforts to pursue deintensification of therapy for low-risk patients, and to pursue therapeutic intensification for high-risk patients. Both sequential therapy and concurrent chemoradiation play important roles in shaping treatment paradigms because both approaches may be used to investigate deintensification or intensification strategies. This article examines the latest evidence and state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting ongoing controversies and future directions.

### Radiation therapy for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: executive summary of an ASTRO evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^112avktH]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) with definitive or adjuvant radiation therapy (RT).

Methods and Materials

The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened the OPSCC Guideline Panel to perform a systematic literature review investigating the following key questions: (1) When is it appropriate to add systemic therapy to definitive RT in the treatment of OPSCC? (2) When is it appropriate to deliver postoperative RT with and without systemic therapy following primary surgery for OPSCC? (3) When is it appropriate to use induction chemotherapy in the treatment of OPSCC? (4) What are the appropriate dose, fractionation, and volume regimens with and without systemic therapy in the treatment of OPSCC?

Results

Patients with stage IV and stage T3 N0–1 OPSCC treated with definitive RT should receive concurrent high-dose intermittent cisplatin. Patients receiving adjuvant RT following surgical resection for positive surgical margins or extracapsular extension should be treated with concurrent high-dose intermittent cisplatin, and individuals with these risk factors who are intolerant of cisplatin should not routinely receive adjuvant concurrent systemic therapy. Induction chemotherapy should not be routinely delivered to patients with OPSCC. For patients with stage IV and stage T3 N0–1 OPSCC ineligible for concurrent chemoradiation therapy, altered fractionation RT should be used.

Conclusion

The successful management of OPSCC requires the collaboration of radiation, medical, and surgical oncologists. When high-level data are absent for clinical decision-making, treatment recommendations should incorporate patient values and preferences to arrive at the optimal therapeutic approach.

### PET monitoring of therapy response in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [^115MmeWP]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

In the Western world, more than 90% of head and neck cancers are head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). The most appropriate treatment approach for HNSCC varies with the disease stage and disease site in the head and neck. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has become a widely used means for the definitive treatment of locoregionally advanced HNSCC. Although this multimodality treatment provides higher response rates than radiotherapy alone, the detection of residual viable tumor after the end of therapy remains an important issue and is one of the major applications of (18)F-FDG PET. Studies have shown that negative (18)F-FDG PET or PET/CT results after concurrent chemoradiotherapy have a high negative predictive value (> 95%), whereas the positive predictive value is only about 50%. However, when applied properly, FDG PET/CT can exclude residual disease in most patients, particularly patients with residual enlarged lymph nodes who would otherwise undergo neck dissection. In contrast to other malignancies, data are limited on the utility of (18)F-FDG PET for monitoring the response to induction chemotherapy in HNSCC or for assessing treatment response early during the course of definitive chemoradiotherapy. The proliferation marker (18)F-3'-deoxy-3'fluorothymidine is currently under study for this purpose. Beyond standard chemotherapy, newer treatment regimens in HNSCC take advantage of our improved understanding of tumor biology. Two molecules important in the progression of HNSCC are the epidermal growth factor receptor and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGF-R. Drugs attacking these molecules are now under study for HNSCC. PET probes have been developed for imaging the presence of these molecules in HNSCC and their inhibition by specific drug interaction; the relevance of these probes for response assessment in HNSCC will be discussed. Hypoxia is a common phenomenon in HNSCC and renders cancers resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy. Imaging and quantification of hypoxia with PET probes is under study and may become a prerequisite for overcoming chemo- and radioresistance using radiosensitizing drugs or hypoxia-directed irradiation techniques and for monitoring the response to these techniques in selected groups of patients. Although (18)F-FDG PET/CT will remain the major clinical tool for monitoring treatment in HNSCC, other PET probes may have a role in identifying patients who are likely to benefit from treatment strategies that include biologic agents such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors or VEGF inhibitors.

Postoperative management of high-risk head and neck cancers — adjuvant chemoradiotherapy indications and cisplatin regimen: In NCCN Member Institutions, most patients with extranodal extension with or without positive surgical margins receive adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after surgery, and the NCCN Panel added a recommendation to consider chemoradiation for other adverse pathologic features that are generally established indications for postoperative RT. The concurrent regimen used in referenced randomized trials added cisplatin (100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for three doses) to postoperative RT. RTOG 9501 showed statistically significant improvement in locoregional control and disease-free survival but not OS, whereas EORTC 22931 found significant improvement in survival and the other outcome parameters; a combined analysis reported that patients with extranodal extension and/or positive resection margins benefited from the addition of cisplatin to postoperative RT, while those with multiple involved regional nodes without extranodal extension had no survival advantage. Performance status and physiologic reserve should be taken into consideration before recommending postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with high-risk pathology.

Resectable, advanced-stage glottic and supraglottic larynx — laryngeal preservation with concurrent therapy/RT: If laryngeal preservation is desired, concurrent systemic therapy/RT is recommended, based on results from Intergroup trial RTOG 91–11. R91–11 compared three non-surgical regimens including concurrent RT and high-dose cisplatin 100 mg/m2 days 1, 22, and 43, with RT uniform across arms at 70 Gy/7 weeks, 2 Gy/fraction. The trial showed a statistically significant higher 2-year laryngeal preservation rate of 88% with concurrent RT with cisplatin compared to 74% with induction chemotherapy and 69% with RT alone, with similar survival for all treatment groups. Based on these results, concurrent RT and systemic therapy (cisplatin preferred [category 1]) is a treatment option for achieving laryngeal preservation for T3, any N, glottic and supraglottic cancers. Long-term follow-up (10 years) indicates that laryngeal preservation continues to be better with concurrent cisplatin/RT when compared with either induction chemotherapy or RT alone, while OS was not statistically different and there was more non–cancer-related mortality among patients treated with concurrent cisplatin/RT.

### Impact of average weekly dose of radiation during radiotherapy alone or chemoradiotherapy in head and neck cancer [^1148LuGW]. Head & Neck (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Altered fractionated radiotherapy (RT) has been shown to improve locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS) in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN). We investigated patient outcomes using a new parameter: the average weekly dose (AWD).

Methods

The medical records of 601 patients who received definitive RT for SCCHN were reviewed. AWD was calculated by dividing the total dose in Gray (Gy) by overall treatment time in weeks, and assessed for predictive value.

Results

Various standard RT fractionation schedules were used. An AWD > 10.0 Gy was associated with improved LRC at 2 years for patients treated with RT alone (80.9% vs 60.9%; p = .006), but not for those treated with concurrent chemoradiation (75.3% vs 77.3%; p = .77). Nonsignificant increases in late dysphagia were seen with AWD > 10.0 Gy.

Conclusion

An AWD of > 10 Gy was found to be beneficial for RT alone regimens but not chemoradiotherapy regimens.

Nasopharyngeal cancer induction/sequential systemic therapy — Preferred regimens include gemcitabine/cisplatin (category 1 for EBV-associated disease, category 2A for non–EBV-associated disease) and docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU (dose-adjusted) (category 1 for EBV-associated disease, category 2A for non–EBV-associated disease). Other recommended regimens include cisplatin/5-FU and docetaxel/cisplatin (category 2B). Following induction, agents used with concurrent systemic therapy/RT typically include weekly cisplatin or carboplatin. For M1 oligometastatic disease (PS 0–1), maintenance capecitabine without concurrent RT following induction chemotherapy is an option.

Induction chemotherapy — locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) recommendations and evidence: The panel notes a category 3 recommendation for induction chemotherapy for locoregionally advanced p16-negative and p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer, while in other sites (glottic and supraglottic larynx and hypopharynx) category 2A and 2B recommendations are based on an update from RTOG 91–11; for selected hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers with less than T4a in extent, induction chemotherapy used as part of a larynx preservation strategy is listed as a category 2A designation. Panel members state that induction chemotherapy should only be administered at sites with expertise in these regimens because of challenges associated with appropriate patient selection and management of treatment-related toxicities. Most randomized trials comparing induction chemotherapy followed by RT and/or surgery to locoregional treatment alone did not show any improvement in OS, though some studies noted a lower rate of distant metastases and a correlation between favorable tumor response and durable disease control with subsequent RT; accordingly, a hypothesis emerged that induction chemotherapy could facilitate organ preservation, avoid morbid surgery, and improve QOL although OS was not improved. Two randomized studies established induction cisplatin/5-FU followed by definitive RT in responding patients as an alternative to total laryngectomy and postoperative RT, offering potential larynx preservation without compromise in OS, yet utilization of induction chemotherapy has decreased with time. Randomized trials and related meta-analyses indicated that concurrent systemic therapy/RT (with cisplatin) offered superior locoregional tumor control and OS compared to RT alone and shorter duration versus induction therapy followed by radiation; meta-analyses reported that concurrent systemic therapy/RT was more efficacious than an induction chemotherapy followed by definitive RT strategy. In the larynx preservation setting, the Intergroup 91–11 trial found the concurrent cisplatin/RT arm had the highest larynx preservation rate; long-term follow-up confirmed that concomitant systemic therapy/RT improved the larynx preservation rate and that induction chemotherapy followed by RT was not superior to RT alone, while OS did not differ among the three treatment arms.

### Induction chemotherapy for head and neck cancer: will history repeat itself? [^116oAAGw]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2005). Low credibility.

Locally advanced squamous cell head and neck cancer remains a therapeutic challenge for multidisciplinary teams. Despite high objective response rates, induction chemotherapy has not resulted in tangible benefit in multiple randomized trials. In recent years, as most evidence solidified the role of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation as either primary or postoperative therapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer, induction chemotherapy fell out of scope and practice. The failure of older randomized trials to show a survival benefit from induction chemotherapy can be attributed to several factors. It is possible that the predominance of locoregional failure did not allow any added benefit from better systemic control to translate into a survival advantage. Alternatively, seemingly active chemotherapy regimens may have been suboptimal. Nevertheless, recent developments have altered our perception of head and neck cancer and its treatment. Locoregional control has dramatically improved with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Of note is that none of the previously conducted randomized trials of induction chemotherapy used concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the control arm. Moreover, we witnessed the development of better combination regimens that improved efficacy in the induction setting. The previously standard cisplatin/5-fluoruracil (5-FU) combination is being replaced by the triple combination of taxane/ cisplatin/5-FU. Randomized trials showed that increased activity with the triplet regimen resulted in improved long-term disease control and survival. Finally, cetuximab, an active epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, is entering clinical practice and is expected to change the standard of therapy. With the emergence of more efficacious systemic therapies, the role of induction therapy warrants reevaluation. A number of randomized trials are planned or currently ongoing to investigate concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without induction. These trials are anticipated to redefine the role of induction chemotherapy for head and neck cancer.

### Promising new advances in head and neck radiotherapy [^117MfKnF]. Annals of Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Efforts to improve the efficacy of treatment for SCCHN have led to the use of multimodality approaches with combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Conventional head and neck radiotherapy, a standard approach for locoregionally advanced disease, is associated with a variety of well-known acute and long-term toxicities. These chronic toxicities (i.e. xerostomia, dysphagia, fibrosis) can impact negatively on patient quality of life. Altered radiation fractionation regimens that incorporate acceleration and/or hyperfractionation can improve locoregional control but also increase acute toxicities for head and neck cancer patients. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has emerged as a promising method for delivering effective radiation dose to head and neck tumour targets while reducing exposure of surrounding healthy tissue. Another method for improving head and neck cancer outcome with conventional radiotherapy is with the concurrent addition of chemotherapy. Indeed, chemoradiotherapy is now a standard treatment approach for locoregionally advanced disease. Molecular targeted agents, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist, cetuximab (Erbitux), have recently been shown to enhance the effects of radiotherapy, and reports to date suggest that this potentiation occurs without an increase in the characteristic toxicities associated with head and neck radiation.

### Chemoradiotherapy: emerging treatment improvement strategies [^111ZZ9CT]. Head & Neck (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The use of chemotherapeutic drugs in combination with radiotherapy has become a common strategy for the treatment of advanced cancer. Solid evidence exists showing that chemotherapy administered during the course of radiotherapy (concurrent chemoradiotherapy) increases both local tumor control and patient survival in a number of cancer sites, including head and neck cancer. These therapy improvements, however, have been achieved at the expense of considerable toxicity, which underscores the need for further improvements.

Methods

The current status of chemoradiotherapy clinical trials for head and neck cancer and research on the emerging treatment improvements were reviewed. A review of potential treatment improvement strategies focused on preclinical investigations on newer chemotherapeutic agents, notably taxanes and nucleoside analogues, as well as on molecular targets such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme.

Results

Concurrent, but not induction (drugs given before radiotherapy), chemoradiotherapy improves locoregional tumor control and survival benefit in head and neck carcinoma relative to radiotherapy alone. In comparison, both concurrent and induction chemoradiotherapy showed therapeutic advantage over radiotherapy alone in the treatment of lung cancer. These therapeutic improvements were achieved with standard chemotherapeutic drugs, most commonly cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Biologically, chemotherapy interacts with radiation through a number of mechanisms, including inhibition of cellular repair, cell cycle effects, and inhibition of tumor cell regeneration. Potential avenues emerged to further improve chemoradiotherapy. One of these involves the newer chemotherapeutic agents, taxanes and nucleoside analogues, which in preclinical studies exhibited strong tumor radiosensitization and therapeutic gain. The clinical benefit of these agents is currently under testing. Another approach for improvement of chemoradiotherapy consists of inhibiting molecules selectively or preferentially expressed on tumor cells, such as EGFR and COX-2, both shown to render cellular resistance to drugs or radiation. Agents that selectively inhibit these molecules are becoming available at a rapid rate, and many of them have been shown in preclinical testing to be highly effective in improving tumor radioresponse or chemoresponse without affecting normal tissues.

Conclusions

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy, using standard chemotherapeutic agents, has emerged as an effective treatment for advanced cancer, but unfortunately at the expense of considerable increase in normal tissue toxicity. There are a number of potential emerging treatment strategies to further improve chemoradiotherapy. One consists of using newer chemotherapeutic drugs, which in preclinical studies are potent enhancers of tumor radioresponse. Another approach consists of targeting EGFR or COX-2 with selective inhibitors of these molecules.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^117QLoFz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Head and neck cancers — newly diagnosed locoregionally advanced disease: In patients with a performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, the recommended treatment is concurrent systemic therapy/radiation therapy (RT), and high-dose cisplatin is a category 1 preferred recommendation; carboplatin/5-FU with concurrent RT is also considered a category 1 preferred option. An improvement in overall survival (OS) with induction chemotherapy compared to proceeding directly to state-of-the-art concurrent systemic therapy/RT has not been established in randomized studies. Cetuximab with concurrent RT is a category 2B option but is distinctly inferior to cisplatin with concurrent RT, particularly in HPV-positive disease. Other chemoradiation options include carboplatin/paclitaxel (category 2B based on less Panel consensus), weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2, and docetaxel (for patients not eligible for cisplatin); additional category 2B options deemed useful only in select circumstances are 5-FU/hydroxyurea, cisplatin with infusional 5-FU, and cisplatin/paclitaxel. Other options for patients with a PS of 2–4 are described in the algorithm.

### Concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced, nonmetastatic, squamous carcinoma of the head and neck: consensus, controversy, and conundrum [^112KWPx5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy (CRT) is superior to radiotherapy alone for the treatment of locally advanced, nonmetastatic squamous carcinoma of the head and neck (HNC). Three issues affect the use of CRT as primary treatment for advanced HNC. The first issue is the definition of advanced stage and the initial therapeutic choice of surgery or CRT and the role of post-CRT neck dissection. Function preservation considerations should guide the choice between surgery and CRT for patients with resectable disease. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning may identify patients who require adjuvant neck dissection. The second issue is optimization of radiotherapy and chemotherapy schedules. Ideally, concurrent chemotherapy should be incorporated into radiotherapy (RT) regimens that would constitute optimal therapy were RT to be administered as single-modality treatment. Modified fractionation schemes constitute optimal single-modality RT. Platinum schedules other than bolus dosing every 3 to 4 weeks are effective and may be less toxic. The third issue is integration of biologically targeted therapy into CRT treatment programs. Epidermal growth factor receptor blockade enhances the effectiveness of RT alone. Its role and that of angiogenic blockade in CRT are under investigation.
