## Question

Could CPK be raised in hepatic damage?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether CPK (creatine kinase/creatine phosphokinase) can be raised in hepatic damage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what CPK measures and where it is normally found. Then, I should verify whether the liver itself produces meaningful amounts of CPK and whether liver injury directly liberates CPK. Next, I will review scenarios where CPK might be elevated in the setting of liver disease due to extrahepatic muscle injury. Finally, I will consider exceptions and indirect associations before concluding with practical clinical takeaways and caveats, supported by references throughout.

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals: CPK is an intracellular enzyme abundant in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain, with negligible activity in normal hepatocytes, so CPK elevation generally signals muscle rather than liver injury; this distribution is why CPK is the cornerstone marker for rhabdomyolysis and myopathies, not liver disease [^116m285X] [^113vW8Xu] [^1157u1jN].

> Wait, let me verify whether liver tissue ever expresses CPK at levels that matter clinically. Although low-level CPK isoenzyme activity has been reported in pathological liver tissue and animal models, this is not the typical source of CPK elevations in patients with liver disease; moreover, assay interference by adenylate kinase in liver samples has confounded older reports, making most apparent "hepatic CK" activity likely artifactual rather than a true liver source of CPK in circulation [^1157u1jN]. I should double-check the practical implication: routine clinical practice and guidelines do not treat CPK as a marker of hepatocellular injury, reinforcing that the liver is not a clinically significant source of CPK in blood tests [^112mcruX] [^113Fviv2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check scenarios where CPK and liver disease coexist. Several settings show parallel elevations of liver enzymes and CPK because muscle injury is part of the disease process: severe rhabdomyolysis often produces secondary hepatic dysfunction or transaminase elevations from proteases and inflammatory cascades, so both CPK and AST/ALT can be high even when the liver is a victim rather than the source of CPK, and this association is well documented in trauma cohorts and consensus statements [^116SnkjX] [^113CoZus] [^113vW8Xu]. I should confirm other examples: leptospirosis frequently causes jaundice and can elevate CPK from myositis, contrasting with viral hepatitis where CPK is typically normal, underscoring that the muscle signal is disease-specific rather than a generic liver effect [^113A2BoP].

> I will now examine medication-induced scenarios where both liver injury and muscle injury can occur independently. Statins can cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations and, rarely, clinically significant myopathy or rhabdomyolysis; when CPK is high in a statin-treated patient, it reflects muscle injury rather than hepatocellular leakage of CPK, and guidelines advise checking CPK only with muscle symptoms, not to monitor liver status, which is assessed with transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase if hepatotoxicity is suspected [^112aQagT] [^11789LPb] [^1176of7Z]. But wait, what if other drugs are involved? Niacin, fibrates, and certain oncologics can injure liver and/or muscle, so concomitant AST/ALT and CPK elevations may be due to independent toxicities rather than CPK release from the liver itself, which is again consistent with mechanistic expectations and regulatory labeling [^114VYTFC] [^113YnoUA] [^112twkEi].

> Let me consider systemic critical illness and multiorgan failure, where both liver tests and CPK can be deranged. In shock states, ischemic hepatopathy elevates AST/ALT, while muscle breakdown elevates CPK; the correlation

### Liver aminotransferases are elevated with rhabdomyolysis in the absence of significant liver injury [^111ZMft7]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is an uncommon finding in the emergency department. However, the clinical implications of rhabdomyolysis are important, with a significant minority of patients developing acute renal failure and multiorgan failure. When present, the cause of elevated aminotransferases in the setting of rhabdomyolysis is often unclear. We sought to determine the incidence of abnormal aminotransferases (defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 40 U/L) in the setting of rhabdomyolysis and how the aminotransferases decrease relative to the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentration as rhabdomyolysis resolves. A retrospective chart review of 215 cases of rhabdomyolysis with CPK of ≥ 1,000 U/L was performed. The incidence of an abnormal AST in the setting of rhabdomyolysis was 93.1% (95% confidence interval, 88.7% to 95.8%). An abnormal ALT was much less common and found in 75.0% (95% confidence interval, 68.7% to 80.2%) of patients with a CPK of ≥ 1,000 U/L (p < 0.0001). In only one instance was the ALT > 40 U/L while the AST was < 40 U/L. Furthermore, AST concentrations (and not ALT) fall in parallel with CPK during the first 6 days of hospitalization for patients with rhabdomyolysis. Aminotransferase abnormalities, particularly AST, are common in the setting of rhabdomyolysis. AST concentrations decrease in parallel to CPK, suggesting skeletal muscle may be a significant source of AST elevation in these patients.

### Is there value in liver function test and creatine phosphokinase monitoring with statin use? [^114L6dya]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Statins have transformed the care of patients with vascular disease. Patients in almost every category that has been studied have benefited substantially. On the other hand, although the incidence of side effects is remarkably low, statins, like any other therapy, are not entirely free of serious risks. From the outset, based on the mechanism of action of statins, hepatotoxicity has been a concern. Moreover, although the mechanisms remain obscure, significant skeletal muscle injury, which can lead to renal failure and death, unquestionably does occur. To mitigate these risks, screening and monitoring programs for hepatic and skeletal muscle injury were put in place when statins were introduced into clinical practice. This article reviews the benefits and the costs of these efforts. Although the benefits have not been shown, the costs are real and substantial. These include the harm caused by inappropriate withdrawal of therapy, which has been shown to be life-saving, as well as the considerable financial expenditure. The conclusion that follows, based on the evidence in hand, is that although these programs were appropriate at the time statins were introduced, they are not appropriate now.

### The importance of serum creatine phosphokinase level in the early diagnosis, and as a prognostic factor, of Vibrio vulnificus infection [^11276tB8]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Vibrio vulnificus infection causes rapidly progressive skin lesions and sepsis in compromised hosts with liver cirrhosis, and is often fatal. Early diagnosis and rapid treatment are important.

Objectives

To clarify the characteristics of V. vulnificus infection that distinguish it from other cutaneous and soft-tissue bacterial infections and to confirm that serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels are useful in early diagnosis, and are a prognostic factor for, V. vulnificus infection.

Methods

We analysed the clinical and laboratory findings (especially serum CPK levels) in eight patients with V. vulnificus infection who were treated at the Saga Medical School Hospital between January 1989 and December 1999.

Results

All eight patients had liver dysfunction and typical skin manifestations. Six had eaten raw seafood before onset. Seven patients had initial skin manifestations in their legs or feet and eventually died, despite prompt therapy in the intensive care unit. CPK levels of six of these seven patients were already elevated at their initial presentation. Only one patient, with skin manifestations solely on his left hand, showed and maintained a normal CPK level and survived. In 23 patients with cutaneous and soft-tissue infections (10 with necrotizing fasciitis, three with erysipelas, 10 with cellulitis), only three patients with necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) showed CPK elevation.

Conclusions

A high level of serum CPK in cutaneous or soft-tissue bacterial infection is considered useful for an early diagnosis of V. vulnificus infection and STSS. A history of eating raw seafood, underlying liver disease and multiple lesions suggest a diagnosis of V. vulnificus infection, rather than STSS.

Statin safety monitoring — targeted testing versus routine labs: In patients treated with statins, it is recommended to measure creatine kinase levels in individuals with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms, objective muscle weakness, and to measure liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) as well as total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (hepatic panel) if there are symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity. In patients treated with statins, routine measurements of creatine kinase and transaminase levels are not useful.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^116S7YG6]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

In the Laboratory

Q: What laboratory tests help to confirm a diagnosis of statin intolerance?

Dr. Sperling: There is no test that typically confirms a diagnosis of statin intolerance, and this is one of the reasons that it is such a difficult clinical entity to address.

Dr. Wong: Obtaining adequate baseline information on current muscle and other symptoms before a patient begins a statin is important, as symptoms are often erroneously attributed to the statin when they were actually present beforehand.

Some papers in the literature suggest that measurement of creatine kinase (CK) is most appropriate for a patient workup, after symptoms of intolerance have emerged.

Some physicians prefer to obtain a baseline CK for comfort, whereas others claim that with a baseline CK, you may end up pursuing the enzyme forever.

Changes in CK levels can occur daily, and CK is not a diagnostic tool. Although there is a general tendency not to look at CK levels in the absence of a specific complaint, a CK measurement 1 to 2 days following intense exercise may be appropriate to see what the highest values might be.

Myositis (defined as muscle inflammation) seems to be associated with exercise, and almost without exception with CK elevations; myalgia (defined as muscle pain) can be relatively nondescript and is seldom associated with CK elevation.

Patients are interested in their liver enzymes. It is recommended that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) measurements be done at baseline and then be repeated, but there is little need for ongoing monitoring of liver enzymes unless warranted.

The ALT and AST levels are measured to determine if a patient is developing liver damage, or even liver failure, which may occur idiosyncratically in 1 in a million patients. This is the same incidence that is seen in patients who are not on statins, so a physician might ask what is really being accomplished by obtaining these measurements. It should be noted that ALT and AST will often increase transiently and harmlessly during the first few weeks of statin therapy.

It should also be noted that some patients may be heavy drinkers, and this may confuse the issue with regard to liver function testing.

### Relationship between viremia and specific organ damage in Ebola patients: a cohort study [^113dZoEx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease remains poorly understood. We used concomitant determination of routine laboratory biomarkers and Ebola viremia to explore the potential role of viral replication in specific organ damage.

Methods

We recruited patients with detectable Ebola viremia admitted to the EMERGENCY Organizzazione Non Governativa Organizzazione Non Lucrativa di Utilità Sociale (ONG ONLUS) Ebola Treatment Center in Sierra Leone. Repeated measure of Ebola viremia, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), activated prothrombin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were recorded. Patients were followed up from admission until death or discharge.

Results

One hundred patients (49 survivors and 51 nonsurvivors) were included in the analysis. Unadjusted analysis to compare survivors and nonsurvivors provided evidence that all biomarkers were significantly above the normal range and that the extent of these abnormalities was generally higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors. Multivariable mixed-effects models provided strong evidence for a biological gradient (suggestive of a direct role in organ damage) between the viremia levels and either ALT, AST, CPK LDH, aPTT, and INR. In contrast, no direct linear association was found between viremia and either creatinine, BUN, or bilirubin.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence to support that Ebola virus may have a direct role in muscular damage and imbalance of the coagulation system. We did not find strong evidence suggestive of a direct role of Ebola virus in kidney damage. The role of the virus in liver damage remains unclear, but our evidence suggests that acute severe liver injury is not a typical feature of Ebola virus disease.

### Patterns of transaminase elevation in rhabdomyolysis versus acetaminophen toxicity [^111gcTgG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Transaminase elevations can occur from liver injury or in the setting of rhabdomyolysis. The goal of this study is to evaluate indices that could differentiate acetaminophen toxicity from muscle injury in the setting of transaminase elevations.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of consecutive cases reported to our regional poison center. Patients with transaminase (AST and ALT) elevation were grouped as those with acetaminophen exposure (AT) and those with elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) without evidence of acetaminophen exposure (RHB).

Results

Of the 345 patients included in the study, elevated AST/ALT levels were attributed to rhabdomyolysis in 168 patients and attributed to acetaminophen toxicity in 177 patients. The median AST: ALT values also differed between groups, with patients in the RHB group had higher median ratios (p < 0.001). Using an AST: ALT value of 2.02 as a diagnostic cutoff produced a specificity of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.64) and sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.94) for acetaminophen detection in the test dataset (N = 104).

Conclusions

Elevated transaminases due to liver injury from acetaminophen ingestion had a different pattern than elevated transaminases due to rhabdomyolysis. Lower AST:ALT ratios were found in acetaminophen cases, however, the specificity using a ratio threshold of ≤ 1 would be 83%.

### Repotrectinib (Augtyro) [^113AZ5cq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

AUGTYRO can cause hepatotoxicity.

Among the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, increased alanine transaminase (ALT) occurred in 38%, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 41%, including Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT in 3.3% and increased AST in 2.9%. The median time to onset of increased ALT or AST was 15 days (range: 1 day to 1.9 years). Increased ALT or AST leading to dose interruptions or reductions occurred in 2.8% and 1.2% of patients, respectively. Hyperbilirubinemia leading to dose interruptions occurred in 0.5%.

Monitor liver function tests, including ALT, AST and bilirubin, every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold and then resume at the same or reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently discontinue AUGTYRO based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

5.4 Myalgia with Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation

AUGTYRO can cause myalgia with or without creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation.

Among the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, myalgia occurred in 13% of patients, with Grade 3 in 0.7%. Median time to onset of myalgia was 19 days (range: 1 day to 2 years). Concurrent increased CPK within a 7-day window was observed in 3.7% of patients. AUGTYRO was interrupted in one patient with myalgia and concurrent CPK elevation.

Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness.

Monitor serum CPK levels during AUGTYRO treatment and monitor CPK levels every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment and as needed in patients reporting unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Initiate supportive care as clinically indicated. Based on severity, withhold and then resume AUGTYRO at the same or reduced dose upon improvement [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Biomarkers of mitochondrial disorders [^11623zJu]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Creatine kinase

Creatine kinase (CK), also known as creatine phosphokinase (CPK), is an enzyme found in most tissues, but is particularly concentrated in skeletal and cardiac muscle and the brain. The primary role of CK is to replenish ATP by catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphocreatine to adenosine diphosphate, thereby creating ATP. This system serves as an energy buffer during times of quick and intense bursts of energy consumption. When damage occurs in any of these tissues, there is a quick release of CK into the bloodstream that is measurable. Although myopathy and therefore hyperCKemia is a common feature of some mitochondrial diseases, it is important to note that there are numerous other causes of hyperCKemia including several other genetic conditions like muscular dystrophies as well as non-genetic conditions like dehydration.

CK as a biomarker was evaluated in 6 different studies, including 196 blood samples. Among these, statistical significance was found in 1 study, not met in another, and the remaining not reporting any p-values. Sensitivity and specificity were relatively poor compared to the other biomarkers, with ranges of 22.2–34.1 ​% and 73.7–97.0 ​% respectively. It is perhaps unsurprising that the utility of CK as a mitochondrial disease biomarker is limited, likely owing to the fact that elevations in CK can be seen for so many other medical reasons and that many mitochondrial diseases do not result in increased CK levels.

### Phenotype standardization for statin-induced myotoxicity [^113TkQvp]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are effective in lowering blood cholesterol as well as in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Approximately 25 million people worldwide are taking statins. Statins are safe and effective in the majority of patients, but they are associated with muscle toxicity, which, although rare, can be serious and potentially life threatening. The clinical spectrum of statin-induced myotoxicity varies greatly from asymptomatic elevations of creatine kinase (CK) without muscle pain, to muscle pain or weakness with raised CK levels, myositis with biopsy-proven muscle inflammation, and, finally, rhabdomyolysis with muscle symptoms, high CK, and potential for acute kidney injury (Table 1). Whether statins cause muscle pain in the absence of CK changes remains controversial. Although milder forms of myotoxicity tend to be self-limiting and disappear after cessation of therapy, they can lead to poor quality of life, poor drug compliance, and, consequently, the failure to prevent cardiovascular events.

Because statin-induced myotoxicity is uncommon, it is necessary to pool and analyze data from various sources, including multicenter clinical trials and observational studies, to study genetic etiology. In addition, electronic medical records linked to biological repositories or to individual patients have been useful in identifying and recruiting patients with drug-induced toxicities. The Phenotype Standardization Project was started a few years ago to facilitate such multicenter research collaborations on various types of serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Phenotype consensus papers on drug-induced liver injury, skin injury, and torsade de pointes have been published by multidisciplinary groups of international experts. The aim of this article is to provide consensus definitions for statin-induced myotoxicity phenotypes, to facilitate cross-study comparisons from the existing cohorts, to aid in the recruitment of retrospective and newly diagnosed patients with statin-induced muscle damage, and to define the phenotype for genomic data analyses.

We convened an international expert workshop on statin-induced myotoxicity in December 2013 in Liverpool, UK, to agree on definitions and a minimum set of criteria to help in identification and recruitment. We report on the deliberations of this workshop: first, we summarize evidence of the clinical and biochemical phenotypes that have been reported, and second, we report on our suggested standardization of the terminology and phenotypes of statin-induced muscle toxicity.

### Elevated creatine kinase activity in primary hepatocellular carcinoma [^1157u1jN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

In a number of studies reporting significant levels of CK activity in liver, interference by adenylate kinase (AdK) isoenzymes in the CK activity assays is very likely (e.g.), or can at least not be excluded, thus questioning the validity of these studies. Another possible cause for inconsistent findings might be compensatory up-regulation of CK expression in pathological liver tissue. Two lines of evidence that favour this hypothesis are: (i) partially hepatectomized rat liver was reported to show an increase in BB-CK activity (see); and (ii) overexpression of CK isoenzymes in the liver of transgenic mice was shown to stabilize energy metabolism under low-oxygen stress and after a metabolic challenge, to accelerate regeneration of liver mass following major hepatectomy, and to increase endotoxin tolerance.

Because of these conflicting data, the goal of the present study was to analyse in detail the CK and AdK activities in pathological liver tissue of patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation.

### The role of liver steatosis as measured with transient elastography and transaminases on hard clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 [^117EVTDK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, given the lack of association between ALT, TE, and pre-existing liver disease with outcomes, the association between AST and LDH was further explored, under the hypothesis that both elevations could be consequence of muscular micro-damage [creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), aldolase, and other muscular enzymes were not routinely available through the study period) and thus linked in terms of predictive ability. As seen in, there was a modest but significant linear correlation between AST and LDH at admission.

Interestingly, when both parameters were plotted highlighting the occurrence or not of the primary endpoint, it could be observed that LDH elevations without AST increase were very common, but remained poorly predictive of the outcome, suggesting a higher discriminative hierarchy of AST over LDH. AST and ALT were highly correlated both at admission and when comparing peak values for each patient during the whole episode (R square 0.743, p < 0.001 and 0.630, p < 0.001, respectively).

WARNINGS

Liver Dysfunction

Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) nicotinic acid products for immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid at equivalent doses.

Liver function tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with nicotinic acid. Serum transaminase levels, including ALT (SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every six weeks to twelve weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6 month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to three times the upper limit of normal and are persistent, the drug should be discontinued. Liver biopsy should be considered if elevations persist beyond discontinuation of the drug.

Nicotinic acid should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of nicotinic acid.

Skeletal Muscle

Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (≥ 1 g/day) of nicotinic acid and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Physicians contemplating combined therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and nicotinic acid should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy.

### Considerations for safe use of statins: liver enzyme abnormalities and muscle toxicity [^112QSXWb]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Statins play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease and have a good safety record in clinical practice. The risk of hepatic injury caused by statins is estimated to be about 1 percent, similar to that of patients taking a placebo. Patients with transaminase levels no more than three times the upper limit of normal can continue taking statins; often the elevations will resolve spontaneously. Coexisting elevations of transaminase levels from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and stable hepatitis B and C viral infections are not contra- indications to statin use. Although myalgias are common with statin use, myositis and rhabdomyolysis are rare. When prescribed at one-half the recommended maximal dosage or less, statins are associated with an incidence of myopathy similar to that of placebo; therefore, rou- tine monitoring of creatine kinase levels in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Myopathic symptoms usually resolve approximately two months after discontinuing the statin, and the same statin can be restarted at a lower dosage, or patients can try a different statin. Clinically important drugs that interact with statins and increase the risk of adverse effects include fibrates, diltiazem, verapamil, and amiodarone.

### Serum transaminase levels in boys with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy [^113JbcSw]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels are commonly used as biochemical indicators of hepatocellular injury but can also detect occult muscle disease. High concomitant serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels can point to muscle as the source of high transaminase levels. Nevertheless, clinicians may be reluctant to attribute high transaminase levels to muscle.

Methods

Study patients were boys with a genetic or biopsy-confirmed dystrophinopathy whose concomitant serum CPK, ALT, and AST levels were measured.

Results

We report 82 enzyme data sets from 46 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and 9 with Becker muscular dystrophy. Our results show a linear relationship between serum CPK and serum ALT and AST and a logarithmic relationship between serum enzyme levels and age for boys with DMD. We developed a mathematical model to predict serum ALT and AST levels when the serum CPK level and age are known. For 6 boys, initial failure to consider muscle as a cause of high transaminase levels led to delay of diagnosis and extensive testing for hepatic dysfunction. A second group of 4 boys with known DMD were investigated for liver disease after high transaminase levels were detected. Serum transaminase levels were highest in ambulant boys with DMD, whose levels reached 1220 U/L (ALT) (22.6 times higher than upper-limit normal levels) and 801 U/L (AST) (12.3 times higher than upper-limit normal levels).

Conclusions

By recognizing muscle as a potential source of serum transaminase levels, clinicians can avoid unnecessary and invasive procedures, expedite clinical diagnosis, and avoid unnecessary cessation of concomitant drug therapy.

Outcomes

What complications should be suspected by clinicians treating rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

Clinicians should monitor for a variety of complications, ranging from an asymptomatic elevation of muscle protein to an accumulation of electrolyte imbalances, edema, and toxic cellular components. Morbidity can present early or late, including hyperkalemia, hepatic dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, AKI, acute renal failure (ARF), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and compartment syndrome. AKI is the most common systemic complication of rhabdomyolysis and is responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with rhabdomyolysis.

Discussion

In rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia is the most significant electrolyte abnormality. Hepatic dysfunction occurs in approximately 25% of patients with rhabdomyolysis. Proteases released from injured muscle may be implicated in hepatic inflammation. Cardiac symptoms may be secondary to electrolyte abnormalities, such as severe hyperkalemia, and range from dysrhythmia to cardiac arrest.

The overall mortality among inpatients with CK > 5000 IU/L is approximately 14%. ARF develops in up to 15% of patients. Among those requiring RRT, mortality may be as high as 59%. Additionally, the release of intracellular products may activate the clotting cascade, leading to DIC in patients with rhabdomyolysis. This presentation is often subclinical with prolonged coagulation studies, thrombocytopenia, and elevated fibrin degradation studies without significant bleeding or thrombosis. Compartment syndrome may be an early or late complication, resulting from direct muscle injury or vigorous muscle activity. This complication occurs primarily due to limited muscle expansion from enveloping tight fascia. A delay of more than 6 hours in diagnosing this complication can lead to irreversible muscle damage or death.

Can prediction scoring be used in rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

The risk of AKI, RRT, and/or in-hospital mortality in patients with rhabdomyolysis can be estimated using admission demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. Risk prediction scores may not directly influence treatment; however, they may be useful in estimating prognosis and setting expectations.

As no single laboratory value is sufficient to predict the course of rhabdomyolysis, a combined index of metrics, the McMahon Score (table 1), may be calculated at admission for prognostication. A score greater than or equal to 6 is predictive of a need for high-volume fluid resuscitation, RRT, and death.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Statin safety — laboratory monitoring and supplements: In patients treated with statins, it is recommended to measure creatine kinase levels in those with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms or objective muscle weakness and to measure liver transaminases, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase if symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity. Coenzyme Q10 is not recommended for routine use in patients treated with statins or for the treatment of SAMS, and routine measurements of creatine kinase and transaminase levels are not useful in statin-treated patients.

### Acute liver damage in anorexia nervosa [^113EQttg]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 26-year-old White woman with a history of anorexia nervosa who developed severe liver damage and multiorgan dysfunction. At admission to our medical unit, her body mass index (BMI) was 10.8. Biochemical evaluation showed a marked increase in serum levels of aspartate aminotransferases (AST = 9,980 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT = 3,930 IU/L), amylase (1,002 IU/L), lipase (1,437 IU/L), creatine phosphokinase (CPK; 783 IU/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH = 6,830 IU/L). Glomerular filtration rate was reduced (35 ml/min), reflecting dehydration and prerenal azotemia. No other cause of acute liver damage except malnutrition was evidenced. Hydration and nutritional support were the unique medical treatment. A rapid recovery occurred in few days and all laboratory data were normal at discharge after a 37-day hospitalization.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines — statin safety management: In patients with statin-associated side effects that are not severe, it is recommended to reassess and to rechallenge to achieve a maximal LDL-C lowering by modified dosing regimen, an alternate statin or in combination with nonstatin therapy. In patients with increased diabetes mellitus risk or new-onset diabetes mellitus, it is recommended to continue statin therapy, with added emphasis on adherence, net clinical benefit, and the core principles of regular moderate-intensity physical activity, maintaining a healthy dietary pattern, and sustaining modest weight loss. In patients treated with statins, it is recommended to measure creatine kinase levels in individuals with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms, objective muscle weakness, and to measure liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) as well as total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (hepatic panel) if there are symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity. In patients at increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk with chronic, stable liver disease (including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) when appropriately indicated, it is reasonable to use statins after obtaining baseline measurements and determining a schedule of monitoring and safety checks. Coenzyme Q10 is not recommended for routine use in patients treated with statins or for the treatment of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and in patients treated with statins, routine measurements of creatine kinase and transaminase levels are not useful.

### Niacin [^113Qa6Zx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Skeletal
Muscle

Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy.

5.3
Liver Dysfunction

Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses.

Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release.

Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release doses ranging from 500 mg to 3,000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN.

Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent, or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued.

Laboratory Abnormalities

Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK)

In the 16-week placebo-controlled period, increased CPK (including Grade 4) was reported in 23 subjects (9.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 5 subjects (4.1 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo.

Liver Enzyme Elevations

Events of increases in liver enzymes ≥ 3 times the ULN were observed in subjects treated with SOTYKTU [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. In the 16-week placebo-controlled period:

ALT elevations ≥ 3 times the ULN was reported in 9 subjects (3.6 per 100 patient- years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 2 subjects (1.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo.
AST elevations ≥ 3 times the ULN was reported in 13 subjects (5.2 per 100 patient- years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 2 subjects (1.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo.

Decreased Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)

In the 16-week placebo-controlled period in subjects who had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–59 mL/min) at baseline, decreased GFR was reported in 4 subjects (1.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 1 subject (0.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo. Two of the deucravacitinib-treated subjects had worsening of baseline proteinuria.

Lipid Elevations

Mean triglycerides increased by 10.3 mg/dL during the 16-week treatment period in subjects treated with SOTYKTU and by 9.1 mg/dL during the 52-week treatment period.

Safety Through Week 52

In PSO-1 and PSO-2, the exposure adjusted incidence rate of adverse reactions in subjects treated with SOTYKTU from Week 0 through Week 52 without switching treatment did not increase compared to the rate observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment.

### Lovastatin [^116BVr4m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Lovastatin may elevate creatine phosphokinase and transaminase levels (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). This should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain in a patient on therapy with lovastatin.

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia

Lovastatin is less effective in patients with the rare homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, possibly because these patients have no functional LDL receptors. Lovastatin appears to be more likely to raise serum transaminases (see ADVERSE REACTIONS) in these homozygous patients.

Information for Patients

Patients should be advised about substances they should not take concomitantly with lovastatin and be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discountinuing Lovastatin (see list below and WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis). Patients should also be advised to inform other physicians prescribing a new medication that they are taking lovastatin.

It is recommended that liver enzymes be checked before starting therapy, and if signs or symptoms of liver injury occur. All patients treated with Lovastatin should be advised to report promptly any symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice.

CYP3A4 Interactions

Lovastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4 but has no CYP3A4 inhibitory activity; therefore it is not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir, nefazodone, erythromycin, and cobicistat-containing products), and grapefruit juice increase the risk of myopathy by reducing the elimination of lovastatin. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics .)

Interactions With Lipid-Lowering Drugs That Can Cause Myopathy When Given Alone

The risk of myopathy is also increased by the following lipid-lowering drugs that are not strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, but which can cause myopathy when given alone.

### Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase is associated with mortality and inotropic requirement in critically injured adults [^114GHwhU]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hemeproteins such as free myoglobin can undergo autoxidation and catalyse lipid peroxidation, increasing oxidative stress. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation is a marker for free myoglobin after myocyte damage. Since oxidative injury is a key mechanism of injury-related organ dysfunction, we hypothesised that serum CPK levels correlate with mortality and need for inotropic medication and duration of inotropic support, i.e. shock, among critically injured patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of 17,847 patients admitted to a single Trauma Intensive Care Unit over 9 years. 2583 patients with serum CPK levels were included in the analysis. Patient data were collected continuously into an electronic ICU repository. Univariate analysis was accomplished using Spearman correlation and the Mann–Whitney U test. Propensity score adjustment models accounting for potential confounders were used to assess the independent effect of CPK level on mortality, need for inotropic support, and duration of inotropic support.

Results

Median CPK was significantly higher in patients who died (916 [IQR 332, 2472] vs. 711 [253, 1971], p = 0.004) and in those who required inotropic medications (950 [353, 2525] vs. 469 [188, 1220], p < 0.001). After adjusting for propensity score and potential confounders the odds of mortality increased by 1.10 (95% CI 1.02–1.19, p = 0.020) and the odds of inotropic medication use increased by 1.30 (95% CI 1.22–1.38, p < 0.001) per natural log unit increase in CPK. There was a significant association between CPK level and duration of inotropic support (Spearman's rho .237, p < 0.001) that remained significant in a propensity score-adjusted model.

Conclusion

In critically injured patients, elevated serum CPK level is independently associated with mortality, need for inotropic medication, and duration of inotropic support. This study is the first to evaluate the relationship of CPK level and mortality in addition to surrogate measures of shock in a population of critically injured patients. If these associations are verified prospectively, there may be a role for treatment with hemeprotein reductants, such as paracetamol, to mitigate the effects of shock and end-organ dysfunction.

### The safety of statins in clinical practice [^1176of7Z]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Statins are effective cholesterol-lowering drugs that reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease events (heart attacks, strokes, and the need for arterial revascularisation). Adverse effects from some statins on muscle, such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, are rare at standard doses, and on the liver, in increasing levels of transaminases, are unusual. Myopathy — muscle pain or weakness with blood creatine kinase levels more than ten times the upper limit of the normal range — typically occurs in fewer than one in 10,000 patients on standard statin doses. However, this risk varies between statins, and increases with use of higher doses and interacting drugs. Rhabdomyolysis is a rarer and more severe form of myopathy, with myoglobin release into the circulation and risk of renal failure. Stopping statin use reverses these side-effects, usually leading to a full recovery. Asymptomatic increases in concentrations of liver transaminases are recorded with all statins, but are not clearly associated with an increased risk of liver disease. For most people, statins are safe and well-tolerated, and their widespread use has the potential to have a major effect on the global burden of cardiovascular disease.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis – when should we start worrying? Case reports and literature review [^113Kzp8k]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) is a serious medical issue usually seen in individuals or patients after engaging in heavy exertion and physical activity. The incidence, natural course, and recurrence of ER are, by and large, unknown. Given the lack of rigorous scientific data that are specific for ER, most of the patients with ER receive treatment in an inpatient setting even with only a mild elevation of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level. Often, patients receive inpatient treatment solely on the basis of elevated CPK (< 3000 IU) even in the absence of other serious signs and symptoms of ER. We intent to describe 2 case reports that involve patients who developed ER after an intense physical exertion and were managed in an outpatient setting with close follow-up. In the discussion part, we point suggest that in patients with a relatively mild CPK elevation (< 15,000 IU) and normal creatinine value and in the absence of factors such as profound dehydration, sickle cell trait, concomitant infectious cause, underlying metabolic syndrome, and current and ongoing use of analgesics, the complications after ER are low. Patients who develop ER, who can be reliably followed up, and who fulfills these criteria can be managed as outpatients.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^113vW8Xu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

What laboratory findings aid in the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

The most commonly implicated variables include elevated serum concentrations of CK (> 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L), myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), potassium, creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Elevated urine myoglobin provides additional evidence. A low threshold of suspicion in the proper clinical context is warranted to initiate appropriate therapy. A strategy for disease monitoring with serial CK measurement should be additionally undertaken. Interval CK values should be followed until a peak concentration is identified (typically at 24–72 hours), discontinued once the CK is reliably downtrending.

Discussion

Traumatic or non-traumatic injury to the skeletal muscle cellular membrane leads to an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, disrupting cellular homeostasis and leading to cell death. Injury may be exacerbated by the generation of reactive oxygen species after restoration of blood flood to the affected tissue (reperfusion injury). The resulting effect is the accumulation of CK, myoglobin, LDH, and potassium in the circulation. In a recent systematic review, the laboratory definition of rhabdomyolysis varied to include an elevated CK level > 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L, with the CK-MM subtype being the most reflective of skeletal muscle injury.CK values may become elevated within 12 hours of injury, peak at 24 to 72 hours, and return to normal in roughly 5 days, depending on the degree of injury and appropriate therapy.

Myoglobin becomes elevated in the circulation once intrinsic binding proteins are overwhelmed. Given a shorter half-life (1–3 hours) versus CK, myoglobin may elevate and resolve prior to CK depreciating its clinical utility. Myoglobin may also be evident in the urine and, although the sensitivity has been reported up to 100%, the specificity varies widely from 15% to 88%. Although a causal relationship may exist between rhabdomyolysis and elevations in hepatic aminotransferases (AST, ALT: alanine transaminase), this is of unclear value as both enzymes exist within skeletal muscle and may become elevated as a result of primary muscle injury.

### Aminocaproic acid [^115L2E9X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

In patients with upper urinary tract bleeding, aminocaproic acid administration has been known to cause intrarenal obstruction in the form of glomerular capillary thrombosis or clots in the renal pelvis and ureters. For this reason, Aminocaproic Acid Injection, USP should not be used in hematuria of upper urinary tract origin, unless the possible benefits outweigh the risk.

Subendocardial hemorrhages have been observed in dogs given intravenous infusions of 0.2 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of aminocaproic acid and in monkeys given 8 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of aminocaproic acid.

Fatty degeneration of the myocardium has been reported in dogs given intravenous doses of aminocaproic acid at 0.8 to 3.3 times the maximum human therapeutic dose and in monkeys given intravenous doses of aminocaproic acid at 6 times the maximum human therapeutic dose.

Rarely, skeletal muscle weakness with necrosis of muscle fibers has been reported following prolonged administration. Clinical presentation may range from mild myalgias with weakness and fatigue to a severe proximal myopathy with rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and acute renal failure. Muscle enzymes, especially creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are elevated. CPK levels should be monitored in patients on long-term therapy. Aminocaproic Acid Injection administration should be stopped if a rise in CPK is noted. Resolution follows discontinuation of Aminocaproic Acid Injection; however, the syndrome may recur if Aminocaproic Acid Injection is restarted.

The possibility of cardiac muscle damage should also be considered when skeletal myopathy occurs. One case of cardiac and hepatic lesions observed in man has been reported. The patient received 2 g of aminocaproic acid every 6 hours for a total dose of 26 g. Death was due to continued cerebrovascular hemorrhage. Necrotic changes in the heart and liver were noted at autopsy.

Monitoring for statin-associated side effects — CK and liver enzymes: "it is recommended that CK be measured in the case of severe SAMS and in the presence of objective muscle weakness", and "the FDA recommends measuring transaminases… if there are signs or symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity". An "asymptomatic increase in transaminases (> 3 times upper limit of normal) is an infrequent statin-associated side effect" that often resolves with dose adjustment, while "Severe statin-associated hepatotoxicity is rare, and the incidence is not impacted by routine monitoring of transaminases", and evaluation for nonstatin causes "is warranted" if elevations persist. "Statins are not contraindicated in patients with increased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver disease", and, overall, "CK and transaminase levels should not be routinely measured".

### Elevated liver enzymes as a manifestation of haff disease [^111esdQV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Haff disease is a rare syndrome of rhabdomyolysis thought to be caused by a heat-stable toxin associated with the consumption of seafood from fresh or brackish water.

Case Report

We present the case of a patient with Haff disease who presented to the emergency department with nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgias after a seafood buffet. Initially, he was treated with i.v. fluids and antiemetics for presumed gastroenteritis, but his symptoms did not improve. He was found to have elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, normal point-of-care ultrasound, urinalysis with large blood and no red blood cells, and an elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK). He was admitted to the hospital to receive ongoing fluid resuscitation for rhabdomyolysis presumed to be from fish. Liver enzymes and CPK downtrended, and patient was discharged on hospital day 3. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Undiagnosed Haff disease has important clinical implications, including multi-organ failure and death. Always maintain a high level of suspicion for Haff disease in patients with symptoms suggestive of gastroenteritis, but complicated by minor liver function test elevations and dipstick positivity for heme, without significant numbers of red blood cells per high-power field, in the setting of recent seafood ingestion.

### Disease spectrum of myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal creatine kinase [^114K77JT]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Creatine kinase (CK) is a muscle enzyme involved in the phosphocreatine circuit for energy supply of muscles, whilst aldolase is a glycolytic enzyme abundantly expressed in not only muscles but also liver, brain and red blood cells. Elevation of serum CK (hyperCKemia) and aldolase level is considered a biomarker of muscle damage secondary to a leakage of these cytosolic enzymes into the bloodstream. HyperCKemia is often accompanied by high aldolase level. The magnitude of CK elevation generally directly correlates with the number of necrotic fibers. CK level can be normal in myopathies without prominent necrotizing pathology, for example congenital myopathies or metabolic myopathies. Immune‐mediated myopathies generally feature a significant degree of necrotic fibers and CK elevation; however, a proportion of patients with dermatomyositis, inflammatory myopathy or polymyositis, inflammatory myopathy with perimysial pathology, scleroderma myopathy and eosinophilic fasciitis can have normal serum CK levels with elevated aldolase levels. In skeletal muscle, aldolase is abundantly expressed in myoblasts in the early stage of differentiation and in regenerating fibers, whilst CK expression in these cells is minimal to none. It is hypothesized that immune‐mediated destruction of these regenerating myofibers may underlie the discrepancy of aldolase elevation and normal CK level. In some patients in whom myodegeneration is not a prominent histopathological feature (e.g. eosinophilic fasciitis), aldolase may be derived from cells other than myofibers. Herein, the aim was to investigate the disease spectrum of myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal CK level.

### Who should receive a statin these days? Lessons from recent clinical trials [^116QSDBx]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins are the most successful cardiovascular drugs of all time. By interrupting cholesterol synthesis in the liver, they activate hepatocyte low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and produce consistent and predictable reductions in circulating LDL cholesterol with resulting reproducible improvements in cardiovascular risk by retarding or even regressing the march of atherosclerosis in all major arterial trees (coronary, cerebral and peripheral). Clinical trials have demonstrated their capacity not only to extend life, but also to improve its quality by retarding the progression of diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease and by enhancing central and peripheral blood flow. They are amongst the most extensively investigated pharmaceutical agents in current clinical use. In cardiovascular end-point trials they have proven ability to help prevent that first and all important myocardial infarction and to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence in those who do succumb. They are equally effective in men and women of all ages and at all levels of cardiovascular risk, whether caused by hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome. In addition, they improve the outlook of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia whose LDL receptor function is deficient or defective; and all of this comes at minimal risk to the recipient. Their most important potential side effect is myopathy, which on very rare occasions may lead to rhabdomyolysis. Clinical experience shows that myopathic symptoms with creatine kinase levels raised to more than 10 times the upper limit of normal is seen in < 0.01% of recipients and progression to fatal rhabdomyolysis because of renal failure has been recorded in only 0.15 cases per million prescriptions. Liver function abnormalities are also, rarely, seen. Again, the frequency of raised aspartate or alanine aminotransferase to more than three times the normal limit is encountered in no more than 1–2% of all treated patients and is completely reversible upon withdrawal of treatment. Progression to hepatitis or liver failure does not occur. This constellation of benefits with little side effect penalty has resulted in the comparison of statins with antibiotics in the global battle against cardiovascular disease.

In patients with upper urinary tract bleeding, AMICAR administration has been known to cause intrarenal obstruction in the form of glomerular capillary thrombosis or clots in the renal pelvis and ureters. For this reason, AMICAR should not be used in hematuria of upper urinary tract origin, unless the possible benefits outweigh the risk.

Subendocardial hemorrhages have been observed in dogs given intravenous infusions of 0.2 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of AMICAR and in monkeys given 8 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of AMICAR.

Fatty degeneration of the myocardium has been reported in dogs given intravenous doses of AMICAR at 0.8 to 3.3 times the maximum human therapeutic dose and in monkeys given intravenous doses of AMICAR at 6 times the maximum human therapeutic dose.

### Creatine kinase is associated with bleeding after myocardial infarction [^111MrCQM]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Tissue and endothelial factors in thrombosis and haemostasis have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (figure 1). With vascular injury, thrombus formation involves damage to the vascular wall and exposure to subendothelial molecules, initiating the coagulation cascade, adhesion of platelets, thrombus formation and thrombolysis. CK is proposed here to serve as a 'tissue factor' that inhibits platelet activation. Importantly, with damage to high CK tissue such as muscle and brain, large quantities of intracellular CK may be released into the extracellular space and circulation, along with ADP, ATP and phosphocreatine. ADP conversion or scavenging action by CK will potentially reduce ADP-dependent platelet activation, which might serve to reduce excessive thrombus formation. The presented data accord with a possible association between extracellular CK and inhibition of ADP-dependent platelet activation, which may act in synergy with thrombolytic or antithrombotic drugs to increase bleeding risk.

Plasma CK circulates, and although the enzyme is thought to be cleared by the liver, there is no known inhibitor. As a consequence, its ADP-binding effect is probably systemic. The conversion to ATP would need phosphocreatine, which is more likely to be present locally at the site of tissue damage. The role of ATP proper in platelet activation is somewhat enigmatic. ATP is reported to have either no direct effect, only through inhibition of ADP-dependent platelet activation, or act on the platelet P2X1 receptor as an inhibitor at low, and an activator at high concentrations. Importantly, vascular endothelium and blood cells are known to contribute to the interconversion of extracellular adenine nucleotides via ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases, ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases, ecto-5'-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatases. Thus, the effect of highly elevated extracellular and circulating CK on platelet activation is thought to be mainly through ADP reduction, but the role of ATP, and the potential interaction between CK and ectoenzymes that convert ATP and ADP needs further exploration.

### Niacin (niaspan) [^1115GBRB]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

5.2 Skeletal Muscle

Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin and statins. Physicians contemplating combined therapy with statins and NIASPAN should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy.

The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased when lovastatin or simvastatin are coadministered with NIASPAN, particularly in elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism.

5.3 Liver Dysfunction

Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses.

NIASPAN should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of NIASPAN.

Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily NIASPAN doses ranging from 500 to 3000 mg, 245 patients received NIASPAN for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with NIASPAN. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of NIASPAN patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN.

In three safety and efficacy studies with a combination tablet of NIASPAN and lovastatin involving titration to final daily doses (expressed as mg of niacin/ mg of lovastatin) 500 mg/10 mg to 2500 mg/40 mg, ten of 1028 patients (1.0%) experienced reversible elevations in AST/ALT to more than 3 times the ULN. Three of ten elevations occurred at doses outside the recommended dosing limit of 2000 mg/40 mg; no patient receiving 1000 mg/20 mg had 3-fold elevations in AST/ALT.

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride [^114DAEq5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Abnormalities

Pioglitazone

Hematologic Effects

Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first four to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects.

Creatine Phosphokinase

During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2,150 to 11,400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing, and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown.

Metformin

Vitamin B Concentrations

In metformin clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously

normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

### Nonlinear association between AST / ALT ratio and 28-day all-cause mortality following ICU admission in critically ill cirrhotic patients: a retrospective cohort study [^115WpuiT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the specific mechanisms connecting a higher AST/ALT ratio to increased mortality risk remain unclear, the current findings highlight several significant potential pathways. It is important to acknowledge that AST is present in multiple tissues beyond the liver, including cardiac and skeletal muscle. In critically ill patients, AST elevation might result from non-hepatic causes such as myocardial or skeletal muscle injury. Biomarkers such as creatine kinase (CK) and troponin can help differentiate between hepatic and non-hepatic sources of AST elevation. The absence of these differentiating biomarkers in our analysis is a limitation that should be considered when interpreting the prognostic value of the AST/ALT ratio. Despite this limitation, elevated AST/ALT ratios indicate mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress, contributing to multiorgan injury in critically ill patients. Furthermore, AST/ALT levels correlate positively with inflammatory markers including CRP, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α, potentially amplifying inflammatory responses.

The observed nonlinear relationship reflects differential enzyme distribution and release kinetics. AST exists in both cytosolic (20%) and mitochondrial (80%) forms across multiple organs, whereas ALT is predominantly cytosolic and liver-specific. In early liver injury (AST/ALT ratio < 3.6), membrane permeability changes primarily release cytosolic enzymes. As injury progresses, mitochondrial damage releases mitochondrial AST, representing transition to extensive necro-inflammatory damage.

The attenuated mortality correlation beyond the 3.6 threshold likely results from hepatocyte exhaustion, enzyme clearance saturation, and cellular trans-differentiation. At higher ratios, extrahepatic factors including multiorgan failure become primary mortality determinants, with complications such as hepatorenal syndrome and coagulopathy predominating.

Alternative biomarkers demonstrated significant elevations in the highest AST/ALT tertile, including INR (2.0 ± 0.9 vs 1.7 ± 1.0, p < 0.001), total bilirubin (4.2 vs 1.8 mg/dL, p < 0.001), and creatinine (1.3 vs 1.1 mg/dL, p = 0.004). MELD and SOFA scores were also significantly higher in this tertile, confirming that multi-organ assessment becomes increasingly important beyond the established threshold. Importantly, AST elevations may partially reflect extra-hepatic tissue injury rather than solely hepatic dysfunction, potentially confounding observed associations.

### Fidelity of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) in differentiating skeletal muscle from liver damage [^116q6qYm]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

This study tested the hypothesis that gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) can be used as a reliable biomarker to distinguish skeletal muscle from liver damage. Twenty-eight Duchenne muscular dystrophy subjects with proven dystrophin gene mutations were enrolled. Included were 14 ambulatory and 14 nonambulatory patients with approximately half of each cohort taking corticosteroids. Twenty normal males served as controls. Initial blood samples for serum GGT and creatine kinase were taken between 8AM and 9AM and redrawn 8 hours later to test for variability. Between blood draws, subjects resumed normal activities in a play environment or could leave the clinic. Not a single duchenne muscular dystrophy patient showed a GGT outside the control range at any time point, while creatine kinase levels were 14 to 200 times normal. Validation of this finding is essential for management of patients with muscle disorders exposed to potentially hepatotoxic drugs for clinical management or monitoring subjects participating in clinical trials.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend to measure CK levels in patients with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms and objective muscle weakness.

### Serum creatine kinase: requesting and interpreting results [^116m285X]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Creatine kinase is an intracellular enzyme found abundantly in skeletal muscle, myocardium and brain. It is well known as a biomarker that increases following skeletal muscle damage and doctors instinctively associate it with myopathies. Serum creatine kinase is undoubtedly often raised in many myopathies and the extent of increase may provide a clue to the myopathic culprit. However, in other myopathies, it may be normal or only marginally raised, and rarely it is normal when the underlying pathology suggests that it should be very raised. Creatine kinase can also be raised in neurogenic disorders, and it can help in the investigation of some neurological disorders that are unrelated to neuromuscular disease. Finally, it may be discovered to be mysteriously elevated without a clear clinical correlate. Here, we examine each of these conundrums, beginning with the clinical problem at hand.

### Bench-to-bedside review: rhabdomyolysis – an overview for clinicians [^111dhbCP]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis ranges from an asymptomatic illness with elevation in the creatine kinase level to a life-threatening condition associated with extreme elevations in creatine kinase, electrolyte imbalances, acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Muscular trauma is the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis. Less common causes include muscle enzyme deficiencies, electrolyte abnormalities, infectious causes, drugs, toxins and endocrinopathies. Weakness, myalgia and tea-colored urine are the main clinical manifestations. The most sensitive laboratory finding of muscle injury is an elevated plasma creatine kinase level. The management of patients with rhabdomyolysis includes early vigorous hydration.

### What are the normal serum creatine kinase values for skeletal muscle? A worldwide systematic review [^113u56KG]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The statistical methods described focus solely on estimating medians and have not been developed to assess the pooled lower and upper boundaries of reference values across population groups. As a result, the lower and upper boundaries of the median confidence intervals did not align with the true reference values reported in the individual studies. Although methods for estimating reference ranges are available, these require studies to report their mean values or individual participant data, which did not apply to our studies. Given that reference values are crucial for clinical practice, we presented them descriptively, summarizing the ranges reported in the studies.

Finally, alongside the descriptive table, we illustrated our results graphically with forest plots whenever a meta‐analysis was feasible and pertinent (based on the heterogeneity analysis).

### Pioglitazone hcl and metformin hydrochloride [^117SQh8C]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

* Reactions that were more common in metformin than placebo-treated patients.

Laboratory Abnormalities

Pioglitazone

Hematologic Effects

Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first four to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects.

Creatine Phosphokinase

During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2,150 to 11,400 IU/L) and in no comparator- treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing, and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown.

Metformin

Vitamin B Concentrations

In metformin clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone and/or metformin.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

### Plasma glutamine status at intensive care unit admission: an independent risk factor for mortality in critical illness [^115ZWZ8y]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The regression analysis showed hyperglutaminemia as a strong mortality predictor also in addition to risk scoring and age. In a selected cohort, as ours, it is common that admission SOFA gives a higher prediction than SAPS 3 due to a stronger reflection of the actual organ failures.

Also, the previous finding of a cut-off for predicting mortality of 930 µmol/L was confirmed, and high plasma glutamine concentration is strengthened as an independent predictor of six-months mortality rate in the ICU setting.

The co-existence of hyperglutaminemia and liver conditions has been shown before. It has been connected to the hyperammonemia frequently found in liver conditions, but without any settled mechanism for this observation. Enteral glutamine loading has even been suggested as a diagnostic tool for hepatic encephalopathy, however, with limited external acceptance. Up-to-date differentiation of separate cohorts within the group of patients with liver conditions has enabled a more selective view upon the connection between hyperglutaminemia and compromised liver function. In our recent report over plasma glutamine levels in four different cohorts of liver conditions, a general connection between severity of liver disease and plasma glutamine levels was found (AUC for ROC curves 0.75 and 0.82 for Child–Pugh score and Model of End-stage Liver Disease score, respectively). Hyperglutaminemia was mainly confined to the cohorts with acute fulminant and acute on chronic liver diseases, while chronic liver disease and liver mass reduction by surgery only marginally deviated from normal.

The liver has a crucial role in glutamine metabolism and balance. An impaired liver function can therefore significantly contribute to deranged, high plasma glutamine levels. Accordingly, higher plasma concentrations of bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, and lactate were associated with high plasma glutamine in our cohort (Additional file 1: table 1A and 1B). Furthermore, it has been suggested that cell damage may result in high plasma glutamine, due to leakage of intracellular glutamine from the destroyed cells into plasma, as intracellular glutamine concentrations greatly exceed plasma concentration in many tissues. An elevated plasma creatine phosphokinase level as an indicator of cell damage is reported in sepsis patients with high plasma glutamine, which supports this hypothesis. Unfortunately, creatine phosphokinase is not a routine sample in our ICU and, therefore, this could not be explored in the present cohort.

### Serum alanine aminotransferase in skeletal muscle diseases [^112eRcGS]. Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Although elevation of the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) following liver injury is well known, confusion exists concerning skeletal muscle injury as the cause of this rise. We reviewed the records of 16 patients who had muscle necrosis without evidence of liver disease. The patients were divided into three groups: extreme exercise, polymyositis, and seizures. All patients exhibited markedly elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels consistent with muscle injury. In acute cases, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ALT were both elevated, and the AST/ALT ratio was greater than 3, but this ratio approached 1 after a few days because of a faster decline in AST. In conclusion, this difference in half-life accounts for the comparable AST and ALT levels in our cases with chronic muscle injury.

### Elevated creatine kinase levels, exercise, and isotretinoin for acne [^116XcKuN]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

There also appears to be a yet poorly understood synergism between isotretinoin and exercise. Chen and Rofskydocumented CK level elevations in 4 patients in whom the levels normalized with the discontinuation of either only isotretinoin or only exercise. The investigators also reported 1 patient who had normal CK levels while exercising alone or while on isotretinoin alone; however, the patient showed marked elevated serum CK levels while exercising when they were on isotretinoin therapy. This may suggest not only a synergy but also an inherent predisposition to developing elevated serum CK levels in certain individuals.

The gamma-glutamyl transferase levels were within the reference range during all evaluations for these individuals (and in all patients in our practice). This supports the findings by Webster et althat elevations in aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase levels most likely originate from muscle damage (not liver pathology), suggesting that CK may be a more accurate marker for muscle damage, and gamma-glutamyl transferase may differentiate liver pathology from muscle tissue damage with isotretinoin.

Further studies are needed to better determine potential interactions between risk factors (both innate and modifiable) for elevated serum CK and isotretinoin levels. Additional prospective studies can improve clinical management by determining ideal timing for CK (re-)evaluation. Studies suggest that traditional isotretinoin laboratory monitoring at 2 months/maximum therapeutic dose may be sufficient. However, as noted in our patients, CK elevations may occur sporadically and recur with supranormal activity levels. Although there are currently no official guidelines, dermatologists may also consider additional CK evaluation at approximately 96 hours (approximately 4 CK half-lives) after supranormal activity.

Until further studies determine the correlation between isotretinoin and CK, dermatologists should continue to inquire about physical activity and additional potential predisposing historic risk factors for elevated serum CK levels (eg, medical conditions such as genetic myopathies or poorly-controlled endocrinopathies, anabolic steroid/testosterone use, intramuscular injections, and medications such as antiepileptics). Although formal guidelines do not yet exist, baseline CK prior to isotretinoin therapy coupled with targeted regular and/or as-needed CK re-evaluations may benefit patients with more common additional potential risk factors (eg, young men engaged in regular, rigorous physical activity) for elevated serum CK and rhabdomyolysis.

3 Results

3.1 Literature Search and Assessment for Eligibility

The literature search results are summarized in a PRISMA flowchart in Figure 1. After removing duplicates, we screened for eligibility, which included 1996 titles and abstracts and 76 full texts. The main reasons for exclusion were as follows: only abstracts were available (primarily conference abstracts), differing aims, including laboratory manuals or statistical methods for measuring CK, opinion papers, or insufficient information on the population studied or measurements inconsistent with our scope (children only, non‐healthy participants, assessment of CK after exercise). Ultimately, 20 papers were considered eligible for inclusion in our review. No additional studies were identified from the references of the included documents or the updated search conducted after finalizing the manuscript.

### Hepatic biomarker abnormalities in the cardiac intensive care unit: proposed criteria for cardiohepatic syndrome [^114pEvnA]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Notably, while commonly termed as such, the biomarkers we labeled as LFTs do not necessarily reflect hepatic synthetic function. Each of these biomarkers can be elevated by numerous distinct processes, in many cases involving extrahepatic organ injury or dysfunction, and none is truly specific to liver disease. Indeed, it is likely that multiple underlying disease processes could have contributed to LFT abnormalities in each patient. Additional biomarkers that are used less frequently can clarify the presence of hepatocellular injury (eg, creatine kinase or lactate dehydrogenase), cholestasis (ALK isoenzymes, gamma-glutamyl transferase or direct bilirubin), or liver synthetic failure (albumin, prothrombin time or ammonia). Because these biomarkers were obtained less frequently in our population, we could not use them in our classification, preventing us from determining the source and etiology of LFT elevations in individual patients. Where available, these additional hepatic biomarkers generally trended in the same direction as the commonly available LFTs we used for classification and were more abnormal in patients with a greater extent or severity of LFT abnormality. The most common LFT abnormality we observed was an elevated AST, which in some cases may have been elevated due to myocardial necrosis in this cohort with a high prevalence of acute myocardial infarction — without creatine kinase for comparison, it is difficult to distinguish between muscle and liver origin of AST (and to a lesser extent ALT) elevations. Notably, AST and ALT levels correlated more strongly with measures of acidosis (eg, lactate, anion gap) than troponin T levels (data not shown), suggesting that hepatocellular injury from liver hypoperfusion was an important contributor to elevated AST and ALT levels overall.

### Acute kidney injury is independently associated with death in patients with cirrhosis [^112ZMfkb]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

However, there are several reasons why creatine-based definitions of AKI may perform differently in patients with liver disease. Cirrhotics are younger and have reduced muscle mass compared with other hospitalised patients. Severe hyperbilirubinaemia gives a falsely low value of serum creatine with chemical rather than the enzymatic measurement techniques. These factors may result in lower than expected baseline creatine values in this patient group relative to glomerular filtration rate. A small number of studies have begun to evaluate the current AKI criteria in cirrhotics. Some have focused on specific groups, such as those in intensive care or decompensated patients with ascites, which may limit their generalisability. The only prospective trial using robust AKIN definitions in a cirrhotic population was performed in four tertiary centres in the United States, but did not include a control group. These data may differ from European experience with a low proportion of compensated cirrhosis (only 2% had Child–Pugh class A disease), high incidence of hepatitis C (44%) and high rates of inpatient dialysis (24%). We therefore sought to add to these studies by further evaluating the utility of current diagnostic criteria for AKI in patients with cirrhosis and examine their association with patient outcomes.

### An evidence-based narrative review of the emergency department evaluation and management of rhabdomyolysis [^114XGSSo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a medical condition caused by muscle breakdown leading to potential renal damage. This can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not rapidly identified and treated.

Objective

This article provides an evidence-based narrative review of the diagnosis and management of rhabdomyolysis, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis is caused by the breakdown of muscle cells leading to the release of numerous intracellular molecules, including potassium, calcium, phosphate, uric acid, and creatinine kinase. There are a number of potential etiologies, including exertion, extreme temperature changes, ischemia, infections, immobility, drugs, toxins, endocrine causes, autoimmune reactions, trauma, or genetic conditions. Findings can include myalgias, muscle weakness, or dark-colored urine, but more often include non-specific symptoms. The diagnosis is often determined with an elevated creatinine kinase greater than five times the upper-limit of normal. Severe disease may result in renal failure, electrolyte derangements, liver disease, compartment syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Treatment includes addressing the underlying etiology, as well as aggressive intravenous hydration with a goal urine output of 300 mL/h. Bicarbonate, mannitol, and loop diuretics do not possess strong evidence for improved outcomes. Renal replacement therapy should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Most patients are admitted, though some may be appropriate for discharge.

Conclusion

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially dangerous medical condition requiring rapid diagnosis and management that may result in significant complications if not appropriately identified and treated. Emergency clinician knowledge of this condition is essential for appropriate management.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^112WZ4M1]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis

Exertional rhabdomyolysis is the combination of muscle symptoms (myalgia, weakness and swelling) and a substantial rise in serum CK (> 50 000 IU/L) in the setting of exercise. Serum CK rises after exercise are common and are asymptomatic in up to half of cases. Mean serum CK values 24 hours after marathons are 3322 IU/L for men (22× baseline) and 946 IU/L for women (9× baseline). The clinical significance of the serum CK concentration is unclear: 6000 IU/L has been cited as the minimum necessary for renal failurebut case reports indicate acute kidney injury may occur with a serum CK of 5000 IU/Land other studies suggest no safe serum concentration of CK. Pragmatically, a rise in CK to > 5000 U/L and/or evidence of end-organ damage (eg, myoglobinuria or decline in renal/liver function) is sufficient for a diagnosis of exertional rhabdomyolysis. Patients with exertional rhabdomyolysis may also experience fever, nausea and decreased/absent urine production. Supportive biochemical findings include hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypercalcaemia or hypocalcaemia and metabolic acidosis.

Most cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis are caused by heat-related injuries, specifically heat stroke and heat injury. The WHO's International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision includes four overlapping categories relating to exertional heat conditions (table 1). These symptoms are worth enquiring about since rhabdomyolysis in the context of a clear-cut heat-related condition usually does not require further investigation.

### Extrapulmonary clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients [^116iWb8T]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 3.
Mechanism of liver injury caused by COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to liver injury through different mechanisms including direct viral toxicity, SARS-CoV-2–induced cytokine storm SIRS and increased right atrial pressure and impeding venous return effect which result in liver damage. These liver injuries can be detected by abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and free fatty acids according to serum analysis.

Nonspecific neurological manifestations.

Few nonspecific neurological symptoms have been reported in COVID-19 patients with varying frequency. These include dizziness 16.8%), headache (13.1%), muscle injury leading to myalgia and increased serum creatine kinase (CK) (10.7%), neuralgia (2.3%), epilepsy (0.5%), and ataxia (0.5%)(Figure 3).

Stroke.

There are multiple evidence in the literature indicating that COVID-19 increases the risk of both venous and arterial thrombosis. COVID-19 patients with a new onset of ischemic stroke are more likely to have a severe SARS-CoV-2 presentation. COVID-19 patients manifest elevated right atrial pressure and impeding venous return which could contribute to the hepatic congestion. Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2–induced liver injuries are not completely well understood; however, some of the features of coronaviruses studied on previous studies on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are considerable.

Encephalitis and encephalopathy.

COVID-19 patients may present deterioration in conscious level and headache. This could be either followed by CNS infection or toxic encephalopathy. Encephalitis refers to the inflammatory lesions in the brain parenchyma which is accompanied by the neuronal damage and nerve tissue lesions. Moreover, infectious toxic encephalopathy is a type of reversible brain dysfunction syndrome that may occur because of SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet further investigations are required. Surprisingly, a rare form of encephalopathy called acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy has been reported.

### Ritlecitinib (Litfulo) [^114ZjQKE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5	Thromboembolic Events

An event of pulmonary embolism (PE) was reported in a patient receiving LITFULO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In a ritlecitinib higher dosing group, 1 patient reported an event of retinal artery occlusion.

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of overall thrombosis, DVT, and PE were observed compared to those treated with TNF blockers.

Avoid LITFULO in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If symptoms of thrombosis or embolism occur, patients should interrupt LITFULO and be evaluated promptly and treated appropriately.

5.6	Hypersensitivity

Serious reactions including anaphylactic reactions, urticaria and rash have been observed in patients receiving LITFULO in clinical trials. If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue LITFULO and institute appropriate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.7	Laboratory Abnormalities

Treatment with LITFULO was associated with decreases in lymphocytes and platelets [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Prior to LITFULO initiation, perform ALC and platelet counts [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. After initiating treatment with LITFULO, treatment interruption or discontinuation are recommended based on ALC and platelet count abnormalities [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Treatment with LITFULO was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT ≥ 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST ≥ 5 times the ULN were observed in patients in LITFULO clinical trials. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt LITFULO until this diagnosis is excluded.

Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevations – Treatment with LITFULO was associated with increased incidence of CPK elevation compared to placebo.

5.8	Vaccinations

No data are available on the response to vaccination in patients receiving LITFULO. Use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during or shortly prior to initiating treatment. Prior to initiating LITFULO, it is recommended that patients be brought up to date with all immunizations, including prophylactic herpes zoster vaccinations, in agreement with current immunization guidelines.

### Elevated glucose level leads to rapid COVID-19 progression and high fatality [^116SXEVm]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study reported important clinical indicators that are associated with COVID-19 disease progression and fatality. At the systemic level, a low lymphocyte count is an indication of a poor systematic immune response against the infection, whereas a high c-reactive protein level is an early indicator of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Besides, increased fibrinogen and platelets count concentrations are associated with increased coagulation activity in patients with infection or sepsis. This is particularly life-threatening for patients with pre-existing cerebro-or cardiovascular diseases, which is common among the elderly. In addition, an elevated creatine kinase-MB level, a know indicator for acute myocardial injury. Further, liver damage or dysfunction, marked by reduced albumin level and elevated direct bilirubin. Most of the remaining indicators may be associated with multiple organ injury or failure. Lactate dehydrogenase predicts the severity of tissue damage. As lactate dehydrogenase is largely present in lung tissues, when damaged by SARS-COV-2 infection, a large amount of lactate dehydrogenase into the circulation. This often clinically presents as a severe form of interstitial pneumonia and subsequently evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase level is also a predictor of endothelial damage, which caused microvascular thrombosis and associated with renal failure. Maintaining an effective systemic immune response against the infection and prevention of multiple organ failures are, therefore, the priorities in treating COVID-19 patients.

Our study has several limitations. First, this is a retrospective single-centre study, and almost half of patients did not have laboratory tests for interleukin-6, natriuretic peptide type B, supersensitive troponin I, myoglobin and procalcitonin levels within the first day after admission. Their role may be underestimated in the prediction of disease progression and fatality. Second, most patients on admission had moderate severity which may lead to a selection bias when identifying factors that affect progression or fatality. Additional cohort studies of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from areas outside Wuhan are needed to confirm our results. Third, considering both the small number of events and the rule of thumb on event per variable > 10, only limited risk factors were included in the multivariable analysis of severe and critically illness at admission to fatality during hospitalization. Fourth, most patients were referred from other medical institution, and the data at diagnosis was not accessible to us.

### A prediction model for acute respiratory distress syndrome in immunocompetent adults with adenovirus-associated pneumonia: a multicenter retrospective analysis [^116zp6uC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In terms of laboratory results, HAdVs associated with ARDS showed unfavorable levels of biomarkers of hepatic injury (elevated transaminase and total bilirubin, decreased albumin), cardiac injury (elevated creatine kinase and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB), and kidney injury (elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen). Furthermore, the data on complications gathered in this study, together with the previous cases, confirm that HAdV-associated ARDS that occurred along with one or more organ injuries (including liver, kidney, and cardiac) was common in adult immunocompetent patients. The reasons for this are multifactorial, and the specific mechanisms remain unclear. We speculate that there could be three reasons for this: (i) increased virulence and pathogenicity or altered tissue tropism due to HAdV mutation or recombination, (ii) co-infections due to hospital setting or invasive management, and (iii) overexposure to hepatotoxic drugs, nephrotoxic drugs, or cardiotoxic drugs during treatment. Furthermore, LDH, a general indicator of tissue damage found in almost all body cells, was higher in patients who showed progression to ARDS than in those who did not. More importantly, we found that elevated LDH levels were associated with a greater risk of developing HAdV-associated ARDS, suggesting a possible relationship between tissue damage and incidence of HAdV-associated ARDS.

### Liver-related aspects of valoctocogene roxaparvovec gene therapy for hemophilia A: expert guidance for clinical practice [^114nmsMq]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Postinfusion ALT and FVIII monitoring

In the GENEr8–1 study, ALT elevations usually occurred within 26 weeks after valoctocogene roxaparvovec infusion. In a less selected, real-life patient population, including those with advanced age and previous HCV infection, ALT elevation is expected to be even more frequent and persistent than that reported in the GENEr8–1 study. After gene therapy, ALT levels should be monitored according to SmPC/PI recommendations (every 1–2 weeks in the first year; Table 3). To minimize the impact of interlaboratory variability, we recommend that the same laboratory used for hepatic testing before gene therapy is used for liver function monitoring after treatment. The relationship between ALT elevation and FVIII expression is currently unclear, and FVIII levels should be monitored in conjunction with ALT. Pharmacokinetic modeling has indicated that, although declining over time, FVIII activity levels will remain in the mild hemophilia range for ≥ 5 years after valoctocogene roxaparvovec infusion. Many questions remain as to why FVIII expression decreases after gene therapy, but it is possible that the production of FVIII in hepatocytes, which are not the natural site of FVIII synthesis, activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, potentially contributing to a reduction in protein expression over time, although evidence for this hypothesis is contradictory. Preliminary data presented at the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders conference in 2024 suggest that the decline in FVIII expression may also occur due to reduced transcription of episomal vector DNA to RNA in hepatocytesor from epigenetic silencing mechanisms linked to the activity of histone deacetylase. However, further research is needed to confirm these mechanisms.

Table 3.
Recommended monitoring frequency of ALT after valoctocogene roxaparvovec gene therapy for HA

In the first year after gene therapy, ALT and FVIII monitoring should be conducted to detect immune-mediated increases in ALT that should be treated with immunosuppressant therapy and that may be accompanied by decreased FVIII activity as a potential consequence of immune-mediated cell damage. However, there is currently no evidence-based threshold for FVIII or ALT levels in this setting. To help rule out alternative causes for ALT elevations (eg, drug-induced hepatotoxicity and alcohol consumption), AST and creatine phosphokinase monitoring is also recommended. After the first year of monitoring, ALT and FVIII testing should be continued to routinely assess liver health and bleeding risk.

### Serum microRNA ‑ 122 for assessment of acute liver injury in patients with extensive skeletal muscle damage [^111b44vo]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum level of microRNA-122 (miR-122) has been reported as a sensitive diagnostic biomarker for detecting liver injury, comparable to the aminotransferases. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities are increased in other conditions, such as acute skeletal muscle injury (ASMI). We determined whether miR-122 is nonspecifically increased in patients suffering from ASMI.

Methods

We measured ALT, AST, creatine kinase (CK), and miR-122 in 3 groups: healthy controls (n = 24), patients with ASMI (total n = 29, 11 with recreational drug use and 18 without recreational drug use), and patients with acute liver injury (ALI; n = 14).

Results

Levels of ALT, AST, and CK increased 83%, 97%, and 100% for patients with ASMI and 100% for all 3 enzymes in ALI patients. In contrast, miR-122 increased in 34% of patients with ASMI (44.4% with recreational drug use and 18.2% without recreational drug use) and 100% of ALI patients. In 2 drug-induced liver injury cases, miR-122 increased about 12–24 hours before ALT and AST.

Conclusion

Recreational drug misuse is associated with both rhabdomyolysis and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The traditional liver function markers AST and ALT were nonspecifically increased in the majority of patients with ASMI. miR-122 is only increased in patients at risk for DILI and demonstrates superior specificity for liver injury.

### Liver involvement associated with dengue infection in adults in Vietnam [^114WUuC1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Although these results indicate that most adults with dengue infection have some degree of hepatic involvement, an additional non-hepatic source of AST could explain the pattern observed. Alanine aminotransferase is primarily associated with hepatocytes, with minimal activity in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and AST is found in erythrocytes, cardiac and skeletal muscle, and kidney and brain tissue, and is often elevated because of damage to those sources and in response to hepatic damage. Given the prominence of musculoskeletal symptoms among adults with dengue, skeletal muscle injury could contribute to the elevation in AST levels. The plasma half-life of AST is shorter than that of ALT, but it is possible that the slower improvement in ALT levels simply reflects slower evolution of the hepatic disease than of the musculoskeletal problems. We were unable to investigate specific muscle enzymes or isoforms in this study, but creatine kinase levels are known to be elevated during the acute phase of dengue infection. In combination with other simple laboratory tests, transaminase levels, particularly AST levels, have been suggested as a potential marker to help differentiate dengue from other viral infections during the early febrile phase. However, mild-to-moderate increases in transaminase levels, with AST higher than ALT levels, are a non-specific finding that may be observed in a number of other infections such as typhoid fever and malaria, and in alcohol-related hepatitis.

### CSF1R inhibition in patients with advanced solid tumors or tenosynovial giant cell tumor: a phase I study of vimseltinib [^1133ah74]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The majority of non-laboratory TEAEs were of low-grade (grade 1/2) severity for patients with TGCT or MST (Table 1; Supplementary Table S6). Grade 3/4 TEAEs in > 5% of patients with TGCT included increases in blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK; 31%), AST (13%), lipase (9%), amylase (6%), and hypertension (6%). Increases in blood CPK were not associated with skeletal muscle injury or other organ damage. CPK increase is consistent with the known mechanism of action of CSF1R inhibitors and not clinically relevant. No postbaseline bilirubin elevations were observed, and there was no evidence of cholestatic hepatotoxicity or drug-induced liver injury. TEAEs led to dose reduction and treatment discontinuation in 63% (20 of 32) and 6% (2 of 32) of patients with TGCT, respectively (Supplementary Table S7). Two serious treatment-related TEAEs were reported in patients with TGCT (both in cohort 5 receiving 30 mg twice weekly): metabolic encephalopathy (n = 1) and vaginal hemorrhage (n = 1). The patient with metabolic encephalopathy had a history of fatty liver disease, increased AST, and excessive alcohol intake during time on study and recovered from this AE; the patient with vaginal hemorrhage was perimenopausal with a history of adenomyosis, and vaginal hemorrhage did not recur following rechallenge with vimseltinib. In TGCT cohorts, 17 patients (53%) discontinued treatment for reasons including AEs (n = 2), physician decision (n = 2), progressive disease (PD; by investigator radiological assessment, n = 2), withdrawal by patient (n = 10), and other (n = 1). Additional information about the 10 patients that withdrew consent is not available. There were no deaths due to treatment-related TEAEs in patients with TGCT or MST.

### Binimetinib (Mektovi) [^112twkEi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Hepatotoxicity

Hepatotoxicity can occur when MEKTOVI is administered in combination with encorafenib. In COLUMBUS, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib was 6% for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 2.6% for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 0.5% for alkaline phosphatase. No patient experienced Grade 3 or 4 serum bilirubin elevation. In PHAROS, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib was 10% for AST, 9% for ALT, and 3.2% for alkaline phosphatase.

Monitor liver laboratory tests before initiation of MEKTOVI, monthly during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.7 Rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis can occur when MEKTOVI is administered in combination with encorafenib. In COLUMBUS, elevation of laboratory values of serum CPK occurred in 58% of patients treated with MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib. In patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma receiving MEKTOVI with encorafenib (n = 690), rhabdomyolysis was reported in 1 patient (0.1%). In PHAROS, elevation of laboratory values of serum creatine kinase (CK) occurred in 41% of patients treated with MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib. No patient experienced rhabdomyolysis.

Monitor CPK and creatinine levels prior to initiating MEKTOVI, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Fenofibrate (fenoglide) [^111fDNrs]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

5.4 Skeletal Muscle

Treatment with fenofibrate increases risk of myopathy. Treatment with fenofibrate increases risk of rhabdomyolysis, usually in patients with impaired renal function. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels.

Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. CPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and fenofibrate therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed.

5.5 Serum Creatinine

Elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown.

### Elevated creatine kinase levels, exercise, and isotretinoin for acne [^112WBmNK]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 44% of patients on isotretinoin develop elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), a proxy for potential muscle tissue damage. Mild elevations are typically transient and well-tolerated, whereas marked elevations can indicate rhabdomyolysis (CK level of ≥ 5 times the reference range [approximately 200 IU/L]) and can be life-threatening. Here, we present 2 physically active patients with clinically divergent presentations of elevated serum CK levels during isotretinoin therapy.

### Study of the relationship between liver function markers and traumatic rhabdomyolysis: a retrospective study of hemorrhagic patients admitted to intensive care unit in a level I trauma center [^113CoZus]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic rhabdomyolysis (RM) is common and contributes to the development of medical complications, of which acute renal failure is the best described. Some authors have described an association between elevated aminotransferases and RM, suggesting the possibility of associated liver damage. Our study aims to evaluate the relationship between liver function and RM in hemorrhagic trauma patients.

Methods

This is a retrospective observational study conducted in a level 1 trauma center analyzing 272 severely injured patients transfused within 24 hours and admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from January 2015 to June 2021. Patients with significant direct liver injury (abdominal Abbreviated Injury Score [AIS] > 3) were excluded. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed, and groups were stratified according to the presence of intense RM (creatine kinase [CK] > 5000 U/L). Liver failure was defined by a prothrombin time (PT)-ratio < 50% and an alanine transferase (ALT) > 500 U/L simultaneously. Correlation analysis was performed using Pearson's or Spearman's coefficient depending on the distribution after log transformation to evaluate the association between serum CK and biological markers of hepatic function. Risk factors for the development of liver failure were defined with a stepwise logistic regression analysis of all relevant explanatory factors significantly associated with the bivariate analysis.

Results

RM (CK > 1000 U/L) was highly prevalent in the global cohort (58.1%), and 55 (23.2%) patients presented with intense RM. We found a significant positive correlation between RM biomarkers (CK and myoglobin) and liver biomarkers (aspartate transferase [AST], ALT, and bilirubin). Log-CK was positively correlated with log-AST (r = 0.625, P < .001) and log-ALT (r = 0.507, P < .001) and minimally with log-bilirubin (r = 0.262, P < .001). Intensive care unit stays were longer for intense RM patients (7 [4–18] days vs 4 [2–11] days, P < .001). These patients required increased renal replacement therapy use (4.1% vs 20.0%, P < .001) and transfusion requirements. Liver failure was more common (4.6% vs 18.2%, P < .001) for intense RM patients. It was associated with bivariate and multivariable analysis with intense RM (odds ratio [OR], 4.51 [1.11–19.2]; p = 0.034), need for renal replacement therapy, and Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA) score on day 1.

Conclusions

Our study established the presence of an association between trauma-related RM and classical hepatic biomarkers. Liver failure was associated with the presence of intense RM in bivariate and multivariable analysis. Traumatic RM could have a role in the development of other system failures, specifically at the hepatic level, in addition to the already known and well-described renal failure.

The adverse activity of H-Zt/g4-MMAE in liver function was evident by elevation of ALT, ALP, and AST (Fig. 6 d and Additional file 2: Table S3). At day 29, levels of all enzymes were restored to the normal range. Hepatic histology examination did not find any evidence of liver structural damages (Additional file 1: Figure S7). A significant increase in LDH and CPK was observed in a dose-dependent manner after H-Zt/g4-MMAE injection (Fig. 5 e), suggesting that functions of other tissues such as muscle could be impaired by H-Zt/g4-MMAE. Nevertheless, the elevated LDH and CPK levels were restored to the baseline within a short period, indicating the effect of H-Zt/g4-MMAE is temporary and reversible. Again, histological analysis of muscle and heart showing no pathological evidences of tissue damage (Additional file 1: Figure S7).

### Rhabdomyolysis-Go big or go home [^1168dPJj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the occurrence of renal injury in hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis among a series of patients presenting to an urban emergency department.

Methods

A retrospective chart review between January 2006 and February 2017 was conducted on patients aged 21–65 years old that were admitted with a diagnosis of Rhabdomyolysis. We included patients with an initial serum creatinine (Cr) level < 1.3 mg/dL and an initial serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level > 1000 U/L. We excluded patients with preexisting renal disease, hypertension, diabetes, patients currently on medications in the statin class, patients with muscular dystrophy and neuromuscular disorders.

Results

One hundred and fifteen patients (100 men, 15 women) were enrolled, with a mean age of 36 years old. The mean CPK at presentation was 18,965 U/L and the highest CPK was 168,300 U/L. The mean Cr upon presentation was 0.95 mg/dL. The average length of stay of our patients was 4.6 days. The longest length of stay was 30 days and the shortest was 1 day. Seven patients had hospital stays longer than 10 days. None of the patients had prolonged admissions due to rhabdomyolysis alone. The patient admitted for 30 days had a protracted admission due to liver failure and sepsis thought to be unrelated to Rhabdomyolysis. No patients that fit our inclusion criteria developed renal insufficiency (Cr > 1.3 mg/dL) or failure regardless of their CPK upon presentation, peak CPK or therapies received during their hospitalization.

Conclusion

Patients in our data set that presented to the Emergency Department with a CPK of > 1000 U/L and a Cr of < 1.3 mg/dL that were hospitalized with a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis are not at risk for developing renal insufficiency or failure if treated promptly with fluid rehydration, regardless of their initial CPK values.

### Impact of statin dosing intensity on transaminase and creatine kinase [^115xgyiS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Higher intensity statin therapy reduces cardiovascular events more than lower intensity therapy, but the safety impact of higher intensity therapy is unknown. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing higher versus lower intensity therapy on liver and muscle safety.

Methods

A systematic literature search through January 2006 was conducted to identify randomized trials comparing higher versus lower intensity statin therapy meeting our criteria. Weighted averages were reported as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (random-effects model). Statistical heterogeneity scores were assessed with the Q statistic and L'Abbe plots. Publication bias was assessed with the Egger weighted regression and funnel plots.

Results

Higher intensity statin therapy increased the incidence of transaminase elevations (RR 3.10 [95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.88–7.85]) versus lower intensity statin therapy. When studies of hydrophilic and lipophilic statins were evaluated separately, higher intensity hydrophilic statin therapy increased the risk for transaminase elevations (RR 3.54 [95% CI, 1.83–6.85]), but higher intensity lipophilic therapy did not (RR 1.58 [95% CI, 0.81–3.08]). The risk of creatine kinase (CK) elevations showed a trend toward an increase (RR 2.63 [95% CI, 0.88–7.85]) with higher intensity therapy. No occurrences of CK elevations occurred in studies evaluating hydrophilic statins, whereas lipophilic statins showed an increased risk with higher intensity therapy (RR 6.09 [95% CI, 1.36–27.35]).

Conclusions

More aggressive statin therapy increases the incidence of transaminase elevations in clinical trials versus lower intensity therapy. Increases in transaminases may be more problematic when hydrophilic statins are used aggressively, whereas CK elevations are more problematic with higher intensity lipophilic statin therapy.

### Case report: lactic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis during telbivudine and tenofovir treatment for chronic hepatitis B [^116pLSqK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Current treatment options for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are pegylated interferon alpha and nucleoside analogues (NAs). NAs have relatively fewer side effects than interferon alpha, and generally well tolerated. Previously 12.9% of patients on telbivudine treatment were reported to develop severe elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, but related clinical disease, like lactic acidosis (LA) and rhabdomyolysis (RM) were rare. The pathophysiology may be mitochondrial toxicity, for the NAs inhibit not only hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase, but also the host mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. As mitochondria are the main sites of oxidative phosphorylation, there will be an increase of pyruvate reduction to lactic acid and insufficient adenosine triphosphate. The accumulation of lactic acid causes LA, while lack of energy leads to cell dysfunction and mitochondria-associated disease, including RM. All five NAs, except tenofovir, have been reported causing LA and RM. Here we report the first case of CHB patients developing fatal LA and RM during telbivudine and tenofovir treatment.

Case Presentation

The patient is a 51-year-old man who was hospitalized in November 2015. He had taken telbivudine regularly because of CHB. Later, tenofovir was added to antiviral treatment because of HBV resistance. Then he had myalgia, chest tightness and anorexia. The blood lactate was 12.7 mmol/L. The arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.25, base excess 21.1 mmol/L. CPK was 991 U/L, myoglobin was 1745 ng/ml and creatine was 83 μmol/L. Abdomen magnetic resonance revealed cirrhosis. Muscle biopsy revealed myogenic lesion with abnormality of mitochondria and fat metabolism. The patient was diagnosed with Hepatitis B envelope Antigen positive CHB, cirrhosis, LA and RM characterized by myalgia and elevated myoglobin. He was given tenofovir alone as antiviral treatment instead. After hemodialysis and 4 weeks' treatment of corticosteroids, his symptoms recovered, and blood lactate gradually returned to a normal range.

Conclusions

This case shows that tenofovir may trigger muscle damage and fatal RM in combination with telbivudine treatment in CHB patients. Thus, patients receiving tenofovir and telbivudine should be closely monitored for muscular abnormalities, blood lactate level and other mitochondrial toxicity associated side effects.

### Relationship between creatine kinase and liver enzymes in war wounded with rhabdomyolysis [^1168HowY]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a frequent complication in war wounded. Its complex pathophysiology suggests that it not only affects kidneys but also other organs such as the liver. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between creatine kinase (CK) and liver enzymes in war wounded with rhabdomyolysis.

Methods

War wounded admitted to the intensive care unit of Percy Military Hospital between 2009 and 2017 with a rhabdomyolysis (CK peak > 1,000 U/L) were included. They were divided in two groups: mild (CK peak < 10,000 U/L) and severe rhabdomyolysis (CK peak ≥ 10,000 U/L). Demographic characteristics, peaks in transaminases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, and CK were recorded. Mann Whitney-U test and, Fisher's exact test were used as appropriate. A Pearson's correlation test was used to determine the correlation between CK and liver enzymes after a log-normal transformation of the data.

Results

Fifty-one patients were included (31 in the mild and 20 in the severe rhabdomyolysis group). Patients in the severe rhabdomyolysis group were more likely victims of explosions (85% vs 39%, p = 0.003). The transaminases peak was significantly higher in the severe rhabdomyolysis group (median AST peak 398 (270–944) vs 91 (63–157) U/L, p < 0.0001, and median ALT peak 106 (77–235) vs 45 (34–71) U/L, p < 0.0001). Bilirubin and ALP were higher in the severe rhabdomyolysis group (39 (25–49) vs 14(11–23) U/L, p = 0.0031 and 84 (55–170) vs 52 (39–85) U/L, p = 0.0063, respectively). We found a significant positive linear correlation between CK and ALT (r = 0.73, p < 0.0001), AST (r = 0.89, p < 0.0001), ALP (r = 0.41, p = 0.0035), and bilirubin (r = 0.37, p = 0.0083).

Conclusion

We found a statistically significant positive correlation between CK and liver enzymes in rhabdomyolysis war wounded, indicating that hepatic damage occurs when rhabdomyolysis is severe and associated with elevated bilirubin and ALP. Further studies are needed to confirm this phenomenon and elucidate the pathophysiological mechanism.

### Gemfibrozil (Lopid) [^113YnoUA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

3. Since a reduction of mortality from coronary heart disease has not been demonstrated and because liver and interstitial cell testicular tumors were increased in rats, LOPID should be administered only to those patients described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. If a significant serum lipid response is not obtained, LOPID should be discontinued.

4. Concomitant Anticoagulants – Caution should be exercised when warfarin is given in conjunction with LOPID. The dosage of warfarin should be reduced to maintain the prothrombin time at the desired level to prevent bleeding complications. Frequent prothrombin determinations are advisable until it has been definitely determined that the prothrombin level has stabilized.

5. The concomitant administration of LOPID with simvastatin is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS). Concomitant therapy with LOPID and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is associated with an increased risk of skeletal muscle toxicity manifested as rhabdomyolysis, markedly elevated creatine kinase (CPK) levels, and myoglobinuria, leading in a high proportion of cases to acute renal failure and death. IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD AN UNSATISFACTORY LIPID RESPONSE TO EITHER DRUG ALONE, THE BENEFIT OF COMBINED THERAPY WITH LOPID AND an HMG-CoA REDUCTASE INHIBITOR DOES NOT OUTWEIGH THE RISKS OF SEVERE MYOPATHY, RHABDOMYOLYSIS, AND ACUTE RENAL FAILURE (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). The use of fibrates alone, including LOPID, may occasionally be associated with myositis. Patients receiving LOPID and complaining of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness should have prompt medical evaluation for myositis, including serum creatine–kinase level determination. If myositis is suspected or diagnosed, LOPID therapy should be withdrawn.

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium (Caduet) [^116SK9tJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Discontinue CADUET if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if CADUET is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue CADUET in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the CADUET dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.2	Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persists despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG-CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue CADUET if IMNM is suspected.

5.3	Hepatic Dysfunction

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of atorvastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 0.7% of patients receiving atorvastatin in clinical trials. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin.

Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Consider liver enzyme testing before atorvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin.

5.4	Increased Angina and Myocardial Infarction

Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.

### Macro-AST: misleading finding in an adolescent with MCAD-deficiency [^115C7rVZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

MCAD-deficiency can lead to organ damage (especially skeletal- and heart muscle, liver, brain) as a result of cellular energy deficiency and/or accumulation of endogenous toxic intermediates. Hypoketotic hypoglycaemia based (amongst other factors) on compromised hepatic ketogenesis from fatty acids is another pathophysiological mechanism leading to encephalopathy during prolonged fasting or intercurrent illness. Organ dysfunction is triggered by longer episodes of catabolism (febrile infection/prolonged fasting) and can usually be prevented by administering carbohydrates. Cell damage leads to spill-over of intracellular enzymes like AST, ALT, creatine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase into the blood circulation. Usually, this does not occur when the patient is well nor does it lead to isolated leakage of intracellular AST. However, metabolites accumulating in MCAD-deficiency are known to be toxic and may lead to organ dysfunction in the long run. There are no large prospective studies describing the outcome of patients diagnosed by neonatal mass screening in adulthood. Therefore, the assumption by the general practitioner that sustained, isolated AST-elevation indicated organ damage in our patient was reasonable. We could show that isolated AST-elevation in this MCAD-patient was caused by macro-AST. This was not a congenital condition as AST-levels were normal initially.

Macro-AST has been described in the literature as a benign condition due to binding of AST to macromolecules like immunoglobulins (e.g.). These complexes cannot be excreted via the kidneys, therefore their half-life is extended. In our patient, we found elevated immunoglobulin E resulting from an allergic disposition while all other immunoglobulins were normal. In most cases described so far, AST was complexed with immunoglobulins A, M and G.

Macro-AST has not only been described in healthy persons but also in patients with hepatic diseases like hepatitis C or malignancies and chronic liver disease. Macro-AST or isolated AST-elevation is not a common feature in MCAD-deficiency. As Macro-AST is fairly common in the general population macro-AST in our MCAD-patient is coincidental.

### What are the normal serum creatine kinase values for skeletal muscle? A worldwide systematic review [^112u7TzE]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Serum creatine kinase (CK) has been used as a diagnostic marker for neuromuscular disorders since 1959. As manufacturer‐provided normative data indicate, CK levels can be elevated in normal individuals. Recent evidence suggests these data often underestimate true CK values, which are influenced by age, race, gender, and other physiological factors. Therefore, establishing a reliable normal range for CK is crucial before further investigation, particularly in oligo/asymptomatic patients.

Objective

This systematic review aims to determine the normal CK levels across various populations.

Methods

We systematically reviewed observational studies with a cross‐sectional, descriptive design. We included studies focusing on healthy adults (> 18 years) of any race who aimed to establish normal CK values, including at least 100 participants. We utilized the following databases: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane.

Results

CK values typically exhibit a non‐Gaussian distribution. Black individuals demonstrate significantly higher CK values compared to Caucasians and Asians. The upper reference limits for CK in Caucasian and Asian males range from 227–440 U/L, while for Black males, it is between 520–810 U/L. The upper reference limits for females range from 135–248 U/L and up to 354 U/L, respectively.

Conclusions

Normal CK values might be higher than previously suggested, especially among specific racial groups. Each laboratory should ideally determine its reference values for CK that reflect its local population.

### Rhabdomyolysis in intensive care unit-distinctive clinical indicators and prognosis [^1169CFtE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a serious medical condition characterized by the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue. This process leads to the release of various cellular components into the bloodstream and surrounding tissues, including proteins such as myoglobin and enzymes like creatine kinase (CK), as well as electrolytes. The severity of rhabdomyolysis can vary significantly, ranging from mild cases with minimal symptoms and slightly elevated CK levels to severe, life-threatening cases. Although traumatic injury is a common cause, a wide range of other factors can also trigger this condition. Previous studies and our research have confirmed that factors such as infection, certain medications, pancreatitis, alcohol consumption, electrolyte imbalance, excessive physical exertion, and heatstroke can also lead to elevated CK. The diverse range of potential causes underscores the complexity of this condition and the importance of considering rhabdomyolysis in various clinical scenarios.

Given the diverse etiology of rhabdomyolysis, patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) with critical illnesses are particularly susceptible to developing rhabdomyolysis. This condition can lead to severe complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome(MODS). Previous studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and the incidence of AKI. Despite its clinical significance, the specific characteristics and risk factors contributing to mortality or adverse outcomes in ICU patients with rhabdomyolysis are not fully understood. Moreover, the relationship between elevated serum CK levels and increased patient mortality remains controversial. In light of these uncertainties, the objective of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of ICU patients diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and to determine whether rhabdomyolysis constitutes a risk factor for outcomes within this patient population.

### Asymptomatic / pauci-symptomatic creatine kinase elevations (hyperckemia) [^116V6LpS]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Neuromuscular clinicians are frequently asked to evaluate patients referred for asymptomatic elevations in creatine kinase (CK), a catalytic enzyme that combines creatine and ATP to form phosphocreatine and ADP. This reaction is crucial for cellular energy generation and metabolism. This laboratory finding, often referred to in simplified lexicon as asymptomatic hyperCKemia, continues to generate controversy at several levels, including definition, the extent of evaluation, and the yield of diagnostic testing. In this review, we summarize the literature based on series of patients with asymptomatic hyperCKemia and provide a rational clinical approach to reveal identifiable underlying causes.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^111Xh7su]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is the combination of symptoms (myalgia, weakness and muscle swelling) and a substantial rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) > 50 000 IU/L; there are many causes, but here we specifically address exertional rhabdomyolysis. The consequences of this condition can be severe, including acute kidney injury and requirement for higher level care with organ support. Most patients have 'physiological' exertional rhabdomyolysis with no underlying disease; they do not need investigation and should be advised to return to normal activities in a graded fashion. Rarely, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the initial presentation of underlying muscle disease, and we review how to identify this much smaller group of patients, who do require investigation.

### Significance of alanine aminotransferase levels in patients admitted for cocaine intoxication [^11212KfT]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Experimental studies in animal models and case reports in humans have described the hepatotoxic potential of cocaine. However, there are few data regarding the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients admitted for cocaine intoxication, particularly regarding the status of the liver enzymes.

Goal

To investigate the significance of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in individuals hospitalized for acute cocaine intoxication.

Methods

Retrospective study with standardized chart review that included patients admitted between January 2003 and December 2010. Bivariate analyses were used to investigate factors associated with ALT above the upper tertile according to gender. Cases of marked ALT elevation were described in detail.

Results

Ninety-three patients were included (79% men, mean age of 27.73 ± 9.97 y). ALT above the upper tertile was associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine phosphokinase, creatinine, and international normalized ratio. Higher levels of ALT were also related to acute renal failure and death. Five subjects had severe ALT elevation during follow-up and all had evidence of hepatocellular dysfunction (jaundice, prolonged prothrombin time with or without hepatic encephalopathy), rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. AST/ALT ratio < 2 was present in 2 subjects with severe ALT elevation at admission, but AST/ALT ratio > 2 was observed in 3 cases with evidence of progression to acute liver injury.

Conclusions

In acute cocaine intoxication, higher ALT levels were associated with evidence of muscle damage, progression to acute renal failure, and death. Severe liver damage was observed in 5% of the sample and was associated with rhabdomyolysis and renal failure in all cases.

### Rhabdomyolysis secondary to interaction between atorvastatin and fusidic acid [^111agdN2]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old ill-looking man presented with nausea and vomiting. He had been on fusidic acid 500 mg three times a day and linezolid 600 mg twice a day for 2 weeks for right knee methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection post right knee arthroscopy performed a month previously. He had been on atorvastatin 40 mg daily and Aspirin 75 mg once a day for a year. His investigations showed elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (759 IU/litre) and transaminases (aspartate transaminase (AST) 58 IU/litre and alanine transaminase (ALT) 123 IU/litre). Atorvastatin was discontinued and the patient was treated with intravenous fluids, a proton pump inhibitor, antiemetics and discharged with follow-up in 2 days for repeat blood results. The patient presented 5 days later with rhabdomyolysis and acute hepatitis. His antibiotics (fusidic acid and linezolid) were stopped. The patient was managed conservatively with intravenous fluids and was transferred for possible dialysis but did not need it. After 3 weeks investigations showed normal urea, creatinine, electrolytes, CPK and liver function tests suggesting earlier rise in transaminases secondary to muscle damage rather than liver. The patient had intensive physiotherapy and his mobility improved, and he was discharged home. The case was reported to pharmacovigilance services.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^112mcruX]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic approach to DILI

DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, relying on a detailed medical history including medication exposure, the pattern and course of liver biochemistry tests before and after drug discontinuation, and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. The initial laboratory testing for DILI includes serum aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and total and direct bilirubin levels, whereas serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) levels are a marker of severity (Figure 1). Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: (1) serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; (2) total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl along with elevated serum AST, ALT, or ALP level; or (3) INR > 1.5 with elevated serum AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI may present with lower levels of laboratory abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries because of NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^111AXKbt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Associated conditions and screening considerations notes that for persistently abnormal liver chemistries, screening should be considered for celiac disease with testing that consists of tissue transglutaminase IgA, and serum IgA level or tissue transglutaminase IgA and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide IgG; that disorders of striated muscle may additionally cause abnormal AST/ALT levels with predominant involvement of AST and screening may be considered with creatine kinase and/or aldolase levels; that both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been associated with abnormal liver enzymes and screening should be considered with initial thyroid stimulating hormone and selective free T4 and free/total T3; that liver disorders of pregnancy are uncommon but critically important to identify due to maternal–fetal risks; and that liver biopsy is rarely required to establish a diagnosis and guide management.

### Risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis in patients with hepatic impairment [^115uYsCv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We describe a case of a 54-year-old man with a 2-month history of biliary colic associated with a common bile duct stone. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and developed postoperative acute kidney injury stage 3. A renal biopsy was performed and demonstrated myoglobin in the renal tubules. Retrospective creatine kinase analysis was suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. It is thought this was precipitated by simvastatin accumulation in the context of a period of hepatic impairment and elevated liver enzymes.

### What are the normal serum creatine kinase values for skeletal muscle? A worldwide systematic review [^111gVkKH]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum creatine kinase (CK) has been used as a diagnostic marker for neuromuscular disorders since 1959. As manufacturer-provided normative data indicate, CK levels can be elevated in normal individuals. Recent evidence suggests these data often underestimate true CK values, which are influenced by age, race, gender, and other physiological factors. Therefore, establishing a reliable normal range for CK is crucial before further investigation, particularly in oligo/asymptomatic patients.

Objective

This systematic review aims to determine the normal CK levels across various populations.

Methods

We systematically reviewed observational studies with a cross-sectional, descriptive design. We included studies focusing on healthy adults (> 18years) of any race who aimed to establish normal CK values, including at least 100 participants. We utilized the following databases: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane.

Results

CK values typically exhibit a non-Gaussian distribution. Black individuals demonstrate significantly higher CK values compared to Caucasians and Asians. The upper reference limits for CK in Caucasian and Asian males range from 227–440U/L, while for Black males, it is between 520–810U/L. The upper reference limits for females range from 135–248U/L and up to 354U/L, respectively.

Conclusions

Normal CK values might be higher than previously suggested, especially among specific racial groups. Each laboratory should ideally determine its reference values for CK that reflect its local population.

### Gemfibrozil [^117GVNp8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

3. Since a reduction of mortality from coronary heart disease has not been demonstrated and because liver and interstitial cell testicular tumors were increased in rats, gemfibrozil should be administered only to those patients described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. If a significant serum lipid response is not obtained, gemfibrozil should be discontinued.

4. Concomitant Anticoagulants – Caution should be exercised when warfarin is given in conjunction with gemfibrozil. The dosage of warfarin should be reduced to maintain the prothrombin time at the desired level to prevent bleeding complications. Frequent prothrombin determinations are advisable until it has been definitely determined that the prothrombin level has stabilized.

5. The concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with simvastatin is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS). Concomitant therapy with gemfibrozil and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is associated with an increased risk of skeletal muscle toxicity manifested as rhabdomyolysis, markedly elevated creatine kinase (CPK) levels, and myoglobinuria, leading in a high proportion of cases to acute renal failure and death. IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD AN UNSATISFACTORY LIPID RESPONSE TO EITHER DRUG ALONE, THE BENEFIT OF COMBINED THERAPY WITH GEMFIBROZIL AND an HMG-CoA REDUCTASE INHIBITOR DOES NOT OUTWEIGH THE RISKS OF SEVERE MYOPATHY, RHABDOMYOLYSIS, AND ACUTE RENAL FAILURE (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). The use of fibrates alone, including gemfibrozil, may occasionally be associated with myositis. Patients receiving gemfibrozil and complaining of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness should have prompt medical evaluation for myositis, including serum creatine–kinase level determination. If myositis is suspected or diagnosed, gemfibrozil therapy should be withdrawn.

### Case report: lactic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis during telbivudine and tenofovir treatment for chronic hepatitis B [^117CKPKY]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In this case, the patient developed fatal syndrome LA and RM, after taking telbivudine and tenofovir as antiviral treatment. Without evidence of other causes like infection or trauma, telbivudine and tenofovir may be the cause of their complications.

Telbivudine is a potent nucleoside analogue for treatment of chronic hepatitis B, while it was often associated with muscle-related adverse events. During the large, multinational registration trials, telbivudine was reported a significantly higher side effect of grade 3 to 4 CPK elevations (defined as 7 times upper limit of normal) in two years compared to lamivudine. In the phase III GLOBE trial, despite 12.9% of patients on telbivudine developing severe elevation of serum CPK levels, clinical myopathy was reported only in two (0.3%) patients. Another study monitored CPK levels of 200 patients who were treated with telbivudine for chronic hepatitis B, the 3-year cumulative incidence of CPK elevations and myopathy was 84.3% and 5%, respectively. Male, younger age and HBeAg negativity were independent predictors of CPK elevations. CPK elevations usually occurred 21 months after starting treatment. However, no risk factors of myopathy were identified. As a result, although an elevated CPK may be an early indicator of muscle injury, this may be nonspecific and can often be elevated due to strenuous or prolonged exercise.

### Elevated liver enzymes indicating a diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy [^112HhkJg]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old man presented to an internal medicine clinic to establish primary care. His past medical history was significant for elevated liver transaminases found during laboratory monitoring while taking isotretinoin for acne. He had an extensive workup spanning 7 years including serial hepatic function panels after withholding isotretinoin, viral serologies, and two liver biopsies, which eventually led to a diagnosis of an idiopathic elevation in serum transaminases. During his present evaluation, he endorsed complaints of significant muscle soreness with strenuous activity despite conditioning. Creatine kinase was found to be elevated at 11,778 U/l. Nerve conduction studies and electromyogram indicated a myopathy. DNA sequencing confirmed a diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The aminotransferases are most notable for their association with liver pathology; however, they are also present in other tissues such as heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Muscle pathology, including the inherited muscular dystrophies, are often identified by elevations in creatine kinase, but can also be suggested by elevations of aminotransferases. This case illustrates that myopathies should be considered in patients with otherwise unexplained elevations in liver aminotransferases.

### Liver fibrosis during clinical ascertainment of glycogen storage disease type III: a need for improved and systematic monitoring [^114LakRX]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

In glycogen storage disease type III (GSD III), liver aminotransferases tend to normalize with age giving an impression that hepatic manifestations improve with age. However, despite dietary treatment, long-term liver complications emerge. We present a GSD III liver natural history study in children to better understand changes in hepatic parameters with age.

Methods

We reviewed clinical, biochemical, histological, and radiological data in pediatric patients with GSD III, and performed a literature review of GSD III hepatic findings.

Results

Twenty-six patients (median age 12.5 years, range 2–22) with GSD IIIa (n = 23) and IIIb (n = 3) were enrolled in the study. Six of seven pediatric patients showed severe fibrosis on liver biopsy (median [range] age: 1.25 [0.75–7] years). Markers of liver injury (aminotransferases), dysfunction (cholesterol, triglycerides), and glycogen storage (glucose tetrasaccharide, Glc 4) were elevated at an early age, and decreased significantly thereafter (p < 0.001). Creatine phosphokinase was also elevated with no significant correlation with age (p = 0.4).

Conclusion

Liver fibrosis can occur at an early age, and may explain the decrease in aminotransferases and Glc 4 with age. Our data outlines the need for systematic follow-up and specific biochemical and radiological tools to monitor the silent course of the liver disease process.

### Serum creatine kinase levels and renal function measures in exertional muscle damage [^112ziF71]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are commonly used to judge the severity of muscle damage and to determine when to hospitalize patients who present with symptoms of exertional rhabdomyolysis in order to prevent renal failure. However, no CK standard exists because of the limited information available regarding exercise-induced CK elevation and renal function. This study determined the magnitude of CK elevation and the effect on renal function produced by exercise in a large subject group.

Methods

Blood samples were obtained from 203 volunteers who performed 50 maximal eccentric contractions of the elbow flexor muscles. The samples, taken before and 4, 7, and 10 d after exercise, were analyzed for markers of muscle damage (CK, myoglobin (Mb), lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase and for measures of renal function (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, osmolality, and uric acid).

Results

All indicators of muscle damage increased significantly after exercise (P < 0.01). CK levels were 6420, 2100, and 311% above baseline on days 4, 7, and 10 after the exercise, respectively (P < 0.01), and Mb was 1137, 170, and 28% above baseline on days 4, 7, and 10 after exercise, respectively (P < 0.01). Of the 203 participants, 111 had CK values at 4 d postexercise > 2,000 U x L(-1) and 51 had values > 10,000 U x L(-1), levels used to diagnose myopathy (e.g., statin myositis) and rhabdomyolysis, respectively. There were no significant increases in any measure of renal function. Despite marked CK and Mb elevations in some subjects, none experienced visible myoglobinuria or required treatment for impaired renal function.

Conclusions

Exertional muscle damage produced by eccentric exercise in healthy individuals can cause profound CK and Mb elevations without renal impairment.

### Statin use in patients with non-HMGCR idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: a retrospective study [^114snqph]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3 disease assessments

Baseline disease characteristics were assessed including IIM type, myositis specific antibodies, and disease duration. Disease activity was assessed using physician global myositis disease activity by 100 mm VAS and 5 point Likert scales. 19 Laboratory measures included creatine phosphokinase (CPK), aldolase, estimated sedimentation rate (ESR), and C‐reactive protein (CRP).

Disease activity was assessed at multiple time points. For patients that were already on a statin at time of cohort enrollment, disease activity was assessed at the baseline visit and the consecutive follow‐up visit. For patients that were started on a statin during the cohort follow‐up period, disease activity measures were collected at the visit before statin initiation and the first visit after statin initiation. Data from the most recent clinic visit was also reviewed to assess long term follow up. Clinically quiescent myositis was determined as no evidence of muscular or extra‐muscular myositis disease activity by subjective report, on physical exam and muscle enzymes.

2.4 Safety assessments

Patients in the cohort were followed every 2 to 3 months in clinic. Data from all visits were reviewed for the following prespecified muscular and nonmuscular AEs: (a) myalgias, (b) CPK elevations (> 25% increase compared to prior visit, for two consecutive visits), (c) rhabdomyolysis (new CPK elevation of > 10X ULN), (d) elevated liver enzymes (elevation in gamma‐glutamyl transferase and transaminases above ULN in the setting of normal CPK, for two consecutive visits), (e) GI intolerance (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps), (f) worsening renal function (increased creatinine > 50% from baseline), and (g) discontinuation of statin. AEs were determined as statin‐related if (a) there was a temporal relation with statin initiation, dose escalation, or change in statin agent in the absence of other clinical causes or (b) the event lead to statin discontinuation with subsequent improvement in signs/symptoms.

### Elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase in patients with pectus excavatum [^113fUgQW]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pectus excavatum is the most common congenital chest wall deformity and the depression of the anterior chest wall, which compresses the lung and heart. Until now, nearly all previous studies have been performed to investigate its etiology, cardiopulmonary compromise, morphology and surgical techniques. However, because most patients with pectus excavatum are so asymptomatic and otherwise healthy that no specific laboratory study is considered to be necessary, there are few studies on the blood laboratory findings of patients with pectus excavatum. We assumed that the etiologies of pectus excavatum or the compression of internal organs including the heart and the lung could affect the blood laboratory findings. To find out the effects of pectus excavatum on laboratory findings, we analyzed the routine laboratory tests, which were performed routinely before surgery (Nuss procedure and pectus bar removal). These routine laboratory tests were composed of 26 separate tests, including complete blood count and blood chemistry tests. Only lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), one of the 26 separate routine laboratory tests, had statistically abnormal value and the other 25 separate laboratory tests were statistically within normal range.

LDH is a cytoplasmic enzyme found in the cells of all major organs, including the heart, the liver, the kidneys, the skeletal muscle, the brain, red blood cells, and the lung. It is responsible for converting lactic acid into pyruvic acid, an essential step in producing cellular energy. Because LDH is present in almost all body tissues, LDH test is usually used to detect tissue damage or inflammation. LDH level can be elevated when various conditions, for example, hemolysis, drug, infection, renal and liver disease, muscular dystrophy, various cancers or tumorous condition and inflammation. Because the total serum LDH is a highly sensitive but nonspecific test, the isoenzyme of LDH test is used to localize the specific site of organs. Also, determining LDH level combined with the results of other clinically important enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase) provides more accurate decisions. However, because the preoperative routine laboratory test did not include the LDH isoenzyme tests, the isoenzyme patterns in patients with pectus excavatum could not be analyzed. Also the present study showed there were no abnormal findings in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase.

### Serum creatine phosphokinase in leptospirosis… [^113A2BoP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Serum creatine phosphokinase and serum glutamic oxaloacetic and pyruvic transaminase levels were determined in 61 patients with leptospirosis and 16 with viral hepatitis during the acute phase of illness. The CPK value was elevated in 29 leptospirosis patients and normal in all 16 hepatitis patients. Conversely, mean SGOT and SGPT levels were lower in leptospirosis patients. The CPK determination is a simple test that may provide diagnostic information in a jaundiced patient, particularly when characteristic manifestations of leptospirosis are absent. The pattern of greatly elevated CPK levels with only modest elevations in transaminase values in an acutely jaundiced patient should strongly suggest a diagnosis of leptospirosis.

### FDA warns of serious liver injury risk with hepatitis C treatments… [^1121Coyd]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Our review of adverse events reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database and to the manufacturer of these medicines, AbbVie, identified cases of hepatic decompensation and liver failure in patients with underlying liver cirrhosis who were taking these medicines. Some of these events resulted in liver transplantation or death. These serious outcomes were reported mostly in patients taking Viekira Pak who had evidence of advanced cirrhosis even before starting treatment with it.
- Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including liver transplantation or death, in patients with cirrhosis have been associated with the use of Viekira Pak and Technivie.
- Viekira Pak is contraindicated in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.
- Discontinue Viekira Pak or Technivie if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation or increasing conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or international normalized ration.
- Health care professionals who have initiated treatment with Viekira Pak or Technivie in patients with cirrhosis should discuss with the patients the risks of hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure and should closely monitor them. FDA evaluated worldwide postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database, and submitted by the manufacturer AbbVie, since approval of Viekira Pak in December 2014 and of Technivie in July 2015.

Of the 26 assessable cases in which causality to components of Viekira Pak or Technivie was attributed to be possible or probable, 10 patients experienced hepatic failure resulting in transplantation or death, and 16 patients experienced various degrees of liver dysfunction. The postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation and liver failure are difficult to interpret because they occurred mostly in patients with underlying advanced chronic liver disease. However, temporal association from starting Viekira Pak or Technivie and resolution of symptoms in some patients after the medicine was stopped suggest a potential causal association. FDA emphasizes that Viekira Pak and Technivie are contraindicated in moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Technivie is not indicated for use in patients with cirrhosis. Some of the postmarketing cases of hepatic failure occurred in patients for whom Viekira Pak and Technivie are contraindicated or not recommended.

Some cases provided insufficient data to definitively assess baseline liver status.

### Creatine phosphokinase in long-term dialysis patients… [^1162DXLd]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Of 90 patients undergoing regular dialysis, 42% had elevated levels of creatine phosphokinase. The BB isoenzyme was not detected, and only one patient had CPK MB. The elevation of CPK MM level did not correlate with values for calcium, phosphorus, calcium times phosphorus product, dry weight, or parathyroid hormone. Elevated levels of the enzyme correlated directly with muscle weakness in male patients and with hypothyroidism and inversely with treatment with vitamin D3 supplements. We conclude that high CPK levels in uremia are secondary to skeletal muscle abnormalities and that hypothyroidism and vitamin D3 deficiency may contribute to so-called uremic myopathy.

### Serum transaminase levels in boys with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy… [^116gn6VD]. publications.aap.org (2011). Low credibility.

Serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are commonly used as biochemical indicators of hepatocellular injury but can also detect occult muscle disease. High concomitant serum creatine phosphokinase levels can point to muscle as the source of high transaminase levels. Nevertheless, clinicians may be reluctant to attribute high transaminase levels to muscle. Study patients were boys with a genetic or biopsy-confirmed dystrophinopathy whose concomitant serum CPK, ALT, and AST levels were measured. We report 82 enzyme data sets from 46 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and 9 with Becker muscular dystrophy. Our results show a linear relationship between serum CPK and serum ALT and AST and a logarithmic relationship between serum enzyme levels and age for boys with DMD. We developed a mathematical model to predict serum ALT and AST levels when the serum CPK level and age are known.

For 6 boys, initial failure to consider muscle as a cause of high transaminase levels led to delay of diagnosis and extensive testing for hepatic dysfunction. A second group of 4 boys with known DMD were investigated for liver disease after high transaminase levels were detected. Serum transaminase levels were highest in ambulant boys with DMD, whose levels reached 1220 U/L and 801 U/L. By recognizing muscle as a potential source of serum transaminase levels, clinicians can avoid unnecessary and invasive procedures, expedite clinical diagnosis, and avoid unnecessary cessation of concomitant drug therapy.
